I've just finished rereading: it remains my favourite Charles Dickens novel. \`A Tale of Two Cities' was initially published in weekly instalments over 31 weeks in 1859: it is historical fiction, encompassing the period from 1775 to 1792.The novel is divided into three separate sections (books) dealing with different events in the lives of Dr Alexandre Manette, his daughter Lucie, French emigrant Charles Darnay and his family, as well as a number of other people and events in France and England. I believe that the novel will be easier to follow for a reader broadly familiar with the history leading to and consequences of the French Revolution in 1789.On my first read, I was most interested in the French aspects of the novel: the images of Madame Defarge knitting, and Vengeance, together with the guillotine, have remained in my mind. This time, I was more focussed on identifying some of the themes that run through the novel. Those themes are resurrection, relationships, retribution and redemption.The sufferings of Dr Manette, and later of Charles Darnay; the relationships between Dr Manette, Lucie, Mr Lorry, and others; the role of the DeFarges, and Vengeance, in both sustaining relationships and seeking retribution; and the redemption of Sydney Carton: combine in a way which illustrates much of what can be good and bad about humanity.\`Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,' observed the Marquis, \`will keep the dogs obedient to the whip as long as this roof,' looking up to it, \`shuts out the sky'.To write more about the story may spoil its impact for those yet to read it. It is both a fine example of English literature and an interesting work of historical fiction. This is a novel where both the journey and the destination matter.\`It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Everyone knows the opening line of this novel: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\\" but have you ever stopped to think about what it actually means? Putting a context on famous lines of literature is (for me at least) one of the best parts about reading classic novels, something that everyone should attempt to do at some stage during their lifetimes. \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" definitely falls into that category, as it contains some of Dickens's best and most complex work. The title stems from the fact that it is London and Paris - rather than any individual character - which make up the central character of the novel, and the way in which these two cities guide the fates of their inhabitants.This is certainly one of Charles Dickens's more unique novels, being one of only two of his works (the other beingBarnaby Rudge (Penguin Classics)) that is best described as historical fiction. Incorporating events of the French Revolution such as the storming of the Bastille, the September massacres and the infamous Revolutionary tribunals that sent thousands to their deaths at the gulliotine, the novel is set against a wide sweep of history that provides the context for the intrigues of his characters. As Dickens himself articulated, characters are not as developed as they are in his other works, and are revealed through action rather than dialogue or exposition. Thus, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is far from a character study, though Dickens provides several vivid scenes that give us insight into the players, whether it be the monotonous shoe-making of Doctor Manette, the lethargic leaning of Sydney Carton or the frantic knitting of Madame Defarge.Pulling together a complex story of betrayal, intrigue, danger, hidden identities and past secrets, Dickens weaves his three protagonists (insofar as you could say this novel *has* protagonists) into a complicated tale set against the dangers of the French Revolution: Doctor Manette, a freed prisoner of the old aristocratic regime, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat who has denounced his heritage, and Sydney Carton, a brilliant English lawyer with a wastrel lifestyle (who is also the most vivid character in the novel). Each man becomes swept up in the events of the Revolution, each facing their inner demons and the secrets of the past that rise up to threaten their lives and the lives of their loved ones.As is to be expected, at the centre of this maelstrom is a young woman, with whom all males are besotted. She is a typical Dickensian heroine: meek, virtuous, beautiful, tearful, and the object of everyone's dearest affections. As someone who has read several Dickens books, she is a somewhat frustrating character - is there really a difference between Lucie Manette and say, Rose ofOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)or Agnes ofDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)or Biddy ofGreat Expectations (Penguin Classics)? Lucie is the paragon of Victorian expectations in a woman, the domestic goddess, the angel of the house, the damsel in distress (in fact, the most memorable aspect to her character is Dickens's mention of her talent at arranging furniture. I'm not kidding). Yes, she is a product of the time, and no doubt a reflection of Dickens's own longings (considering his own domestic lifestyle was far from ideal), but you can't help but wish that Dickens had taken the time to explain why Lucie had such an extraordinary effect on the men around her, rather than just tell us that such a thing was so.Despite this, Dickens has a tightly plotted novel, which gradually reveals the intricate connections between each character as the story progresses. By any other author, these connections would seem melodramatic or too coincidental, in Dickens's hands, they take on the sense of an inevitable pattern taking shape, almost a fateful air. Juggling the intimate details of the inner turmoil relationships of the characters with the grander scale of the political upheaval, Dickens strikes the perfect balance between the two, personified in the cities themselves. London becomes the place of peace and security, but also dignified secrecy and disclosure (as Dickens famously ponders in the opening chapters, pointing out that we - as human beings - are all mysteries to each other), whereas Paris is swept up in violence, blood-lust and a witch hunt for enemies of the new order. Yet as Richard Maxwell points out in his enlightening introduction to this edition, the two cities exist together in the course of the novel - without Paris, Carton's melancholic and wasteful life was in vain; without London, there is no safe haven for the Darnay family to flee to.Dickens also has room for his own commentary on the Revolution, and is careful in his portrayal of those involved, making none of them totally evil, nor completely virtueous. Everyone involved is painted in shades of grey, making the Revolution itself a complicated process of upheaval, cruelty, justice, madness, victory and tragedy. Just as the revolt of the people is perceived as justified against the tyranny of the aristocracy that abuses their position so appallingly, the madness that follows becomes just as horrifying as the rule of that which preceded it. As it stands, Dickens ends the novel by alluding to the execution of Madame Roland, who was said to have cried out just before her death: \\"O Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name!\\" This is one of my favourite Dickens's novels, and leaves you with plenty to mull over long after you've finished reading."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"According to historical sources, Dickens was paid by the word for his books. Thus, I infer that the long, winded and boring passages Dickens exhibits in A Tale of Two Cities must indicate his greediness. Though I'm only 16, I can still identify well written books. If one is seeking a great novel, I suggest 1984 by George Orwell."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book for school, and although I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, I found the tidbits of plot hard to pick out from the filler material.

I will, however, say that I found the ending incredibly poetic and poignant.

It is a historical novel, set during the bloody period of the French Revolution. The ageing Doctor Manette is released from the Bastille after eighteen years and reunited with his daughter Lucie in England. Two very different men, Charles Darnay, a French aristocrat in exile and Sydney Carton a disreputable but brilliant lawyer, fall in love with Lucie. \\"From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.\\"Dickens really portrays the madness and uncertainty of the period well. The French people were (understandably) angry at the nobility and went wild with chopping off everyone's head. A Tale of Two Cities both illustrates the period, and also tells a personal tale of Lucie Manette, Charles Darnay, and Sydney Carrton. I really enjoyed A Tale of Two Cities; it was probably my favorite Dickens novel so far, even more than Great Expectations. The writing wasn't too overwritten for Dickens, and it was about the French Revolution, a period I'm interested in. I really cared about the characters, even though I knew the ultimate ending already (I had seen part of the film.) I'm planning to see the whole film with Ronald Colman soon. If you're a fan of Charles Dickens and haven't read this one yet, it's a must-read.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, [...]"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book years ago and loved it. I still love it. Charles Dickens' writing still holds up after all these years. The story he tells in A Tale of Two Cities is a great history lesson and show that the past is still sometimes the future."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I studied this book in great detail while preparing for my GCE exams many years ago. However, re-reading it was quite a different experience, an eye opener for the mature reader. Now I am able to appreciate Dickens' writing far more and I shall certainly re-read more of his books. The details of the French Revolution were very educational and scarey in the sense that the atmosphere of fear and suspicion in France at the time of the Revolution still exist in many parts of the world today. It is a story of courage in the midst of chaos and distrust. It is also interwoven with love between father and daughter, husband and wife and, unforgettably, Sidney Carton's for the heroine.A Tale of Two Cities is a book than can be read several times and still give renewed pleasure."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"Recalled to life,\\" is the strange message that Mr. Jerry Lorry of Tellson's Bank gives to the messenger on horseback waiting in the dark. \\"Recalled to life\\" is the running theme of the book, that each of its characters encounter. Originally, the message was stated for the case of Dr. Manette, a man hidden in the deep folds of the Bastille for 18 long years---his relatives never cognizant of his imprisonment, and thus presumed him dead many years ago. When Lucie, his daughter & only living shred of a family, discovers that he is alive at an innkeeper's lodgings in Paris, she immediately attempts to rescue him from his current horrible state she then finds him in.Fast forward a little bit through the story, and the phrase \\"Recalled to life\\" fits yet again into a young man's life, a friend of the Manette's, whose name is Charles Darnay and has to endure his own hardship. The phrase is not applied to his situation, but works just the same. His fate includes being sent to the Guillotine, the main execution process used during the French Revolution. As trial after trial unfurls, what will be left of these men when it is all said and done?This story begins in \\"the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five\\"--a few years prior to the beginning of the French Revolution. As the story progresses, the precautions and conflicts of the French citizens lead up to the full revolution, including the final storming of the Bastille and afterwards.My personal thoughts:I'd been wanting to read \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" for a while, and I'm so glad that I did. The story had its peaks, which interested me greatly as I read each chapter. In reading this book, I realized what a sense of humor Charles Dickens truly has, as illustrated in a few favorite passages I immensely enjoyed. Occasionally, slow-going parts of the story paused my reading for a little while, but I pushed through, and in the end, it was truly worth it. A character worth mentioning is Sydney Carton--although his original position in the story had him as a rather minor person, it was only in the final chapters that he made his path clear. I didn't notice him much through the course of the story, but after reading the ending, he now ranks as my very favorite of the book. It was his actions, as selfless or as selfish as they were, in those last 4 chapters, which made the entire book a worthwhile task now satisfactorily accomplished.My recommendation:When the entire book has been finished, it is great, but to get there, it includes very hard reading. Everyone could enjoy it... but no matter what age, you'll probably want to grab a dictionary while you're at it.\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\\" -----The very first sentence of the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The only Dickens story I have ever read was A Christmas Carol. That being short, I was unsure of what to expect from a full length book. After finishing the book, I can see why people have such high regard for Dickens. The story is broken up into 3 \\"books\\". The first book was short and kept my interest. The second (and longest) book started to get tedious, but then it began to pick up in the 2nd half of that book. The final book was fantastic.What I liked most about the way Dickens wrote this story (and hopefully others as I will begin reading them) is that he seems to treat the reader like they are intelligent people who can understand how characters should react and how they would approach their emotions. He does not spoon-feed every part of the book. He gives you the information you need (with beautiful prose) to allow the reader to determine themselves what happened \\"off-screen\\".As an example, how the Manettes react when they see the final person in the carriage is never discussed. It doesn't have to be. Anyone with any emotion or experience with life would know exactly how they react, why write it. Dickens leads you to the conclusion and allows you to determine in your own way what happened. Do we need to have the author discuss every meeting Dr Manette has with the leaders of the Revolution or can we can guess the outcome and Dickens just tells us the final result.And the ending, do we need to know if what Sydney Carton saw was real or his imagination? No. We as the readers know. Dickens does not need to hit us over the head with it.I will be reading other stories by Dickens, but I'm glad I started with this one.I read the Kindle version. I saw no issues with the book. There were one or two words not available in the Kindloe dictionary. I'm not sure if they were misspelled or words Dickens used that maybe are in the UK English and not the US English. I never bothered to research and it only occurred two or three times. There is an active table of contents and it also has page numbers. I can't think of what a paid version of the book would offer over this free version."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"One of the hardest books to get into that I have ever read, but the ending gave me chills and I couldn't stop thinking about if for days. If you are stuck at the beginning and wondering if it will be worth it, I promise it is."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have to agree with Charles Dickens. I do not wish to ruin this story (and this would be quite the book to summarize), so I will not reveal much of its plot. I will merely say that it is set in both England and France during the time just before and then the beginning of the French Revolution. The political details are quite accurate, the characters (even secondary ones) are well developed, the narrative is amazing (uplifting, depressing, humorous, terrifying, and poetic), and the love story is pure and beautiful (i.e. marriage), not something obscene and disgusting.'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...'Those immortal words describe this book.You will (probably) enjoy the best of times while reading this book.You will miss out on one of the best of times, and thus almost suffer the worst of times, if you pass on this story.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Was Charles Dickens a poet? Conversely, perhaps his structure and style are no longer suited to today's rushed lifestyle, as some reviewers lament. I believe Dickens is one of the most magnificent story tellers ever to put pen to paper, portraying vivid landscapes that are often as vital as his characters in affecting events. Dickens, like Shakespeare, could never be told in TV length segments, or using today's best seller pablum.'A Tale of Two Cities' is one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors. The prose is lyrical, the story telling awe inspiring, the tale simply unforgettable. It left a mark on my soul.I remember my first reading of Shakespeare, and stumbling hopelessly through the pentameter and 'backward' structure. Thankfully a wonderful metamorphosis occurred and somewhere along the way I realized my mind had assimilated both meter and verse, and my unconscious brain was giddy with the beauty of it. I experience Dickens the same way. His unfamiliar style blends into the rich tapestry of his work, adding a depth and clarity that is difficult to imagine without it. And like Shakespeare, we are most assuredly on a journey of wondrous descriptive and emotional insight.'A Tale of Two Cities' is a definitive description of the French Revolution, although it is a work of fiction. Dickens intricately weaves these momentous, earth shattering events through the lives of a small chorus of individuals, all hoping to cope with a world threatening to devour them at any moment. His strength in describing how each acts within such tumultuous times creates a fantastic story all its own. But Dickens is only getting started. In his own ingeniously inevitable style, he compels events and characters together in a climax of towering suspense. With a courageous act of human spirit our true hero takes center stage as he equals the desperate call that only rebellion and war can advance.Through it all, Dickens remains himself; constructing beautifully intricate foundations, dropping seemingly innocuous small details in the midst of sub chapters which at the time are much more important, slowly composing the story with the sense of a trickle of a stream leading to the river and the rapids and the waterfall, gaining an urgency and crescendo until the sound and the fury of the story becomes a palpable beating in one's chest. Is the book a love story? Is it historical fiction? Is it the tale of rabid crowds taking over noble causes? Is it man vs. nature, or a story of a man who rises to his destiny? Yes, it is.\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\\"With arguably the most famous first sentence of a book in all of literature, I shall leave you with one more thought if you are not sure if you like Dickens. Or perhaps you already tried to read him and felt unconnected; but perhaps you were too young then, or too busy, or distracted. And perhaps you're ready now, to leave everything behind, to curl up in a chair, preferably with a warm fire and a glass of wine, and rediscover him. Read \`A Tale of Two Cities' when you are ready, with an open heart. Dickens will inspire you to song and tears. For I assure you, that somewhere along the way, you will make a start, or you will stand up and stretch, and you will realize that he has somehow profoundly altered your view, and that you will never really be quite the same again. And you will cherish him, as I do, and the beauty with which he writes, and his faith, win or lose, of the human spirit to endure all else."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"is really a wonderful book, and I enjoyed it immensely.

Not only does this book have a wonderful, colored illustration of a certain character (readers who have read this book know who), the cover and pages are thick and durable, not to mention acid-free (many publishers like Penguins do not use acid-free paper). Also, the binding is thick and very sturdy, and the font is of a comfortable size, unlike the mass-paperback editions.

I am still blown away at how stupid I was to not recognize how good Dickens is."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Set in the period between 1775 and 1793, A Tale of Two Cities traces from the prelude of the French Revolution to the beginning of the Reign of Terror in France in close details. The story mainly deals with the plotting and undertaking of the French Revolution and several innocent characters' involvement in it. Charles Dickens provides a fairly balanced and reasonable image of the opposing forces of the French Revolution - the French aristocrats and the peasants - through the characterization of few characters in the novel. Reading this novel will truly be an unforgettable experience, as if all the events that took place from 1775 to 1793 are replayed through Dickens' masterful uses of plot and imagery.The central idea that Dickens introduces in the novel is the dominance of the aristocracy over the dirt-poor peasants in France. It is also the driving force and the central conflict of the novel, for this is the very reason that caused the eruption of the French Revolution. The local aristocrat in France basically has complete power over the lands he owns (of course, including the people) and he can do anything at his own territories, such as demanding his servants' wives: \\"...that man's brother [the aristocrat] saw her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him - for what are husbands among us!\\" (348). The growing hatred among the peasants for the aristocrats slowly builds up and finally erupted in 1789 with the storming of the Bastille.According to some reviewers, the characters in the novel are underdeveloped and the chapters seem quite verbose. Nevertheless, Dickens verbose style creates a very descriptive picture of everything he intends to relate, which immerses the readers in the atmosphere he creates. The characters in the novel may seem to be underdeveloped, but Dickens uses these ideal characters to contrast the cruel reality of the French Revolution, as it was introduced in the first sentence of the first chapter, \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\"(1). These ideal characters also serve to support one of Dickens' major themes in the novel - there will be hope even in the worst situations. One of such characters is Sydney Carton, who saves Darnay from execution with his own life. Other people argue that Dickens did not provide a just and balanced portrayal of the classes in France because the French revolutionaries are mainly represented by Madame Defarge and other extremists. However, Dickens did present the population of na?ve peasants in France and suggest the cruelty and irrationality of the revolutionaries through the unreasonable death of the little seamstress.The nobles of the novel, the Monsigneur the Marquis and his brother represent the inhumane aristocrats. On the other hand, Dickens portrays the protagonist, Charles Darnay, as an aristocrat who sympathizes the suffering peasants in France in order to balance the portrayal of aristocrats at this time period. Unlike the Marquis who lives on the expense of his peasants, Darnay shows a great degree of sympathy towards the miserable peasants, \\"...seeking to execute the last look of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress...\\" (130). Consequently, Darnay declares that instead of living off from the unfortunate peasants, he \\"must do, to live, what other...countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day - work.\\" (131).The peasants of the French Revolution in the novel are portrayed fairly as well. There are these pitiless and bitter revolutionaries represented by Madame Defarge and the Vengeance; there are also those innocent and ignorant peasants represented by the little seamstress. Although the little seamstress had done nothing wrong, the mob still beheaded her in the name of the Republic. She clearly states the irrationality of the revolutionaries before she is executed, \\" \`I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I am not willing to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be...'\\" (381). The novel presents a crucial theme through the little seamstress's death: justice is not always present and many may be sacrificed for others' advantages. In this case, the theme is effectively expressed through many innocent lives that are sacrificed for the Republic. Madame Defarge sufficiently backs up this theme by exercising her power among the revolutionaries to execute her personal wills - to take revenge on Darnay and his family. By this point in time, the Reign of Terror had begun.I highly recommend A Tale of Two Cities, a passport to a beautiful story and the life during the French Revolution. Moreover, the novel has the most beautiful ending I've ever seen. Read it to find out! Moreover, the book is very affordable - only $7.00! It is suitable for high school students and adults. Since the novel is filled with a number of vocabulary and literary devices, it will be helpful for students to prepare for the SAT critical reading section. You will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a story of 18th and 19th century France and England which depicts of the struggles that took place against the lower class citizens and the nobility of France. In the novel, Charles Dickens describes these issues of his time using a handful of characters along with underlying themes and motifs that explain what he is trying to portray. The different ways that Dickens displays these themes, characters, and motives are clever and makes A Tale of Two Cities a wonderful book to read.The best thing about the book to me is the way that Dickens has an underlying meaning in mostly everything he writes. There's a slightly hidden message in his writing that allows the reader to see his point-of view of things. \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity...\\" (Dickens 1). This quote was the first paragraph of the novel. I think this was an excellent quote to begin the novel with. The first chapter of the first book is called \\"The Period\\" in which Dickens describes this time in 1775. In this chapter he compares France and England noting that both countries were going through a time of social unrest. France was spending all of its money, its people were being mistreated by religious leaders, and the guillotine was introduced, while in England, violent robberies were taking place, and amongst the crimes was harsh capital punishment. These comparisons of the two countries show the brilliant way in which Dickens uses duality as one of the themes in the novel. Although France and England are two different countries, and seem like opposites, they are actually alike. However, Dickens used opposites in his opening paragraph to describe the countries, a way in which he sets up his characters. For instance, Darnay and Carton were shown as opposites. Dickens uses foreshadowing by stating the resemblance of the two near the beginning of the novel. Carton, a drunk who felt his life was worthless is the complete opposite of Darnay, a man of honor who lives his life more on virtues than his \\"family title\\". Despite these differences, both were truly in love with Lucy. Their resemblances to one another and their love for Lucie tie both characters together.I also like the way Dickens criticizes the situations of his time in his writing. Dickens humorously describes the mistreatment of the peasants by the aristocracy very well in the novel. Dickens uses the wine-spill outside of the wine shop as a symbol of the hunger and the desperateness of the peasants. He symbolizes the entire aristocracy in just one person. The Marquis was a heartless man who ran over a young boy, and as compensation, through a coin to the father of the boy. Dickens uses the Marquis to describe the wealth of the aristocracy and their cruelness toward the peasants. \\"...his morning chocolate could not so much get into the throat of Monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook\\" (Dickens 108). This depiction of Monseigneur shows the selfishness of the entire aristocracy in which the French Revolution set out to change.Not only do I like how the political issues are represented in the novel, I like how Dickens places the political issues into literary works. A motif of the novel that I thought was good, is the secretive nature of human kind. Darnay and Jerry Cruncher both had secrets. Darnay's secret was his last name which would show his identity as nobility. Jerry Cruncher had a job of which he was known as a \\"Resurrection Man\\" in which he digs up dead bodies to sell to scientist for extra money. This motif also deals with the inner thoughts of man, which holds a person's intentions, which cannot be seen on the outside. Such cases of this are Carton and Madame Defarge. At the beginning of the novel, Madame Defarge is seen as a quiet lady who innocently knits. However, She actually knits a hit list of the Revolutionaries that she is planning to kill. Madame Defarge is also a symbol of vengeance toward the aristocracy. This vengeance is a deep feeling for Madame Defarge who even seeks it on indirect associates of the revolutionaries, i.e. Darnay, Lucy, and little Lucy, who have done nothing to her. Carton's secretive nature reflects from his love of Lucy. He secretly plans to die for Darnay in order to show his love for her. At first, the novel displays him as a worthless, lazy, good for nothing, drunk. The book describes his life as meaningless, but in the end, Carton proved to be the hero of the whole novel. \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done, it is a far, far better rest that I go to that I have ever known\\" (Dickens 404). This quote ends the novel, and is my favorite quote in the book. Carton speaks this quote right before he goes to the guillotine. The character of Carton symbolizes revolution. It symbolizes the revolution for Carton, for Lucy and Darnay, and for the French Revolution. Carton has a change in himself. He becomes confident, and his life now has meaning. Lucie and Darnay can now continue to live their life happily ever after with their children. Right before he dies, Carton looks upon the future and what will happen after he dies in which he sees peace, and a change for those who were once mistreated. I think that Dickens could not have chosen a better way of ending the novel. He uses the character, Carton, to show a way in which he felt would resolve the situation taking place in France. He embodies Carton as a Christ-like figure, who through his sacrifice, could save someone else. Not only did he save the life of Darnay, but his own, once worthless life, had new meaning."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this edition with a student I am tutoring. The introduction by Gillen D'arcy Wood is well written and helpful. The footnotes and endnotes provide just the right amount of information and background to the story. This is a superb student edition of a classic tale."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two cities in the beginning is kind of boring, but as you read more it gets pretty good. Dickens does go into a lot of detail, but then again, so did a lot of authors of his time. Dickens probably went into a lot of detail because he would get paid by the word. The book is great, there are many coincidences as there are in every book Dicken has written. Everything ties in at the end. It's definitly a book I would recommend. you just have to remember to be patient. When I first heard about A Tale of Two Cities, i heard it has one of the best endings ever written, so i was eager to get to the end quickly, and i have to say, it is one of the best endings ever written. I'm in High School and we had to read it over the summer, and i know so many people that just gave up reading the first chapter because it was boring, trust me if only they would have read to about the 3rd chapter they would have changed their minds."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dicken's lengthy account of the French Revolution remains an historical pillar, perhaps literary as well? Regretfully, I never read this in school, nor had the opportunity to dissect and analyse its elements. The Tale of Two Cities ridicules France's distaste for nobility and aristocracy with humour while revealing the gruesome bloodshed that tortured liberty and civil rights. Dicken' s Tale of Two Cities exhibits some of the time honored cross channel nuances that continue to sustain this curious English-French relationship today. This wonderful story is a must read for any English speaking student of French Language and History."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a classic, if not a bit archaic tale of the French Revolution and those trapped in the figurative and literal fires of the cruelty of the primal human nature that came with it. It is how the very same people once burned and blistered, both as individuals and masses, fueled their own fire and ironically became no different than their own oppressors. A story with very strong ideals and themes, A Tale of Two Cities is undeniably powerful if it is fully digested into the psyche. However, therein lays the only possible problem with this tale.The translation of great ideas and well thought out themes that evoke emotion and thought from Dickens' mind to the pages seems to be lacking in accuracy. It is often simply too difficult to understand what relevancy what it is Dickens is talking about page to page. Endless lines of pointless, tedious dialogue and seemingly inane sub plots make it difficult to embody the full ideas of what it was Dickens was trying to confer. Looking at it from a reader's point of view it is not a superb piece of literature because it does not read well. A book such as this however is not prescribed by a teacher for easy reading. It is because of the golden stuff on the inside that makes this book valuable, because it contains a trace of almost every possible theme of human nature from sacrifice to insanity to class discrimination. \\"I know, Dr Manette, that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. (122).\\" The theme of love, however, is perhaps tied with the chaos of human nature as most prominent, and, without doubt, Dickens excels in his vivid descriptions of both, equally portrayed with physical and dramatic detail.One of the most meaningful parts of the book comes from one such description involving the striking scene of the Grindstone. \\"The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away. (251)\\" These words, as well as many other instances from the book have a great deal of a permanent feeling, a cold and creepy aura portrayed by Dickens demonstrating and contrasting the overwhelming cruelty with the intense yet fleeting loveliness of man.Overall, A Tale of Two Cities is a satisfying yet frustrating book. A difficult read, but it yields more in the meaning department to make up for its lack of flowing sentences. It's worth the read if only for the unique experience. 3/5."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two of Two Cities is a great story and was an instant classic. A very famous quote from this book is \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\" If you have read this book you should know this quote by heart.I really liked this book with all of the suspense and the heroics, but some parts were confusing. The beginning of the book starts off slow and somewhat confusing, but as I read on I caught on to the gist of the story and then couldn't put it down. Each chapter ending in a cliffhanger I found myself saying one more chapter after I finished each one.Charles Dickens was an ingenious author. He wrote many classics and knew how to make stories come together in a great way. He wrote A Tale of Two Cities after he wrote an unsuccessful book, but it just shows that he was persistent and kept going even when things weren't so great. He fought through all of that and wrote a great book and it became a classic.The vocabulary in this book was very complex and I had to look up many of the words in the dictionary, but it didn't get in the way. If I found a word that I didn't know I just looked it up, found out what it meant, and then kept reading. It really didn't get in the way, but it happened throughout the book.Overall, this was a very well written book. It had many positives to it and had only a couple negatives. The only problem I see with it is younger readers would have trouble comprehending what is going on throughout the book.

An enjoyable read but my favourite is still Great Expectations!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I waited until I was 39 years old to read this. Somehow I managed to escape it in high school and college. All I knew about it, really, was from an early 1980's episode of the sitcom \\"Diff'rent Strokes\\", where Arnold tries to wriggle out of reading the book (assigned by his English teacher who's played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar)... only to find out that he really enjoys it.Going in, armed only with what I knew from Arnold Jackson and from pop-culture at large (namely, the first and the last sentences)... it took me forever to actually enjoy the darned thing. The first chapter, which gets off to a great start with \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\\" continues on with a few hundred more similarly paradoxical sentences; this is pretty exhausting after a while, unless you're an English professor, which I am not. The next two chapters, unless you know in advance what's supposed to be happening, also make virtually no sense (a London banker is interrupted by a courier during a late-night journey by coach with an important message from Paris).The first two sections of the book (\\"Recalled to Life\\" and \\"The Golden Thread\\") are spread out over more than 20 years, and take their time in establishing the main characters and settings; they take place in equal measures in England and France. In retrospect, there are some nice bits of misdirection, mostly regarding the relationship between lawyers Stryver and Carton in London (if you had to guess, based on the early chapters, which one would wind up being the hero, you'd probably be wrong), and between the Defarges, unofficial heads of the Parisian revolutionary movement.Reading this book without the help of study aids, an English teacher, or even Wikipedia, I see now that I completely misunderstood two important plot points: who assassinated the Marquis St. Evremonde (a stand-in for the French aristocracy that would later be deposed in the Revolution), and why Dr. Manette (a former political prisoner turned reluctant hero of the revolutionaries, and father of the book's romantic female lead) has his second nervous breakdown in the middle of the book.The final section is, even for a book written as a serial that was published over 31 weeks, pretty much airtight and breathtaking. The scope of the book collapses into a brutal 15-month stretch in Paris, coinciding with the Reign of Terror. The characters' identities -- who's a hero, who's a villain, which characters are going to learn something and which ones do not -- are solidified, and there's real tension as to how our heroes are going to escape the Terror, if at all. This part of the book does rely on a lot of the standard Dickensian plot twists that we now identify as \\"soap opera\\" -- every character turns out to have a pre-existing relationship to every other character, either by blood or by long-ago coincidental encounter -- but it is exhilarating to watch everything fall into place. Even today, it's impossible to keep a dry eye during the final chapters.For younger and more secular readers, the religious symbolism towards the end may become heavy-handed, but even that is an important key to understanding why \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" was written, and how it would have been understood and appreciated by a mid-19th Century audience. It didn't bother Arnold in that episode of \\"Diff'rent Strokes\\", so it doesn't bother me now, either."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I enjoy these classics.

Dickens not only sets a great foundation for the novel but he also builds an illustrious story with great detail. His creativity explodes in this book.The book is set in the time before and during the French Revolution. It is about the experiences of two French families and how those experiences later collide with their future. Their experiences not only create a great fictional story but they also dipict the true horrors that occured in France at that time.Dickens makes the plot very interesting because he incorporates fiction and historical facts and events. For example in the storming of the Bastille scene, he brings to life an actual event and adds the fiction of what the peasants found in Dr. Manette's cell and the inside look on how they may have felt. Two other examples include the scenes where the revolutionaries kill the king and queen of France and the many times they use the guillotine. They demonstrate this mixture because they're true events yet, Dickens adds fictional characters and the feelings and emotions the people might have had.Another great touch that Dickens adds is all the detail. Although at times it is rather long it helps to make a clear picture in the mind of what is going on. One such example where he does this is when he describes fate and death. He makes two rather hard to picture objects visible in the mind as the Farmer and the Woodsman. Another example of his great use of detail is when he describes Mr. Lorry's trip down the Dover mail. His description gives the feeling of actually being there. These are just two but there are numerous of other examples.One more thing that made this novel fascinating was how Dickens reveals bits and pieces of the plot mixed together, but then ties every piece together at the end. For example he dipicts the Marquis' cruelness first and does not explain his involvement right away. However, by the end he turns out to be a key character. He also does that with the character of Dr. Manette. He introduces the character but leaves the suspense of that character's involvement until later. The suspense keeps the interest in the novel going. Dickens details, mixture of fact with fiction, and suspense makes the novel a extremely enjoyable book. After reading this book a clear understanding is achieved of why Charles Dickens is such a renowned author. A Tale of Two Cities is a unique and fascinating story which is why it is a must for anyone's bookself."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is the best plotted and most readable of Dickens' works. Broad in scope, the story spans main character Dr. Alexander Manette's lifetime and the English Channel. Dickens portrays London as the opulent center of the civilized world, and Paris, in the throes of the French Revolution, as a cesspool of tortured humanity. The complex tale of love, honor, and courage is woven over the backdrop of this politically charged and culturally polarized time in history.Interestingly, it has been alleged that this book, which is shorter and stylistically different than Dickens' other books, was not actually written by him. Dickens was a unique character in English literature, being perhaps the first writer to achieve wealth and fame during his lifetime. Some suggest that he either lent his good name to the manuscript of an unknown in a duplicitous scheme to boost sales, secretly sharing the proceeds, or that he flat out stole the story from one of the many hopeful writers who sent him manuscripts for comment. We'll probably never know the truth. But it doesn't matter who wrote it. That only adds to the mystique of a fantastic book. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, Author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"When I first started reading this book, I didn't think that I liked it very much.

Sydney Carton is now one of my favorite characters. My one complaint is that the author portrayed Lucie like she didn't have very much, &quot;girl power&quot; as it would be said these days.

Probably the fact that I better appreciated Dickens' style and the way he used symbolism. Everything from &quot;Charles Darnay&quot; (CD, &quot;C&quot;harles &quot;D&quot;ickens perhaps placing himself into the story!) to the Christological implications at the end of the story (&quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&quot;) It's so rich that perhaps you ought to utilize the Cliffs Notes to help you better understand the hidden meanings. To me, everything just came together in the end. Don't let what happened to me the first time occur to you!

It's a book that truly transports you to another time, one of history's most terrible and frightening, as well as one of its most idealistic and noble.

I am planning on buying it so I can read it again."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known -Sydney CartonThe passage above and the opening of the novel--It was the best of times, it was the worst of times--are among the most often quoted lines from any of Dickens' works, both because they are memorable and because somehow this is the one work of his that we all get assigned in school. I assume this one is chosen because, while it is still great, it is one of his shorter efforts.The story should be familiar, Dr. Alexander Manette is freed from his unjust imprisonment in the Bastille and is reunited with his long lost daughter, Lucie, in England. They are called as witnesses at the treason trial of Charles Darnay, a dashing young Frenchman. Darnay too is falsely accused, but he is saved, in part by his resemblance to a law clerk named Sydney Carton. Darnay and Lucie eventually marry, though not before the wastrel Carton declares his love for her and his unworthiness of her. He pledges that one day he will prove himself worthy by doing her a service. That opportunity comes when Darnay is condemned to death by a French tribunal and sentenced to the guillotine.This has been one of my favorite books since the 8th Grade. There is no more thrilling moment in literature then when Carton takes Darnay's place and bravely faces certain death. It is a moment of redemption that reminds us that great literature serves human purposes; we may never have such a moment in our own lives, but the example instructs us in how we should face such a situation if the time comes. We can ask no more of ourselves than the courage and sense of honor to do that &quot;far, far better thing.&quot;GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This edition simply did not display properly on my Kindle 2. Long lines alternating with short lines (frequently only one word) made this edition just unreadable for me.A Tale of Two Cities (Penny Books)comes out just fine. Perhaps the lesson learned for me is to download a sample first, but the failed formatting of this edition was an unpleasant surprise."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It's slow going at first, but once the French Revolution kicks in, the reader finds himself right up to the nostrils in severed heads.In my relatively uneducated opinion, the book has some annoying characteristics: the sentimentalism, the wordy style, the sentimentalism, the melodrama, and the really cloying sentimentality. But the strengths exceed the flaws. The story itself, once you get past the first 20% or so, is darn clever. And all of the characters are memorable, particularly Jerry Cruncher (who's certain his wife is prayin' agin' him), Sydney Carton (self-pitying perpetual first-rate loser), and cold, cunning Madame Defarge (French, of course).I heard this one on unabridged cassette, by the way. .... The narrator had a real knack for establishing voices for the different characters."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I first read A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens in 1969. My friend Bucky, a French-Canadian, gave me the book as a birthday present with a bouquet of daisies, a blue balloon, and a wooden crate of oranges. We sat on the beach eating oranges from morning until sunset, reading A Tale of Two Cities to one another. It was one of my favorite birthdays. It is still one of my favorite books. It is probably the reason oranges are my favorite fruit."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book would be best described as a quick, fascinating read. It is a historical book, showing off one of the less flattering periods of world history. It's well written, interesting, and draws the reader in quickly.I won't say the plot, because quite frankly, it can't be explained. I can only recommend it wholeheartedly and hope that you realize that this is a book worth reading. The whole historical aspect mingled the with interesting characters and the good writing makes this book worth even more. The characters are interesting and though they are not exactly characters you fall in love with, they're characters that leave you with a sense of curiousity and intrigue. They are almost characters to watch. The story rushes along, and there is no \\"boring\\" moment.It's a four and not a five for two reasons. The first is that I had trouble understanding who was who at the beginning. It got a bit confusing when people were just referred to vaguely and not directly. The seconod reason is that the sense of frustration I experienced at the end of the book. I wasn't entirely sure that I was sure of what had happened, and that was a little annoying. However, ignoring these extremely small points I find myself inviting you to read this great book. Buy it, check it out from the library, borrow it from a friend... I honestly couldn't care less about your method of obtaining the book. All I care about is you reading this cool \\"tale\\" and being introduced to one of the most interesting (and bloody) classics of all."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have been reading this book for a long long time, and I can truthfully say that it is the most difficult book that I have ever read. I spent a whole month reading, and all i could finish was one-eighth of it. That time was no wasted though. Tale of two cities has reminded me of my childhood books, not for the text, but for the way i see the surroundings. A picture book barely describes the setting, but that does not matter, because the pictures show what the setting is like. Tale of Two cities may be a book filled with words, but the words that Dickens writes paints a picture that is just as clear as any photograph. This is definately a book to buy if you have the brains and the time. Don't pick this book up if you don't like puzzles, because parts of it will even confuse the smartest teachers. Gripping story that will drive you to the edge of your seat, if you don't mind going back and reading a passage over and over again. My friends advised meto just read and ignore the parts that i didn't understand, but if I did that , I wouldn't be reading. If you enjoy this book, you should read Great Expectations, which is another great piece of work by Charles Dickens, about a growing boy, out to persue his dreams."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The story starts off with Lucie going to Paris to find he lost father. When she finds her father he is a completely unstable man straight from prison. She takes him right back to England and five years later they are back in Paris again. They are there for the trial of Charles Darnay who is being accused of being a spy for France and the U.S. He is doomed to die when Sydney Carton says that the identification of Darnay as a spy might not have been correct since he himself looks much like Darnay. After saving Darnay he meets Lucie who he begins to love. He pronounces his love but she has begun to love Darnay and they soon get married. After their honeymoon he decides to go back to France to save a servant of his who has been imprisoned because he was called a spy. Upon his arrival in France in Paris he is arrested because he is the son of a hated noble in Paris. He is sentenced to death when Lucie and Sydney and her father come to France to see what they can do to save Lucies husband. When they are assured that he wont get out this time Sydney sacrifices his life and takes Darnay's place on death row."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In general, this was not a horrible book like I found Great Expectations to be. I read it for English this year. I think that if I hadn't been reading this for the class with deadlines and analyzing it and all, I would have enjoyed it much more. I did like it. Certainly. At times, it was great, and I just kept on reading.The characters are pretty easy to relate to. You have the damsel in distress-- Lucie Manette, loving and kind to everybody. She really is the ideal Victorian Woman (Dickens was Victorian). Then you have her man-- Charles Darnay, rich, perfect guy, somewhat boring, gets himself into a couple of scrapes and needs help in getting bailed out. There is the worthless man who loves heroine but knows he can't have her and will risk anything for her-- Sydney Carton, looks just like Darnay, saves him a couple of times, drunkard, loves Lucie, knows is a failure and does not think he can change. Then we have the father-- Alexandre Manette, a little weary of Darnay at beginning, has reason to be so, Lucie is dedicated to him hand and foot. The revolutionary crazy woman-- Madame Defarge, quite the vengance, according to Dicken's vision, she is simply a dark haired Lucie. And the loveable father figure-- Lorry, sweet, rigid at first, but loosens up.well, the book is well written most of the time, but there are some parts where it is really obvious that dickens is getting paid by the word. he also skips some important stuff or summarizes in a chapter. There is one point where he is describing how time passes and talks about Lucie's children and all, and he kinda spends two pages discussing like 7 years or something, found that kinda confusing, and there were a few other parts like that.Still, the book is important for any well-read person to have read. If you can stand Dicken's style, the book is certainly worth it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is not only one of classics of literature, but it is a classic in Christian literature. There is no way of missing the Christian message of sacrifice, since Sydney Carton is a Christic figure who, by his death, lets the captive Charles Darnay go free. For the real obtuse, Dickens quotes the bible several times!Admittedly, one wag described a church as a gathering of hypocrites, and sadly, this may be right. Books like this help Christians spiritually get their head on straight. It is not preachy, save for the eloquence of example. Yes this is a dark book, but it burns so brightly because the characters glow.The darkness is the necessary element: the headless angels carved on dark wood, the grave robber, the wet blade of the Guillotine, and the outrages of injustice. But that is an accurate depiction of the current scheme of things, and this darkness shows the shine of the characters. The Truth is made manifest by the contrast. Carton could have remade a drunk, but he rose above and beyond himself!I read this book in High School, and was so overcome with it, I bought it, and I will never let it go!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities is arguably one of his best novels. It is his only attempt to write a Historical Fiction novel and it is very successful. A Tale of Two Cities takes place during a time of chaos known as the French Revolution. Entwined around a historical base, A Tale of Two Cities follows a French doctor once political prisoner of the Monarchy, his daughter Lucy, Madame Dafarge, Charles Darnay, Sydney Carton, Mr. Lorry and his entourage. Throughout the novel many comparisons are apparent; from the first lines \\"It was the best of times, It was the worst of times\\" to nearly the last \\"Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine.\\" Wine and blood, London and Paris, many of the comparisons have great contrast between them. Ms. Pross and Madame Defarge, the Lion and the Jackal, Darnay and his parents, each have different views of the times and the world. Similarities also appear throughout the book, Lucie and her daughter, both bearing the same name and the same appearance, the almost identical appearances of Carton and Darnay. Even more themes are wound around the contrasts and similarities in A Tale of Two Cities. All themes one would expect to find in a Dickens novel are present; greed, vengeance, rebellion, love and sacrifice being most predominate. Both fate and past actions spell out doom for the characters in the book. Lucie's father witnessed the killing of a young man by Darnay's family. Mr. Defarge an acquaintance of Doctor Manetee happened to find a note regarding this during the storming of the Bastille. The man killed happened to be the brother in law of Madame Defarge. All these events lead to one thing psychopathic revenge on the part of Madame Defarge. Charles after his arrival in England meets and falls in love with Lucie, the Doctor's daughter. After marrying and having a child he travels to France. On his journey, the Republic passed a law barring foreigners from entering the country under penalty of death. In Paris he is imprisoned by the Republic and scheduled to go on trial later that month. His new family and friends are notified that he was arrested and come to support him. Using influence gained by being a prisoner of the Bastille and the fact that Darnay relinquished his nobility in France years ago, Dr. Manette is able to give Charles his freedom. Unfortunately his efforts are worthless, the day Darnay is released he is once again arrested for a crime not committed by him, but his parents. His new accusers: Citizen Defarge, Citizeness Defarge and Dr. Manette, Lucy's father. Defarge kept the letter written so many years ago and used it to have Darnay arrested. Will Charles face the ultimate penalty, or once again gain his freedom? In conclusion A Tale of Two Cities is Dickens' best book. It has enough fast paced action to keep anyone interested if they can get past the first 60 pages. The hardest reading of the book takes place in this first section but is also very rewarding reading. This detailed filled section gives the reader knowledge of past events, which greatly enhance the plot. The first sixty pages are filled with foreshadowing which enhances his novel making it his best. If you want to start reading Dickens I suggest you begin your epic by reading A Tale of Two Cities. If you have already read some of his previous works you will love this book. When I began reading A Tale of Two Cities it seemed boring and slow like Great Expectations. Once I read Book the First, I began to appreciate Dickens work much more."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is the best of books ... it is the worst of books.

I have read many books in my lifetime, yet none of them seem to compare to this world-famous piece of literature. I am usually very good in understanding and comprehending literature, but the wording of this book actually did confuse me. It is no fault of Charles Dickens that I could not understand some of the wording, but that really was not the main problem. The plot to this book is really very enthralling, just very confusing. It sporatically changes setting from England to France. Also, the years go jump up in clumps of at least 5 years at a time.

That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tis' a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before, byrating this book perfect!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It seems that my initial review was considered a spoiler, or either I didn't send it in (which I'm skeptical about). Okay, here it is in non-spoiler fashion. Dicken's \\"A Tale Of Two Cities\\" takes place in two cities- London & Calais. The high point of the novel is the French Revolution, which (in this book) incorporates a fictional twist with (you guessed it) fictional characters. The character dialogue in the unabridged versions of \\"Two Cities\\" may seem a tad on the tedious side to the novice reader (I know it did to me *hint*). Therefore, there are study guides like CliffsNotes (which is a 12th grade AP English teacher's adversary) which aids in a couple o' steps onto the firm ground of better understanding. \\"Two Cities\\"'s central focus is on a man named Charles Darnay (half French/ half English) who goes on trial in England on accusations of treachery. Yet, he's acquitted based on the fact that his defense lawyer, Sydney Carton, bears a striking resemblance to him. Sydney Carton is a self-pity case who has no esteem for himself, and also has an eye on Darnay's wife Lucie. When Darnay returns to France to help out a friend, the revolutionaries snare him... because he's kin of the most hated Marquis in the history of France. Hence, that would mean he's \\"guilty by association.\\" Now Carton has to put his neck on the line (or guillotine?) to redeem himself for his wrongs and save an innocent man (Lucie's man). In short, ballooned language or not, this has to be one of the, if not \\"the,\\" best novels (on something other than America) ever written. It's good reading (it has suspense and plot), despite any specific target age."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\" shows the reputation this novel possesses due to the fact that everybody knows this quotation.This novel definitely showcases Charles Dickens' use of sophisticated language and complex plot to construct this elaborate masterpiece of A Tale of Two Cities. This novel entails much concentration and energy in order to pick up on Dickens' subtle but powerful hidden meanings. The wide array of intricate characters of love, loath, revenge, and defeat creates a totally different aspect to this already incredible story.Madame Defarge's twisted and chaotic behavior towards the aristocracy represents the resentment and anger the lower class displays to them. Charles Darnay's life of love for Lucie and his life of trial portray his intricacy and his ambiguity as a character. Lucie on the other hand is the \\"golden thread\\" that connects everyone in the novel together, thus bringing out the best in all. And of course, there is the infamous Sydney Carton. At the start of the novel, Carton displays immaturity and cruelty. However, Sydney performs one of the most memorable and \\"it is a far, far better thing that [he does]\\", which makes the reader change their opinion on this complex character.Dickens uses tools such as symbolism and theme to further captivate the audience in this riveting novel. Themes like resurrection and sacrifice are embedded in Dickens' text in order to keep the reader alert. Wine symbolizes the brutality and bloodshed of the notorious French Revolution. These aspects in Charles Dickens' writing allow for a meaningful and brilliant piece of work.These characters travel from France to England and back again in an endless struggle for freedom, power, and revenge, not to mention the inevitable storming of the Bastille. This story keeps the reader on edge and enraptures the reader into a dangerous and hectic world. This novel lives up to the title of a classic novel and every person must read this book at least once. This book is recommended to anyone with a love for history and a passion for excitement. The multi plot story in this novel does not bore the reader at any part in it. Strongly recommended because of the action and thrill, and highly praised, a reader cannot ignore this classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In his masterful novel, A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens brilliantly recreates the French Revolution. The novel captures the brutal Revolution in London and Paris as a whole, while also following a more personal experience through the main characters. Having previously read another Dickens novel, an abundance of characters is common to his style but they are intricately connected to each other, in turn creating a powerful development of each character to accent the storyline. Strong imagery is prevalent throughout the novel to demonstrate the harsh change of the lower class from innocent peasants to bloodthirsty, savage revolutionaries, where the action picks up at the Storming of the Bastille. The beginning of the book is slow, simply developing characters but the story gains traction after a few chapters, providing an interesting, deep, intense experience until the last line of the book. The ending of the novel connects personally with the reader and Carton's selfless sacrifice reveals an emotional part of the novel hidden by all the bloodshed from the peasants. Other scenes involving Lucie were boring as she is one of few characters to remain static throughout the ongoing Revolution and is never close to the action involving the revolutionaries. Also, while reading the novel, much of the description may seem unnecessary to the story and tiresome to read through, but if analyzed each chapter is important either through character development or establishment or foreshadowing of a significant event. Personally, reading the novel was not enjoyable but realizing and understanding the deeper meaning of the book made me appreciate the powerful words of Charles Dickens. Although most people may remember the first line, \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...\\" the characters resonate more profoundly and prove to be more memorable in Dickens' incredible tale of two cities."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter's summer reading...a great classic.You can't go wrong w/Charles Dickens..highly recommended and one of those books everyone should have read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This was required reading for school, so I did not particularly enjoy the book because it is a little dry and hard to follow.

Usually, that sentiment is correct, but there are exceptions. TTC is one. Many of us know the basic plot from high school, about the brave man that takes another guy's place on the guillotine. There is a wonderful storyline here but book and movie follow two very different paths. The 1935 MGM classic is more direct than the Charles Dickens opus. Ronald Colman carried the two hour movie, which considerably condensed the written work. And that is the heart of the matter. Dickens takes too many pages-and too many chapters (all in the flowery language of the era) to spin his tale. In fact, this reader would have been hard pressed to follow the plot without the benefit of having seen the screen version. There is no doubt Dickens is a great author, but his style can also grate the less than (very!) patient reader. By pleasant coincidence, this reviewer can offer one other example of screen superiority. That would be \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\", which also starred Mr. Colman- with a wonderful supporting cast including Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Madleine Carroll, David Niven and C. Aubrey Smith. There is a positive aspect to the Gillen D\\"Arcy Wood version of TTC: The introduction and footnotes are superior. This reviewer actually read and enjoyed them, but doing so adds to the time investment of perusing the printed word. This observer concluded his review of the movie by stating it was so good he was buying the book. The verdict is in: For entertainment appeal, the 1935 MGM movie is clearly superior."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a good piece of literature but at times is too wordy and can be hard to comprehend. There are underlying themes and symbols that can be hard to pinpoint in the labyrinth of long-winded sentences throughout the book. Aside from this all, the character development became so broad that side plots could sidetrack the main purpose for Dickens writing this tedious story. A Tale of Two Cities depicts the cities of London and Paris during the time of the French Revolution. Dickens for the most part remains neutral throughout the story, for he is less trying to state which side was the lesser evil of the French Revolution but is more illustrating the horrors of it. The book shows the faults of both sides without taking a biased point on the issue. The aristocracy is depicted as they should be, wealthy and indifferent of the oppressed lower class. While on the other hand also shows that the lower class took unwarranted action. At times depictions of both sides may seem somewhat overstated, as the aristocrats seem totally ruthless at times and the lower class less than human. The broken wine cask on the street of St. Antoine is a strong example where Dickens not only illustrates his ideal of the peasants but also serves as a symbol of the hunger of the lower class.The broken cask shows a metaphorical hunger of the peasants, a hunger for freedom. Dickens uses skillfully uses strong imagery to create a scene visible to the reader. It truly exemplifies the oppression the upper class puts on the lower. This is just one of the many examples of how Dickens shows this but he remains unbiased in showing extremities from both sides. He counters something like this with the execution of innocent people by the hands of those of the French Revolution, the peasants. This book is true to history and impartial but it loses its two stars with the side stories. Due to the wordiness of the story some parts of the story that were total subplots could be falsely analyzed as something significant to what Dickens was trying to state about the Revolution. Although it remains in perfect English like we speak today, it may be too archaic to translate to a readable piece of literature in our time. At the time of its first release the way of writing may have been comprehensible to the literate person, but in our time the common person would not be able to open the book and understand all Dickens is trying to say. A Tale of Two Cities, at one time may have been a remarkable, epic story but today it could only be enjoyable to a select group. This group consisting of a bright analytical few that could interpret Dickens' muddled story of European history at a crucial period in time. A Tale of Two Cities is a book worth picking up at the local library if you are up to the challenge for reading it, but it is not worth the cost of buying for you are not likely to want to read it more than a single time."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I reaf this book about thirty years ago and I have enjoyed it again just as much.

When you read it, it translates beautifully from the late 18th century to today. Although the language is of the era, Dickens' words come through as amazingly descriptive. It's actually written in English, not whatever language it is that many people speak today. Could this have been an inspiration to Henry Higgins?

I was fifteen years old. That was the era where learning English literature did not mean reading the stories and talking about fate, or irony, or peripateia and how the story draws from earlier tales. Instead, we went searching for deep, often sexual meaning (strawberries were a dead giveaway, usually. I don't recall if A Tale of Two Cities had strawberries.)We excavated the writers' personalities through their works. So I suffered through this book, made my usual A grade in the class, and finished the year. That summer I thought, \\"This book can't be as bad as they made it out to be.\\" I pulled it off the shelf (well... I purchased a paperback) that summer, sat down and read it.This book is magnificent. Read it. If you start to bog down, skip the chapter. You can go back and read it later.

How, for example, did I get an undergraduate degree in the arts without ever reading Dickens?[Forgive me, I'm about to praise Dickens via The Muppets]His style of writing is immediately impressive. I remember when \\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" was released that they chose to cast Gonzo as Dickens so that they wouldn't lose Dickens' narrative voice. I now fully understand that decision. His writing style is intimate and full of personality. It has an exuberance that makes you feel like you're sitting beside a cozy fire as Dickens himself reads aloud to you. His long sentences can sometimes be hard to follow, but they're evocative and absorbing.The plot equally impresses. A complicated web of characters is slowly established in our two cities of London and Paris. Based on the meticulous setup, events unfolded as I expected them to, culminating in a moving ending. Did I just call the plot predictable? In a sense, yes, but I think there are two kinds of predicability: one that's due to a reliance on cliche, and one that comes from a resolution where all the pieces fall into place in a way that makes perfect sense, fits the themes, and satisfies the reader. This novel is firmly the latter. Dickens uses the theme of duality to his advantage in his comparisons of the two cities and the characters of Darnay and Carton, all leading to an ending that is so classic that even if you think you don't know it, trust me, you do.If I could lodge one small complaint, it's that the novel's heroes have not withstood the test of time. To Dickens' Victorian audience, perhaps Charles and Lucie's overwhelming goodness was striking and exemplary, but to the modern reader they'll come across as a bit dull and one-dimensional.Now that I'm finally acquainted with his work, I plan to read much more of it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Been wanting to read this for years. While I am only 3/4 through, I can understand why it's considered a classic. Better late than never."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Plot twists and the merging of all the secondary characters at the end of the book is amazing.A very enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I love Dickens, and I've read and re-read his books for many years. However, I'd never plowed through \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" until recently. There's something about its lecturing tone and the back-and-forth plots and the perfection of some of the characters that just didn't work for me. This time, I did read it through to the end, and I'm thoroughly impressed.The book is a departure for Dickens on several levels. It's his only historical novel, using the French Revolution as its fulcrum. Much of the action takes place in Paris and occurs in a place and time he did not visit; usually, he wrote much closer to his experience. It's probably his most blatantly political book, and it treads on dangerous turf, given that England and France at the time potentially could still wind up in battle.The best parts of the book are its angriest: Dickens railing against the evils of oppresion that gave rise to the Revolution and then the excesses and horrors that arose when tricolor revolutionaries gained power. I was almost trembling with anger at the injustice and horror of nobles taking robbing and raping poor villagers, and then angry villagers killing scores of people (innocent and guilty) at the guillotine. Dickens is an equal-opportunity avenger. He hates the evils perpetrated on both sides (though seems to be blind to similar inequities that existed in England at the time, though of a much lesser degree). His concerns feel modern, as we in America grow increasingly angry with the rich-getting-richer society, even as one-fifth of homeowners still owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth (how they can be called \\"owners\\" of their homes is something I don't understand).The book is pretty close to being one long polemic, thinly disguised by a plot. It's not too far from Upton Sinclair, though written with much more humor, satiric bite, and memorable descriptions. And that's okay. We weave through the improbable plot, but mostly to find out whether justice will be done, and to get a feel for the fever that overtook France during the Revolution. And we love the bizarry Jerry Cruncher, errand-runner with the spiky hair, and fearless Miss Pross, as fiery as her ruddy countenance. We fear DeFarge and, especially his wife, who sits serenenly knitting while plotting her revenge. We marvel at the success of Mr. Stryker \\"shouldering\\" his way to the top of the legal profession, all the while collaborating quietly with the dissipated Sidney Carton --- who rises up in the end to prove to be the bravest man of all.As a final note, I'd say that this isn't an easy Dickens book, and certainly not the best place to start. The sentences are complicated and often in a passive construction that's hard to follow. And the book is not as fun as his other famous works. But if you get your feet with with \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Pickwick Papers,\\" then this is a great next step."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The book doesn't require any comment.

Anyone who is a true admirer of Dickens' work would toss his or her copy in the trash as I did mine. Admittedly, it's one of his shorter works. I believe this is why it's so widely read in schools (and, yes, I can understand a sentimental attachment on the part of otherwise intelligent readers who read the book at a young age). There are so many excellent novels by Dickens (Martin Chuzzelwitt, Barnaby Rudge, Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood, etc.) that I felt betrayed by Mr. Dickens when I finally read \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and realized what a profoundly bad piece of writing it is. As with any prolific writer, not everything this genius set to paper is worth reading. Pass up \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", suck it up and grab one of his longer, far better works. You'll be surprised just how quickly 799 pages can fly by (as consolation, his chapters are generally very short!). It's well worth the effort. While you're at it, if you're still in the mood for Victorian melodrama, pick up something by Dickens' buddy, Wilkie Collins.

The reason I gave this book one star is because there was no choice for zero stars. Spare yourself from reading this book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Probably one of my all time favorite losers!!Never finished this classic crap.

Great Expectations (when forced to read it) was one of the worst books I have had to read; it was confusing, dragging, completely improbable, and generally annoying.A Tale of Two Cities was definitely an improvement on that one, but was still confusing. The plot jumped around a lot from place to place, often without much explanation as to what was going on. It was compelling in parts, and mysterious enough that I wanted to keep going, but the rest was boring.Just as an example: I was confused about two characters in the middle of the book, and whether they were two people or the same person. I assumed it would be cleared up by the end, and it was just careless reading on my part. Unfortunately, this was not the case. To this day I still have no idea if these two titles are the same person or not.

I could not care about the plot or about even one single character, although I sympathize with Dickens' social observations, I usually devour anything in print and I love 19th century novels as a rule. My high school class discussions did not bring me around in the least on this book. Dickens' female characters are either crones or ingenues, and he really does write as though he's being paid by the word. He was capable of better: \\"Great Expectations\\" is actually worth the paper its printed on; he actually seemed to give that one some care rather than just churning out word after word after word. Unfortunately out of all his books I've read, only \\"Great Expectations\\" lived up to his potential.

The two cities, of course, are Paris and London, and the drama of the story centers on the terror of the French Revolution in 1789-92 when the Guillotine was put to frequent use against those judged to be enemies of the new republic. The reader, Frederick Davidson, does an excellent job of characterizing the voices in the story. The voice he uses for each character is easily identifiable in dialogue between characters, and brings out the traits Dickens built into them. The one exception, in my opinion, is the voice Mr. Davidson chose for Lucie Manette, the passive heroine of the story. Her lines in the novel are mostly insipid because she is the classic Victorian delicate, fainting beauty, and of course her first language is supposed to be French, but I found her voice and character difficult to warm up to (unlike Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, whose love for her drives much of the plot). Still, her speaking part is small, and Mr. Frederickson's virtuoso performances of Jerry Cruncher, Jarvis Lorry, Miss Pross, and Sydney Carton, not to mention the charming Defarges of Saint Antoine, render this a very small shortcoming in an otherwise clear, consistently interesting, and suspenseful performance.

It is a masterpiece on many counts, the development of the characters, the setting of the scene, the intricacy of the plot, and for its meaning and ability to move the emotions. Here we have a complex plot gently unfolding under the shadow of the turbulent French Revolution. Where Dickens excels most is in his descriptions and characterization. Thus after a few pages you will be living with the characters, feeling their tribulations and enjoying their moments of happiness, traveling with them on the road and feeling the tension of the trial rooms. One can feel through the pages the rush of the crowds during the historic moment of the storming of the Bastille, and cannot escape feeling the sympathy for the rescued Dr. Manette. The patterns of the novel shift from the violent to the happy to the frightening to the violent in an endless cycle not unlike today(tm)s turbulent world, where the secret trials and the revolutionary bloodshed are the theme of the day. A Tale of Two Cities is a timeless story about the triumph of love in such terrible times."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Dickens does a superb job in conveying how insensitivity of careless brute can meet pitiless vengence."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Set amidst the turmoil of the corrupt governments of England and France, this story begins in 1775 with the release of Alexandre Manette who has unjustly been in prison for the past eighteen years. He is reunited with his eighteen-year-old daughter, Lucie Manette, who believed herself an orphan. Though Monsieur Manette gladly adjusts to leading a normal life again, he is haunted by the thought of something he cannot remember.Charles Darnay is a French heir to much wealth, which he does not claim, due to the means by which it was acquired. Rather, he has chosen to earn his living by teaching, and in kindnesses to others, attempt to repair the wrongs incurred by his family. In one such instance of kindness, he meets the Manettes; their acquaintance grows into friendship throughout further meetings. Darnay's renunciation of wealth and position in France, donning a false name in England, and traffic between the two countries, cause each country to either dislike him or suspect him of treason. All of these things lead to tenuous situations for Charles Darnay.Sidney Carton is a barrister of England, who, though very bright, is in general, bored with life. He is envious of Mr. Darnay because he holds the affection of the beautiful Miss Lucie Manette. Can he reconcile his love for Miss Manette, and his dislike of Mr. Darnay?Aside from the characters already mentioned, A Tale of Two Cities contains wine shop keepers who lust for revenge on their French oppressors, a messenger for a bank who robs graves at night, Lucie Manette's opinionated, but faithful servant and friend, and various other characters, all intricate to Charles Dickens.Although this is a story about people, it is also a tale of two cities, London and Paris, before and during the French revolution. It is a tale of loss and of gain, of violence and of peace, of revenge and of love. Perhaps it is best described by its opening words \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\".This copy of the book has small, but definitely legible print, and contains eight expressive sketches. The cover is black, with gold lettering on the spine; the slipcover is blue, with yellow lettering, and a color picture of a man, a woman, and a child. The inside flaps contain a synopsis of the story and of Dickens' life and works.A Tale of Two Cities (Masterpiece Theatre, 1989)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This abridged Pacemaker Classic is short, gripping, and demonstrates the madness that took hold in France during the Revolution's reign of terror. We follow main character Charles Darnay, a decent and dissenting member of the aristocratic Evermonde family who leaves France for England, survives a trial in England, marries there, then is tricked into returning to France to be arrested and charged. We also see the kangaroo court atmosphere that existed in France during those blood-thirsty days; the accused was easily arrested, presumed guilty, and almost always sent to the guillotine. There's also vengeance, as pertains to Madame DeFarge, determined to see that all Evermondes (guilty and blameless) are done away with.Years ago my high school classmates griped that this book (complete version) was boring. But teaching this abridged (94-page) version recently to students in Latin America was fun - most of them (like me) found it crisp and powerful."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens is a highly thought provoking novel. It portrays the French Revolution in a way that no other author could even start to compare. Reading this novel is like living in the middle of these harsh times. Throughout the novel many subtopics as well as themes and symbols are suggested. One I find interesting is the \\"Resurrection of Sydney Carton\\" which is based on events that take place at the end of the novel. Carton goes to the guillotine, for the sake of his loved ones. Because of this, he is seen as a Christ-like figure. Although he doesn't die for the sins of everyone in the world, he still dies for the people he loves, in order for them to be able to live better lives. There is obviously a drastic difference between Jesus and Carton, given that Carton is drunk the majority of the time. Carton does quote the Bible, which is most likely why this theme is such an obvious one. \\"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die\\" (pg. 309). The main gist of the way that Carton dies is definitely enough to at least compare their intentions of sacrificing themselves for others. This is an effective theme because it contrasts a character with a widely known leader in history. In a sense, it puts Carton's action of sacrifice in a new perspective. There are many other themes throughout this novel that are just as interesting as this one.Charles Dickens does an incredible job in his descriptions throughout A Tale of Two Cities. He is so greatly detailed that it is easy to feel the emotions and see everything taking place while being mentioned. This novel is a classic, the majority of people can at least find one part of it that they thoroughly enjoy or at least slightly appreciate. I think that Dickens shows both sides of the French Revolution in a very symbolic way. He brings out the hatred the peasants feel towards the aristocrats very often. He shows how it really felt like to be a peasant, and he is a very trustworthy speaker when it comes to this topic, considering he was one himself as a boy. As for the aristocrats, he describes their snobby personalities in a way that turns you against them. He is very clear about how both sides reacted to certain events that occurred during the French Revolution. It seems as if Charles Dickens explains his views on the Revolution through the peasants point of view, which seems like quite a smooth approach. This book is written in a very interesting and intriguing way. Although sometimes verbose and complex, it also enriches the reader's understanding of the characters. A Tale of Two Cities is a very well written novel and it definitely helps readers get a better grasp of the French Revolution."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, was a well- written book. The beginning was a lot of summary of what it was like around that era and things that were going on. It also was about the way of life for the citizens. I think that this book offers a good look into the French Revolution. It gives you so much information about the French Revolution and how it felt to live in it back then. I like the fact that the book was based on the history it was based on, which is the French Revolution. In the 1700's, which was when the revolution was, everyone had a part to play in the revolution. There were two sides to be on the peasants or the aristocrats. Every revolutionary spied on the enemy side as a working strategy to get there way. I think that Charles Dickens was on both sides of the revolution. He was routing for both peasants and aristocrats. He showed his feelings of the revolution by putting his feelings of the revolution into each character. The rebels in France conflicted with the calm people in London. The contrast between settings changed into conflicts between characters. The characters in A Tale of Two Cities also contrast each other. Madame Defarge is an aggressive woman and has a huge part to play in the revolution. She registers the names of people who are going to be killed in the revolution by knitting them. Lucie Manette, who contrasts Mme. Defarge, is a kindhearted lover of her friends and family. Dickens puts many contrasting characters in the novel to show his perspective about the time period of the French revolution. The peasants saw the well-off aristocrats as being selfishly bad people that should suffer a painful death by being sentenced to the guillotine. Dickens put in a lot of symbolism to show problems in the novel. For example, the red wine represented the bloodshed that was coming with the revolution and Lucie Manette represented the golden thread, or peacefulness, that tied everyone together through the unusually violent times during the revolution. Overall it's a good book. I recommend that the future readers keep up and take notes or else you will be completely lost. This is a story about London and France during the French Revolution. In the novel Dickens tells about 'the best of times and the worst of times,' for the rich and the poor'. (p.1)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is confusing and cumbersome to read, but underneath that, it makes for a very interesting and easy to understand plot, even if he takes twelve lines describing something so seemingly minute as a few flies buzzing around a room. The point of these lengthy interjections in the plot is to make absolutely certain that the symbols and themes of the novel are, at some points, painfully obvious. Dickens frequently foreshadows the plot to come so well that one can figure out the next few chapters, and be correct. Overall, this has the effect of making the period of the French Revolution very real to anyone who reads it, accurately portraying the moods and emotions of those caught in the whirlwind period.Dickens uses symbols to make this book much more rewarding when read carefully. While other authors bury symbols deep in the dredges of things only meaningful to the plot, Dickens makes his symbols about as transparent as a Picasso. This use of symbols makes the book a much deeper experience than simply an emotional plotline. His portrayal of the guillotine as a character, for example, is quite satirical in its use. \\"Sainte Guillotine(275),\\" as it is called fondly by bloodthirsty revolutionaries like the ridiculously twisted wood-sawyer, is stained with the blood of many, and the way that the republicans say, in a proud and slightly sadistic manner, how many people's heads rolled that day; it brings a sick feeling to one's stomach. The peoples Guillotine worship is a constant reminder of the violence brought on by revenge, and the injustice done to the poor, innocent people who were swept into the sea of violence and blood.In the end, when Carton is being a martyr and keeping his word to Lucie, he meets a poor young seamstress who was convicted of a plot against the Republic. The injustice shown by this cruel act is just another theme of the novel, and another way Dickens shows how the new government is every bit as unjust as the Old Regime was, but in a different, much bloodier, way. This is an example of his hiding of symbols... obvious, no? It is actually a more deeply buried symbol than many in the book, many of which are named specifically and are meant to be found, for example, the case of the woodsman and the farmer, which represent fate and death, which he tells you...very blatantly. This way of using symbols and other literary devices is almost too effective, it takes the whole search out of it, which kind of defeats the purpose of teaching it, it is pretty self explanatory on its own...therefore, Dickens was a little doubtful of his audiences intelligence, maybe?He also makes a very balanced view of the French Revolution, showing both sides' motives, while also showing the sheer brutality and unjustness of all groups involved, while not getting too over the top in his hyperboles. His portrayal of the nobility is fairly balanced, by using Monseigneur to show the bad side of the Aristocracy, and Charles Darnay to show the fair side. He also weighs the Revolutionaries side by balancing the bloodthirsty evil side of Mme. Defarge with the logic of her husband. The passages denouncing both, while scathing, are both believable in the time period of the book.In short, Charles Dickens' use of symbols and his balance make A Tale of Two Cities a very interesting and intricate book encompassing the emotions of both sides of the French Revolution, even if it is and tedious and time-consuming read.~Noah Sanders"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Even though the book, A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is one of the most complex books I have ever read, I loved every minute of it!This book is about Lucie Manette finding her father in Paris, then running into Charles Darnay on a ship to England. Darnay is accused of treason; Lucie and her father support him in his trial. Later Darnay and Lucie fall in love. Darnay decides that he wants to go back to France; he takes Lucie and her father with him into a world of mock trials and crazed rage. You would expect the ending of this book to be one of fear, but Dickens unexpectedly turns the ending to one of hope and what lies ahead.You need to have a very long attention span in order to keep interest in this book. When I read it, the beginning of the book seemed dull to me, but as I got along, the book became alive. This book is written so that each character has a story, but somehow, all the stories fit together to form this brilliant novel. It is now my favorite, no other book will ever take its place!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Set during the French Revolution \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is a story told through the perspective of different groups of individuals caught in the turmoil and violence of the \\"Reign of Terror\\". Having been imprisoned in the Bastille for the last 18 years, Doctor Mannete is at last reunited with his 17 year old daughter, Lucie, who helps her father to recuperate from his fragile state of mind. Five years after returning to London, Doctor Mannete and his daughter get acquainted with Sidney Carton, a lawyer of little repute, and Charles Darnay who later becomes his son-in-law. In a twisted turn of events Doctor Mannete along with his daughter are forced to return to France, a place, Dr. Mannete never thought he would return, where they all are sucked into the unrest and violence prevalent during that time in France.Before reading this book the only thing I knew about the French Revolution was from my History book and the \\"Reign of Terror\\" was described only briefly in it.French Revolution was a time when all the citizens of the France were supposed to free and equal. Instead, it turned out to be a time which was dominated by death and violence. This is what was depicted by the book. While the book mostly deals with the ruthlessness of the common people of France during that time, it does not give just a one-sided view. No matter how much I tried I couldn't actually hate the Defarges though they were at times compassion-less. After knowing their stories I too sometimes wonder, what would I have done if I was in their place. The \\"Reign of Terror\\" was born from the accumulated anger of the French people who had been suffering for years under the oppression of higher classes.Though the book can get a bit boring and confusing at first but as more and more facts are revealed the story gets both interesting and exciting. What really makes this book one of my favourites would be its shocking and unexpected ending. My favourite characters would be Sidney Carter and Madame Defarge. Carter though a creditable lawyer has little or no respect among his fellow collegues. Even though he is thought to be selfish and useless, the sacrifices he makes for his love, Lucie, shows a nature quite contrary to the popular assumptions about him. Madame Defarge is quite the opposite of the other female lead of the book, Lucie, who is frail and weak. She is the driving force behind her husband and her pain of losing a son makes her stronger. Her nature is a queer mixture of caring and cruel.A Tale Of Two is one of those books which could be read again and again. This book does not only have a good story, it is accompanied by excellent writing by the author which enables the reader to connect to the story and the characters. This is Dickens at his best!Favourite Quotes:\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way- in short, the period was far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\\"\\"A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be profound secret and mystery to every other.\\"\\"Death may beget life, but oppression can beget nothing other than itself.\\"Overall:A beautiful, touching and memorable tale of love, sacrifice and ruthlessness of people during the French RevolutionRecommended?Yes, to all those love Charles Dickens and to those who are fascinated by the French Revolution."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a classic novel. I've read it several times through the years and each time I am more impressed with Dickens. The time period comes to life and it is a must read if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"GREAT PRODUCT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT WOULD BE THAT AT TIMES THE READING IS QUITE FAST. WOULD RECOMMEND IT ALONG WITH THE BOOK AND THE MOVIE."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Mr. Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank is traveling in the Dover Mail, 1775. Men from the bank frequently travel from London to Paris. He receives a message when the Dover Mail is stopped, and he learns he is to escort Lucie Manette to a reunion with her long-lost father. In Paris he encounters Monsieur Defarge and his wife, Madame Defarge. It seems that Dr. Manette has taught himself to be a shoemaker and that he doesn't remember his old banker, Jarvis Lorry. An issue arises as to whether Dr. Manette is fit enough for the journey to England.In 1780 Tellson's Bank is still old-fashioned. Mr. Charles Darney is a defendant is a court proceeding and Mr. Lorry and Miss Manette testify to having seen him five years previously in the vicinity of Calais. He is acquitted. Dr. Manette has started to receive patients again. Jarvis Lorry spends many Sundays with Dr. Manette and Lucie. At times Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton are part of the company. Darnay and the Manettes are voluntary exiles from France. Mr. Stryver, a barrister, and Mr. Darnay seek Lucie's favor. Lorry warns Stryver he may not succeed.There is so much color in a Dickens novel, street scenes, grotesque names, (Cruncher), so many roles assumed, (Barsad, spies), and so many droll ways of telling a story, (an officiating undertaker), a reader is overcome with admiration for the author's craft. Dickens is comparable to Shakespeare in terms of breadth of subject matter.I don't think historical writing is Dickens's strong suit, but, in any event, Dickens is Dickens, and the momentum given to him through Carlyle's work carries him to the end. In his personal life Dickens was in a sensitive and overwrought state, and this shows through in his portrait of Dr.Manette. Manette, for reason of his incarceration, seems to be afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This novel is pretty historically accurate on its portrayal of the revolution and plays out well. The bad thing is the language is kind of outdated, as well as hard to follow at parts. I like the storyline, and it is pretty intense, as well as shows how people were punished for going against the revolution. The history is interesting and makes this book worth reading, as well as the well developed characters and dramatic story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens gives another meaning to the French Revolution by portraying it through the eyes of the peasants and the aristocrats. Dickens' sarcastic tone for both classes shows that he is not taking either side, but rather showing his disapproval of their actions. By showing the aristocrats as immature and unable to care for themselves, Dickens shows no sympathy for their condition. However, by describing the revolutionaries as wild and untamed, the reader can tell that he does not approve of the peasants' take on the situation.A Tale of Two Cities is an intricate novel, with many conflicts interweaving in the first two books. Although the reader can engross themselves with the violent crimes of the Revolutionaries, the novel's true climax does not show itself until the third, and final, book. Although there is a large amount of crucial information in the first two books as to why the main climax happened, there is also a lot of excess information that I feel Dickens did not have to include in his novel an example being Mr. Stryver. Although some may argue that Stryver is needed to show how Sydney Carton is a \\"failure\\" compared to him, I feel that the novel could have done well without the involvement of this arrogant character. He proves as having no value to the story at the time of the climax, and he stays as a flat unimportant character that in no way helps move the plot along.The character of Madame Defarge is one that I feel is the most well-developed villain in all of literature. Her sinister ways and her hidden motives that become revealed in the third book keep the reader intrigued. The way she stops at nothing to destroy the aristocrats characterizes her as someone with a passion to avenge their loved ones, and not just an evil woman who loves to create bloodshed. Another character that I feel is important is Sydney Carton. This man, who at first receives no sympathy and maybe even disgust from the readers, proves himself as worthy of a good life and becomes the most lovable and admirable character of them all. His selfless attitude and his motivation to become a good person pull on the heartstrings of the readers.A Tale of Two Cities is a very heavy read, with a great amount of imagery, motifs, and symbolism that must be analyzed in order to fully comprehend everything that happens. This book is for those who feel they can put their heart into this dense book and fully understand it, otherwise nothing will make sense at all. Once they do, they will feel as if they have been transported back to the time of the French Revolution. Charles Dickens has rewritten history in a way that we all can enjoy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is based in London and Paris around the time of the French Revolution. The complexity of the classic makes for a suspenseful and intriguing story. The book depicts multiple sides of a story, following Lucie Manette and the formation of her family, Madame Defarge, the antagonist who has her own purposes behind instigating a revolution as well as Carton's change in character. Dickens portrays Sydney Carton, the protagonist and a favorite of many readers, as a lifeless, unmotivated young man who once had the potential to be as successful as his friend, Mr. Stryver. Using imagery and foreshadowing to draws readers in, Dickens creates an exemplary piece of literature.Anger and fear fill many of the characters' hearts through this chaotic time in history and surround the development of plot in the book. The famous first line of dualities, followed by a description of the period, begins the tale. The book reveals deeper insight into the French Revolution by presenting both the thoughts of the aristocrats and the peasants. By using fiction, Dickens gives readers a new outlook from the aristocrats' side during the Revolution. A Tale of Two Cities is a unique, challenging novel that requires further analysis and studying than most books.Being an honors student in her first year of high school, I would highly recommend this brilliant classic to my peers and elders. Younger students will most likely have trouble following the plot and appreciating Dickens' literary genius. At the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities, I had trouble myself understanding what seemed like thousands of characters and encoded events. Overall however, A Tale of Two Cities is another brilliant novel created by Charles Dickens, and I would recommend the book to anyone who is willing to make their way slowly and diligently through the rewarding classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"As a mere high school literature student and no more, this review is from a personal and not professional literature standpoint. Though Tale of Two Cities has always been hailed as a classic, and Dickens always proclaimed to be masterful, brilliant, etc., it wasn't until mid-way through the novel did I really feel this way. Picking up this book at first, it was far from appealing to me. I looked upon the book as just another boring history novel that was forced upon me to read. However, with time and much effort put into trying to understand the unfamiliar style of writing and large words, the novel became much more enjoyable and actually a fun read!This is not what I understand to be a light reading novel, one to read a little and put away for much time before touching it again. From personal experience, I believe that this novel requires time and conscious thought; it is much to digest. Though the action I typically look for in a novel did not really start until about half way through, it is a great book overall. Perhaps professional critics write their reviews depicting the wonderful artistry with which Charles Dickens weaves his plot and characters together, or his unmatched characters and imagery, but readers be aware. For any high schoolers or lower classmen looking to read this novel, this novel, though a fun read, requires thought and time. Skimming is not an option. In order to fully enjoy this deemed classic of Dickens, the events of this novel need to be understood first. I found that in the midst of the unfamiliar old english style and large words, the story of unrestrained human nature expressed as the French Revolution was lost to me sometimes. Only when I took the time to understand the basics of the novel first (writing style, unknown words, etc.) was I able to enjoy the very real imagery and characters, as well as the brilliant ease in which this author intertwines such seemingly complicated plots into one.Charles Dickens takes storytelling to a whole new level. His characters are real, their faults and very nature are as close as one can get to a true person on paper, and very relatable. The imagery used is developed and all too real, transporting the reader into the very pages of the book itself. Completely unappealing to me at first, what I misjudged to be a boring old history novel turned out to be very well, as all critics have seem to commonly put it, \\"a must read and a true classic\\"."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens presents one of his best writings in Tale of Two Cities. This artfully written piece displays incredible plot structure, amazing characterization, and fantastic themes. Using his skill, Dickens seamlessly intertwines the stories of both France and England during the 1700s. His story begins in England in 1775, where Lucie is introduced. This prominent individual represents both light and wholesomeness, and Dickens cleverly contrasts her pure character to Dr. Manette, Sydney Carton, and Charles Darnay. Darnay's struggles with England's courts show the corruption in the judicial system. While Carton holds potential, but a hopeless future. Last, Dr. Manette, a dramatic character, shows how humanity recovers from the brink of death, after his long sentence in prison. This book displays themes and characters that make the story remarkable.In France, Dickens characterizes aristocrats and peasants to reveal a slow rising revolution. The tension builds between the two classes, as Dickens introduces the Marquis and the Defarges. Marquis, representing the aristocracy, displays heartless and cruel behavior towards the villagers of France. On the other hand, the Defarges speak for the angered, vengeful, and poverty-stricken peasants. Through brilliant imagery, Dickens shows both sides of this inevitable revolution. This main plot and theme for France soon mixes with the characters of England.Near the end, many twists and turns occur to result in the shocking end of the story. The fate of Madame Defarge, a strong revengeful woman, shows justice, and the decision of Carton displays the sacrifices one must make. As the most memorable quote, \\"I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats,\\" it shows both the efforts of peasants to be free, and their soon revival after the brutal war (366). This quotes sums up the book and its meaning of resurrection and sacrifice. If a reader is thinking about picking up this classic, the book is highly recommended for its vivid imagery, deeper meanings, refreshing characters, and a flowing plot. Needless to say, this classic will leave a sorrowful smile on one's lips, but a thoughtful expression on the face."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens creates A Tale of Two Cities with an enthralling view of the French Revolution. He begins with the famous words \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,\\" continuing on to describe how London and France differ, but remain similar (7). Dickens goes on to describe how London recovers from the American Revolution, and foreshadows the French Revolution through the Queen abusing her powers. The introduction, full of literary devices, enriches the book, capturing the reader's attention. The motifs, imagery, and repeating themes make the book more powerful.Through the heavy and intricate descriptions of mob, characterizations of class, and themes of love and resurrection, Dickens builds layers upon the book changing the seemingly soporific plot. Characterizations depict the character's/groups true nature, while recurring themes emphasize an idea. The vital details that enhance and replete the book, making it a heavy read.However, if one takes the time to read, it unravels the events of the revolution in interesting ways. The characters in the story all suffer from distressing pasts, making their mingling with each other unusual. The entire book possesses a quality of suspense and enraptures the reader from the first beginning from how mysterious uncovering of truth in the book.When writing the book, Dickens gives life to the book by providing a story that goes with the French Revolution events. Lucie Manette discovers her father living with the Defarges, and eventually falls in love with Darnay. However, Sydney Carton gives his life for Darnay so the woman he loves lives happily. Carton's last words reveal his nature when he says \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done...I have know\\" (386). He believes he wastes his life never doing anything good for others. He proves himself wrong by sacrificing his life for another person not grateful or considerate to him. Through these characters and their powerful actions, the Revolution develops, making the book enticing. Therefore, the book prevails as a must read."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I have not read this book yet, however I am looking forward to reading it as soon as I am done with my other book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a, and I am being generous, very mediocre book. If you love reading great English literature filled with complicated symbols, confusing metaphors, and a somewhat hidden plot, then this is the book for you. I had to read the book for school, so my opinion of the book is already tampered with. When you are forced to read something within a certain time period and get very distinct information out of it, there is almost no plausible way that you can enjoy it as much as you would had you been reading it for pleasure. And let me tell you, I would definitely not recommend picking it up at your local book store and reading it on your own time for enjoyment. It is, on the other hand, a very well written book filled with delicate description and a deeply thought out plot. If you are into looking deep into a book to search out its true meaning, then you will enjoy Dickens's use of imagery and description through metaphors and personification. The book is quite humorous if your I.Q. test states that you are a genius. It is hard to understand, but once you get the hang of it, it can be absolutely hilarious. Had Charles Dickens not been paid by the word to write this, what seems like prolonged and everlasting book, one might be able to get more insight out of less words instead of being drawn away from the story because of the length and longevity of a single paragraph. You might say I was being like Dickens now, trying to prolong the review using as many words as possible just to make some extra cash. One difference, I am not getting paid, I just get a lousy grade for staying up late and bruising the tips of my fingers on the keyboard while using every last ounce of thought left in my brain to finish it and do a good job. Well, enough of that, back to A Tale of Two Cities. The book will teach you a lot about the French Revolution and the condition of what was going on during the time period. Dickens goes into vivid detail about the slaughtering and revolt that took place during the French Revolution. The theme of \\"what goes around comes around\\" is present in the novel and takes place in the plot. In conclusion, the book is, as I said before, mediocre. The book can be quite amusing if you understand and relish in the humor that Dickens uses. I did not like the book, but I know many people who did. It is a good read if it is your style. You may or may not get a lot out of the book or enjoy it, but it is your choice, so have at it. If you do decide to obtain it, you should pick it up at amazon.com.

I love the storyline itself as it is packed with drama and suspense in rescue of an innocent doctor accused of treason by a treasoness government. While the story it dark and very intricately written, it is by no means a book that can be read at one's own leisure. If put down, it is easy to be confused on where the story left off and where it is going. The wordage is sometimes confusing and the story jumps around much which can complicate things if you don't read the story straight through.

It took a long time to get into the book and I found it extremely hard to understand. It had way too many antonyms, and it swirled around and would talk for 2 pages about somthing easily told it 3 sentances. Extremely boring and uninteresting. When I saw that Charles Dickens wrote it I thought &quot;Hey this is going to be good, I mean this is Dickens one of the best, most talked about writers of all time&quot; but now I think very little of the name Dickens as a writer. I hesitate to read Great Expectations, or Oliver Twist for the sheer lack of a waste of time. 100 pages into the book and I still have no idea what it is about. There was 2 good things about it 1)Where Mrs.Mannette finds her father and 2)When I quit reading it"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"It was the best of times, it was the was the worst of times...\\" Charles Dickens's dramatic opening phrase to his novel about the French Revolution now stands alone in the English language and is used with ordinary regularity and contrasts in historical events. An internet search shows the phrase occurring in 5402 different web sites. A new reader of this book could well come away with the feeling that this was the best of books, it was the worst of books. The contrast for the new reader is one of subtle character development and that of cartoon characterizations.On the one hand the reader will find Sydney Carton, a drunken, broken, brilliant lawyer who is the tool of a sober but less clever man. Carton lives a life of drink and works only to support his habit. If this were all we were to know about him, he could be one of many characters that Dickens uses to set the stage. But Carton is more than window dressing; he can still love and hope to be loved. His love for Lucy Manette is unrequited, but this condition drives Carton not back to the tavern but to the guillotine where he dies so Lucy can experience love that is undiminished. Sydney Carton is not ones usual hero; he is at once broken and ruined as well as noble and transformed. The reader will find a home in Sydney Carton because, like most people, he is a mixture of these things which fail and succeed.On the other hand, the new reader may not feel so very much at home with the novels remaining important characters: the Manettes, Charles Darnay, the wicked Marquis, and M.and Mme.Defarge All of the characters are cartoons which the Victorian reader may have enjoyed but do not seem to come to life today. For example, Lucy Manette is beautiful, righteous, long suffering, obedient, and boring. Charles Darnay is chivalrous, honorable, just, long suffering, and boring. The wicked Marquis, uncle to Darnay, is just wicked and damned and he knows it. If you enjoyed Harry Potter you will find Lucius Malfoy and the wicked Marquis are alike. What can be said about Dr. Manette and the Defarges? Dr. Manette is righteous, patient, and long suffering and boring. The Defarges are a couple who have suffered many wrongs, but are also cruel and murderous. The wicked Marquis may have known his business well. Charles Darnay is the only Frenchman who has any virtue in Dickens's eyes. There is a specific reason for this. Charles Darnay wishes to become a middle class Englishman, a sentiment which would appeal to Dickens's readers whose opinion of the French Revolution was formed by Thomas Carlisle, an English historian and friend of Dickens. The other characters are cartoons because we don't really know them and they either provide extremes of passion, like the wicked Marquis and the Defarges, or they stand for middle class virtues but remain strangers to us.Dickens was born in 1812 at the end of the first Napoleonic Era. The French Revolution would have still provided an exciting place to tell a story of decay and redemption in part, because Victorian England was still nervous about revolutionary events. The 21st Century reader may find the French Revolution gory but strangely remote. Today the French do not want to be good Englishmen; instead they have chosen to become the Marquis of Defarge.While the character development in the book certainly takes away from the book so does the narrator, in some cases. The narrator of this story has a way of impeding the plot with needless detail. To the modern reader the block form the narrator uses in telling the story can be dull. The reader has to take into account, however, that this book was written in a serial form. This would mean that the more Dickens wrote, the more he was paid and the more detail was needed. Dickens uses the narrator as a way of putting in his opinions, again in a very long block form. His opinions are that of the English's view of the French Revolution. This was that both the peasants and the aristocracy were at fault. The peasants obviously started the war but the aristocracy shouldn't have treated them so vilely. This is examined with the scene where the evil, bloodthirsty mob reeks vengeance on Foulon, the same person who said, \\"Let them eat grass.\\" The third person narrative is imperative to this novel because the reader would never get the entire story, only someone else's view.The narrative in this book is long and hard to read. These reasons make the modern reader find the beginning and the middle of this book extremely uninteresting. Since the book was written after the French Revolution, some of the word choices are out of date and confusing. Dickens's style was used by most Victorian writers and is not in the least unique when he is being overtly descriptive. However, when he wants to convey powerful emotion, he is quite effective. When he writes, \\"She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other. The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before him - is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-two.\\" While he is writing in this way, he is very interesting and moving. This is one of the last paragraphs in the story. The end of the book gives the reader a feeling of sadness and respect. Such feeling is achieved when Carton, with his last breath says, \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\"Even with all of it's emotion this book will not be read for another hundred years because the historical events that this book is based on will become even more remote than they are now. No one is afraid of the French Revolution. No one will care about the guillotine or the wicked Marquis. The tension in the book will not be there anymore even though Sidney Carton, as valiant as he is, cannot hold up the story, The Tale of Two Cities."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Although A Tale of Two Cities is both confusing and sometimes monotonous, it is truely a great novel. Sydney Carton ,the books necessity, is both useless, and vulgar. At the beginning of the novel while talking to his partner he is referred to as the &quot;Jackal&quot; foreshadowing his life to come tainted by his decisions made early in the novel. Although most readers finish this novel with more pros than cons, they come to a sense that they owe a great deal of credibility to Carton, as he examplifies more than meets the eye. Having established the reputation of worthless, he has a hard time proving himself to the people amoungst him. Finally in his one chance to make his life worth the while, he sacrifices himself for his friend Lucie Mannette's husband, Charles Darnay. Darnay was one of many to be captured during the era known well as the French Revolution. As they come to find out Darnay will be lead to death only escaping it with the help of Carton. During Darnay's trial early in the novel, the public comes to find that Darnay and Carton have a striking resemblance. So, seeing this as great chance to bring meaning to his life, Carton, decides to sacrafice himself for the one and only, Charles Darnay. Thus, proving his life, saving his true friend, and adding an intriguing crux to this novel. So, as you, the reader, leave this novel you part it with both feelings of admiration and hatred, creating a love hate relationship."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It always takes me a while before I really get interested in any story. Unfortunately this story took until almost the end before it really grabbed me. It may not be that bad for you, but I found some of the sentences extremely long. After reading David Copperfield I'm put off by his diction or older cliches, as long as the story is compelling. Many of his descriptive narratives were just too long and drawn out. I think there might have been some clever metaphors that I was just to lazy to think about; or as an excuse I don't know that much about that time in history. The end was full of action and suspense, I don't know if it was more disappointing that the story ended or that the first five-sixths of the book was flat.

I chose it from a list of books we had to read for school, and I'm very glad I did. True,it drags on in some parts. I was furious to discover that the esteemed Mr. Dickens wrote this story in monthly installments for a magazine,and that the more words he wrote,the more he was paid! Despite that,he is still one of the greatest writers I have ever had the honor of discovering. The book starts slowly, builds up the suspense, then starts firing one event after the other. I may not be able to analyze the plot and writing structure the way the literary critics do, but I appreciated this literature all the same.Sydney Carton is of course my favorite character,hands down. His transformation from the wine-addicted depressed young man to the noble savior is beautifully depicted, especially the eye-smarting speech he gave,or would've given according to Dickens, at the end. At last I can read A Little Princess and know what the Bastille is. At last I understand why the following words are some of the greatest in English literature:\\" It is a far,far better thing that I do, than I have ever done;it is a far,far better rest that I go to,than I have ever known.\\""},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is so heavy and dark.

With his abundant amount of paradoxes, he provided a sufficient supply of ambiguity and complexity to his intentions of writing. These contradictions are littered throughout the plot line like dropped bread crumbs with no direct trail to follow. I, personally, feel that Dickens purposely confused his readers to display the perplexity of the time period. While on occasion it was faintly puzzling to follow, through the rhetorical device of paradoxes, Charles Dickens created a story that might have been set in the past but could also be compared to any time period.Something that made A Tale of Two Cities exceptionally captivating was the author's use of an omniscient point of view. As an unidentified narrator recites the story, the audience has full access to every character's thoughts and actions. This form of writing not only adds to the complexity of the work of literature, but also presents nonstop entertainment to the reader as the story is constantly turning and changing.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed A Tale of Two Cities. The storyline is intricate and well-structured, and the humor is subtle enough to enjoy without taking away from the somber tone. The audience is brought to the front row of the French Revolution, embracing the tension that was realistically endured. A Tale of Two Cities may have been a slightly morbid and mature read, but Dickens ceases to amaze readers with his infamous style of an unforeseen circular plot."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This story gives you the chills and keeps you reading.

His books are painted with such vivid text that the reader is left with indelible impressions of the characters and scenes that move from one country to another in pursuit of the saga that engulfs them. In the process, characters are shaped, whether for good or for evil, impacting on lives of those they are closely associated with, then rippling forth and affecting those least suspected."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors.

Everything from the way Dickens places the reader right in each scene, to the development of each character, to the political and sociological issues of a country going through a revolution, to the philosophic issues of right and wrong, just and cruel, and death and the possibility of life after it, and to how each sentence is written with an unimaginable amount of thought and care, makes this a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"No problems downloading or reading on my Nexus 7.

The language was completely foreign to me, and I didn't understand a single thing in it. I never finished it.Now that I'm more mature, and am reading many of the old classics, I decided to give it a try again. The language is still a bit foreign, and I had a rough time getting into it and following it at times, but I'm glad I finally finished this book.Ostensibly, the book is about the French Revolution. But I don't think it is, really. It may be set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, but it is, at its heart, a love story. And not the soppy touchy feely romantic kind of love, either. Real love. The love of a man for his friends, the love of a father and daughter, and yes, the love of a husband and wive. This book spans decades, and is about the events unfolding simultaneously in London, England, and Paris, France (hence the Two Cities) around the time of the French Revolution.I would recommend anyone interested in history, especially Christians, to read this book, but there's something in it for everyone.Only issue is, after reading the whole of Book The Second, I still had no idea just who, or what, the Golden Thread is!

I look forward to reading my next Dickens classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"i would NOT recommend this product because it is abridged and doesn't say so on the cover. It was a big disappointment!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"We as humans make daily sacrifices. We learn to cope with wants that have not been fulfilled. The sacrifices described in Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities are the ultimate sacrifices; dying in the place of another soul. Though the book didn't appeal to me, I tip my hat to Dickens' for his superb detail to the theme of sacrifice.Sidney Carton's decision to switch places with Charles Darnay, was a superfluous one. A new respect was gained in the event of Carton coming out of his misery and giving his life meaning. Dickens' pulls out his character and brings him to life. Dickens' \\"recalls him to life\\" from a miserable nobody to a Christ-like somebody.With the exception of the first fifty, tedious pages, the novel is one that is presented very eloquently. A Tale of Two Cities is a novel which has a tendency to drag on until it reaches the very enlightening point. The excitement of the French Revolution draws the reader to keep reading. The personal stories of Lucie Manette, Dr. Manette, and other characters keep the reader anticipating more adventures.An audience of history buffs and adventure lovers would appeal to this book. History excerpts in Dickens' story, bled together with personal stories, resemble a history lesson. Chapter 13, entitled \\"Fifty-two\\", discusses the history, necessity, and horrific details of the guillotine. What ties the story together is Sidney Carton's self-sacrifice to save Darnay concluding the novel with the famous line, \\"It is a far, far better thing I do, than I have ever done. It is a far, far better rest I go to than I have ever known\\" (470).Though the novel could have been written in first person narrative, the third person point of view gives the story interest and intrigue. Critics say the story would have more life if told through first person. Others says it is a fine piece of work, do not tamper with it. However, the third person narrative lets the reader see the story in a form of viewing it through their own eyes; as opposed to somebody else's.Where some say the author style is exquisite, others object to the style being a painful experience to read. In areas Dickens lost in a smooth read, he makes up for in Victorian style language and a successful storyline. The reader may have the urge to place down the novel and never pick it up again. One the other hand, the most enjoyable moments of the book keep the reader wanting more.Dickens has a great number of weaknesses, as well as a great number of strengths. The way Dickens presents this story lingers on the palette. The reader will begin to ask himself, \\"Am I willing to lay down my life for someone else? Am I willing to make the ultimate sacrifice?\\""},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"another great read from charles dickens.still amazes me how a book written so long ago can still be so enjoyable.as with other dickens novels at times it gets a little slow but keep going its worth it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"wow, just wow. I was roughly familiar with the plot to this book before I read it, but it was fantastic nonetheless. Great insights into human nature, excellent turns of phrase, and a wonderful exploration of the human world. The end was very moving.Just one thing I got out of this book was a realisation of how and why the French Revolution was so dehumanising. First, there was a focus on inflicting pain and suffering because they had suffered. The objective was causing suffering, not justice, which is why innocence was no defence against the guillotine.Secondly, the state was God. The ultimate end was the state. Thus, it was good to condemn your family and friends to the guillotine in service to the state. People were encouraged to serve something not-human (the state) over something human (real individuals). This dehumanised the people involved. It was like a giant telescoping of society, moving so far back that all the revolutionaries could see was \\"the state\\" and \\"the revolution\\" and were blind to the individual people who really matter.I've always distrusted Dickens as dry, dull and preachy without having ever read any of his books. If they are all like this, then his way with words and insight into human nature make him a new favourite author of mine!Joshua"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"One can challenge himself and learn numerous things about the history of the French Revolution by reading A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. This novel challenges readers because in order to understand the deeper meanings of why Dickens incorporates certain symbols, allusions, and motifs, one must develop a strong analyzing ability. For example, Dickens incorporates the motif of footsteps to foreshadow the revolution; without the ability to understand this, one may not understand what occurs in the beginning of the novel and why violence arises in society. Although one may realize comprehending A Tale of Two Cities becomes difficult and tedious, learning about knowledgeable information regarding the French Revolution becomes motivating.By reading A Tale of Two Cities, one can learn a lot of information about the history of the French Revolution. One can learn from this book because Dickens depicts the state of the peasants and the aristocracy with great detail. Also, one can directly understand the hardships in the time of the Revolution and feel the misery in the people. For instance, \\"some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run our between their fingers\\" ( Dickens 32). This quotation portrays Dickens's meaningful writing.A Tale of Two Cities interests people who enjoy reading challenging and educational books. Dickens's influential writing attracts people's attention. If one reads the novel, one cannot easily lose concentration in reading. A Tale of Two Cities attracts people's attention and strengthens a reader's capability and knowledge."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"From the first lines of the novel about London and Paris to the last speech by Sydney Carton at the end the book held us in its grip. I have read Carlyle's History of the French Revolution, Dickens' main source, and find this much the superior. My wife and I read this in high school and now in our seventies appreciate it more than then, and we appreciated it then, too. Dickens' engaging style remains with the reader. A few years back we walked by the few remaining stones of the Bastille and they seemed redolent of the novel. Reading this book was more than entertainment, it was an experience."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"As a junior in high school, the set task of reading this novel was a daunting one that loomed over me from the beginning. I did not open the cover with an eager appetite to see how this story played out, to say the least. Though in doing this novel proper justice, I must say it was a lot better than I expected. It is written in old english and Dicken's style adds on to that for the worse rather than the better in terms of making it easier to understand. Simply put, it is a difficult read, though not an impossible one. The twisting plot structures make for a hard time in comprehending what is going on, though Dickens does not leave you out in the wilderness to fend for your own. Everything comes together and makes sense. The French Revolution provided a topic that Dickens exploited to its fullest potential, pulling both the oppression and the bloodshed from its proper historical context into this novel. In a few simple words...this novel can prove challenging to read and comprehend, but is an amazing story in itself."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"There are many themes in the novel \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" by Charles Dickens. Dickens' novel is a little confusing, but it does seem to have a major theme. A famous quote sums up that theme. \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope...\\"(Dickens, pg.1) I can't imagine a better a way to begin a novel. It was considered the worst of times because during that period the horrible revolutionary war in France was occurring. It was also considered good times because of the ability of human nature to overcome such a bad period to achieve heroic achievements. The heroic achievements I'm referring to deals with Sidney Carton's change of life direction during the novel. For him the novel is summed up to \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known\\"(Dickens, pg.252) From that point, however the novel gets a little less clear about which direction it is going to take. We learn quickly this novel is going to be about the French revolution. Dickens compares and contrasts the cities of London and Paris. I believe that Dickens unfairly portrays the city of Paris. He makes the city look like it is just a horrible place and makes England look like it is the place to be. Dickens is able to depict the Revolutionary France with such detail because when he was growing up he lived in poverty for a period of time. Dickens may have written the novel \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" because he might have seen the state that England was in at the time and he may have been trying to warn his fellow countrymen of the outcomes that would come of such a horrible war. In the novel Dickens continuously switches scenes from London and Paris. He switches his story from hatred and oppression to the simple concept of love and the more difficult concept of self-sacrifice. He wanted everyone to see the hatred that the revolution could bring out of people. On the other hand, he wants us know that good does rule over evil. When Dickens allows Sydney Carton to take the fall for Charles Darnay we are very clearly shown that. Through the whole novel, which at times can be unclear, Dickens will present a situation that includes dangers and take us to the edge so we believe that maybe, just maybe, that evil prevail and then quickly and cleverly drag us back to safety with his wonderful word choices. While the quote was said at the beginning of the novel and of this review it still applies anywhere you want to put it when you have Dickens describing the revolution with his novel \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\"(Dickens, pg.1)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The novel A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a, and I am being generous, very mediocre book. If you love reading great English literature filled with complicated symbols, confusing metaphors, and a somewhat hidden plot, then this is the book for you. I had to read the book for school, so my opinion of the book is already tampered with. When you are forced to read something within a certain time period and get very distinct information out of it, there is almost no plausible way that you can enjoy it as much as you would had you been reading it for pleasure. And let me tell you, I would definitely not recommend picking it up at your local book store and reading it on your own time for enjoyment. It is, on the other hand, a very well written book filled with delicate description and a deeply thought out plot. If you are into looking deep into a book to search out its true meaning, then you will enjoy Dickens's use of imagery and description through metaphors and personification. The book is quite humorous if your I.Q. test states that you are a genius. It is hard to understand, but once you get the hang of it, it can be absolutely hilarious. Had Charles Dickens not been paid by the word to write this, what seems like prolonged and everlasting book, one might be able to get more insight out of less words instead of being drawn away from the story because of the length and longevity of a single paragraph. You might say I was being like Dickens now, trying to prolong the review using as many words as possible just to make some extra cash. One difference, I am not getting paid, I just get a lousy grade for staying up late and bruising the tips of my fingers on the keyboard while using every last ounce of thought left in my brain to finish it and do a good job. Well, enough of that, back to A Tale of Two Cities. The book will teach you a lot about the French Revolution and the condition of what was going on during the time period. Dickens goes into vivid detail about the slaughtering and revolt that took place during the French Revolution. The theme of \\"what goes around comes around\\" is present in the novel and takes place in the plot. In conclusion, the book is, as I said before, mediocre. The book can be quite amusing if you understand and relish in the humor that Dickens uses. I did not like the book, but I know many people who did. It is a good read if it is your style. You may or may not get a lot out of the book or enjoy it, but it is your choice, so have at it. If you do decide to obtain it, you should pick it up at amazon.com. Lots of words, lots of meaning."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A TALE OF TWO CITIES is a surprisingly fast-paced book that feels more like a motion picture (Dickens even builds suspense by cross-cutting between two separate lines of action in one scene...er, one chapter). It has a very modern feel to it, as do most of the characters -- with the exception of its romantic leads (neither of whom turns out to be the true protagonist). It also has a lot of modern significance as, certain aspects of the human experience are, unfortunately, seemingly eternal. The book is full of memorable images (mental var.) of the horrors of the Reign of Terror, and nearly as many pertaining to the offences of the Aristocracy that brought the Terror about. The book is relatively short (by Dickens' standards) and amazingly compact in that seemingly every character and action turns out to have significance in the later chapters when all of the unanswered questions of the early chapters are tied together. I don't want to give away any secret twists of the plot by summarizing the story, but if you're not already familiar with it (or only half-familiar with it, as I was), it'll have you on the edge of your seat ...well, you get the idea."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is easily one of my favorite novels. It has overtones of Greek tragedy, but most of all it is a very Shakespearian piece of literature, as can be seen in the force of dialogue and the magnificent eloquence of the characters, as well as in dramatic tension and the vividness of situations. Of course, it is all due to Dickens' great ability to take the English language to the highest form, as well as to his skill in creating characters, in particular Sidney Carton, Mr. Jarvis Lorry, Miss Pross and the Defarges.Dickens goes back and forth between tragedy and tenderness, violence and family quietness, between the intimate and social denounce, without failing or getting lost. He is, moreover, a genius of irony, of subtle sarcasm and sense of humor, even when the story is not comical at all.Dr. Manette has spent 18 years of unjust imprisonment in the Bastille (you'll find out later why). His little daughter has been rescued by an English banker and taken to London, where she grows up. Lucie is a charming young woman, the happiness of everybody around her. One day, Mr. Lorry, the banker, breaks the news that his father has been released, and they go to Paris to bring him back, a broken man on the brink of total insanity. A couple of years later, father and daughter are called as witnesses in the trial of a young Frenchman, accused of spionage, whom they had met on the trip from Paris to London. The man is acquitted thanks to the timely intervention of a lawyer, Sidney Carton. Years pass by happily. The Frenchman, Darnay, marries Lucie, with whom also Carton is in love. Carton is the character to follow and his parts are possibly the best crafted in the book, as Dickens paints us a portrait of a gifted but weak man, a good lawyer sunk in the depths of alcoholism and lack of self-esteem. Then the French Revolution breaks out, in all its horror. Mr. Lorry and Darnay are forced to travel to Paris, the first on business and the second on a call of honor. Darnay will get trapped in the Terror on account of the noble past he had renounced, and he will be put into prison. To say more would risk spoiling parts for future readers, but rest assured tension, drama and adventure increase rapidly as Darnay's imprisonment drags on. Another set of characters worth remarking are the Defarges, husband and wife, the leaders of the Revolution in their St. Antoine quarter. She is one of the most perverted, malefic, horrible and well-crafted female bad-guys in literature. It will give you the creeps every time she appears, and for good reasons.Although this is by no means a political novel (and so it's silly to complain that \\"there are no two sides to the story\\"), Dickens shows us both the contempt and despotism of the Ancien Regime, as well as the bruteness, baseness, horror and violence of the masses set loose to take revenge, to replace an old tiranny with a new, fiercer one.Some people complain that in Dickens' novels too many coincidences occur and some characters are too good or too bad. The hell with everything, there are amazing coincidences every day in the world and some people are too bad and other too good. When it all comes down to giving us a great piece of excitement, identification with the humankind, and pure fun, so be it. This is a wonderful way to spend your time."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Quite simply a masterpiece of literature that is untouchable by even the most ignorant comments coming from an immature high schooler.

Even though I knew the ending, I couldn't help crying at the end, it was so wonderful. I feel sorry for anyone who is forced to read this great book in school and doesn't understand it.

Just because a book is long doesn't mean it's a bad story.

The story-telling is cumbersome and sometime confusing; there are large chunks of narratives about irrelevant details (such as the chapter \\"The lion and the jackal\\", it does little to advance the plot). The dialogues are pretentious and unnatural -- the characters speak with a lot of parenthesized texts. The actions of the people are also to some extent unexplained and unexplainable: why does Carton sacrifice himself to save Darnay? Because of his love for Lucie? At the end he is portrayed as some larger-than-life hero and martyr, but I find some hollowness and unbelievability in that.Dickens' contemporaries and French counterparts, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas, who also wrote a few books using the same backdrop (the French Revolution).

Its impossible to get to know the characters because their is no plot! I got more than 2/3 of the way through the book and as far as I could tell absolutly nothing was happening, but people drinking tea and talking. Then i put it down more than 2/3 done and i simply couldn't finish it because the story (if their WAS a story) was going absolutly no where! As far as i can tell this is just a bunch of words slapped on a piece of paper. For those of you who say that i'm just a immpacient teenager: i've read books that are tough to get into. Tolkein's first book in the Lord of the rings was tough to get into, but i stayed with it because i could see it was going somewhere. i got rewarded with the next to books, which were fun to read.

But Charles only made a few sporadic appearances throughout the novel.What Dickens excelled at was that he put a face on the French Revolution. Often times when you read \\"war novels,\\" the novel starts off great, but when it heads into the war section, the narrative almost stops and the peoples' lives that attracted you to the novel in the first place cease to be mentioned for 200 pages or so. That didn't happen here, thank goodness. Dickens weaved the story, of people we care about, in and out of the trials and tribulations of the French Revolution. Not only did I find it easier to deal with the gory aspects of war, but the historic information stuck with me; like how if you were caught mourning the death of prisoners who had been beheaded under the guillotine, then you too could be imprisoned and later beheaded.Madame Defarge is a great villain.One of the highlights is the showdown between Madame Defarge and Ms. Pross. \\"The vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate.\\" Great line!You do need to be patient with the prose.

Once I read this book I truly regretted never having read more books for the author. His style is simply amazing. The author introduces us to different characters one step at a time. In the beginning we don't really understand what is going on, or why a certain character is being described in detail. However, as the story progresses it quickly comes to our mind that what the author is doing is that he is weaving a masterpiece and connecting the different parts together so that what we have in the end is nothing short of a piece of art that will surely stand the test of time. The depth of the characters and the irony of the times that they live in makes this book a must read or all."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is a beautiful printed edition of a classic edition of Dickens classic book.Highly recommended for your reading pleasure.

The two cities, of course, are Paris and London, and the drama of the story centers on the terror of the French Revolution in 1789-92 when the Guillotine was put to frequent use against those judged to be enemies of the new republic. The reader, Frederick Davidson, does an excellent job of characterizing the voices in the story. The voice he uses for each character is easily identifiable in dialogue between characters, and brings out the traits Dickens built into them. The one exception, in my opinion, is the voice Mr. Davidson chose for Lucie Manette, the passive heroine of the story. Her lines in the novel are mostly insipid because she is the classic Victorian delicate, fainting beauty, and of course her first language is supposed to be French, but I found her voice and character difficult to warm up to (unlike Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, whose love for her drives much of the plot). Still, her speaking part is small, and Mr. Frederickson's virtuoso performances of Jerry Cruncher, Jarvis Lorry, Miss Pross, and Sydney Carton, not to mention the charming Defarges of Saint Antoine, render this a very small shortcoming in an otherwise clear, consistently interesting, and suspenseful performance. I listen to a lot of audio books, and for my money this one easily deserves a 5 star rating. 87 tracks plus a short credits track at the end. 14.5 hours in MP3 format.

The insightful quotes taken from this book prove that this is a timeless classic. The theme of resurrection and exciting twists to the plot up until the very end give readers a wonderful book to enjoy. What can be considered one of the highlights of the story, the vivid imagery Dickens successfully uses to develop mood, foreshadowing, and other literary devices and concepts make A Tale of Two Cities even more interesting. This deep novel takes much analysis to understand, but it is a worthwhile and important book that should be read. Charles Dickens creates a captivating story about the French Revolution in the novel A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens uses numerous literary devices including mood, foreshadowing, and imagery to create a novel that captures readers from the beginning. The dynamic characters featured in the story, including Madame Defarge and Sydney Carton, help create a unique and exciting novel for that time period.

I was expecting such when my English teacher announced the next book in our curriculum. With the memory of my attempt and failure at staying awake while viewing the movie adaptation of \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" in History class last year still fresh in my mind, I flipped to the first page of my shiny new paperback feeling like I was participating in the beginnings of a new government-authorized torture session.I was one thoroughly annoyed sophomore.Needless to say, I experienced a gigantic mental turn-around a few chapters in. I ended up adoring this book and, throughout the course of the novel, often found myself digging ferociously through my pencil case, in search of my handy-dandy Bible highlighter to mark up favorite passages.Radically different from the YA novels I devour on a regular basis, \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is probably the most beautifully written piece I have encountered so far. The lengthy list of characters is sometimes confusing, but Dickens' writing style overshadows all that. His eloquence manages to convey the insanity of the French Revolution quite well, however contradictory that may seem. Admittedly, I did feel like I was plowing through a swamp in five inch stilettos at times, but I enjoyed every second of it.\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is something I definitely would not have started on my own, without the threat of a failing grade dangling above my head.

It's even better to read after all this time. Again, Dickens' use of the English language is superb! The story, characters and plot all seemed new to me, as I had forgotten much of the story. What I had mainly forgotten was how inspirational the whole tale is. The theme of resurrection (\\"Return to Life\\") and redemption is constantly there. My favorite character this time was Jarvis Lorry of Tellson's Bank - something in his business-like attitude I really relate with. However, the ending of the story, and of Sydney Carton, is quite touching; \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known\\". It is always good to go back and read the classics; I believe they offer so much history and life. Dickens does not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens brings a reader into the midst of war, famine and corruption in his novel A Tale of Two Cities. This story is not the typical heroic rebellion of a wronged people who bring peace to their society, but a bloodthirsty revolution of a desperate, starved peasantry. The detailed imagery of the blood and death of the French Revolution draws a reader into the plot. In the midst of the chaos, Dickens portrays one family, the Manettes, as the pure and innocent contrast to this degraded society. As Dickens writes in a poem of his, \\"the pure, the bright, the beautiful...shall never die\\". In this novel, though a wronged and betrayed group of people take a passionate revenge on its enemies, Charles Dickens never fails to portray the light and hope that survives among the talent people through his subtle themes of life and redemption. From the \\"digging up of graves\\", (which is really the revival of long forgotten prisoners), to the honest \\"fishing trade\\" of Jerry Cruncher, (the digging up of dead bodies), Dickens reveals the idea of resurrection and restoration to love, light, and human companionship.The characterization Dickens creates through his descriptive imagery is what makes his book unique. Charles Darnay, husband to Lucie Manette, is accused of treachery because of a family connection that the revolutionaries despise. The sinister, miran arakelian unsuspected Madame Defarge, along with her husband Defarge, are merciless to anyone whom they declare an enemy to the revolution. The drunken, wasted Sydney Carton, beyond all hopes of redemption, is in the end brought back to a sober, purposeful life. These unforgettable characters make this tale not only about a war but also about Dickens' view of human nature.The ending of the novel deviates from the revolution itself. It is expected, yet also an abrupt cessation to what is originally a war story. It is argued that Dickens wanted the story to end not with the end of the revolution but with a thought of hope for an end to the war. To find out what the ending is, one must read the book.Miran Arakelian"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Who knew Dickens had a sense of humor and such a good take on politics.

No book reports due at my age......"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a profoundly moving novel about the French Revolution. The story takes place in both London and Paris in the years 1775-1793. The two protagonists of the novel are Charles Darnay and Sidney Carton. Charles is a French aristocrat who moved to England because of his disgust at treatment of the poor by other Aristocrats. He is honest and courageous. He is married to Lucie Manette, a French woman brought up in England. Sidney is an alcoholic lawyer who physically resembles Charles, but secretly despises him because Charles reminds him of all the successes he might have had but failed to attain. The two are friends however, because Sidney would not bear to hurt Charles as Lucie is his wife, and Sidney has a secret love of Lucie. The antagonists of the novel are Monsieur and Madame Defarge, French wine shop owners who aid in the bringing about of the French revolution and who hate Charles Darnay because he was once an aristocrat, and will stop at nothing to kill him. Other notable characters include Mr. Cruncher, a man who does odd jobs and is friends with Charles and Sidney, Dr. Manette, a French physician who is the Father of Charles' wife, and Marquis Evremonde, the rich, cruel uncle of Charles who has no regard for human life and often abuses the poor.Dickens' masterpiece exhibits external conflict, character vs. character. The characters in question are Charles and Sidney vs. the Defarges. The Defarges are so caught up with Revolutionary fever that they will stop at nothing to kill all of the Aristocrats and anyone associated with aristocrats, in this case Charles and Sidney. The crimes that Marquis Evremonde committed are enough to warrant the death of Charles in the Defarges' minds. An example of the heartlessness of Evremonde was when he was speeding down a main street of Paris in a carriage and runs over and kills a child. Instead of showing any compassion, he instructs his servants to move the child off of the road and throws a coin to the grieving parents, instructing them that he will not be so \\"generous\\" as to offer them any pay next time. This evil deed by Charles' uncle causes Monsieur and Madame Defarge to hunt anyone who bears a relation to the Evremonde family. After they kill Evremonde, the Defarges imprison one of his servants, Gabelle, who is close friends with Charles. Charles rushes to France to aid his friend, and upon his arrival he is imprisoned without being told his offense, and spends one year in prison awaiting his trial. This event shows the cruelty and hatred of the Defarges, and when his trial does come, he is saved only by the quick wit and silver tongue of Dr. Manette. Although they were foiled for the moment, the Defarges still had much in store for Charles, in which Sidney becomes more deeply involved, and of which you must read the novel to find out for yourself.Overall, the novel is very entertaining, with several unexpected plot twists and very detailed and beautiful language. I like the idea of the Defarge couple quite a bit, as at first they appear as if they are to be good characters, beginning the revolution against the cruel aristocrats. But their blood-lust and hatred led to them becoming evil, an event that often happens in the real world. I also found the character Dr. Manette to be incredibly interesting with his brilliant, yet unstable mind that came from years of suffering. I was also impressed by Dickens detailed description of the poor and their hardships. After further reading, I discovered that this was because Dickens himself had to exist by living on the streets as a child after his family was imprisoned for unpaid debts. I did dislike at times, however, the grim, grotesque and at times sentimental tone got a bit depressing at times. Another minor thing that I disliked was that it was told in a 3rd person point of view. Personally, I prefer 1st person, but that is merely my opinion. I would recommend that you read this book if you are interested in history or in 19th century literature."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"What a wonderful read!

The major characters of this book are Charles Darnay, Sydney Carton, Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, Monsieur Defarge, Madame Defarge, Marquis Evr&eacute;monde, and Gabelle.Lucie Manette is the main character of this book, and she lives in England. She has a special gift which allows her to transform people around her into a better person. She is loving, caring, and beautiful. She is wife of Charles Darnay and daughter of Doctor Manette.Charles Darnay is a French aristocrat, who has moved to England because he is ashamed of French aristocrat's behavior towards the poor. He is honest, and full of courage. He is Lucie Manette's husband, and Marquis Evr&eacute;monde's nephew.Sydney Carlton is a lawyer who fought for Charles Darnay. He loves Lucie Manette and becomes one of her better friends. He changes drastically through the story through her relationship with Lucie Manette. In the beginning, he is a selfish and alcoholic who is very careless. By the end, he turns into a person who is totally unselfish and will go to any extent to help his friends.Doctor Manette is lost father of Lucie Manette. Doctor Manette is a brilliant physician, extremely loving father, and a very kind person. He spent eighteen years in Bastille prison. By the time he got out, he had turned into a mad man. Manette transformed into a normal person with the help of his daughter.Monsieur Defarge a wine shop owner and a former servant of Doctor Manette. He took care of Doctor until Lucie came. He is a revolutionist, and has very good leadership skills. He shares a very good relationship with Doctor Manette. Madame Defarge is wife of Monsieur Defarge. She is very intelligent, sneaky, and revengeful through the story. She made a list of people who should die, which includes most of the aristocrats of France.Marquis Evr&eacute;monde is Darnay's uncle, and he is an aristocrat who shows no mercy for poor people. He is hated by his nephew and most of people in France. Gabelle is heir of Marquis. Gabelle is jailed during the France revolution.One theme that came to my mind after reading this book was that in order to achieve something must be sacrificed. In order to save lives of Dr Manette, Lucie, and Charles, Carlton had to give his life up so that the other three could live. Likewise, people of France had to take some action against the Government before they could install a new government. Another theme that I thought of was that don't give up hope too easily. When Carlton came to France with a plan to free Darnay, a character though that it would be impossible to save him but, Darnay was able to accomplish it because he was determined and never gave up hope. Likewise, when Lucie first meet her father, she wasn't sure if she would be able to change him, however her friend Jarvis Lorry gave her confidence that she can do it. In the end her father was transformed into a whole new person.There was a lot of symbolism in this book. The aristocrats of France in this book were symbolized as evil people who didn't care for anybody but themselves. They were looked upon as evil which had to be over come in order to bring a new government inform, which would make life better for all people living in Frances.Tale of Two Cities is a story about a girl by the name of Lucie Manette, a woman who has the power to transform people around her. This story takes place just before the French revolution. She lives in England. Lucie goes to France in 1789 to find out if it was true that her father (Doctor Manette) is still alive. After she got there, she found her father who had gone mad because of staying in jail for 18 years. Then Lucie determines herself to change her father into a normal person and she accomplishes it in a short amount of time. Then she returned home with her father, when she meets a guy by the name of Charles Darnay (an immigrant form Paris). Darney is on trial for treason against England, and his lawyer is Sydney Carlton and Mr. Stryver. Carlton and his partner are able to win the case for Darnay. Then, Darnay returns to Paris, where his uncle Marquis Evr&eacute;monde is waiting for him. Marquis Evr&eacute;monde is cruel aristocrat who shows no mercy for poor people. After Darnay arrives to France, he blames his uncle and the rest of the aristocrats for being very cruel to poor people. Then he returned back to England, and got the news that his uncle was dead. About one year later, Darnay asks Dr. Manette if he can marry Lucie, Darnay said he will reveal his true identity if she marries him. At the same time Carlton told Lucie he also loved her. Later on Darnay gets married to Lucie and reveals his true identity that he is a French aristocrat. This sends Dr. Manette back into madness for a week or so before he recovers and joins them at their honey moon. Then in 1789 French revolution begins and Gabelle, Marquis Evr&eacute;monde heir, is imprisoned. As soon and Darnay got the news her went to help Gabelle. However, when he got there, he was put directly in jail by revolutionaries because he was an emigrant. Then Lucie and her father come to France to save him, however he had to stay in jail for one year. Then Dr. Manette uses his influence with revolutionaries to free Darnay. However, Darnay is arrested again that night because of charges from a woman, whose parents were killed by Darnay's uncle. Then Carlton came from England with a plan to save Darnay. Carlton's plan was to go to Darnay's jail and to switch their clothes. Then Darnay would leave the jail and meet his father-in-law and wife, so that they could leave for Paris as soon as possible. Carlton was able to accomplish his plan and send them back home. Then Carlton was executed and the story ended.I like Tale of Two Cities for many reasons. I like it because this book showed that if people wish they can do anything. Like Lucie was able to change peoples lives through her love. Same way the people of France decide that they wanted to a new type of government and did whatever it took to defeat the current government. I also like it because it showed that one should never give up hope even if they are not in a very good position. Finally, I liked it because it depicted a story which was very real and unfair in many ways. Over all, this a great book to read for anybody, form young kids to old adults."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I loved the plot. But I hated the characters. Lucie, Charles, Dr. Manette, and Mini-Lucie. The hero and heroine was beautiful, perfect, wonderful, nice, talented, etc, etc. Typical Barbie Doll Love story. If Lucie was as great as Dickens wrote her out to be, she would've married Sydney. He needed her more. Instead, she went with the more conventional Charles. And how Lucie was so surprised that Madame Defarge didn't feel sorry for her and pity her, etc. Madame Defarge had to be a very evil, evil woman not to like such a wonderful Lucie, well, I'll tell you something. Lucie sickened me. She was so perfect, it was like drinking a cup of water fully saturated with sugar. And then not brushing your teeth or rinsing your mouth. That was what reading about the perfection of Lucie and Charles and Dr. Manette was like. I related to Sydney and a little of Madame Defarge, because they showed basic human emotions of revenge, low self-esteem, hate, etc. Which the main characters did not. This is what will always keep Dickens from being a great writer in my list, his obsession with perfection and his dodging of the real world with real people and real emotions. I would read this book for the sake of Sydney. He was a great character. The depth, the tortured soul, and the person that existed within."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I did not enjoy this particular audio book.

Defarge or Alexander Manette will murder Lucie...it's an historical novel. And like all classics, they became classics because they showed insight into the human nature and soul. The first two books develop the plot and help the readers to develop and love or hate the characters, through a slow pace. In the third book, Charles Dickens makes a point of looking into human nature with his world-famous magnifying glass and wraps up all the plots. The pace picks up and we figure out what loyalty is. I am absolutely positive that the only part that these foo-foo heads like was when Ms. Pross beats up Mme. Defarge."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Basically, I purchased the e-reader on sale back several months ago and anxiously downloaded my favorite classic free as part of the deal.

They share many similarities, the most obvious one being the father/father figure who languishes in jail for many years and who learns to live again through the love of a golden-haired daughter. In Les Miserables Eponine dies to save Marius' life so he and Cossette can live happily ever after. In A Tale of Two Cities Sidney Carton sacrifices himself by dying in the place of Charles Darnay for the sake of his beloved Lucie.Both books express an overwhelming sense of anger at the injustices in French society that condemned the poor to lives of misery and despair. Dickens chose to show both sides of the story and he doesn't shy away from the horrors that were inflicted on innocent men, women and children during the reign of terror. Madame Defarge is the most sinister figure in the book as she sits in the wine shop, knitting, watching and waiting. She is the embodiment of the pent up fury of the oppressed and when the Bastille is stormed she releases this fury on the world.Dickens is not known for the subtlety of his characterisation, but when we find out Madame Defarge's secret at the end she becomes at least a little human. Dickens tries to drive home the point that the people who committed atrocities against their countrymen weren't just uncivilised barbarians, but that the conditions for the bloodshed were created by the aristocracy and their total disregard for the masses.I must admit I struggled to get into this book at first and for most of the book I rated it 3.5 stars. All the coincidences become a bit much after a while, but Dickens was writing in a different era when readers expected these things. The ending pulled me right into the book and I really felt the pain of Charles as he faced what he thought was his final night in his jail cell. Even though I knew what was going to happen I found their escape from Paris very suspenseful and was glued to the page till I finished, reconfirming my faith in Charles Dickens as a master storyteller."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The language is sublime.

I had read it when I was in middle school and thought it would be fun to reread it as an adult."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This tale operates on so many levels. Most obviously, it sets up multiple levels of contrast between characters, places, philosophies and world views. These contrasting forces are not portrayed as equal. The overriding impression is one of a dark and increasingly corrupt world, or rather such a human nature inflicted on the world. Yet in various places and in various people and relationships, we find glimpses of nobility, morality and love that give hope. One of the nastiest 'villains' meets a fitting end, while others seem to prosper. Some villains seem to grow uncomfortable with the evil they unleash only to find it unmanageable. The 'good' characters' strength is not in force but in hope, morality, endurance and love. As such, this is a somewhat religious story although I wouldn't see it as an evangelistic work. Dickens does not take sides with any single socio-economic group. His heroes range from a reformed grave robber to a reformed French lord. The key is that they have all experienced a reformation of sorts, leaving behind a corrupted beginning. So this is a tale of endurance, not one of breaking free.This Kindle edition is a pleasure to read.

Characters pour forth in profusion from the inexhaustible pen of themaster of English fiction,If you haven't read this book in years pick it up again and enjoy an exciting tale. The book was written by Dickens after he had read Thomas Carlyle's \\"French Revolution\\" and many other books on the period. His research shows in a realistic rendering of what one family experienced during this terrible time. A timefor suffering and redemption; a time of cowardly traitors and also great bravery. A time ripe with all facets of the humanemotions Dickens explored so well.The preface, footnotes, illustrations and several appendices in the Penguin edition add to the reader's enjoyment."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"After I finished the first one hundred and fifty pages of Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities, I was in dismay. Never having read a novel by Charles Dickens, I was expecting much, much more. The \\"great\\" Charles Dickens is praised around the world by critics and readers alike, but by the start of A Tale of Two Cities I didn't believe it. I was inclined to quit reading, but the realization of the novel being an assignment kept me going.At the beginning, the pace of A Tale of Two Cities is monotonous. Dickens spends too much time in one scene; in one passage. Dickens lingers too long in one place. At times, Dickens overuses his marvelous ability to lag sentences on forever, and to create a full scale scene in just a paragraph, and he forgets about the reader. It is almost as if he gets caught up in his own writing, not caring for the reader. The wordiness of his sentences is his foe; yet his friend. When utilized correctly, the wordiness is more effective than any author that I have read, but when exploited in the wrong manner, excess is purely at work. Dickens chooses to ramble on in certain scenes, where, instead, he could get to the point and be finished. The excess of words and phrases hinders the reader's interest in the novel, and causes boredom and monotony during certain sections.Dickens's wordiness has much do to with the plot development. The excess of Dickens's words contributes greatly to the slow, dull story of A Tale of Two Cities at the beginning. The length of his sentences, phrases, and paragraphs ties in with the boredom of the first one hundred and fifty pages. The extra length makes one simple sentence or scene, such as the descriptions and adventures of Monsieur the Marquis, seem not interesting at all. Many characters are introduced, and much information is received; but we still gain only minor information from these occurrences and characters. The plot needs to be rejuvenated; refreshed from its tedious ways. This weak development of plot, right at the beginning, is sometimes just long enough to give readers the chance to stop. Readers may very well lose interest and abandon all hope of A Tale of Two Cities because of the storyline.Although the beginning plot of A Tale of Two Cities is lacking, in some ways the lacking beginning is made up in character development. Dickens is a master of characters. He presents the reader with certain characters who go through numerous changes and situations throughout the beginning and end of the novel. These experiences give change to and better the character in the end. \\"Idlest and most unpromising of men\\" (90), Sydney Carton, is a classic example. Carton \\"careless...and insolent\\" (81) overcomes the realization of his personality and stature from the beginning of the novel, and perpetrates the most selflessness and courageous act of our times; self sacrifice. Starting from the beginning, Dickens gives examples and experiences of Carton. This leads over to the novel's end when Carton eventually changes for the better, and commits his act of eternal bravery for Lucy Manette.Dickens's third person point of view in the novel is one of the novel's greatest strengths. Being in third person, A Tale of Two Cities can jump from scene to scene; from city to city like the blink of an eye. Third person point of view helps to create the intimate relationships of the characters such as Lucy and Darnay, Lucy and Manette, and Carton and Lucy; while it, also, gives opportunity to develop the overall plot of the French Revolution mixed into each other. Third person in Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities gives the reader an example of a relationship of people going through the hardships of the time (i.e. The French Revolution). It makes the story more personal and really hits home much harder. If Dickens had written the book in first person, there would have been no way for the book to skip back and forth between cities. There would have been no way for Dickens to go from the peaceful streets of Soho to the storming of the Bastille; from Mr. Jerry Cruncher \\"sitting on his stool in Fleetstreet\\" (159) to Saint Antoine and the Defarge's wine shop.The second half of the novel brings great changes to the previous half. The plot and style of writing pick up drastically. The story line unifies, and plays out amazingly. Dickens ties all of his characters from the beginning, that seemed to have no relevance to the story at all, into the ending. The stirring and adventurous second half really brings the novel together, and the \\"greatness\\" lost in the first one hundred and fifty pages of the novel, Dickens regains in the end. Dickens's sense of plot is like no other. He leads the reader on from chapter to chapter in the second half, and the novel becomes exhilarating. Dickens is still a little wordy in the second half, but because of the plot acceleration his prolixity is not as noticeable. Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities is certainly written by a master artist. Although slow starting off, A Tale of Two Cities turns into an enriching masterpiece that should be read by anyone who can get his hands on it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Tragedy seems to be the underlying theme in Charles Dickens's classic novel, A Tale of Two Cities. From the beginning, misfortune plagues the Mannette household, as well as the impoverished public. Even if there is happiness among the people, it is short-lived; tragedy resurfaces and causes more pain. It seems as if nothing good will ever come from the endless story. However, the true meaning of Dickens's novel, resurrection,appears toward the end of the book when the fallen discover hope for the future.The characters created by Dickens compel the reader to become infatuated in the melodramatic lives of each family. The characters are masterfully drawn out, each one representing different types of resurrection during the Revolution, and each one being the antithesis of another character in the book. For example, Sydney Carton is the general symbol of resurrection. He is, at the beginning, a wasted soul who finds comfort in wine. But after falling in love with Lucie, Carton strives to become a better man for Lucie's sake; Carton realizes \\"It is a far, farbetter thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.\\" (470) From this unselfishness, a hero is reborn through the ashes and his lessons are passed on. Lucie and Madame Defarge portray the two opposing characters. Lucie is an elegant and lovely young lady; she has \\"a short, slight pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes, and a forehead with a cingular capacity,\\" (24). She has countless friends who are completelydevoted to her; she desires many children and a beautiful family; she represents the ideal woman, wife, and mother. However, Madame Defarge is a crude, unattractive woman who chases evil; she despises children, has horrible enemies, as well as friends that do not stay loyal; she is the vengeful mother of the Revolution, sucking out all life and greedilydesiring death for the wealthy. The pair does find common ground in one respect by both representing their own social class and being the one to whom their peers look up to. Dickens, nonetheless, focuses too much on how each character is being represented. He spends excessive energy making sure each character over-emphasizes his or her message in the story. In Lucie's instance, Dickens portrays her to be the perfect woman,more fake and dreamy than realistic. Because of Dickens's analysis, though, he is able to include symbolism into the story of the Revolution.Dickens wonderfully illustrates life during the Revolution; he uses references to common subjects found throughout the time period, such as the guillotine. \\"It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best curefor headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey....It was the sign of the regeneration of the human race. It superseded the Cross,\\"(341-342). Though the focus on A Tale of Two Cities is the French Revolution, the story also suggests obstacles and possibilities that could easily be found in the Twenty-first century. Hardships of love(seen in the triangle of Lucie, Carton, and Darnay), hope for finding lost loved ones( asexperienced by Miss Pross), and the reality of being ruled by a cruel aristocracy( witnessed by the miserable peasants) are among the many plot lines seen throughout the novel, which relate to our own times.The novel evokes excitement through its bewildering stories. For instance, just as the reader thinks all hope for Darnay's life has ceased, he is found acquitted, simply because Darnay and a spectator, Carton, are \\"sufficiently like each other...thus brought into comparison,\\" (90). Again, Dickens causes fascination, this time by private affairs, as well as ruthless fighting scenes. Each person is connected through two great tragedies, love and war. The way in which Dickens entangles all the characters into one great web of sorrow is intriguing to try to comprehend. Finally, the peasants' thirst for vengeance upon the aristocracy, is one story in and ofitself; the determination of such blood-thirsty people is inconceivable, and the only way to discover what will be the outcome is to keep reading. But even respected authors have their flaws. Dickens dulls his own story by using perpetual detail, which can last for pages and does nothing for thereader but cause confusion. The story is also weakened by Dickens's tone; the rambling of useless sentences goes on for quite a while, until Dickens reaches a point where he has everyone's private affairs collide at once.But such a surprise only enthralls the reader more.Many could argue that Dickens's writing is that of a genius; but his story is simply an accuracy of the war which hides nothing, and instead generates the questions of sacrifice and love. Anyone who wants to learn more about the meaning of life will be fascinated by Dickens's well-thought out story. A Tale of Two Cities has fortunately lingered on for generations because of its gruesome reality. Dickens showed no fear bytelling the world the truth about such a disastrous and dark era. It has become a book of immortality, one that will withstand the test of time, affecting the lives of all who open its pages."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Even after many centuries, a classic novel can still be read, understood and charm a wide audience. For it teaches the reader about life and death, society and history through a magnificent story. &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, written in 1859, is one of those classics.This magnificent story begins a year before the American Independence and several years before the French Revolution. As only Dickens can, he breathes life into the most bizarre, comical and memorable characters... such as Madame Defarge, Miss Pross, Jerry Cruncher and a slew of others. But in the midst of these people, the light shines on the few characters on which the story hence revolves. About Lucie Manette who has a true and beautiful heart that affects everyone around her and her aristocratic husband Charles Darnay, an ambitious man of French blood. Dr. Manette who after surviving 18 years in jail overcomes his weakness to rescue another. The light shines strongly upon Sydney Carton... a man who doesn't seem very redeemable in the beginning but who has a heart of gold who is capable of the greatest sacrifice of all for the woman he loves. It is these people whom Dickens chose to give life to during the grim and bloody French Revolution.This novel is one of my most favorite of Dickens' novels. The hero and the heroine are rather complex and admirable characters. However, they are not necessarily the ones that win the sympathy and the heart of the reader... but suprisingly (and pleasantly) to the most unexpected of Dickens' character. On another note, the novel starts with a famous and recognizable opening line, &quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...&quot; and ends with a very memorable line, &quot;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.&quot; To which I give great credit to the novel by Mr. Dickens."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I noticed most of the reviews were written by high school students; thus, being a high school English teacher, I felt obliged to respond. I teach all seniors, and we read the book each year. Most of them, I will admit, do not like reading. I, on the other hand, feel there is no greater pastime. One argument I hear often is, &quot;It's not a good book because I can't understand it.&quot; Balderdash. I simply tell them they can't understand it because it IS a good book. The plot is, as my summary says, &quot;super-thick.&quot; But it is not Dickens' fault if the reader, whatever age, cannot pick the details. He wrote novels. And yes, they are full of exposition and detail (he did not overdo it--English teacher thinking, of course). But an intensive study of anything, especially Dickens, requires reader effort. The most unfortunate thing about A Tale of Two Cities is most people, students and adults alike, would never rush into a book store and purchase it for pleasure reading. It is, in my opinion, the greatest novel ever written. Some have said, &quot;I believe Dickens is a good writer, but I didn't like the book.&quot; Hogwash. That statement is based on popularity. I don't care for Hitler, even though he was popular. Others have said, &quot;Dickens is a great writer who has written a lot of good books; I just didn't like ATOTC.&quot; Again, hogwash. Those folks have no more read Dickens' &quot;good books,&quot; which they all are not, than the next person. I do thank all of the teachers out there who have assigned the novel. I do not thank the teachers who have simply put the novel into a student's hand and said, Read!&quot; and have offered little help. And to all the students who have given Dickens a chance, whether you liked him or no, I must extend to you a sincere, &quot;Thank You.&quot; If you like him and the novel, great. If you don't like him and the novel, make sure you know why, and don't let it be because you don't understand it or because he uses too much detail. Actually, he could stand to add detail, but that's another essay."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I started reading this book because of a suggestion from my Language Arts teacher. I was immediately taken in by the descriptive words used by Charles Dickens. You first meet Mr. Jarvis Lorry, whose &quot;credentials, entries, and memoranda are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life'&quot;, who is sent to France to retrieve a man who has been held a prisoner for 18 years. As you go on, you are shifted back and forth from England to France, and back again. You see many of the aspects of the French Revolution in the late 18th century. Now you may not listen to my advice, because of my age, but I can tell you that I am at least at a 10th grade reading level, and I can read and understand this book with great ease. This book is probably a great book for anyone in high school or over, and I wish I could rate it 6 stars!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities is considered \\"classic\\" and a \\"must read\\" by almost every high school English department. This label appears to be based on tradition, rather than the actual substance of the book. Thus, one may argue, \\"a little bit of Dickens goes a long, long way.\\"The novel is written as historical fiction, intended not only to entertain the reader but also to inform. Dickens teaches his audience about the French Revolution--the trials, the treason, the guillotine--by weaving it into the plot, and in this aspect, the novel is great. One may learn more about the Old Bailey and French guillotine in this book than in a single European History class. His descriptions are colorful and vivid, making the reader feel as though he or she is actually witnessing a particular scene as it progresses; however, it may be said that the author goes overboard with his explanations. For example, six of the eight pages in chapter nine are devoted to describing a minor character, Monseigneur the Marquis. This could be accomplished in a page and a half at most.In-depth analyses of characters and locations help illustrate the historical setting; nevertheless, the massive descriptions cause the novel to lose any intent to entertain. While some background information is necessary to the understanding of the story, the reader feels as though he or she must read through excessive paragraphs packed with tedious details in order to get to one character or event filled with depth, action, and adventure.Despite his tendency to ramble with details, Dickens creates a decent plot filled with love, war, life, and death. Though the story may drag at times, the ending neatly ties everything together, causing the reader to realize the importance of such minute details and making the time spent sifting through them worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a piece of extremely complex historical fiction set in the French Revolution. In it, Charles Darnay is captured, tried as a traitor, and then rescued before execution. Although it is a wonderful piece of literature, it should not be taken as an account of the French Revolution. Due to Dickens' background and the tone of the novel, it is probable that the book is highly biased.Charles Dickens is an English writer, writing about the French. Throughout the novel, he tends to describe the British characters much more idealistically. For example, he depicts even the servants of Dr. Manette's household as patriotic citizens towards the end of the book: \\"I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;... and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!\\" (324)Also, Charles was born to a poor family, and portrays the general aristocracy with a bitter irony and sarcasm. In the introduction of the Marquis, Charles describes the way he is served chocolate: \\"It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips.\\"(84) The careless way in which the aristocrat kills a child by running over him with his carriage in the beginning of the novel may indicate even a personal experience of the author.Despite the bias, Charles Dickens ornamented the novel with many symbols and motifs. A motif that comes again and again is that of imprisonment. Throughout the novel, someone is in prison, even after the revolution. This suggests that the revolution did not do anything to help the actual state of the country, and that France is still imprisoned in the dungeons of hate. The mob is another motif, indicating fickleness. At first, the mob is forward force, freeing the Bastille and ending aristocracy's rule, but it later evolves into a bloodthirsty killing machine bent on revenge and driven by mindless frenzy. For the sake of patriotism they may stop and cry for the sufferer's sacrifice, but once the frenzy is back, they once more become the old bloodthirsty mob. The mob is the fearsome symbol of total anarchy.The motifs and symbols are woven through the story in such a way that they are an essential coloring of the story; the majority of Dickens' style is apparent in his use of symbols, as with other famous authors. These elements enjoyably accentuate the story and determine the backdrop of irony found throughout, even if subconsciously noted.Once the initial vocabulary and verboseness block is overcome, the story is extremely engaging. When one gets caught up in the love, the passion, the irony, and the fear pouring out of the book's pages, it becomes apparent why Charles Dickens considered A Tale of Two Cities his greatest work. Bias aside, an author's goal is to transmit and make understandable a kind of emotion, and a complete mastery of that is the acme of a writer's career.Although I wouldn't recommend A Tale of Two Cities for light reading (it is a very heavy of a story with too much prevarication for the impatient), it is a good story for a patient reader with a dictionary handy."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I don't understand the point of Amazon reviews that synopsize the plot of the novel in question, sometimes at length. I see one such review in here, from a Top 500 reviewer. That's more of a book report than a review, and doesn't help people interested in this work. Nor do such reviews acknowledge the \\"neighborhood\\"--the other reviews among which they reside. It seems like they are just dropped in, with no awareness of their surroundings.Potential readers looking at these reviews to decide whether to tackle the work do not need a detailed plot description. The plot summary on the bookjacket will suffice for that. And a reader who has finished the novel doesn't need a detailed description either. The Introduction will suffice for that, if your own reading has lost some details.How then can a review in this space help someone who is interested in this book? Here are a few observations to help you decide if you want to buy and read this Penguin Classics edition:--The typeface is clear and readable. Many editions of Dickens are not--have a look at them in your local bookstore some time. You'll have enough grief working through the language without the distraction of a muddy font. At $7.00 this is a great value simply in terms of readability.--If you haven't begun the book, be prepared, as other reviewers have noted, for a slog through the first 100 or so pages. Early on the syntax and cadence of the language will be a burden to most modern readers, since you don't have the context of character or plot to hang on to, to compensate for the difficulty of the language. But stick with it and the novel will gradually open up until you reach the last third. By then the language ceases to be a problem because you're invested in the outcome.--Don't read the Introduction until you are finished reading the novel, since it gives away most of the plot. You're better off encountering it for yourself in the text.--The illustrations are great! Look at them carefully.--Once you have finished the novel and the Intro, go back through some of the early chapters. An easy second pass will help you pick up details you might have missed the first time.Four stars because Darnay and Carton are ultimately opaque, each in his own way. Since the historical setting is in effect the main character, Darnay does not rise beyond the level of noble stick figure, and Carton's motivations remain obscure to the end. The ending as others have mentioned is remarkable."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Of all novels by Charles Dickens, \\" A Tale of Two Cities\\" is the most darkly compelling one. Essentially a masterpiece wherein the revolutionary excess is portrayed in deep pathos and restrained sentimentalism, this novel transcends the boundaries demarcating the good and the evil.\\"It was the best of times, it was tha worst of times.....\\" The opening words concise the whole theme of this landmark novel and underlines what Shakespeare said long back:\\"life is a mingled yarn of good and ill\\". The melodrama centres around the French Revolution of 1789 and gives a tragic insight into the darker side of an uprising. First published in 1859 during Dickens's mature period after he carefully scrutinised Carlyle's \\"French Revolution\\", \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" is an apt comprehension of the cruel aspects of a struggle against oppression and a fight for survival. The French Revolution was indeed the inevitable and logical uprising against Louis THE FIFTEENTH and Louis THE SIXTEENTH. This the author never doubts and actually sympathasises with the revolutionists in the early chapters of his book, but changes tone when the revolutionary excesses barge in later in the novel.The novel begins in 1775 when Mr.Jarvis Lorry, a devoted employee of the Tellson's Bank in London, sends a strange message \\"Recalled to Life\\" through Jerry Cruncher to his bank. He brings Dr.Manette to life after he has been \\"buried alive for eighteen years\\". The Frenchman was an innocent captive in the Bastille in Paris, a scapegoat for witnessing the death of a molested peasant girl and her wounded brother at the hands of Marquis de St. Evremonde and his twin brother.This we understand quite later in the novel and signifies the thriller-like approach towards the whole scheme of things.The imagination of a thriller is further consolidated by the gradual unfolding of \\"Charles Evremonde, called Darney\\"-'s true identity and that of Madame Defarge's, who apparently \\"did not often make mistakes against herself\\". But the narrowing of the world into a handful of major figures gets detracted by Barsad and Solomon turning out to be the stangely family member and by Sidney Carton's sudden appearance on a distorted steet in Paris at the time when all hopes of any revival seemed to have been relinquished.This is a novel of incident of incident that than of characters and unlike in \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" where the comic nature of Pickwick, Weller and Jingle gave birth to those extremely hilarious incidents, here the circumstances hoodwink the characters and mould them into the diametrically opposites. Nowhere in the book is the metamorphosis of a character more surreal and dramatic than in the case of Sidney Carton. The drunken never to do well barrister come to no good with no charm or interest in life becomes a tragic hero out of the blue when he substituts himself in the proposition of the doomed Darney at the prion of \\"La Force\\" and saves him and his family. We're all fascinated by the sharp turnaround of the frog into a handsome prince when the princess throws him out of the window but the spiritual, moral and personal transfiguration of a man in the real world is far more sullen and enthralling.But then again,what propels a fallen soul to raise itself to an ethereal level? What else than love? This is the underlined philosophy in Dickensian works and the love for Lucy, Darney's wife, begots Carton into a resurrected man. In Lucy we deduce a fair reflection of Agnes in \\"David Copperfield\\"; her nobility, emotional sympathy for Carton and profound duty-consciousness towards her father and husband makes her the \\"gentle angel\\" really.Mr.Lorry is the unsung hero and even Miss Pross and Cruncher transpire elements of heroic proportions. What the author implies is that the tendency and urge to be a hero are always calm and placid and not frivolous or fanfaring. It is always the calm sea which beholds a tempest.Of all the characters in the novel who lay no claim to the station of herohood, Madame Defarge is the prime suspect. She carries an aura of a sinister appearance about herself as so obvious by her constant knitting and despite her act to lead the revolutionists, she loses her main motive somrewhat and takes refuge in personal revenge and so justifies her parodical end.Within the domain of the tragic,appaling and uncertain time, lies the co-domain of characters and their hopes,fears,joys,pains,holiness and the downright evilries. The two cities are Paris and London and the scene shifts from one o the other in a story of brutality, repression, oppression, hatred and revenge on one hand and idealism,love,transmutation and self-sacrifice on the other. Charles Darney had no reason to have his life so abjectly mortified, no crime to be taken on trial for and no reason to die. Sidney Carton too had no reason to abnegate himself and Dr.Manette didn't deserve to be chased by the shadows of the past. Yet the innocents would forever suffer and that's the tragedy of this world.\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" depicts, amongst other things, the unhumane misery confronted by the poor lot in our society. Hungry and thirsty people running \\"to the spot\\" in the suburb of St. Antoine when a large cask of wine lay 'shattered like a walnut-shell\\" could never have been pictored so ruthlessly and subtlely by any other hand. Sentimentality is idiocratically restrained by Dickens when Carton is on the verge of death. Carton then transfigures to an epitome of calmness as to die \\"is a far,far better thing\\" to do. Carton lents us hope of love and honour and Emily Dickension called hope \\"that thing with feathers\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT,BANGALORE,INDIA"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read this book in 8th grade(two years ago) for a report in English class.

In ninth grade other classes had to read it and hated it, but my class read Great Expectations instead. When I was sixteen I read it on my own time, and I loved it. I don't know why other reviewers get so hung up on the language. That's just how people wrote back then. It's a great story, especially if you like French history.

This was the best Dickens book that I have read, with the exception of Great Expectations. The characters were different than those in any of his other novels. This book takes place in the late 18th century around the time of the French Revolution. A Tale of Two Cities evolves around this event. All of the characters, even the ones that appear unimportant at the beginning, play a role in the climax of this book.

Never the less tthis book does manage to entertain, but it is little else. The most interesting parts deal with the historical back ground of the novel.

Thanks to Mr. Dickens, I've had my fill of reading such fictional accounts that may very well have done justice to capture the unbridled hate and chaos that was the French Revolution and subsequent \\"Terror\\". Through the protagonist(s?) and auxiliary players, Dickens has conveyed the entire spectrum of human emotion and capacity for reason. While some characters did seem relentless in their rather unrelenting vulnerability, hatred, or haplessness, the metamorphosis of some characters through their experiences in jail, despair, and euphoria tempered by the reality of the revolutionary machine seemed to add enough complexity to elicit admiration of the personal growth and redemption of these key players in the novel.Certain parts are melodramatic, to be certain.

I'd get a few pages in and my eyelids would head south. Or one of my friends would come over. Then I'd pick up the Cliff notes which was even MORE boring.Looking back, I don't think the teachers or whoever developed the reading curriculum knew what they were doing. After all, I have a PASSIONATE love of books now, and these people simply turned me off completely to reading.But anyway, despite the precocious braggadocio of several Tween reviewers here, this isn't a \\"beginner's\\" book for several important reasons. Most importantly the language is dated and it takes lots of extra work and rereading of passages to get the gist of them. Secondly, the narrative can be plodding with philosophical, historical, geographical, botanical and meteorological expatiations that could zap the attention span of any reader, much less one with raging hormones and skateboards to ride.But now that I've read the book on my own terms I can say unequivocally, that it's a masterpiece. From the amazing characters, the exciting pace of the action, the weaving of story threads, the suspense, the horror, the surprise twists and turns, and the great humor, Dickens leaves no doubt that he is one of the greatest storytellers in history. The way he captures the atmosphere, mannerisms, sights, smells, emotions, indulgences and despairs of the people and places in the book is nothing short of remarkable, even miraculous. It's hard to pick up another book after a great one by Dickens."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is Charles Dickens' master work. It explores powerful issues of class, as played out against the backdrop of the French Revolution. Certain of the Dickens' characters in this novel have become emblematic of the times, such as Madam DeFarge, the probably insane working class woman who knits and cackles as she screams for others to be executed by guillotine. And Sydney Carton, the drunken wastrel whose bravery and self-sacrifice crown the story.This is a must-read classic. The question is, in what edition should you read it? This \\"Enriched Classics\\" version is excellent, especially for first-time readers of the novel. In addition to a quality text, the edition includes a number of helpful features, such as an historic timeline, analyses of the novel by contemporary critics and a discussion of key plot points and themes to help readers understand the novel's context. Overall, an excellent edition of a towering classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I will never, the rest of my life forget these two sentences. \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness....\\" and at closing \\"It is a far, far, better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known.\\"Wow, this is not your usual Dickens. No quirky characters with strange names and laugh out loud moments, just a darn good story -- the story of two cities, London and Paris. It is difficult to put the plot into words, but when the book begins you are in London at the time of the American revolution and spies (or suspected spies) abound, and the story eventually switches to France prior to and during the French revolution.Dickens does a marvelous job (as always) of building his story one step at a time and slowly peeling back the layers one at a time. This is not a put down and pick it up a week later kind of a book, it is very intense and complicated and you have to pay close attention. I was just floored at how he sucked me in with his descriptions of the mobs, terror and the madness of the revolution leading you to a nail biting finish. I admit to holding my breath during those last few pages!Highly recommended, and well worth the time to discover (or rediscover) an old classic."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is a distinguished piece of literature; that for more than one hundred years has brought readers the haunting and grotesque history of the French Revolution. Charles Dickens balanced view of the populace during the French Revolution is illustrated through all the struggles of impoverished people and the abuses of the ruling class.Charles Dickens characters, through many coincidences help keep the story moving and balanced. The author makes the main characters not only middle class but also divided on the conflicts of the revolution. Lucie and Charles Darnay, a happily married couple find themselves divided on the issues because of family back grounds. Lucie's father spent over a decade imprisoned by the Marquise and his brother; Coincidentally the plot revels that these scoundrels are Darney's father and uncle. Another convenient coincident is that the Defarges, leaders of the French Revelation, are so closely tied to Dr. Manette and the Marquise as to kill to see their side revenged, revenge for their own family and friends. That another happening is Defarges find the letter written years before when Doctor Mannet was a prisoner and use it to condemn not only Charles Darnay but also Lucie, their little daughter, and Doctor Manette himself. Another example of the possibly overly abundant Coincidences is when Sydney Carton, the wretch of a man who manages to saved Charles Darney, in the first trial by having a similar appearance will be the only person with the ability to save him in the conclusion.Though the many coincidences give the story a contrived feel, the book is worthy of it's renowned respect and the readers time. The book does drag especially in the beginning, and though he may lose the interest of the reader in moments while using many words for his detailed descriptions, the story line is sound, and every step a character makes adds to the plot. For instance the english mob seen around Roger Cly's funeral, and the fact he was not dead. The book depicts many aspects of life, from the Monseigneur, who has several people just to serve him chocolate, to the starving poor people who are forced to eat grass and fight over drops of muddy wine. Throughout the book Charles Dickens, through the best and worst in the book manages to write art into every page."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"My first experience with Dickens was in 9th grade, when I was forced to read Great Expectations. I remember the experience as painful and ardous. But after reading A Tale of Two Cities, I realize that my opinion must have been influenced by excessive pouting. There is simply no way that a man who could write something one the level of A Tale of Two Cities could write something tedious. When people say that everything important can be found in this novel, they are not exagerrating. Love, tyranny, triumph over oppresion, the futility of the mob, and, most importantly, self-sacrafice. This is one of the greatest novels ever written, I don't hesitate to say so. Dickens has a singular ability to present an enveloping view of all humanity, all it's triumphs, struggles, and failings, and yet he can still produce characters who don't get lost in the sweep of the plot. In addition to this, Dickens (along with many others, such as Hugo, Dostoeysky, and Tolstoy) marks the transition from the &quot;listing&quot; style of writing (simple list of events written down) to the truly artistic novel. You'll find yourself rolling his words over your tounge, in awe of their brilliance. For your own sake, read it, read it again, and never forget it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I am a thirteen-year-old girl who absolutely loves to read. I bought this book initially to be something that I could read time and time again because I had heard of it being a classic. In the beginning, this novel was hard to follow, and I found myself rereading passages to try and understand the meaning more clearly. However, the beautiful language kept me going. As the plot started coming together more distinctivly, I could not put the book down. Every moment I absorbed this piece of literature was an adventure. It made me laugh and cry and cheer for the heroes and heroines and silently jeer the enemies. It made it possible for me to understand a little bit just how harsh and dangerous the feelings during the French Revolution were. I enjoy reading other classics although some, especially ones written during this time period, seem to be depressing as if nothing good ever really comes. The language and plot of such books are no less astonishing, but they seem to be lacking something. This book gives you no such feeling. It is truly one to be enjoyed by all age groups."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The back cover does not match \\"look inside\\" picture - I received a condensed version of Dickens' story consisting only of train/mistress story. Last line: \\"His affair with Nellly eventually cost his his marriage.\\" Their typos, not mine.Title heading on every page inside reads \\"A Tail of Two Cities.\\" Once again, their mistake (spelling), not mine.So what else is wrong with this printing? I don't know this book well enough to risk finding out...Also there is no publishing page in the book - is this a legal copy?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"One of the few books that has remained in my top five favorites since the first reading. As a teen, the simple adventure tale roped me in. In my early thirties, the principled sacrifices of the host of noble characters in the face of the evils of revolutionary excess sang out to an idealistic mind. Now, more mature yet, the familial interactions engaged me in still another way. Historicaly set leading up to, through, and beyond the French Revolution it is Dickens's best crafted and most meaningful work. Required reading for everyone and a likely re-read for most. Five stars - without question."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I read A Tale of Two Cities for school recently, and I have yet to regret it. This beautiful tale is writtin in a language that causes you to think and figure things out. As soon as you figure out how to understand it, it paints both a beautiful and terrible picture of the time of the French Revolution. A Tale of Two Cities has everything that makes a good book: love, sacrifice, sadness, anger, revenge,suspense(sp?),and a great ending. I definitly intend on reading more books by Dickens."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The 'Tale of Two Cities' is actually a tale of two men; the honorable yet naive Charles Darnay; born of a hated aristocratic blood and sworn to protect the people whom his family oppressed, and the dissolute and careless Sydney Carton, who although has lost his passion for living, can still evoke a desperate and beautiful love for the girl that Darnay is destined to marry. The heartache and happiness in their lives are set against an era in which people are seperated by finance; and united in pride. The one thing that disturbed me about this otherwise psycological and provoking piece was the one dimensional portrayal of Lucy Manette. Carton is willing to sacrifice at any degee to simply uphold her happiness, although she is written up as nothing more than a pretty face who is neither his intellectual match nor manifests the same passion that he once did for living. She speaks but a few words, naturally compassionate as was expected of young ladies in her day. I find it a disgusting 'image' of the ideal Vistorian woman; one who neither thinks nor possesses individualism. I'm not promoting feminism; I just can't understand why she was the favorite heroine."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is incredible. I read it last year (in eighth grade), and I love it. I love Charles Dickens' language and style. Whoever is reading this may have little or no respect for my opinions, thinking that I am to young to comprehend the greatness of the plot and language, and I admit that I probably do not completely appreciate this classic piece of literature. I do read above a 12th grade level, although that doesn't count for a whole lot. It took me a while to get into this book. In fact, I dreaded reading it for a long time. But nearer to the end, I was drawn in by the poignant figure of a jackal, Sydney Carton. In his story I became enthralled with this book, especially his pitiful life. After I read and cried at Carton's transformation from an ignoble jackal to the noblest of persons, I was able to look back over the parts of the book that I had not appreciated, and realize how truly awesome they are. I learned to appreciate all of the characters, from Lucy Manette to Madame Defarge. I also was affected by all of the symbolism involved with both the French Revolution, and the nature of sinful man, no matter what the time or place. My pitiful review could never do justice to this great book, please don't be discouraged by my inability."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The more Dickens I read, the more impressed I become at his skill as a writer. No matter the form, be it short, long, or a monolith like some of his best works, Dickens excels at changing his style of characterization and plot to fit whatever mode he writes in. &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is one of his shorter novels, and he manages to make the most of out of the allotted space. The compression of the narrative sacrifices Dickens's accustomed character development for plot and overall effect, but what we get is still phenomenal.&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; begins in 1775, with Mr. Lorry, a respectable London banker, meeting Lucie Manette in Paris, where they recover Lucie's father, a doctor, and mentally enfeebled by an unjust and prolonged imprisonment in the Bastille. This assemblage, on their journey back to England, meets Charles Darnay, an immigrant to England from France who makes frequent trips between London and Paris. Upon their return to England, Darnay finds himself on trial for spying for France and in league with American revolutionaries. His attorney, Stryver, and Stryver's obviously intelligent, if morally corrupt and debauched, assistant, Sydney Carton, manage to get Darnay exonerated of the charges against him. Darnay, a self-exiled former French aristocrat, finds himself compelled to return to France in the wake of the French Revolution, drawing all those around him into a dangerous scene.Dickens portrays the French Revolution simplistically, but powerfully, as a case of downtrodden peasants exacting a harsh revenge against an uncaring aristocratic, even feudal, system. The Defarge's, a wine merchant and his wife, represent the interests of the lower classes, clouded by hatred after generations of misuse. Darnay, affiliated by birth with the French aristocracy, is torn between sympathy for his native country in its suffering, and his desire to be free of his past.&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is a novel driven by historical circumstance and plot, much like the works of Sir Walter Scott, wherein the characters themselves assert less agency, finding themselves forced to deal with the tide of epic events. Richard Maxwell's introduction to this newest Penguin edition does a good job outlining the themes of doubling and literary influence that Dickens works with. One specific influence I discerned in reading &quot;A Tale&quot; that Maxwell doesn't metion is Edmund Burke's &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France,&quot; which if nothing else, gives the feeling that the rampant violence of the early revolution and the later Reign of Terror has brought about an irreversible change in human nature. While Dickens remains cautiously optimistic throughout the novel that France can recover, the tone of the novel speaks to the regression of humanity into a more feral, primal state, rather than advertise any real hope for its enlightened progress.Despite the supposed dichotomy between England and France in the novel, Dickens seems to suggest throughout that there are no real differences, due to the way that human nature is consistently portrayed. With England in between two revolutions, American and French, Lucie's sensitivity early in the novel to hearing the &quot;echoing&quot; footsteps of unseen multitudes indicates a palpable fear that the &quot;idyllic&quot; or &quot;pastoral&quot; England he tries to portray is not exempt from the social discontent of America or France. In this light, stolid English characters like Miss Pross, Jerry Cruncher, and Jarvis Lorry appear to almost overcompensate in their loyalty to British royalty. In a novel that deals with death, religion, mental illness, I could go on and on for a week, but I won't. One of those novels whose famous first and last lines are fixed in the minds of people who've never even read it, &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; demands to be read and admired."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Please note that this is not the original Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens - it is RETOLD by Lucinda Dickens Hawksley. English teachers will not accept this version for use in their classes. The Amazon photo and description is misleading. Now I get to buy the original version - hopefully it gets here before the class starts to read it. Anyone want to purchase a new RETOLD version of A Tale of Two Cities?"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The period from 1775 - the outbreak of the American Revolution - to 1789 - the storming of the Bastille - is the turbulent setting of this uncharacteristic Dickens novel. It is his only novel that lacks comic relief, is one of only two that are not set in nineteenth-century England and is also unusual in lacking a primary central character. London and Paris are the real protagonists in this tale, much as the cathedral was the 'hero' of Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris. Dickens was writing at a time of great turmoil in his personal life, having just separated from his wife, and no doubt the revolutionary theme was in tune with his mental state.The result is a complex, involving plot with some of the best narrative writing to be found anywhere, and the recreation of revolutionary Paris is very convincing. The device of having two characters that look identical may seem hackneyed to modern readers, but it is here employed with greater plausibility than in Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson or Collins's The Woman in White.Dickens was inspired to write this story by reading Carlyle's newly published history of the French Revolution. Those events and their aftermath stood in relation to their time much as World Wars I and II do to ours, that is, fading from living memory into history, yet their legacy still very much with us. In many nineteenth-century novels, especially Russian and British works, you get a sense of unease among the aristocracy that the revolution will spread to their own back yard. In the case of Russia, of course, it eventually did.I have often recommended A Tale of Two Cities as a good introduction to Dickens for younger readers. This is based on my own experiences, because it was a set book in my English Literature class when I was 15 and I remember thoroughly enjoying it. Yes, it is challenging, with its somewhat archaic language and its slow development, but you cannot progress to an enjoyment of great literature without being challenged."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was first introduced to this book when I was 14 years old in my 8th grade English class. I found it utterly overwhelming; in its cast, its plotlines, its settings, its themes and most of all, in the intricate web the various relationships create. I only understood three things about this book. First, the two cities are London and Paris. Second, France was convulsing itself with the French Revolution while England was undergoing changes that would prepare it to enter the Industrial Revolution. Third, English in Dickens' time did not resemble English at the end of the 20th century, but somehow seemed similar to the English used in Hollywood epic movies from the 1950s and 1960s like Spartacus, Ben-hur, the Ten Commandments, Cleopatra, etc...Years later, I picked up this book and reread it. I considered this a labor, not of love, but of duty. This book is so famous and used so often in English literature classes that I felt I had to read it again for a deeper understanding. What I got from this book a 2nd time around is a profoundly subtle yet accurate sociological and psychological study of what happens to a society and a community that is built on shaky foundations. Specifically, France was an aristocracy where a tiny minority owned all the land. The rest of society was organized into tiers that varied in their opportunities of becoming landowners. Because of this pyramid structure, most of the people hewed to the social order knowing that yes they get crapped on by those above them, but there's always somebody below them to take advantage of.Eventually this social Ponzi scheme comes to a screeching halt with the French Revolution. Enough people have had enough that they decide to start over. In the process a lot of people get killed and a lot of property changes hands. So woven into this story of a society's collapse are individual tales of woe, revenge, sacrifice, retribution, love and lust. Some are wrongly imprisoned or executed, while others willingly trade places to free those who have been marked for punishment. Families are torn asunder, and friendships are made and betrayed.Overall, this book is a classic; though not appropriate for anyone not in their mid-teens yet. Its careful depiction of a society warrants its reading for those interested in 18th century Western history. But it should be read with notes and study guides for its depth and complexity can easily lose the interest and focus of many readers."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I like all of Dicken's work because of his ability to bring a place and period to life as well as his gift for creating round characters that seem like real people you can reach out and touch. This novel certainly represents these qualities, but has a dark quality with no type of comic relief. It is intense and it captures the psychological and emotional climate of the the French revolution in a visceral way.This novel which parallels the rise of the French revolution, compares and contrasts life in two cities Paris and London. It also develops a very intricate plot that is difficult to follow if one does not read steadily. In other words, it's not a light plot that you can set down for a few days and pick back up. On the other hand, it's extremely engaging and you won't want to put it down.When I read it, I actually bought the Cliff's notes because I needed to set the book down for a few days at a time. When I picked it up again, I found the Cliff's notes useful to help me engage again without a lot of looking back through the book for all the twists and turns in the plot and lives of the characters.This is a great novel in every respect, but it is not a happy one. It captures the harsh reality of the French Revolution in deep way. If you are studying the French Revolution, I would say it's a must read to truly get the spirit of what was going on. I don't believe history books can do it justice, you need the inside view which this provides.Lastly, if you are simply enjoy a good story, you will like this. Don't expect a \\"everyone lived happily ever\\" type ending, however. This is heavy stuff, almost in the spirit of a Russian existentialist novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 9th grade Honors english class, and I have to say that I loved it! It was terribly boring at first--very hard reading! And Dickens IS VERY wordy; or, as my English teacher says, he likes to make his point and than slap you in the face with it several times until you get the point! Aside from that however, I really enjoyed the story. I laughed with my friends over the mini battle between Madame Defarge and Miss Pross, and cried with them at Sydney Carton's courage(he made Charles Darnay look meaningless). Although this classic story is by far one of the best I've ever read (Black Beauty is THE best), I don't think I could have enjoyed it nearly as much without my wonderful English teacher explaining every &quot;difficult&quot; section-- and pointing out the humor that Dickens uses, and which many overlook.

Charles Dickens, in this book more than any of his others, twists and sews the plot in circles, keeping the reader in suspense and a state of unknowing--all while the tension continues to build to a climax.This is a story of so many topics. While the simple poor find themselves in a revolution attempting to oust the aristocracy for their wealth and luxury in a time of so little, Dickens focuses on the struggle of one man and his beloved friends trying to stay alive. And in their attempt, tales of utter hatred and cruelty take place at the hands of both sides of the Revolution, with the plot stuck between the two. Forgiveness, sacrifice, devotion....the novel strikes upon so many human emotions.And the ending--the ending you will never forget. It will impact and inspire you. Dickens has a beautiful style of writing for audiences. Reading the words at face value tells a terrific story. But Dickens always has a second or third meaning to them all.

The scene of our book is the French Revolution. It is a time in history when the french peasants, horrifically treated by the nobility, revolted and caused what is known as 'the terrors'. It is a time when people can be accused in secret, tried summarily, and then tortured and beheaded. Many, many people were beheaded on a daily basis, sixty, or more, at a time.A Tale of Two Cities takes this story up by beginning with the story of Dr. Manette, who has spent fifteen years as a secret prisoner in a tower of the Bastille. He is rescued by an old servant, Monsieur Defarge, who turns him over to his daughter Lucie. Lucie, who has always thought her father dead, takes care of her mentally damaged father and helps restore him to his health and sanity.We also meet Charles Darnay, who Lucie eventually comes to love and marry. Turns out, unfortunately, that Charles is actually living in England under and assumed name, because he is really a french nobleman, much hated in his mother country. When Charles is called back to Paris to clear the name of an old servant he is imprisoned. Much of the story is then spent in the effort to get Charles out of prison, and his family safely out of Paris.The story is too complicated and wonderfully intricate to describe in full here. There are many other characters which are all important. For those who loves suspence, A Tale of Two Cities holds many surprises and will keep you wondering the entire time. There are loves unrequitted, acts of horror, deep sadnesses, and acts of perfect heroism. This story will bring tears to your eyes.As a piece of literature, A Tale of Two Cities is unsurpassed. The writing is beautiful! This book begins and ends with two of the most famous lines in all of literature. The words are truely poetic. The prose is full, deep, and perfectly moody. Dickens does an excellent job of painting not just the scenes for us, but the feel of the time. He makes you experience the weight of the drudgery the peasants experienced, the horror of the terrors, the grief of the mourner, and the triumph of the human spirit. Read this book, you cannot be disappointed."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was forced to read this book in accelerated english during my freshman year of high school and I hated it with every fibber of my being.

I would recommend this book to more advanced readers because the story is written in old english so parts of it are more or less impossible to read (seriously... the first paragraph of the story is one sentence!) This novel details the lives of the nobles and peasants in both England and France in the time leading up to the French revolution.

It's my first Dickens experience and I'm enjoying it immensely. The typesetting leaves something to be desired though.

The story has a bit of a slow start, but once Dickens gets the setting established he runs with the story until the end."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cites by author Charles Dickens truly delivers a classic and timeless novel. Based during the French Revolution Dickens intertwines historical events with well-developed character storylines. He creates a perception of reality and suspense throughout the entire novel. This novel encompasses the purity of innocence in characters as well as the adamant characteristics one must encompass in order to fight for purpose and redemption. Dickens embodies an author who knows how to write a cohesive and exceptional story filled with compelling characters left and right, a unique writing style and riveting storylines.Charles Dickens produces quite a range of characters such as Madame Defarge a true twist in the story who inevitably leads The Storming of the Bastille. Dickens, establishes Madame Defarge as ruthless, radical and an undeniable thrill to the story. Dickens also creates the most prominently praised character Sydney Carton. At first seen as an undeveloped, insignificant character, Sydney Carton later develops as the most relatable and most real character to the storyline. Charles Dickens draws little emphasis to Carton for most of the novel, but then uses his famous writing skills to finish the novel with a remarkable twist, proving Sydney Carton as one of the most dynamic characters of the book throughout. In this novel Charles Dickens creates strong influential characters to the plot and storyline that create a truly remarkable and relatable story.Dickens establishes his unique writing style from the beginning of the novel, which may leave an inexperienced reader flustered and unaware, but when thoroughly taking time to understand Dickens' work the reader can see the advanced flow of ideas, the details to the characters, the undeniable use of imagery and the ending that stands as truly unforgettable. To an inexperienced reader, this book exists as dry and almost confusing, but when continuing to read, Dickens clear qualities of an experienced writer really show through. This stands indeed as a hard read to a mere high-school freshman as well as any advocate unaware of fine literary techniques and devices. With much persistence and deliberate evaluation of the text at hand it becomes easier to understand the well-deserved praise this novel receives through all these years. Every page exists with thoughtful construction and well-written text.A Tale of Two Cities in its entirety truly presents itself as a spectacular and flawlessly developed novel that can easily acclaims itself as a must-read book that can never put itself down. Dickens creates emotion, tone and details that truly give the reader a connection to the characters and storyline. This story intertwines two plots of the uprising of oppressed peasantry to a remarkable love story of a character deemed static for most of the novel. This novel encompasses true literature without the irrelevant non-sense usually put in. Dickens definitely creates a memorable, and timeless piece for many generations to come."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities revolves around the French Revolution and the struggles of the peasantry and nobles. The novel begins slow and descriptive to introduce the characters, but soon enough gains speed to tell a story of a raging, bloody war. A silent Madame Defarge always shown to be knitting becomes vengeful and bloodthirsty in her quest for justice. A drunken and worthless Sydney Carton pours out his sorrows and regrets but in the end, becomes the true hero.With detailed perspectives of all sides of the war, Dickens depicts the thoughts of Madame Defarge as the merciless peasantry, Lucie and Darnay as the pure goodness in people, Dr. Manette as the hope even after tragedy, the Marquis as the uncaring aristocrats, and Carton as the lover who dies for the one he loves.Dickens weaves the story with imagery and foreshadowing that sustains the dark and heavy mood. His precise word choice portrays the true feelings of the characters. Just before Carton gives up his life he says \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known\\". He shows the value of sacrifice and gives meaning to Carton's life as he becomes a martyr for the people. And when he portrays his desires for what he perceives will be after the war as \\"a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their triumphs and defeats\\" he shows the potential for the restoration of peace and order.Dickens creates themes of resurrection and second chances, and leaves the reader with a feeling of satisfaction at the end. He possesses an ability to paint the purest picture of the toils and struggles of the French Revolution. This is a must read for all and is truly a classic to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Never mind how pretentious that sounds, because in this case it really is true. The dark deep foundations that are laid in the prelude ('Recalled to Life') are sewn together into a majestic tapestry in the second book ('The Golden Thread') and produce a fury of swirling currents in the panoramic last book ('The Track of a Storm') that culminates with a profoundly satisfying d&eacute;nouement.There are no wasted words or baroque passages in A Tale of Two Cities. Every word is written for a purpose, and that purpose is profound. Nothing could exceed the brilliance of its execution, which includes among many very modern devices a completely convincing novella ('The Substance of the Shadow') near the end that turns out to be the prismatic centerpiece of the human drama that grips you to the last sentence of the entire novel.Dickens proves himself to be a supreme dramatist in this work. How many examples of classic literature actually succeed in not releasing their grip on the reader till the final sentence has been read? This is one of a select few in which the dramatic tension intensifies to the very end.Don't be put off by the seriousness of this novel. To be blunt, those who say this book is not full of comedic characters and situations could not have read it. May I suggest a great audiobook reading of this novel, John Lee's, if it feels too weighty to embark upon this classic alone."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Like many great literature in history, A Tale clothes itself in multiple layers of meanings and the story can be enjoyed on various level depending on the age of the reader. On the most superficial level, it is an intimate story of kinship and love with the tumultuous backdrop of French Revolution. Lucie reunites with her long-lost father (Doctor Manette) who has suffered years of political imprisonment in the Bastille. With Lucie's loving care, Doctor Manette struggles to maintain his sanity which is otherwise reflected by his obsessive shoe-making activities. During this time, Lucie is met and pursued by two suitors - Charles Darnay who is an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton who is a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer. As the story progresses, Lucie marries Darnay and war breaks out in France. Darnay is arrested for his acrostic association. Doctor Manette learns to let go of his fear and irrational rage towards his prosecutors through helping Darnay. But it is Sydney Carton who makes the ultimate sacrifice in the name of justice and his undying love for Lucie.Of course, Dickens' stories are never to be taken lightly at its face value. There are always deep and even deeper implications, which makes his books so much more intriguing. The most important implication of this book is the French Revolution. Unlike other books from the genre of historical fiction, Dickens used only a handful of characters and successfully delivered the epic movement of history and portrayed the clash of classes by microscopically examining the relations between Manette, Darnay and the Defarges. There is strong conflict between the lowly working-class such as the Defarges and Darnay who is crowned as an aristocrat only by birth but would rather earns an honest and modest life by laboring for it. Then, there is Manette. Caught between two clashing forces, his unforgettable past gives him the urge to hate Darnay and the likes of him, yet Darnay's marriage with his daughter represses him from exposing his inner feeling. Manette's internal struggle and fragility is seen everywhere in the book and his dependence on his daughter Lucie is somewhat disturbing to me.The Defarges are the central characters who represent the roaring mass that overrun the Bastille. At the end of the story, readers will discover the Defarges have ulterior motive for uprising and for relentlessly trapping Darnay. I don't want to give away too much but it does have a hollywood-ish dramatic effect where everyone turns out to know everyone in the end.Readers may wonder why Dickens chose to focus on two cities rather than just one. The answer becomes quite obvious as we move onto later chapters. To Docotor Manette and Lucie, London is a safe haven where they are able to live at peace and with abundant joy. Paris, however, is a city of turmoil. With each trip they make to Paris, they lose more and more control over their lives. Without London to contrast Paris in the story, it is hard to show how much damage the war has caused.This book is different, yet I wouldn't consider this book a historical fiction more than a general fiction. As much as this book is different from his other master pieces such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations (which are both my favorite), Dickens' writing still focused on character development and the relationships between them, as well as the contrast between classes.If you ever complained about Dickens' writing style to be lengthy and full of descriptions, this book actually is a lot of lighter on the wordy description and uses more of dialogues to lead the story, which means that Dickens is trying to fade out his voice in the story and allow the readers to perceive the characters with more imaginations.Regardless if you are a Dickens' fan or not, I suggest you pick up and read one of his books, if not this one, any other one will be just as good. To me, Dickens' books are timeless and I like how most of his characters have a sense of purity and goodness in them than are hard to find in most books."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"The Dickens volumes published by Duckworth Press and based on the classic Nonesuch editions of his books are great bargains. They're big, with sewn bindings and include the original illustrations for the books from Dickens's time. In some volumes, the text isn't printed as crisply as one would like -- my copy of \\"A Tale Of Two Cities\\" had that problem -- but all in all these are superb reading editions, which you will appreciate all the more if you've ever tried to get through one of Dickens's books in a paperback edition with tiny print.There are better modern reproductions of the Nonesuch editions -- such as those of the Folio Society -- but they are very pricey. For the cost, these Duckworth versions are hard to beat."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities is arguably Dickens' greatest work. It is epic in scope, loving in detail and haunting in its imagery.The concept is instantly accessible; nowadays there are dozens of movies and hundreds of books that come out every year where someone's story is told \\"against the backdrop of (Insert Your Choice of Civil Strife Here).\\" A Tale of Two Cities neatly fits into this genre, though you could argue that it created this genre and you wouldn't be overstepping things too much.As it is, we follow a series of characters back and forth across the channel between England and France during the years leading up to and including the French Revolution. There are those who would be turned off by such a plot, imagining dusty old rooms and stuffy language, and that would be a shame. Barring the fact that Dickens wrote over a hundred years ago the story is shockingly fresh and action packed. You have intrigue and covert operations and underworld organizations and rape and murder and grave robbing and family revelations and really it's quite the roller coaster ride which, for the most part, sticks to the world of the street instead of the drawing room.That being said, it is Dickens and Dickens got paid by the word, so things can seem a bit overly descriptive at times. On the other hand, it is Dickens and he is a master storyteller, so any number of things I was rolling my eyes at in early chapters came, in later chapters, to be of absolute importance, making me feel sheepish for questioning their lengthy descriptions earlier.Likewise, at first it seems like Dickens is just introducing characters for the sake of introducing characters, but every one of them comes into their own at some point to push the story forward into its perfect conclusion.Give this book a read, don't be scared off because it's Dickens, don't be scared off because its old, don't be scared off because it deals with history. Get over those things and you'll be sucked into one of the best tales ever woven."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It's no coincidence this is a classic. It's also no classic without quite a few coincidences. Charles Dickens plays freely with the laws of averages and chance, and expects his readers to buy into his premises. Once that is done--and for me, it was a simple decision to dive in with joy and dread--the book reads quickly, while still dealing with a cast of rich characters.A Tale of Two Cities is the story of London and Paris (mostly the latter), on the eve of the French Revolution and leading into that turbulent period. There are prisoners with hidden secrets, nobles with hidden pasts, and scoundrels with hidden goodness. As the slow fuse burns, the chaos and horror of the Revolution approaches--mirroring in some ways the American Revolution that had preceded it, but with a much more violent nature--and then draws the key characters into its net of suspicion and danger. From Dr. Manette, a troubled soul, and his sweet daughter, to Charles Darnay and the steadfast accountants, housekeepers, and friends that surround them, this is a story of goodness in the face of great evil.Despite that evil, Dickens has a keen eye and ear for the toils of the poor, and he makes the initial motives of his revolutionaries clear, without glorifying or completely demonizing them. This is a story that deals with oppression and class struggle, with elitism and common decency, and with the bravery that resides in even the most unlikely hearts.Yes, the coincidences mount up at certain points, but I couldn't help but be swept away by Dickens' clear care for his characters, for the cities and times in which the story takes place, and for the English language as a means of entertaining, educating, and challenging his readers' minds. This is a classic for a reason, and I think it holds up strongly even today."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"...after all, it did help cement in the public mindset the reactionary slanders of the Republic as an unremitting orgy of bloodletting, in the most calculated bit of hypocrisy that persists to this day.

That did it for me. I cannot read that chapter without weeping. Do you know what it's like to have the words you should have said, NEEDED to have said spat back at you across centuries?

Read it instead for your heart."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens was a master and this book was one of his best. It is a departure from some of his other works which have a lot in common with each other. A Tale of Two Cities is a mystery, a spy thriller, a history, a tragedy, and a love story all rolled into one. It also happens to have the best opening lines and the best ending lines of any novel. As with any classic like this, the language and writing are not what the modern ear is used to hearing so may be a little difficult for those who are new to that. It will be well worth your time to read this book though. It will put you through a roller coaster of emotions right up to the very end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I don't think I can say anything about this book that hasn't been said. I thought the characters, the plot and the historical backdrop were terrific. I'm not sure why I never read this in school, even as an English major. This is the kind of book that will stay with me forever.Having said that, I don't think most high schoolers could ever fully appreciate this book. I read this at the same time as my 10th grader, who did not enjoy it. I think it's a struggle for most younger readers to understand the plot and Dickens' writing style. If you have to read it for school, try to appreciate it and think about reading it again when you are older - it is very much worth the effort!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" by Charles Dickens is perhaps best known for its famous opening and closing sentences. It is a simple yet complicated story of life during the French Revolution with settings in both London and Paris. It tells the tale of Charles Darnay, the rightful French heir, who renounces his inheritance at a great price, and the consequences that his renunciation has upon the people that he loves.The story begins with descriptions of the hardships endured during the time period by both the English and the French before one of the main characters, a banker by the name of Jarvis Lorry, enters the scene. It is his task to escort young Lucie Manette to Paris in the hopes that they can find her father, Doctor Manette, who was imprisoned in the Bastille when Lucie believed him to be dead. Upon returning to England, the doctor is restored to new life just as Charles Darnay is in fear of losing his as he stands trial for treason. The charges against him are dropped and he eventually marries Lucie and they have a happy life; yet while the reader and Doctor Manette know his true identity, no one else knows that he is the French heir. When a troubled letter recalls him to Paris, Darnay finds himself imprisoned once again with little hope of ever being released and doomed to meet his fate at the hands of the terrible Guillotine.\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" sports a wide cast of characters that at first can be difficult to follow. Yet all of the characters are interweaved together in the end. The separate lives of the Darnays in England soon fatefully mix with the revolutionary crazed lives of the Defarges in France. Indeed, Dickens created one cruel and repugnant villain in Madame Defarge, as well as an unlikely hero in Sydney Carton, a man willing to pay the ultimate price for those he loves.Dickens has a lot of territory to cover in terms of the revolution, and while some lengthy descriptions can be tedious, the storming of the Bastille is graphically captured. At times the serialization of the novel is too evident, but that does not detract from the greater story at hand once all threads begin to mix together. There is also a fair amount of wit and humor thrown in to the story to keep readers interested, although the ending may leave readers wondering if the prophetic offered visions will come true."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"What a book! After reading this, I've come to appreciate Charles Dickens as so much more than 'that guy who wrote the Christmas Carol.'One thing I love is his ability to create a perfect storyline. Seriously, everything in this book fits together in the end like a perfect, completed puzzle. Components that were thought to be gratuitous at first will come back in major ways at later points in the book. Maybe it's just me, but I adore authors who blatantly show that they know exactly where they're going with every sentence of the story. The ending packs a serious punch, too.The characters in this book are exceptional, as well. My personal favorite was Madame Defarge. It's probably me and my general love for 'the bad guy' in stories, but I loved every scene she was in. I also like the fact the Dickens gave her a reason for hating the aristocracy so much, as compared to her husband. The wood-sawyer/roadmender was interesting, too, if only for entertainment value. But of course, I'm sure anyone going around screaming \\"My little guilltine! Off with her head! Off his his head! Hahahaha!' for no apparent reason except to please the majority might interest anybody.This book was also a strong commentary regarding the Revolution. It was interesting to see the ironic way in which Dickens compares the aristocracy to the angry revolutionaries. The revolutionaries are mad for the aristocracy hurting and killing the innocent. Then, they turn right around and start killing plenty of innocent people for the sake of watching their heads roll.I understand this book isn't for everyone. The plot is complex, there are plenty of characters to keep track of, and it takes a long time to get exciting. But, trust me, if you stick with it, it will pay off in the end."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was \\"required\\" to read this in High School. Twenty+ years later, I am glad that I finally did.Paris today is a nice place to visit compared to the late Eighteenth Century, during the Revolution. You could be arrested and condemned to death under the guillotine for mere suspicion of Anti-republican behavior. That and the mockery of law of the pseudo-trials which condemned people to death following a \\"denouncement\\" sort reminds me of our own American ancien regime.The English, and the English system of government is portrayed as flawed but far superior to the mockery of the French system pre and post Republicanism. Think of the arrest and trial of Darnay in England. He was arrested for treason, and the method of execution (described in detail by Dickens) for that, should he have been found guilty, was far worse than being guillotined. However, under English law, Darnay was allowed the counsel of lawyers and was at least allowed to present witnesses to the bar, even for one of the worst offenses to the government, treason. In pre-revolution France, Dr. Manette was locked up in the Bastille for eighteen years for offending a nobleman, without any trial. In post-revolution France, you could be arrested, given a mock trial by revolutionaries without access to counsel or witnesses, and condemned to death for petty offenses or for just being a member of the nobility.Madame Defarge has to be one of the most evil women to ever appear in literature. She is single-mindedly obsessed with putting to the guillotine every last nobleman and woman in France. As another female figure of evil, Lady Macbeth, complains her husband is \\"too full o' the milk of human kindness,\\" Madame Defarge complains her husband is too soft to plot the execution of the Manette women. Defarge is like Lady Macbeth in the respect of being without feelings towards others. Because Lucie Manette makes the appeal to Madame Defarge to save her husband \\"O sister-woman, think of me,\\" Madame Defarge singles her out for later vengeance. She frostily replies \\"Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?\\"The battle scene between Miss Pross and Madame Defarge ends with Pross victorious and Defarge dead, with much staring down but little actual violence. I don't think Pross capable of having enough strength to squeeze the life out of that wicked woman by the abdomen. Dicken's declares the defeat was because \\"love conquers hatred\\". What utter nonsense. This is the weakest part of the book.Sidney Carlton, the man who sacrificed himself to save Darnay, was previously a drunkard. He barely had a life. Was he desperately searching for meaning in it, and then when he found it, died for it? Did Carlton suddenly become a Christ-like figure, sacrificing his life to save others? The argument can be made due to his vagabond lifestyle and occasional gifted insight."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I was assigned A Tale of Two Cities for school. It wasn't the most exciting novel ever in the beginning (actually it was a bit boring) but at the beginning of the 3rd installment, I couldn't put it down. Everything started to come together, and I was able to start to see through the thick haze of tangled plot lines and characters that covered the first half of the book. It amazed me how Charles Dickens could tie up all of the loose ends and not forget a single thread.One of the things that bothered me in this novel, and it's one of the things I've noticed in Dickens' other books too, is that most all of his characters are on a one-way road. For example, Lucie Manette is perfectly good and loving and nice. I kinda wanted to call her simpering at times. This novel had some more rounded characters in it, like Sydney Carton and Mr. Manette, and I liked that a lot.If high school teachers want to force-feed this to their students, I would suggest trying to relate events then to events now to make it more interesting , because I had some trouble plodding through the first 20 chapters of the book before it got interesting. Overall, I liked A Tale of Two Cities a lot and I think I'll probably re-read it in the future."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Accustomed to reading Dickens for a good laugh and a great story, I read A Tale of Two Cities about a year ago. While waiting for the McCawbers to show up, I failed to appreciate what is now one of my favorite books. Dickens hints around a subject in a way infinitely more powerful than plainly stating it and evokes deepest emotions in plainly stated phrases. For anyone turned off by the intricate and meticulous way the story develops, a second read makes the importance of minor incidents clear and gives the writing its full force of Mystery and Faith.Dickens's signature humor appears through Miss Pross, Mr. Stryver and Mr. Cruncher. I loved Miss Pross's beatification of her degenerate brother and Mr. Cruncher's imperiled vow to leave Mrs. Cruncher the superintendence of her own future \\"flopping.\\"However, the brilliant language must inevitably lead from the innocent drinking spilled wine off the dusty streets of Paris, to the Reign of Terror and, ultimately, La Guillotine. A sense of awe and foreboding lurks within every line and only the faith of Darnay and Carton can withstand the relentless grind of Revenge.I try to read A Tale of Two Cities with the attitude of understanding a foreign language and ask myself what every word means in the sense here used. By this approach, although it's impossible for me to adequately describe what makes me shiver while reading Dickens, I can confidently state, that A Tale of Two Cities lives and teems with it."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Some honest disclosures. My strongest academic credentials relevant to literary criticism are that I minored in English. I have never been a \\"student\\" of Dickens. I enjoy Shakespeare plays in the same manner that I enjoy analyzing baseball games: I always get the point and relish in the general purpose of the production, but there are finer nuances that are beyond me and most of the people watching probably have a more sophisticated appreciation than I do. All of that stated, I dove into this classic Dickens title (actually, reading it aloud to my pre-teen kids) and was pleasantly surprised to find that I throughly enjoyed the experience.As practically every review on this page will tell you, or as could be digested from Wikipedia or Cliff Notes, this novel is set in the circumstances of the French Revolution. What Dickens provided is a human tale from the perspective of the coming (and elapsed) revolution on the lives within one extended family based in Paris and London. Make no mistake: this book is long and plodding, and the language is sufficiently \\"Dickensesque\\" to discourage any modern American reader, but the investment of time and attention is rewarding. Dickens is wonderful, and it is a delight to read the words of someone whose universal messages can still reach across the centuries and cultures that separate us (like Twain, Shakespeare, and, what the heck, the Apostle Paul).I am not expert enough in English literature or French history to provided more of an endorsement than this: this is a great read and is surprisingly accessable. The themes of violence, greed, rebellion, hatred, love, charity, mercy, and sacrifice are clear enough for anyone to appreciate. And my children, as young as eight-years, eagerly settled down for a chapter night after night. Another big shout goes out for Dickens."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This may be the only Dickens novel I can stand, probably because it would be difficult to render the French Revolution boring or preachy. The story, full of the lucky coincidences and chances for redemption that make it a Dickens novel, is rather unbelievable, making it more of an allegory than a true tale of human characters. However the backdrop of revolutionary France is fascinating. The story of an oppressed people rising up and quickly turning to brutality has been repeated oft enough in history to be worthy of interest."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; is tedious and time consuming. While many people say that it has plenty of action, Dickens spends too much time in description for it to be truly enjoyable. The language is too grand for most audiences today, but this is understandable. What is not understandable is the lack of life put into the words. Certainly the book is somewhat realistic, but it lacks realism. Too many characters maintain their high ideals in a time that is essentially war and chaos. I would not, under any circumstances reccommend this book to either an adult or a child."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"First of all, I really give it 4.7546788 stars, because it only has a slight problem, but other than that, I found this book impossible to read without feeling some of the emotion felt by the characters, especially Carton. Dickens' eloquence and beatifully constructed sentences allowed for this. It is difficult to tell whether Dickens is impartial, or he supports the Revolution or aristocracy. Personally, I think it is the latter, but he seems to be understanding of the revolutionaries despite what seems to be a satire of them, especially Madame Defarge. I think, however, that Dickens stumbled a little bit when he used so much foreshadowing. Sometimes, it does not seem natural, and it felt like I was reading almost someone who had clumsily jumbled together various elements of style and literature. But other than that, it was wonderfully written, and I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"having read some of the appalling reviews written by people my age i felt the need to add my two cents. first off pardon my lack of grammar or capitalization i am writing this on my kindle and its very slow going. well i am in my freshman year of high school and we are reading this for honors english. i would like to make it very clear that this book is not boring at all. i know its a litte overwhelming to begin reading classics after many years of &#34;young adult fiction&#34; and whatnot but just beause its different than what we are used to that doesnt make it bad. this is a beautifullly written tragic tale telling the story of the french revolution in vivid detail. yes the description tends to be excessive but it gives the reader a better understanding of the characters and setting. if you cannot at the very least appreciate his talent in crafting amazing sentences then i really dont know what to tell you. all in all this book is not boring in fact it is quite the opposite. sure its not an easy read but its a fun and rewarding challenge to teenage readers everywhere. so dont groan if you see this book on your reading list. you will probably love it. :)"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In my opinion this is Dickens' best.

The two cities, of course, are Paris and London, and the drama of the story centers on the terror of the French Revolution in 1789-92 when the Guillotine was put to frequent use against those judged to be enemies of the new republic. The reader, Frederick Davidson, does an excellent job of characterizing the voices in the story. The voice he uses for each character is easily identifiable in dialogue between characters, and brings out the traits Dickens built into them. The one exception, in my opinion, is the voice Mr. Davidson chose for Lucie Manette, the passive heroine of the story. Her lines in the novel are mostly insipid because she is the classic Victorian delicate, fainting beauty, and of course her first language is supposed to be French, but I found her voice and character difficult to warm up to (unlike Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, whose love for her drives much of the plot). Still, her speaking part is small, and Mr. Frederickson's virtuoso performances of Jerry Cruncher, Jarvis Lorry, Miss Pross, and Sydney Carton, not to mention the charming Defarges of Saint Antoine, render this a very small shortcoming in an otherwise clear, consistently interesting, and suspenseful performance. I listen to a lot of audio books, and for my money this one easily deserves a 5 star rating. 87 tracks plus a short credits track at the end. 14.5 hours in MP3 format.

Mind you, by classic I mean the books that changed the way the world thought or acted, books that made a difference, not just the ones called \\"classics\\" because old authors wrote them. The big questions about books seem to be \\"Why read when you can watch it on the big screen or in your living room?\\" \\"Why imagine a scene when it can be seen right in front of you?\\" It may seem a pain, but if you have or had a great English teacher like I do, experiences like Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities are not ones you are allowed to miss. It seems now, that most people identify Charles Dickens, (if at all), with his trademark love of description and detail, a.k.a., wordiness. As one would expect, his masterpiece, A Tale of Two Cities, is full of just that. Don't be fooled though, Charles Dickens's love for language does not only result from his payment by the word, but from his innate storyteller persona. This tone results in absolute magic as he weaves a story of love, pain, and sacrifice. It brings fear as he paints a picture of a country in turmoil, and of course, ensures that no movie can outdo the splendor of the text! (I was kidding on that last one). In all seriousness, Dickens does justice to both sides of the revolution, but in a very story conducive way. While under the oppression of the Aristocracy, the poor peasants are made out to be humble, cooperative people, having every last glimmer of hope crushed out of them by heavy taxes and oppression. The nobility is portrayed as uncaring and cruel, the villains of the time. It is during the bloody revolution, however, that the roles of the two sides begin to change. The peasants become the bloodthirsty judges and executioners of their aristocrat prey, mercilessly exterminating any nobility who chose to not flee the country, putting the nobles in the similar powerless situation the poor faced for so long. Ironically enough, Dickens uses his sharp detail and depiction, oddly enough, to blur the line between hero and villain, provoking deep and important consideration on what being a hero or a villain really means. Dickens does not at all miss his irony; \\"Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms (Dickens 376).\\" Sharing in the wisdom of such statements and ideas is something everyone can and should partake in, and always benefit from. It is for this reason and others, that I consider A Tale of Two Cities a classic and a \\"must read\\". I highly recommend this book to the young, (but not too young), and old. If you read and hated this book in high school, read it again, and if you have never read it, give it a try. Do not be discouraged by Dickens' verbosity. Use it to immerse yourself in a tale for the ages. Do yourself a favor. Pick up a copy and stick with it (if for no other reason than it gets really good at the end!). Verdict: A Tale of Two Cities is a piece of history not to be missed and certainly not forgotten."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Before reading 'A Tale of Two Cities' I was not a huge fan of Dickens. However, this book has completely won me over. Comic, formal, somber, trivial, and truly epic by turns, his changing tones and tenses may confuse some readers. His wandering style of writing grew on me; the book is full of his personality and opinions. It's the opposite of objective, and so much the better for it.True, any intelligent reader should be able to see the plot twists coming from a mile away, but it's not what happens, but how it happens. I knew the basic plot when I began reading, and I was still mildly surprised and definately gratified at the finish.Dickens has a knack for forcing the reader to sympathize with each side - first you cheer for the Saint Aintone peasants, then root for the nobility, then end up with a knot in your stomach when they come to odds with each other. Neither comes off in a particularly good light, and neither triumphs. The only victory to be found here is a very personal one, at the very end.It's true that the characters are rather one dimensional, and can be summed up in a word. Mr. Lorry is the British stiff-upper-lip, Lucie Mannette is loyalty, Madame Defarge is revenge. The best character by far, the anti-hero Sydney Carton, is a failed but still brilliant, lazy, boozing, lawyer. He is sacrifice and redemption.The one-dimensionality is okay, however, as this isn't really a character-driven story, but (obviously) is the tale of cities. You get a sense of the slow inevitability of a revolution, a glimpse of daily life during the time period, and the third book/section is absolutely permeated with the terror of a mob out of control with bloodthirst and \\"la guillotine\\".Perhaps the best part of the book concerns the inexorable progress of man going to his death. If you have a soul at all, you'll be left wondering what you would do in his situation. What is it like to face such impersonal death?The theme of vengeance reminded me a bit of 'The Count of Monte Cristo' - is revenge really worth it? Far from being about \\"boring historical stuff\\", it's about a basic human character trait (or flaw?) that's still quite pertinent today:\\"Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammer, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms.\\""},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities was published by Charles Dickens in 1859. Set in the time of the French Revolution (late 18th century), the stories plot revolves around a French aristocrat (one who renounced all his power and land in France) named Charles Darnay and his wife, Lucie. Charles has moved to England and teaches French (he is later tried on the suspicion of being a French spy. Because he and his clerk appear identical, the charges are dropped).At the outset the narrator describes the rampant injustice, poverty and disorder in both England and France. The tale quickly moves on to a mysterious scene between a senior employee at a bank in London (Jarvis Lorry: he is affiliated with Lucie's family, the Manettes) and a messenger, Jerry Cruncher (a man with the distasteful side job of being a \\"resurrection man\\"-someone who digs up bodies for use by medical students. Jarvis visits Lucie in Dover, informing her that her father, a man thought by all to be dead, has been imprisoned in the Bastille in Paris for eighteen years. Lucie and Jarvis move to collect the now old man.Five years later Darnay is on trial for suspicions of treason-on the grounds that he was seen with some \\"lists,\\" a vague and paranoid accusation that no less carries weight. Darnay is saved by his identical clerk, Sydney Carton, who suggests that it may have been he, a born Englishman and a clerk (who would naturally handle lists) that the witnesses saw. Darnay is acquitted (incidentally, although Sydney is always saving Darnay, he feels very jealous of his boss, saying that Darnay is what \\"[Sydney] could have been). Here Dickens uses the parallels between the two to explore the noble, romantic side (Darnay) and his cynical, darker side (Sydney).Through a series of squabbles between Darnay's uncle, Darnay is recalled to France. There he makes note of his desire to renounce his nobility; whereas his father and uncle abuse their power, Darnay wishes to help the people with his. At any rate, the uncle is beheaded, Darnay moves back to England and becomes one of three suitors for Lucie (the others are his Lawyer, Stryver, and Sydney). He ends up marrying her and having a daughter. Next, after a gap of six years, the French Revolution flames up (literally; France burns). Darnay returns to France to attempt a rescue of a family friend; he is subsequently imprisoned. The old Doctor returns and uses his influence as a former prisoner to calm the bloodthirsty crowds and try to rescue Darnay. He is unsuccessful for 15 months; after that, Darnay passionately pleads to be set free. He is.However, soon after a letter proving Darnay to be of aristocratic blood surfaces and he is sentenced to die the next day. However it is Sydney once again who saves him: he switches places through a clever plan and a letter. As he is about to die he thinks these most famous of words: \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest I go to than I have ever known.\\"In completely transforming himself through love, Sydney becomes the story's sacrificial hero. It is a curious fact that in the end Sydney's heroism throughout the book becomes clear at last; ever loving and ever intelligent, it is he who becomes the book's hero, not Darnay.Set in the bloody background of the French Revolution, A Tale of Two Cities gives an accurate, graphic account of the mob mentality sweeping through the oppressed; it ironically depicts how the oppressed rose up to become worse than their oppressors; and on a more romantic note, it portrays sacrificial heroism in all its poignant glory; more than anything else, it shows that while the blame for poverty belonged wholly to the aristocratic, the responsibility for the blood drawn from it is the fault of the most destitute-whether justified or not. Overall, It is an excellent novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In this sharply honest recounting of the French Revolution, Dickens weaves together an unusual cast of characters to form a tale of love and loss, hope and despair, trust and betrayal. Dr. Manette, who had been jailed on false charges, is released after almost twenty years. His daughter Lucie, who believed him dead, found him, brought him back to Soho, England, and began to care for him. In the course of events, they meet and become close with Charles Darnay, an alleged French spy. Dr. Manette and Lucie also form a strange sort of friendship with Charles' rather unsuccessful lawyer, Sydney Carton. Sydney, who is misunderstood by everyone, possesses a quiet strength that he seldom reveals. Meanwhile, in Saint Antoine, France, the wicked Madame Defarge and her husband plot to overthrow every single aristocrat they can get their hands on. But every one of these characters are struggling to survive in a world full of terror, dread and false friends.The detailed accounts of the people and places cause you to feel as if you are right there, in middle of all the action and drama. The meticulousness of the writing gives you information that enables you to picture the characters perfectly. In addition, I highly enjoyed the characters' personalities. Specifically the way the character of Charles Darnay was so bluntly truthful, and how the villain, Madame Defarge complacently knitted away at public hangings.In conclusion, I recommend this book to people who go for drama and/or historical fiction. I sort of enjoyed reading it (once I got past the first 100 pages or so -which were kinda boring)."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Imagine in the year 1792 in the middle of France. The crowds are electric as another day of trials has come. You're in that crowd watching as the prisoners in the wooden cart filled with hay passes by. The crowd chants, &quot;Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!&quot; They hiss and throw objects at them. The prisoners proceed down the street to the square where their fate resides. Within minutes the crowd chants as the executioner holds up the prisoners' severed head for all to see. Or imagine yourself in England during this time with a government distrustful of its lower class people and foreigners after two revolutions overseas. Both these scenarios can be found in Charles Dickens' Tale of Two Cities. The story takes place in the same bloodshed seen in Revolutionary France and the uncertainties felt by the people in England. The Book opens with the reader meeting Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a senior clerk of a bank. At First a man of pure business, he becomes a good friend of Alexander and Lucie Manette. Alexander, or Doctor Manette as he is called in the book, once was a respected doctor. But after 18 years in the Bastille, he becomes a mental wreck. However, his daughter, Lucie Manette, is portrayed as a sweet natured girl, the &quot;Golden Thread&quot; that holds everything together. She is the one able to help her father after his long imprisonment. Dickens also presents characters that are the antithesis of each other. The first set of characters is Sydney Carton and Charles St. Evremond (Charles Darney for most of the book). Sydney is an alcoholic whose humble beginnings early on resulted into a failed life. On the other hand, Charles Darney is a great success, yet his beginnings are unknown to the reader at first. Their connections their love for Lucie Manette, which is so strong, and for whom each one will do anything for her. The other pair of character is Ms. Pross and Madame (Therese) DeFarge. Mrs. Pross is the loyal servant of the Manette family who would give her life to protect Lucie Manette. Mrs. Defarge is a ruthless revolutionary leader who is out to prosecute an imprison the Manettes as well as other aristocrats and anyone who would stand in the way of the &quot;Republic.&quot; These character connections revolve around Lucie Manette, and she is, as said before, the &quot;Golden Thread&quot; that holds everything together. The characters seem to revolve around her, yet she cannot be considered the protagonist of this story. She is a very &quot;static&quot; character and doesn't change much throughout the story. The most &quot;dynamic&quot; character is Sydney Carton. He changes the most throughout the story from the first time he is mentioned to his last actions at the end of the book. Not only the interesting mix of personalities in Dickens' characters, one would notice the main theme of this story - Resurrection or a restoration of one's life. Many of these characters have their lives restored or drastically change throughout the eight years in which this book takes place. For example, Dr. Manette's life during his imprisonment was a miserable one indeed, passing his time by making shoes. But after Mr. Lorry found him rotting away in the Bastille, His life changed after he was reunited with his family and friends. His life was &quot;restored&quot;. Another theme of this story is one of revenge. The setting and background of the story help prove this theme. The revolutionary setting and the acts of the revolutionaries portray the revenge the lower classes take upon the aristocracy for centuries of serfdom and oppression. They imposed on them imprisonment, arson, and even murder. Also, the Defarges wanted to take out revenge against all who would opposed the revolution. Especially with the Manettes, the Defarges used their influence in the republic to carry out their &quot;revenge&quot; on the aristocratic St. Evremond family and anyone connected with them. However they would not triumph for their quest for revenge. Overall, the themes show that good will triumph over evil or that love will triumph over hate. All the &quot;good&quot; characters had a happy ending while the villains failed to &quot;get the best of&quot; the Manettes and their party while in France during the revolution. Some aspects of Dickens' writing style were a weak point in the story. His style of repetition to get a point across was annoying at times and redundant at other times. The sharp change between settings and story lines at the end and sometimes in the middle or relatively small chapters was also a weakness. Throughout book 2 this constant change can sometimes confuse the reader about where the story scene is at certain times and who is involved. However, the excellent plot and realistic characters help overcome these weaknesses. There are unexpected events and surprises as the story develops in the characters' connection to this mysterious St. Evremond family are revealed. These aspects of the plot would keep any reader captivated with the story. While Dickens wrote and excellent, exciting plot, he also developed some excellent characters. Dickens' characters seem real because they had realistic problems and life styles. For example, after years of imprisonment, isolated from contact with people, anyone's mind would go &quot;crazy&quot;. These mental problems are exactly what Mr. Manette experienced after his 18 years in the Bastille. Alcoholism, a problem that still exists in the 21st Century, was very predominant. Sydney Carton represents the classic alcoholic in the book, as well as its effects on a person. Each Character had realistic qualities that represent every aspect of life in the Revolutionary era in France and Britain. With three books, and almost 400 pages, Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities can be considered a lengthy book to the average high school student. However, any student of English literature needs to read this book. As stated before, the plot and characters in Dickens' story were well written, and can get any teenaged, video game-loving couch potato interested in the story of love and hatred in the French Revolution. Any student of history, especially European history, will also enjoy the book because of the use of historical events, and historical circumstances to help enhance the story. It is amazing to see the first-hand description of the French Revolution from a person who never lived during this era. This is an excellent book for any student in high school."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"If you're having problems sleeping, this is probably the book for you. With its convoluted sentences that often span half a page without cease, this novel manages to put half the students in my honors sophomore English class asleep.To be sure, the plot is tolerable, if relying a bit too much on coincidences. Of course, Darnay and Carton just HAPPEN to look alike and Carton just HAPPENS to be the assistant of Darnay's lawyer... In fact, I occasionally even found myself wanting to know what happened next.Dickens' language...well, I must pay my compliments to his vocabulary. The devices of foreshadowing and symbolism which he seemed to be over fond of using are easy to miss in some cases, and smackingly obvious in others. Also, a warning about the melodramatic prose that was so appealing to Dickens' audience.Lastly-- to the characters which are so often lauded. There are occasional interesting characters like Jerry Cruncher and his Anna Dominoes (his &quot;Anno Domini&quot;) and the vehemently loyal Miss Pross. However, Lucie is particularly unappealing as the heroine (ever fainting, provided that there be a comfortable chair near). The reader often wonders exactly what it is that so inspires such strong devotion from Carton and Darnay. How she can manage to be the 'golden thread' that holds everything so well together when there is absolutely no evidence of extraordinary intelligence or strength? Or even of ANY intelligence or strength? She is compassionate, yes, but it is a quality which many ladies were expected to possess in those days.Overall, if you want to enjoy an excellent story with the French Revolution as a backdrop...don't read Tale of Two Cities. I suggest The Scarlet Pimpernel, a much more exciting and swashbuckling classic (also set in the French Revolution). While Tale has some good qualities, I feel they are much over-shadowed by its vices. Any excitement in the novel is eclipsed by the horrid prose."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"My teacher made me download this and I never got past the first chapter.

It is shorter than many of his books, and the plotting was tight. There were fewer memorable characters and incredible plot twists than usual, but of course there was brilliant description and witty dialogue. \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" really is the story of the Revolution more than a particular person. The pace of the story picks up during the last 50 pages (although it is not too slow for the rest), and becomes quite exciting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Dickens or is interested in the French Revolution. So I give it 4 stars...only because Dickens did write \\"Great Expectations\\" and \\"Our Mutual Friend\\"."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"In A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, he uses humor to make pointed suggestions about the state of society in France and England at the end of the eighteenth century. One example of this is when he describes Tellson's Bank. Through his verboseness, he gets the point across that it is an old crusty building. The tone uses here is humorous when explaining the characteristics of the building. It is easy to see that Dickens is trying to say that the building is old without saying, \\"This is an old building,\\" because of his wonderful use of imagery. \\"Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old - fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious...if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. (46, Dickens) Another prime example of Dickens being humorousness, satire, and tone is in book one chapter two when he is describing the Dover Mail. The imagery used gives the impression that he is thinking that it was musky smelling and very dark. Dickens makes his point come across by using the narrator to observe the way that all the passengers felt while inside. Because of all the verboseness used it is clear that Dickens thought the carriage ride was very uncomfortable. This humor of Dickens' was not very effective because although it had much meaning, it was very long winded!This novel, although very verbose and elongated, was a great piece of literature for those who enjoy all the details. Dickens portrays his own style of writing that, luckily, is very easily comprehendible unlike other famous writers like Shakespeare. This piece of literature gives a lot of true information about the French Revolution. I think that the novel portrayed both sides (the aristocrats and the peasants) well, however Dickens favored the peasants more. The peasants were obviously Dickens' favorites in this novel because they relate so much to his own life growing up. Charles lived as an orphan and a peasant all his life because his father was sent to debtor's prison when he was just twelve. This small part of Dickens' history connects directly to Lucie Manette and all the peasants in the novel.The title that was given to this review came from the opening and closing quotes of this piece of literature. \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...in the superlative degree of comparison only.\\" (1, Dickens) \\"It is a far, far better thing that i do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.\\"(352, Dickens) I picked these two quotes to join together as my title because as I was thinking about this novel and all the imagery I had to percieve and the wonderful story behind it all I wondered if reading this book was the worst of times or the best. On the other hand, bringing the last quote of this horribly long novel into play, now that it's all over I think, just as Sydney Carton did when he said this about his life being traded for Darnay's in order to make his love (Lucie) happy, that it is better to know that I have done something good by actually finishing the novel and doing what needed to be done."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This novel is the standard by which I measure all English literature classics by. It was absolutely captivating. I admit it was long and the furst few chapters seemed slow, but as the story got going the book was hard to put down. Dickens' characters really come to life. He has exceptional powers of description; whether the scene is London or Paris, the city comes to life. I felt like I was right there in the thick of things. I know from my history classes that Dickens didn't quite get the historical details all totallly right, but there's something to be said for dramatic license. He's more interested in the complex relationships, the themes of love, sacrifice, and morality. It's interesting how neither the aristocracy or the revolutionaries are necessarily shown as clear cut \\"good guys\\" - the characters have a greyness, an ambiguity, that makes the book fascinating."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known -Sydney CartonThe passage above and the opening of the novel--It was the best of times, it was the worst of times--are among the most often quoted lines from any of Dickens' works, both because they are memorable and because somehow this is the one work of his that we all get assigned in school. I assume this one is chosen because, while it is still great, it is one of his shorter efforts.The story should be familiar, Dr. Alexander Manette is freed from his unjust imprisonment in the Bastille and is reunited with his long lost daughter, Lucie, in England. They are called as witnesses at the treason trial of Charles Darnay, a dashing young Frenchman. Darnay too is falsely accused, but he is saved, in part by his resemblance to a law clerk named Sydney Carton. Darnay and Lucie eventually marry, though not before the wastrel Carton declares his love for her and his unworthiness of her. He pledges that one day he will prove himself worthy by doing her a service. That opportunity comes when Darnay is condemned to death by a French tribunal and sentenced to the guillotine.This has been one of my favorite books since the 8th Grade. There is no more thrilling moment in literature then when Carton takes Darnay's place and bravely faces certain death. It is a moment of redemption that reminds us that great literature serves human purposes; we may never have such a moment in our own lives, but the example instructs us in how we should face such a situation if the time comes. We can ask no more of ourselves than the courage and sense of honor to do that &quot;far, far better thing.&quot;GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot; Perhaps no first line of a book describes the book better than A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. This novel really is a mix of good and bad. It all starts with Dr. Manette, who, after being 18 years in jail, is retrived from France by his daughter Lucie and an old friend named Mr. Lorry. The Manettes live safely in England, where Lucie meets Charles Darnay, a man who herself, her father and Mr. Lorry were testifying against at his trial of treason. Lucie and Charles fall in love, devasting Carton, who loves Lucie and was Charles' lawyer, and get married unaware that Charles' family put Lucie's father in jail. One of Darnay's old servants is thrown in jail back in France, so Charles goes there, during the revolution and gets himself thrown in jail. The Defarges, wineshop owners in France who were taking care of Dr. Manette, are after Charles and his new family because of a deep dark secret that Madame Defarge holds against the family. This book holds much info, many names, dates and places, but the reader catches on quickly. The characters seem to constantly move back and forth from France to England, and the story junps back and forth from the Manettes and the Defarges. Dickens makes the transitions from person to person, and place to place easy for the reader to understand by adding tags to the characters and introducing the setting in the beginning of the chapters. One problem is the length. The book seems to drag on. The chapter entitled &quot;Hundreds of People&quot; repeats the same phrase or idea over and over again wearing out its initial symbolism. Granted A Tale of Two Cities could not be condensed into 20 pages, but Dickens pushes the reader's attention span and the use of details to the extreme. There is such a thing as too many details. One character that seems too &quot;lady-like&quot; is Lucie Manette. Her constant fainting and crying make her an unlikeable character, and Madame Defarge, the tyrant, is more likeable. Overall, A Tale of Two Cities is a masterpiece. It is a reflection of Dicken's genius and a period of time lost to us, but remembered through the pages of this novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is a classic that I should have read 50 years ago but avoided. Mr. Dickens spends 80% of the book setting the scene - late 1700's London and Paris - and the characters; the last 20% approaches being exciting. The redeeming feature of the story is that I'd previously had no knowledge of the French revolution and this encourages me to find out more about the history. Reading this on Kindle gave me the advantage of being able to easily look back to refresh my memory on a character appearing early in the book, then not again until later."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"A Tale of Two Cities has a complicated plot with twists and turns that eventually unravel the tightly woven story. The story begins in France, several years before the French Revolution, switches to England, and then returns to France at the end. A lot of foreshadowing creates suspense, and as the story progresses, war ensues. Death is always a constant threat or recurring theme. In typical Dickens' style, every character and scene is fully developed with symbolism playing an important role; i.e., the broken wine cask in the beginning and the reference to blood. The imagery reminds one of the Christian sacrament, and the impending war in France.Of particular interest are the characters; the protagonist, Lucie Manette, discovers her father has been found alive imprisoned in the French Bastille for the last eighteen years. Lucie is the embodiment of love, and her unconditional love restores her father's sanity.As the French Revolution draws nearer, the reader senses the progression of hopeless bloodshed through the continued foreshadowing of events. There is an overarching uneasiness that something evil is going to happen to the main characters. The darkness of one of the main antagonists, Madame DeFarge, and her constant knitting of the names of those condemned to death, stands in stark contrast to the loving protagonist, Lucie Manette.Soon Darnay and Lucie marry, and a few years later, the French Revolution begins.Dickens shows the intense suffering and affliction of the masses and the arrogant aristocracy, which is portrayed by the heartless Marquis Evr&eacute;monde when he runs over a poor plebian child. The impending conflict in France creeps ever so closer to the Manette family in England when Darnay travels to France and is arrested. Darnay returns to Paris to free one of his former servants from prison, but is imprisoned on false charges. After a year, he is released following a trial, only to be immediately seized again by the evil Madame DeFarge. The father, who has been \\"recalled to life,\\" teeter totters on psychosis, reverting to his old shoemaking occupation while in prison when Darnay for the second time is sent to the guillotine.The tight plot, where nothing is wasted, builds to a stunning conclusion with the eventual escape of Lucie, Darnay, and their young daughter from Paris back to London, thanks to Miss Pross' killing of Madame DeFarge.One of the most poignant characters is Sydney Carton. In the beginning, he is an unhappy attorney that has taken to drink and feels his life has been wasted; yet, he still longs for a meaningful relationship and finds it in the ever-so-compassionate Lucie Manette. Through her kindness, he becomes more than he could have hoped for or imagined. Her love reaches deep, and, in the end, propels him to make the ultimate sacrifice for Lucie and her family, where his purpose in living embodies ultimate redemption.A Tale of Two Cities reminds me of those books and movies that need to be enjoyed twice; the first time for the overview of the complex plot, and the second time to appreciate the various symbolisms and motifs that make for a magnificent story."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Great classic. A powerful story of redemption.French aristocrat, Charles Darnay is anxious to undo the evils committed by his family. He happens to meet the lovely Lucie Manette while crossing the English Channel, as she is returning with her father who had been imprisoned in the Bastille.

Both men fall for Lucie, but Charles wins her heart.In the throes of the French Revolution, Charles and his entire family find their lives and fortunes in peril. It is up to Sydney, once again, to save the ones he loves--this time by making the ultimate sacrifice. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is powerfully preached in the last few chapters of the book.Don't begrudge this book because it was assigned for a literature class.

[...]"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens, as we all know, was paid by the word to write A Tale of Two Cities. This is what holds this book back from getting the respect and popularity it truly deserves. The wordiness and the over-the-top, verbose sentences bring the novel down. Despite the excessive vocabulary, Dickens takes a relatively neutral position in his portrait of the revolution. He depicts both sides of the revolution in a similarly negative light. The aristocracy is portrayed as arrogant, wealthy, pigs, which they rightly deserve.\\"It took four men, all four a-blaze with gorgeous decoration, and the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips\\" (pg. 108). Dickens wants to show the reader how the French upper class operates and live their truly extravagant (and I use \\"extravagant\\" in every sense of the word) lives. He paints a picture of ridiculous parties, exorbitant amounts of food, implausible lifestyles, and no regard for the poor or the peasants. He also characterizes the peasants as savage, vicious human beings. Dickens often describes the lower class citizens as some sort of animal whether it be a rat or a buzzing congregation of flies.A Tale of Two Cities is full of plots, subplots, and miniscule side-stories. The novel also has various themes that Dickens tries to drive home. The number one theme that Dickens exemplifies throughout the novel is about misused authority. When authority is misused, the consequences are drastic. Of course, this is shown through the French aristocracy by the commoner uprising; the uprising that leads to a so-called \\"reign of terror\\". Many citizens are killed because of this abuse of power. \\"Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled: \`Drive him fast to his tomb. This from JACQUES'\\" (pg. 134). Madame Defarge is a flawless example of the theme Dickens tries to get across. She is the driving force behind the revolution, but eventually drives herself to an inevitable death. \\"All this was in a second. \\"As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground\\" (pg. 383). This message is conveyed very well, and is really the only thing I could completely understand from the novel."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I love Charles Dickens writing, and I think his characterization cannot be beat. I have read all of his books, but I think this one remains my favourite. Charles Dickens could tell a marvelous story, and this book tells his most powerful tale of all. It centres around the French Revolution. The book is a short one for Dickens, but it has a complicated plot, and it is very fast-moving. It also opens with one of my favourite quotations ever - \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...\\" What a great way to start this book about two men - one a dissolute young Englishmen and the other is lookalike, a nephew of a French nobleman. They meet because both are in love with the same girl. She is the daughter of a man who has been in the Bastille for eighteen years. The book is a masterpiece, and Dickens employs quite a bit of symbolism in it as well. The story about the long scarf that Madame Defarge is knitting throughout the book is unique to literature, I think. And the ending of this novel is very powerful and totally unforgettable. This book is probably one of my favourite of all time, and with good reason."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This book is great! I had to read it for English class, and I am so glad because it was a great book! Many people say it is not good because the beginning is boring and sometimes mysterious so you're like, &quot;What's going on?&quot; But if you read it through to the end, the ending is great and clarifies all. It jusifies the sometimes boring parts. Have fun reading!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness...\\" (3). A Tale of Two Cites was one of Charles Dickens's greatest love stories, yet it had some flaws. Dickens's book has been around for 150 years, a fact which shows that some people care for Dickens, yet there are others who do not. Dickens described each scene so that one almost got a feeling of being in Paris during the French Revolution.Dickens used a style of writing that made each character believable. Sydney Carton, an alcoholic, non employed, lower class citizen of Paris, France, was in one of the worst possible spots during the French Revolution. There is a major idea of rebirth in A Tale of Two Cities: some of the characters grow and mature in some way. Sydney is one of the many characters who is recalled to life. He starts out as a drunk and ends up a hero. Sydney even loses his life to save Darnay and to keep his promise to Lucie who was his good friend. Lucie and Darnay got married during the novel. Sydney once confessed his love to Lucie by saying that he would do anything for her happiness. \\"For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything,\\" (189). Darnay, one of the richest men in Paris, left his life of luxury to fulfill his life, but he did not realize what would happen after he left. Darnay got in trouble for leaving because he was assumed to be a spy, and was put in jail. He was recalled to life when Sydney switched places with him right before his death. Sydney and Darnay were enemies until this point in the novel. Sydney knew that the only way for Lucie to be happy was for her to be with Darnay. This was a definite act of heroism in this novel. \\"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to, than I have ever known,\\" (470). All the characters worked together to make the plot suspenseful and interesting to the reader. The characters in A Tale of Two Cities were very well-drawn. As the reader reads the book, he or she can visualize each character, and get a feeling for how meaningful a person he or she is. For instance, when Dickens talked about Madame Defarge there was always a feeling of darkness. She even nits everyone's name into a cloth that she thinks should die.The plot in this novel started off slowly, but gained speed toward the middle. Dickens had good intentions for making the beginning slow, yet the speed might lose some readers in the first 100 pages. If one keeps interested in the novel after the beginning, then it is a superior book filled with suspense, love, and heroism. A Tale of Two Cities suits an audience of adults and teens, and it can be related to the present because there are wars and people fighting to change their government every day.In A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens was telling the story. He proved effective because he got the message across. Dickens used too much detail, and some parts of the novel had so many details that it was difficult to understand. For instance, if Dickens wanted to say something that need 2 words to describe it then he would use five. Dickens would have been wise to give a character in the novel the voice. If Dickens had given Sydney Carton the voice of the novel, then the audience would have gotten more detail about each character and more of what Sydney thought about the Revolution.Charles Dickens is an superior writer, though his writing is too thorough. He does have a very unique way of handling the narrative. He starts the novel off slow as a form of literary suspense, but that is not effective. The ending of the novel is a surprising twist that helps add to the effect of the plot.When one reads A Tale of Two Cites one has to stop and think about what the writer is trying to say, thus it is very thought-provking. Through his novel Dickens definitely enlightens his reader about the French Revolution, and one has the sense of the time period in the 1700s. This book is a classic, and there will be people 100 years from now reading it. Some people like the way Dickens writes, and those people will keep reading it. A Tale of Two Cities was an exciting yet complicated book."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I tend to divide Dickens' work into two fields - the straightforward novels, and the socially relevant ones. This belongs in the latter category, which means it is slightly less fun to read. However, the worst novel by Dickens is better then most author's best. This is a great work and when I think of The French Revolution and The Reign of Terror, it is A Tale of Two Cities that I usually imagine. Also, it contains two of the most famous passages in all of literature: \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...\\" and \\"It is a far, far better thing I do now than I have ever done...\\" It is a great novel to be sure, but it should not be your INTRODUCTION to Dickens."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It was very wonderful and easy to get in to.

I missed that somehow when I was 17."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"This is one of Dicken's finest works of writing. It diplicted the French revolution tremedously. Many the chapters were hard to understand but with a good english teacher like Mrs. Lee (Fort Morgan Colorado) I found it to have a great plot. When I was finished with the book looking back on it I realized what a great job dicken's did forshadowing the book and using great detail and repition to get main points across. Themes of the book though written a very long time ago still apply to life today. The only things I really disliked about the book was that it was drwan out and had at times too much info that was not nessicary. This was a great book and everyone should read it just to see a new style of writing."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I found the Tale of Two Cities to be incredibly engaging. Charles Dickens was a great author, with a tantalizing grasp of the English language that comes out in his metaphorical, deeply symbolic style.

The dual nature of man, politics, war, love, sacrifice...it's all there in beautiful 19th Century Prose. Hurray for Dickens!"},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"Charles Dickens gives outstanding detail for all of the characters in this novel.

I had to study Great Expectations at school many years ago. Today, I find his style of writing rather slow and laborious. With today's mass media, one is used to rather faster moving plots. I also found it difficult to imagine some of the characters. Possibly because they do not really exist today. The story becomes more interesting when the action moves to France. He captures the effects of a suppressed population revolting against authority very nicely. As ever it is replaced by something far worse if only temporary. One naturally is sympathetic towards the oppressed population. There is no mention of 'let them eat cake'. One of history's most revealing comments. The true nobility of man is revealed at the close."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"One of Dickens' best.

While the first two chapters or so are slow going because they're filling you in on the setting and the characters, the plot quickly picks up and makes you want more.

How do you explain the writing without having to explain the upsetting circumstances surrounding the characters involved?The last part is easy, as is the case with the classics, most know already that A Tale of Two Cities is set in the time of the French Revolution. It begins in good times, but ends on the opposite end of the spectrum, while still finding a way to give hope to those turning the pages of history.There are visuals within these pages that will touch any reader, clear and beautiful in their wording. However, in keeping with the dual nature of things, there are also visuals that will touch the reader holding the sadness and horror of what had come about during the time of multiple executions.Life changes for many this book touches, that includes those holding it in their hands."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"It is the extraordinary book that makes one feel they are a richer person for having read it. A Tale of Two Cities was on my list of books to read before I die. My bucket list of novels if you will. I agree with many of the commenters that say that Dickens is long winded. However, you would be as well if you got paid by the word. I was half way through the novel when I almost gave it up, the scenes becoming laborious and many not needed at all. I stuck with it reminding myself of the fact 19th centry readers did not have the short attention spans we have today.I was never so glad that I did as the final scenes played out. My heart gave over not to the protagonist(s) of the story, but to Sidney Carlton. A man Dickens in the first half of the book drew to be nothing more than a bitter drunk.Yes, the novel will seem ponderously long to the novice reader. However, Dickens did a masterful job at weaving subtle hints through out of how the characters would owe their fates - and in one case their head - to a the one man least suspected.If you are looking for a light, read at the pool side type of book, A Tale of Two Cities is not for you. However, if you are looking to enrich your life with a solid piece of literature with a heart and not to heavy of a moral clause then \\"Cities\\" will fill that hunger and then some."},{"Title":"A Tale of Two Cities - Literary Touchstone Edition","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Like most Dickens books, it takes a little to get going and get a handle on the style of writing and the older style language, but after that, it was a great read."},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"Burning Tower is the daughter of Whandall Feathersnake, the hero in the authors' previous book, 'The Burning City'. This is her adventure in a world filled with other facinating, lively characters, even an emperor who knows the meaning of \\"have a heart\\". There are many good things to say about the story; but, if I said more, it would ruin the surprise. What you really need to know is that the story gets more interesting with every page, draws you in, and keeps you turning pages until the very end.Were it all true, the background material would be worth reading even without the story. The book includes a mosaic of different cultures presented in enough detail to be convincing. There is a description of Chaco Canyon that should increase the number of tourists visiting NW New Mexico. (The Nageezi Chamber of Commerce will want a copy of this book.)The reader will learn a little about a lot of things from how to set a backfire to stop the spread of a wildfire to the use of chariots in battle, and more than one would expect about the terror birds that used to live in times past. Lovely creatures that will remind you of Kipling's line \\"Once we feared The Beast-when he followed us we ran\\" (The terror bird in this book is probably the Titanus Walleri.)And, after reading this story, you will only want right-handed hummingbirds in your garden. I kid you not.Yet there is a downside to this book, Niven and Pournelle have written a story that makes magic plausible leaving you with the guilty feeling you get from actually having liked a fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"A reviewer above said these books [Burning City and Burning Tower] appeal only to hardcore Pournelle & Niven readers, and added that even they should only buy the books at discount.I heartily disagree.It's not Shakespeare, it's not Conrad, but it's not silly or poorly written. While the plots are not as tight as some English & writing teachers would strive for in a writing class, I would not call them haphazard at all. And while some characterization is weak, I'm willing to accept that given the relatively large cast of characters in this book (Burning Tower) and its prequal. I found the characterization for the major characters and the descriptive writing to be pretty good. For something really bad, try reading \\"1865\\". Or rather....don't read '1865' or, '1910' for that matter.If the one or two poor reviews posted here have not dissuaded you from reading Burning Tower or Burning City, you might be interested in knowing that the background world is taken from a collection of stories titled \\"The Magic Goes Away\\". That book inspired a sequal \\"The Magic May Return\\".As reviews here have mentioned, magic was once common, but went away because it was made possible only with the presence of \\"manna\\". So people literally used up the manna and the magic went away.The first book (Burning City) tells the story of a young man who leaves a city that seems to be magic-poor, yet is still dominated by a fire-god and magic. He leaves the city has adventures and later returns. On one level it is a simple adventure/coming of age story. On another level it is abouthow a city/society is changed when it is exposed to the greater world.The second book (Burning Tower) is on one level a quest: Find out why the terror birds are attacking the caravans. On another level it is a love story about two people from different worlds. He is a Lord. She is a semi-nomadic trader. On an even higher level, it is about how people react when they realize a precious resource is going away. After you read this book, substitute the word \\"oil\\" for \\"manna\\" and then use your imagination.I found both books interesting and fun to read. Note: while Burning Tower stands on it's own, it obviously helps the reader to have first read Burning City."},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"This \\"Unicorns and Magic\\" book is in realty a clever telling of folk legends from the days long before the coming of white people to Southern California and Western Mexico. My only quibble is this is disclosed in the after-words (Notes),and I would wish it a preface. Start there.I want to read it again, but first I'll take in \\"The Burning City\\" the first book in this series. Events in the prior book in this series, are refrenced constantly in \\"Burning Tower.\\" However modern movies and books jump timelines regularly. Modern storytelling references events never written all the time. It really doesn't matter which book brings you to this saga.I had not previously read \\"The Burning City\\" when I picked up \\"Burning Tower.\\" I was at Orycon and felt like buying something to read (imagine that!). Knowing nothing about this or the prior book, I knew that I trusted Pournelle and Niven to tell a tale worthy of my time. I trusted them as authors and editors, both alone and especially together. \\"On the gripping hand\\" is their words, and you hear that all the time outside of fandom.I had misgivings about these authors doing a \\"Unicorns and Magic\\" book. Not my normal genre, nor I thought, theirs. Or so I thought. The first half of the book didn't pull me in, but didn't push me away either. The characters and situations were rich and textured, and I kept turning pages. The evil that the protagonists fight seemed a stretch but that was before I read the after-words in the \\"Notes\\" section.How did Jerry and Larry handle this genre? Just fine. You will love the ending.Legends are told and retold, heard and re-heard. That's what makes 'em legend. The wonderful discovery that these tales are based on real legends is significant. It is not necessary that you believe these stories. It is however vital that you understand: a hundred generations have."},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"\\"You don't know about me without you've read a book called\\" . . . Huck Finn's opening to his autobiography is particularly appropriate here. This book can't be enjoyed, almost not read, unless you have completed \\"The Burning City\\", its predecessor. For starters, your first question will be \\"what time period does this take place in?\\" A little research reveals you'll be many thousands of years off - in the wrong direction! Appearing at first like one of the standard post-nuclear holocaust fantasies, it turns out to be many millennia in the past. Niven and Pournelle have violated a guideline of trilogy writing. If you pick up this book assuming it's a \\"stand-alone\\" novel, you will be sadly disappointed. If you start it as a fantasy adventure story, you will find much excitement, adventure and, of course, travel. What's a fantasy story for if not to go on quests in distant lands? Well, that's not quite the case here.Location questions are dispelled by the maps provided. The story takes place in Southern California. In what's now called the Los Angeles Basin, there exists a multi-layered society. There are Lords and Ladies, Lordkin, who seem to be minor aristocrats, and the kinless - the bottom of society. As with today, bushfires are a matter of concern in this arid environment. A fire sets off this story in revealing the rivalry within the aristocrat clans and threats from other clan groups. Ameliorating this rather medieval scene are the merchants' wagon trains. To keep commerce flowing, wagon trains are pretty much left in peace, except by bandits - and \\"terror birds\\".The terror birds, which almost elude physical description, become the core of the story. They seem to be an archaeopteryx with an attitude. Having attacked the merchants' wagons, they've also destroyed whole villages and besieged a town. Having upgraded from solitary attacker to group assault, the birds are clearly becoming a serious threat. Are they being guided using magic? Lord Sandry joins the Feathersnake caravan to find out. He encounters the gypsy beauty queen Burning Tower [you never learn the source of the name] and romance flares. Oh, yes. As a virgin, Tower is allowed a \\"bonehead\\" - a unicorn - for a mount. It's all quite genre stuff. Sandry, the Hero of this tale, doesn't have a quest. He's just riding shotgun for the commercial travellers. Still, he's allowed some heroic activity with a bit of help from his [girl]friends.The framework of this fantasy fable is that \\"there's gold in them thar hills\\". Gold is one of the sources of \\"manna\\" [magic] that makes things happen in this rather disjointed tale. So is petrified wood. The problem with magic is that once introduced by an author[s], there are no limits to its use. Magic is available to certain types who use others as pawns in power struggles. In this bizarre Southern California environment, it is gods who wield that power most significantly. Unless they are turned into myths, which depletes their prowess. Magic, like gold in a later age, is being depleted. Dire predictions for the future permeate this story, and the result will surely be depicted in the next volume. However, i will not be learning the accuracy of the predictions. I haven't yet worked out how Atlantis found it's way to the Pacific Ocean before sinking, as this novel implies.

When it came, I spent a couple of late nights reading it. It is a fantasy set in somewhat familiar territory in pre historic Southern California. It combines magic, unicorns, Aztec legends and other elements in a highly entertaining, readable form. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"Thousands of years ago, the magic is running out. Although the firegod Yangin-Atep has 'gone mythical,' and manna is slowly seeping back into Tep's Town, throughout the world, manna is being used and once used, it cannot be replenished. But a few sources remain--and trade in manna-enabled objects remains central to the economies of the cities of what is now California. When huge birds begin attacking caravans and cutting off this trade, the leaders of Tep's Town send Sandry, a young lord, along with Burning Tower (the woman he loves), her half-sister and coyote-sired Clever Squirrel, as well as some mercenaries and a couple of 'Lordkin' to determine the source of the problem and to re-open the vital trade in magic.Terror birds had been known to caravaneers for ages, but never before had they organized. Clever Squirrel determines the only possible solution--they are being controlled by a god. But what god would want to destroy the profitable trade in manna-enriched items? And what can their trading party do against the power of a god? Their journey takes them across California and what is now the southwest U.S. to the mythical city of Aztlan--from whence Aztec culture descended. There's plenty of action and some clever plot twists along the way.Authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle continue the saga begun in THE BURNING CITY. The 'end of magic' motif adds poignancy to the story--and creates a bit of moral ambiguity as Sandry and Burning Tower learn the motives behind the terror bird attacks.BURNING TOWER is a solid and enjoyable adventure. I did think that the relationship stuff felt a bit like an add-on, designed to make the book appeal to the teenaged girl audience. It was easy enough to tune out, though, and didn't detract from the story.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Burning Tower","review":"These 2 books are fantasy novels set in a human prehistory in which magic exists. The twist to this idea is that magic is based on a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource called manna (what else). In some ways, this is an attempt at an allegory of contemporary dependence on petroleum products. Against the backdrop, Niven and Pournelle set a series of stories about a period when manna is really drying up. The first book, The Burning City, is a bildungsroman about a young man growing up in a relatively magicless community with an unusual social structure and his later adventures in the greater world. The second book, Burning Tower, is a quest story in which the heroes, related to the heroes of The Burning City, search for powerful wizards manipulating magic in a malignant way.These are not particularly well written books. Plots are haphazardly developed, characterization is weak, and good descriptive writing is conspicuous by its absence. The Burning City, in particular, is marred by some poorly developed allegory. Neither Niven nor Pournelle are gifted writers though some of their previous work, both individually and in collaboration, is considerably better than either of these books. Neither of these books come close to matching their best work, The Mote in God's Eye, a very good novel.Given these deficiencies, the books succeed or fail on the authors' ability to weave traditional mythology and prehistory into their premise. Here, they are only modestly successful. Their use of mythic elements is relatively superficial. I can recommend these books only to hard core Niven-Pournelle fans, and then only if they purchase these books at a discount."},{"Title":"Super Workbook: Grade 4","review":"I am a homeschooling mother and am always on the lookout for curriculum materials for my children. I had heard about these workbooks but did not think they could truly cover an entire year's course work. This book surpassed all my expectations. It could be a stand along curriculum, supplemented with some extra math and reading of library books. It does a wonderful job of covering every subject taught in elementary schools everywhere. It would also be excellent as a book to tutor students on the subjects they might be weak in.

So, if you're a movie buff, have an appreciation for this art, and can afford it, then great! If not, go whine somewhere else!"},{"Title":"Who Goes There?","review":"A collection of movie posters for the well-remembered sciencefiction films of 1950 - 1964? And sets of lobby cards tosweeten the pot? Well, the problem is that most of thescience fiction films from this period were ultra-low budget,which translates as to &quot;no money for art for posters,&quot; and&quot;no colorizing of stills used as lobby cards.&quot; And thattranslates further to, &quot;of very little visual interest.&quot;Not that there are not some good posters, but the good onesare all familiar. THE THING (7) features giant letters carvedapparently out of gobbets of raw flesh! INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS (38) features tiny images of running pairs ofpeople on a half-red, half-yellow background with asuperimposed hand print. The beautifully painted poster forATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN is not only a fine portrait of thesultry Allison Hayes, but depicts the largest &quot;squirrel shot&quot;in the history of urban civilization! But you've seen 'em.There is so little of real interest here that you'll findyourself killing time by counting the number of posters thatfeature monsters or robots carrying girls in a scandalous stateof undress. Having done that you may find yourself reducedto looking for posters in which the monsters or robots carry(or sort of brandish!) boys and adult males (all fully clothed,I am happy to say).If none of this sounds appealing, I suggest you save your money,and I wish that I had."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"If you love travel books and perfume, this is perfect. Celia Lyttelton takes her readers behind the scenes to scent sites around the world in her quest to not just create but understand her bespoke perfume. Her style is straightforward and conversational rather than flowery, which I found added punch to her descriptions of fragrance and place. She made me want to run out and sniff whole nutmegs and buttery iris bulbs.This is a book I'll read again and again."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"I bought this book because it joins two of my loves: perfume (and how it is created) and travel. However, as another reviewer noted, the book repeats much of the same things over and over again, but not consistently (ironically!). Words and concepts are mentioned well before they are explained. Historical context, statements, and notes are thrown in here and there, but in places where they don't \\"fit\\". Maybe one section, up front, to delve into the history, then another about processing operations, would be useful before the author starts traveling. Also, more description about the areas where the ingredients are grown/harvested, and how those people depend on the livelihood, would have fleshed the book out more. Some observations end up being shallow. As it is, it's not very in-depth. Still an interesting read, and her inclusion and interviews of some top fragrance developers (Lutens, Fragonard) was an excellent idea."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"I heard about this book when the author was a guest on Rick Steeve's radio show; given my love of travel and perfumes I figured it had to be a winner, so I ran right to my computer and ordered it!The book is the account of the author's quest for her own unique scent. It starts when she visits a perfumer to develop her own bespoke (custom) perfume. After choosing the various ingredients that she wanted (which mainly reflected her childhood in various exotic locales), she set out to travel the world, seeking out the genuine (as opposed to synthetic) ingredients for her scent.Over a two-year period she travelled to France, Italy, North Africa, India, Turkey, Yemen and the island of Socotro (and perhaps even more places that I'm forgetting) and managed to find pure, genuine sources of all the ingredients she wanted. If you're looking for a travel diary then you will probably be disappointed; the personal, travel diary-type pieces are mere asides, little snippets added here and there. The focus of the book is on the methods of perfume production, both traditional and modern; though she goes into detail about her experiences visiting the various exotic locales, it all ties directly in to her focused search for ingredients.The book should appeal to perfume lovers/nerds like me, although I don't know how many of us there are out there! And even then, its interest may be limited; Lyttleton necessarily limits her book to the ingredients she wanted for her own scent, which may not correspond to the ingredients a particular reader is interested in. For instance, I love gardenias in scent and would love to read about their cultivation and production in perfume; however, since that wasn't an ingredient in the author's own bespoke scent, it wasn't covered.All in all it was an interesting, fast-reading way to vicariously travel to exotic locales that I will probably never see. I doubt that I could afford my own custom-made scent, much less afford to spend two years traveling the globe chasing down the various ingredients. Nevertheless, the book made a nice intermission between other reading."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"I enjoyed reading about the fascinating people that Lyttelton meets on her journey. Also, Lyttelton does an excellent job of describing the scents from the exotic locations that she visited. Scent is difficult to write about, and this book is an example of excellent scent literature. Also, it makes you think about the connection between the farmers in obscure parts of the world and the essential oils that are used to create natural scents. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to develop a better understanding of perfume."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"Any perfume lover will enjoy reading about this passionate adventure and will identify with Celia Littleton's determined pilgrimage to the origins of the oils and resins of her custom perfume. Although some of her descriptions seem a bit too abbreviated, she does bring to life her obvious desire to seek scholarship and pay homage to the luscious and precious ingredients of her favorite fragrance materials. I commend her for her tenacious efforts; it is something very few perfume lovers could do. There are some surprisingly interesting observations and cultural facets in this book, and I found it quite compelling. All-in-all, I really enjoyed this journey with her. Thanks Celia, for doing what many of us can only dream of doing!"},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"\\"The Scent Trail\\" is a travelogue focused around finding the ingredients for the author's custom-created perfume. The first chapter talked about the process she went through to decide which scents to have the perfumer put into her perfume. She then traveled to France, Morocco, Turkey, Italy, Sri Lanka, India, Yemen, and Socotra to personally buy the ingredients for her perfume.Along the way, she gave snippets of interesting history and information about the perfume trade. We also learn about the countries (especially as regards the perfume trade) and the history of the perfume ingredients: mimosa, neroli, petitgrain, damask rose, iris, nutmeg, jasmine, vetivert, frankincense, myrrh, and ambergris. She also summarized the conversations she had with several perfumers and described tours of several buildings where the ingredients are distilled or made into concentrate or absolutes for the perfume trade. While there was a lot of interesting information, she rarely went into any depth on a topic.Her love of scents and travel came through strongly and made me want to smell the scents she described. However, I would have found some pictures helpful as I had a hard time picturing some of the places and things she described.People who are interested in both foreign countries and perfume will probably find this memoir/travelogue interesting.Reviewed by Debbie from Different Time, Different Place book reviews(differenttimedifferentplace. blogspot. com)"},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"The author is a world traveler, led around by her nose and her deep understanding of, and passion for, natural aromatics. Her vivid imagery and ability to describe a scent - which is actually a difficult skill - will waft you along on clouds of smoldering frankincense, sweet and deeply dark jasmine and buttery orris roots drying in the sun. This is one of the most evocative and delightful books I have ever come across on the hypnotic world of natural fragrances. It pulled me in like a suspenseful thriller, a page turner that I just couldn't put down."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"Take my opinion as such. But I noticed in the first pages that the author mentions gathering musk from musk deer as not harming the animals. They scrape it out of their scrotums.I'm quite interested in perfume, but I don't like people who see the world as a giant picnic table. I got that impression from this woman and it turned me off.Fascinating subject otherwise. Think I'll wait for another book though."},{"Title":"The Scent Trail: A Journey of the Senses","review":"This book is an easy read, but here and there it is a bit repetitive. The same processes are explained again and again. It is also a bit girlie here and there. I found something I didn't understand: from an aerial picture one was able to deduce that there were 42 kilograms of rosehedges in some part of Morocco. Bit odd, should have been miles or acres, but not kilograms... But the idea of travelling for scent is nice. Victoria Finlay did the same with Color (about pigments) and Jewels (about stones). All in all a reasonably amusing read."},{"Title":"The Scrolls from the Dead Sea","review":"Edmund Wilson, brilliant author and critic, describes the most exciting manuscript find of our time in a lucid account of the origin, discovery, and implications of the ancient Dead Sea scrolls, the first of which were found by Bedouin boys early in 1947. The significance of this dramatic discovery and its meaning to the history of Christianity and Judaism, and its relevance to modern Biblical research, is recounted in this absorbing narrative.The author visited the Dead Sea site and writes of scrolls and scholars with warmth and feeling, telling about the discovery of the scrolls, the environment, historical background, and the personalities involved. He traces the precarious journey of the scrolls from the hands of the Bedouin boys to the Syrian Metropolitan Samuel at the Monastery of St. Mark in Old Jerusalem. The Metropolitan purchased half the Hebrew manuscripts and brought them to the attention of interested scholars. The rest of the manuscripts were purchased by Professor Suk&eacute;nik of the Hebrew University in New Jerusalem. it was a spectacular find -- the oldest Biblical manuscripts yet known -- which included a complete copy of the book of Isaiah.One of these scrolls contained a Manual of Discipline evidently used by the Essenes, a pre-Christian monastic order, whose monastery has recently been excavated near the cave where the scrolls were found. Other caves were explored, and there has come to light what is apparently a whole library of the literature of the religious movement to which the Essenes belonged -- a literature which in some respects corresponds so closely with the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles that the latter are now thought to derive from it.A shorter version of the book appeared in The New Yorker, where it provoked exceptional response from readers of all religious denominations.One of the most distinguished literary critics writing today, Edmund Wilson is also a novelist, poet, and playwright. He is the author of The Triple Thinkers and The Wound and the Bow, and recipient of the 1955 Gold Medal for Essays and Criticism of The American Academy of Arts and Letters and The National Institute of Arts and Letters."},{"Title":"SAP SD Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations","review":"Before buying this book,I had high expectations because of price and author.

(speaking from experience).Pocket size book which cotains hardly any thing important.Please don't waste you time and money on this."},{"Title":"SAP SD Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations","review":"First, and frankly the most important thing to understand about interview questions books is that they help you save time. These books help you understand what deserves your attention and further reading, and what does not. These books help you understand what you need to learn, and what you can safely ignore. As an SAP consultant you can spend several hours each week, if not every day, learning about SAP. It is a major part of being an SAP person (especially a good one), and anything that you can do to reduce the amount of time you spend simply learning is very valuable to you. When you're spending time reading and not billing at a client, it can cost you about $100 each hour. That's expensive reading time! And so why would you even think twice about the cost of a $50 book if you think it will help you learn something valuable that you can apply at your job.Second, the SAP market is evolving. It is evolving in ways that demand SAP people understand more about the product we are working with - It's not uncommon to see requests for an \\"MM and SD\\" functional consultant these days. Also, in my consulting practice, I am focusing on SRM - but each day I am called upon to talk about MM, PP, PS, and other areas in SAP. I think that clients are less and less willing to hear, \\"Well that's a FICO issue - or that's an MM issue.\\"Finally, I use these books myself. Each time I'm asked a question that stumps me, and this happens all of the time (despite what my clients may think), I turn to my own books as a reference. A couple of weeks ago someone asked me a question about a work order in PM. As an SRM consultant, I had little exposure to work orders. So I grabbed my PM Interview Questions book, looked up work orders in the index, and the EXACT question someone asked me was answered in the PM book. So the SAP Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations series of books help save SAP people time because they show you what is important to learn, and I believe they help greatly in cross training - and so that's what these books are all about. They will save you time, and give you more knowledge about the SAP product. And the only group of people that don't want that to happen are consultants who want to keep their skills a secret!"},{"Title":"SAP SD Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations","review":"book was a great start on my SAP SD study program - I will sit for certification and glad to have read this masterpiece"},{"Title":"SAP SD Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations","review":"This book lacks quality and quantity.

What would the Americans find in VN few years after this movie was made? This book lets the reader know. What was Audie the celebrity like as a person? The details of his role (no pun intended) in the overall making of the motion picture The Quiet American as presented in the book answers that question, with gusto! I agree with the poster who said parts of this book read like a novel, the logistics and headaches encountered by director Joseph Mankiewicz in his almost Quixotic quest to do the picture on location, quite a story. Finally, there is also intentional unresolved drama of what might have been. What might have been for Audie Murphy's career if his attempt at expanding his range as an actor hadnt bombed so badly at the box office."},{"Title":"A Thinker's Damn: Audie Murphy, Vietnam, and the Making of the Quiet American","review":"I have an interest in war, Japanese and Asian affairs. Amazon recommended The Quiet American with Michael Caine. Somewhat a Caine fan, I ordered it and liked it for what it implied about early US involvement in Vietnam. Amazon then recommended the dvd version with Audie Murphy and Michael Redgrave which I tried. That was different. What was going on? What had Graham Greene really written? Ordered and read new Penguin edition. Both film versions took liberties. Why? Amazon suggested A Thinker's Damn by Willima Russo, which finally sorted out for me why the Murphy/Redgrave version differed from the Greene book. Russo also filled in a huge number of additional details and insights about this first film version. The two dvds and the two books provide a very good look at book to film adaptations, and three people's impressions about US policy in early Vietnam. I wonder if Russo has written about the Michael Caine version; it is the one I prefer, even though I am a fan of Michael Redgrave who portrays Fowler in the early film. A good number of photographs illustrate this book."},{"Title":"A Thinker's Damn: Audie Murphy, Vietnam, and the Making of the Quiet American","review":"The author spares no one and writes without malice, nor affection.

Everyone was treated with care and shown as they were.. This will be a book long treasured by film buffs for its frankness and honest appraisals.

Russo makes us feel how all these actors and crew worked so hard--knowing it was getting worse every day and the movie itself would not be what they wanted.

Russo covers--and uncovers--a lot of ground (some where bodies are buried!) in this detailed account of the making of the Quiet American. First, he paints a gripping picture of life and work in SE Asia in the period that's the calm before the storm. He breaths new life into the fading reputations of director and stars--especially the gorgeous but miscast leading lady. By all appearances well-researched, this history is peppered with intriguing nuggets of show-biz gossip. An interesting hybrid of scholarly and fan-mag writing. Highly recommended for film buffs and Murphians."},{"Title":"A Thinker's Damn: Audie Murphy, Vietnam, and the Making of the Quiet American","review":"What I like most about this book is that it takes a few months from 1957 on a film location and tells how it feels to be there.

Yes, they had some terrible times, with ego clashing and scandals covered up, but it is such a nostalgic little story, reading like a novel.

The movie The Quiet American was a special project for him, according to his best friend Willard Willingham. He soon hated doing it because Vietnam, even in 1957, was not a pleasant place before the war. This book reads like a novel but is all true. If you really want insights into Audie Murphy, you must read this book. Despite all that happened, he knew what he had to do. He was not just an actor. He was a hero--and in the Quiet American, he played the part to perfection.

She goes to the place where many say you can't go: home, again. Is small town, Texas any safer than urbania?Texas isn't Minneapoilis and Devon learns that she and her young son are no more protected from the twists of the World at her monther's ranch than they were in the city. She saves her son from a likely murder and herself from a rape when she kills her attacker. We can all imagine having to do that - Devon actually does so. Scarier than the now room temperature, would-be killer, is his mother. In the novel's best scene one protective mother, Devon, meets another; it will send you reeling.Devon finds something all of us want, but not the she she would have thought.

The memories of Minneapolis and her leering boss over the past year have made Devon weary and she feels her family ranch will be good for her and her son. Devon also feels a bit guilty about her mother being alone with the recent death of her father and feels the three generations will be good for one another. When they reach the ranch, the duo receives a hero's welcome.While driving without a spare, a flat tire leaves Devon and Jamie walking home on a deserted back road when John \\"Buddy\\" Colton offers a lift. Devon rejects the ride, but he hurts Jamie and tries to rape Devon. She manages to stop him by knocking him unconscious with a cane. Later she learns that he died from his injuries. As the sheriff investigate this case of self-defense, Devon struggles to recover from her feelings of insecurity that no where is safe.HOWL AT THE MOON is a deep relationship drama centering on a disturbed individual whom feels unsafe and inadequate due to the actions of others. The story line gets inside the damaged psyche of Devon who wants to remain hidden in her bedroom on the family ranch rather than face life's dangers any longer. Though Buddy is a bit stereotyped in his ugliness, fans will appreciate Polly Blankenslip's tale of a second chance to live life to the fullest on your only shot at it."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Dan Brown and other authors have inspired a new interest in DaVinci, freemasons, and templars. After our interests are piqued, many of us then seek to learn more about a newfound interest or obsession. After glancing through several books, I picked up The Templar Revelation.This book is informative and well researched. Ultimately I have only a slightly better understanding of what I was looking to discover. Of course, discovery is not always the fun part - sometimes the fun come in the research. This book is a masterful attempt at deciphering many things. My biggest impression of this book was, however, that my fairly impressive vocubulary was lacking in areas. I found this book well written and researched and do not dispute that it is a worthy read if this topic has snagged you - - however I also found it to be a difficult read at points.If you are searching for knowledge then pick this book up and scour it - it is FULL of information. However if you were inspired to read more after Dan Brown hooked you... well, you might want to stick with fiction rather than research. It's by far more entertaining..."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I readThe Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christexpecting another Holy Blood Holy Grail.

I also readThe Rozabal Linewhich provides a completely different \\"contrary position\\" to the one provided by Picknett.

Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. The theories expressed in this book should be compiled in the mind along with the writings of Henry Lincoln (&quot;The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....&quot; &amp; his more recent works), &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; by Knight &amp; Lomas &amp; the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right?If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:In \`Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew \`and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is \`not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, \`and then' His dead body was hung on a \`tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text.The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In \`I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made \`a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an \`idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was \`idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as \`The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\"Robert Rouche"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"So well done!, but obsolete. Knight &amp; Lomas (The Hiram Key, The Second Messiah) have pushed this topic much farther."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I bought this book to learn. I like new researchs and think established historians are too biased on their status quo to accept new interpretations. But reading this book I saw the authors just ignoring or changing facts to make their theories acceptable. For example, right at the beginning they say , about black madonnas \\"although these statues clearly still evoke huge, passionate followings, these are on a local scale and are NEVER officially recognized or supported by the Catholic Church\\". ( the word \\"never\\" is in italics in the original). Please, a simple google search will show all the Black madonnas supported by the church. But I will cite only the one I know best, being in my own country, the Black Virgin of Brazil, Nossa Senhora de Aparecida, has a statue found in 1717, in 1904 Pope Pio X signed the decree of coronation of the statue, in 1929 Pio XI declared her the Patron Saint and Queen of Brazil, in 1967 Pope Paul VI gave a Golden Rose to its shrine and in 1980 Pope John Paul II consecrated the new cathedral built to house it during his trip to Brazil. So much for lack of church support or recognition. And there are plenty more like the Lady of Guadalupe, etc. So, now how can one believe any argument they put forward with the black madonnas and associated cults?This is only one instance of , at best a sheer lack of research or at worst a clear case of wanting to fit their theories at cost to the truth.Also, the authors ramble too much. In almost every page they write something like \\"We'll discuss it later\\" or \\"more about it later\\". That is poor structure. When you get to that information there was so much rambling in between you forgot what it was all about.There are better books out there on the subject. Don't waste your money on this one"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book, referenced by the fictional work \\"The DaVinci Code\\", stands alongside \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail\\" (Baigent, Lee) as one of the seminal books that throw back the veil on the cult of the Magdelane and the pagan roots of Christianity. It is not easy reading; the writing is more akin to an academic paper than to a pop non-fiction treatise on the subject. (The comprehensive bibliography and appendix attest to as much.) The revelations are startling. The implications, even for people who consider themselves agnostic or cafeteria christians, have the potential to shake your very core."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a wonderful book that I understood easily and found astonishing.

That the Freemasons are the theoritical descendents of the Knights Templar is not a new theory; however, the idea that the Priory of Sion, an anti-Semitic group with links to the Nazi Party of Germany, having been the moving force behind the Knights Templar is a little hard to swallow. Why, if I may be so bold, if the doctrinal theory behind the Priory of Sion is Egyptian and Isian, is it anti-Semitic when the Jewish religion has little to do with Egyptian religion? A great deal of time is spent on the different writings involving the quest for the Holy Grail. It has been proven that the King Arthur/Knights of the Round Table/Quest for the Holy Grail is the beginning of the violent anti-Semiticism that eventually led to HaShoah. The author does not attempt to explain this anamoly. Surely, if the basis for these is the Isian religion and the &quot;inner circle&quot; of these groups are in agreement with the Talmud about the reason for Jesus' execution, they would not be persecuting the Jews but joining forces with the Jews against the Church. The authors need to do some explaining along these lines."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The authors claim to have the correct answer to all the mysteries. However, by the end of the book, all that's left is the mystery of why you bothered to purchase this tripe. Lots of questions, lots of promises, but no answers.

It really is a superb piece of historical investigation. Shame the public didn't catch on to this one instead of Dan Brown's rip off. The key point of the book is that the real indentity of Christ, as far as the Knights Templar and other heretical groups were concerned, was not Jesus, but John the Baptist. The implication being that they could not have been as interested in protecting the so-called bloodline of Jesus as the Holy Blood, Holy Grail writers have suggested. The only down side to the book is that they get lost in Isis-Osiris speculation half way through it, and are at a loss to explain the significance of Mary Magdalene to the heretical tradition."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"With the proposition of finding information concerning the secret identity of Jesus Christ, the last thing I considered was not being able to finish the book.

Under the subject category of \\"heretics\\" I found \\"The Templar Revelation.\\" The book proposes that there was a unique relationship among Jesus, John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene. The authors also claim that the Roman Catholic Church suppressed this information by suppressing the people who they considered heretics and suppressing their texts.The authors claim that Jesus was a disciple of John the Baptist, and that John's teachings were similar to the Egyptian myths of Isis and Osiris. To support this claim, the authors point out how many stories in the New Testament are adaptations of those found in other religious traditions. In addition, Jesus is one in a line of many dying-and-rising gods. Another claim is that Mary Magdalene had a sacred sexual relationship with Jesus, in keeping with their religious beliefs, and as his \\"initiator\\" into the sacred mysteries had an equal relationship to Jesus."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book is a MUST for anyone interested in the truth about the origins of Western relgion. It provides a fresh look at what have previously been thought of as facts. The reader is encouraged to seriously contemplate the ideas presented here and form their own INFORMED opinion. I love the way the authors continually refer back to things they've previously presented, because there is so much information that it would be very difficult to keep it straight otherwise. Although I have yet to read the other highly acclaimed books on this subject, I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with this book. Yes, it is a collection of theories. No one is arguing that it is the &quot;gospel&quot; (sorry, couldn't help it),not even the authors from what I could tell when I read it. Of course they are going to present what they think is the truth. Isn't that what scholars do? They word most of what they say as not to present it as fact. Many &quot;factual statements&quot; they make are usually prefaced by &quot;If...is true, then...&quot; so as to show what they BELIEVE are the logical conclusions to what they have found. At least they did present other arguements, even if they do attempt to disprove them, and their bibliography is EXTENSIVE, so anyone wishing to research for themselves is quite capable after reading this. I pride myself on learning as much as I can about my religion and others, especially when that knowledge gives me some intellectual ammunition against &quot;Bible-thumpers&quot; who have never read anything their priest or pastor didn't approve of first. You'd think that if these theories were incorrect that they would at least read it first(ALL of it!)and then attempt to construct a sound arguement against it, instead of saying &quot;Oh, dear&quot;, not finishing it, and saying it is poorly researched without giving even ONE example as to how. How, indeed! HOW am I supposed to know these detractors KNOW it is poorly researched if they don't give examples. I mean, come on, we do have 1000 words to play with here.

They misquote theologians and biblical scholars as to the nature of Jesus as well as present theories from the last century as cutting edge. They go so far as to quote the Nag Hamadi Library, wich is full of texts of a very late date, as being on an equall footing with the Cannonical godspels, and ignor that several scholars both discount the so called &quot;gnostic&quot; gospels and date the synoptics earlyer than they do. Not only that but this book is full of slopy historical scholarship about the mediaeval world. For example, the details of the council of Viene, where the Templars were tried, are glossed over. That the council existed isn't even adressed directly. Rather, they present a picture of rapid and descicive action by both the Papacy and the French Crown. The reality was that the Pope reacted to the arrest of the Templars as a threat to his authority and drug his feet. That the French Kings had long used &quot;hearisy&quot; as a charge to gain power over the Church, and that the loss of the Templars would have put the Papacy in an extreamly difficult possition both militarily and economically are both ignored, if the authors even knew of theses facts. They also miss the facts about the anomosity many in Europe felt towards the Tempalars. It was widely felt that they had &quot;sold Jerusalem&quot; to the Muslems, and had betrayed the Christian Cause. When these things are added to the fact that they treat such odd sources as Masonic Sermons and Occult books as valid sources only goes to underscore their total lack of historical verasity and qualifications to write history."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I love these kinds of books.

This book is very much in the 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' vein of modern occult miasmata.What's more the authors do not hesitate to bend, stretch and wilfully distort data to fit their preconceptions. One small but telling example is the way in which they misrepresent the Hermetic teachings of Libellus IV of Corpus Hermeticum: \\"If you do not first hate your body, my son, you cannot love yourself...\\" With breathtaking intellectual dishonesty the authors mangle and invert this citation, misquoting it to fit their dubious meanderings about 'sacred sex.

That was the only good thing about the book.I don't have a problem with the fact that Jesus may have been married to Mary Magdalene because He is still my Lord and Savior regardless; but I have a huge problem with the book calling Him One Who practiced the Egyptian religion: that is utter blasphemy! The Son of the Father practicing religion of the gods of the Egyptians?? He just then broke the 1st Commandment: &quot;Thou shalt have NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.&quot; Well, according to my Bible, Jesus Christ always did what was pleasing in His Father's Sight and kept all the laws without fault and did good deeds on the Sabbath which were not a sin in themselves. He never practiced the Egyptian religion: that is ludicrous.This book seeks nothing else but degrading Him into anything but God and making Him into a sinful Man; but then, what else is new because this book was written and researched by people who's eyes are spiritually blinded to the truth of Jesus Christ: He is God Incarnate Who died for sinners--John 3:16.What I find extremely interesting is that Jesus Christ predicted the Fall and Destruction of Jerusalem and it's temple because the religious leaders of that day rejected Him and eventually crucified Him. That prediction came true in A.D.70. Have any of the gods of this world ever done anything like that?Jesus Christ was the Seed promised to Abraham according to Genesis 17. He was the Prophet greater than Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15). He has fulfilled ALL of the prophecies of the Old Testament as the True Messiah Who is also the God/Man.John the Baptist was NEVER against Christ: He said about Christ when He saw Him coming down to the River Jordan, &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God Who taketh away the sin of the world.&quot; (John 1:29). That doesn't sound like someone who hated Him but extolled Him instead.If you want to find the truth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, read the Bible from cover to cover.

And it worked excellent - every point the authors are making can be explained otherwise, quite according to the mainstream history.When the authors argue about occult Christianity being spread in medieval Europe, why can't the same events be explained by well-known attachment of the population to ancient cults? They choose to forget that the rites they mention include not only Magdalene-like goddess, but many other deities as well, without any parallels in the NT.Some of their conclusions are just funny. For example, they believe that John was the only baptizer in Judea, because his name is THE Baptist. By this token, Judah the Galilean must be the only person in Galilee.Many assertions are plain inaccurate, like when they write that ritual washing was unknown to mainstream Judaism - contrary to many mikvah pools existing around the Temple.Wild suppositions, made by the authors, after a few pages tend to be presented as certain things, and the authors proceed to build their theory upon them.The level of scholarship involved is clearly seen in the Bibliography section. The total number of books is ridiculously small, and even of those most belong to alternative historians."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Picknett and Prince make some points &amp; raise some valid questions, but the book is somewhat disappointing. The best part of this book was their sight seeing \\"adventures\\". They tell us Jesus was a rival of John The Baptist, and a practitioner the Egyptian religion. That his message was altered by the church which hid the importance of Mary Magdalene in the church. The authors also make a point of how ignorant most Christians are about the origins of their own theology. They then ask us since Christianity emphasis's is on &quot;faith&quot; (belief with no proof), why should the existence of proof that Jesus survived the crucifixion, was married and had children make any difference? The book dances around the agenda of the Priory of Sion and the secret of Rennes le Chateau. They muse at times about these topics, but never deliver any answers.I did however read a book recently that didn't dance around its topics, and it gave me a lot of answers concerning religion. It also gave me a lot to think about. It dealt with such subjects as different religions, the Christ Consciousness, angels and the angel worshipping society we live in today, Hell and its different levels, and much more.

The current work opens with a fascinating disclosure about Leonardo de Vinci, and closes powerfully with the 'revelations' about Mary Magdalene and the 'initiates' of a Jesus-Egyptian mystery school. Prince and Picknett point out that some of Jesus's own disciples didn't really understand what he was teaching, and this book takes us one step closer to the reason why the Templars and Prieure de Sion venerate Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist above all. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a book about Jesus, the development of Christianity, and the origins of certain heresies and secret or occult traditions. The authors share some interesting theories concerning Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and John the Baptist, supporting their ideas with some thought-provoking evidence from a wide range of sources. Special attention is afforded to the beliefs and traditions of certain well-known secret societies and religious sects.The first half of the book is less compelling than the second, and deals with a few of the more curious historical characters, myths and legends that are often associated with these topics, and the authors offer a few novel insights. It is worthwhile persevering until the second half of the book, which presents some very interesting theories and is rich in intriguing scraps of information, scriptural contradictions, conspiracy theory, and unsolved mysteries.Despite the title, the main focus of the book is not the Templars. However, anyone with an interest in the Templars, the history of the crusades, or the occult, should appreciate that experts continue to debate whether or not the alleged Templar heresy was genuine; where the heretical ideas originated and how they might have fitted in with the pursuits of a medieval Christian monastic military order. Some light is shed on these questions in this text, although the authors inexplicably seem to avoid actually stating some of the connections that they appear to be alluding to...This book is easy to follow, informal and sometimes entertaining, packed with interesting information and ideas, and I would suggest it to any reader who would like to read around the subjects discussed."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"At first I found this book too interesting to put down. It presents as supported facts many things which I had wondered about to begin with. Unfortunately, as I got deeper into the book, I became increasingly more disappointed at the authors' way of making their points and drawing their conclusions. In my circle of friends, we have a term called &quot;reaching.&quot; It is used to describe someone who &quot;streches&quot; things a bit too far to be believable. This book does this repeatedly. They present a handful of facts, them present several theories that appear to be presnted objectively, but then they have an annoying tendency to turn around and presnt the theory that they hold as correct as though it were fact. The phrase &quot;as we have seen&quot; is far overused in this book. For example, they present the facts, suggest a variety of ideas based on these facts (or lack of facts), and then continue to draw more conclusions on the basis that these ideas are facts. By the time you reach the end of a section, the conclusions drawn are so far-fatched in lilght of the presented facts that it is obvious that the authors are &quot;reaching&quot; as far as they can. I have to say that I did find the book a good read, and that if the data was not stretched so far this book would've received 5 stars. But anyone reading the book should definitely go into it with an open mind and pay close attention to semantics. You can stop reading my review here, because following will be only examples of how they reach their final conclusions. In the first chapter of the book, they present Leonardo da Vinci and the &quot;secret code&quot; that they beleive him to use in his artwork. They, for example, describe his rendering of the Last Supper, and give and interesting interpretation of this work. But the reader must bear in mind that a person's interpretation of something is just that: one interpretation. In fact, they state themselves that their own interpretation goes contrary to da Vinci's own notes on the painting. They point out that the figure which is supposed to be St John appears to be a woman. They draw the conclusion that the distance between this &quot;female&quot; figure and Jesus represents something, but they do not elaborate on what it is supposed to represent. They then allege that there is the letter &quot;M&quot; in the picture made by the bodies and clothing of Jesus and this figure, and they obviously beleive that this implies that da Vinci wanted to identify the figure as Mary Magdalene, and not St. John. The appearance of this &quot;M&quot; is debatable, and the conclusion, if there is an M, that it is meant to identify Mary is &quot;reaching,&quot; and this is the only interpretation the present. They also state that in several of da Vinci's paintings he depicts himself. In each of these paintings that picture both Leonardo da Vinci and Jesus, da Vinci portarys himself with his back turned on Jesus. The authors present this as evidence that da Vinci belonged to another &quot;underground&quot; version of Christianity that did not hold Jesus in such high esteem. Their failure to point out that this portrayal of himself could merely be an indication of his self- proclaimed atheism is puzzling. They go on later in the book to give more theories in this manner based on a lack of facts rather than on facts. They then present these theories as though they were facts in order to substantiate their next conclusion. To further complicate matters, they use verses from the bible to support their arguments, but when I have checked the references, I do not find the wording they use in any translation of the bible that I have come across. (and I looked in several) This gives the appearance of misquoting their sources, and it only serves to discredit more of the book. I truly wish I knew what translation of the bible they used. I must add, however, that their conclusions may not be completely bogus, for some of the conclusions that they have draw have much in common with conclusions that I have drawn myself in my own (rather extensive) studies."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Once I got started I just could not put this book down. 'The Templar Revelation' explores the often misty background of ancient and medival history. If you feel the need to protect sacred articles of faith this book is not for you. If you are looking for a fresh new perspective on western mythical and religious heritage this book will fascinate. The book certainly delivers on its title subject, the Templars ... but goes MUCH farther. You are definitely in for more than what you might judge by&quot;~ this book's cover. Picknett &amp; Prince cut to the bone with suggestions that the Dead Sea Scrolls were not the devotional material of any one particular religious group; the Essenes - but could just have been a collection rescued from the library at Jerusalem ... and not only that heretical themes are present in the work of Leonardo da Vinci - but that the Shroud of Turin was actually an early experiment of Leo's in photography. looking for something new - and did I find it!

Now, that doesn't mean its true, some books are so addictive for their silliness. But this book, like many others similar to it (the hiram key), presented thesises that seem to have some substance to them somewhere internally, however usually unlikely parallel to the author's conclusion. However the scholarship on this book is much better than say, The Hiram Key, and the research done much better, relying on some scholars who are reliable (Golb, Crossan) though some who are anything but that.(Thiering, Schonfield) Obviously, this book's conclusions are certainly heretical to Christianity, though some of its statements even &quot;heretical&quot; to the paradigms of history. I mean by this notions that Jesus' religion was not Judaism, but an Egyptian mystery school. Overall, this book presents many convincing arguments that make you reconsider some conceptions (Again I reluctantly put down the Hiram Key in juxtaposition...none of the Hiram Key worried me at all, I was impressed by its theory and authors, but not scholarship and research..sadly, it really was a good book..) One strong argument for the historical implications was the modern existance of a religion venerating John the Baptizer of Jesus, not only that but going as far as enmity between the Christ and their sect.All in all it is without a doubt in my mind worth further research, because they certainly have made connections between subjects, but any of the conclusions of the connections are speculative, perhaps biased. But, some of the information was new news and revelation to me, so I must admit it remains the best book I've read recently and you should take a look into its claims as well.You'll also find some cool things hidden in &quot;The Last Supper.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I am an avid reader of &quot;alternative theory&quot; or &quot;speculation&quot; or whatever it's called these days. &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot; is another intriguing dip into the tidal wave of books in the past fifteen years that deal with the Jesus/Mary/Knight Templars/Priory of Sion/Rennes le Chateau mystery. Some new twists are added, some new information is brought to light, and some new interpretation is presented here that may very well be closer to the truth than what society deems &quot;gospel.&quot; But I have a problem with the petty squabbling that is apparent here in this book.I have also read both &quot;The Hiram Key&quot; and &quot;The Second Messiah&quot; by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas. In &quot;The Second Messiah&quot; Knight and Lomas disagree with Picknett and Prince's theory on the Turin Shroud in order to support their own theory. And thus vanity rears its ugly head. In &quot;The Templar Revelation.&quot; Picknett and Prince are obviously familiar with &quot;The Hiram Key&quot; because they do indeed make a couple referrals it; only in the negative. But &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot; uses current theories on the Templars and Rosslyn Chapel that are in COMPLETE ACCORD with Knight and Lomas' theories, and yet obviously avoid giving Knight and Lomas credit. Oh dear, their feelings must have been hurt. BUT THEN, Picknett and Prince turn around and do the exact same thing to Richard Andrew and Paul Schellenberger's &quot;The Tomb of God,&quot; where they, in an appendix, needlessly slam the book into the mud.The truth is out there, folks. And so, I suggest, that if the authors wish to bicker and argue, that they choose the ESTABLISHED ACADEMIA as their target, that they attack conservative and stultifying scholarship and religion and leave the authors alone who's writing, plausible or not, at least OPENS OUR MINDS TO ALTERNATIVE POSSIBILITIES. Heated debate IS GOOD. Don't be so closed minded towards your own theories - YOU MIGHT BE WRONG! This type of close-mindedness rings too close to the Roman Catholic Church and should not be in the presence of &quot;Truth Seekers.&quot; Though I enjoyed &quot;The Turin Shroud&quot; immensely, and &quot;The Templer Revelation&quot; is indeed food for thought (as is &quot;The Hiram Key&quot; and &quot;The Tomb of God&quot;), I do have this to say to Picknett and Prince: as they say here in NYC - &quot;You're not all that.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a remarkable book which tells the story of a search to discover 'just how deep the rabbit hole goes.' It is not a book detailing original research, but a heavily footnoted journey with a jaw-dropping ending. The research has all been done by biblical scholars, anthropologists and sociologists in the last century or so, and it's out there for everybody to see - that is, if they care to. What these authors have done is connect the dots for us in a way that narrowly focused research cannot. Many scholars have developed pieces of this puzzle, but this is the first time I have seen them assembled in this manner. Having read some of the popular new agey titles like 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail', 'The Temple and the Lodge', 'The Hiram Key', 'Born in Blood' as well as several of the 'boiler plate' templar histories, it was refreshing to find out where the others blew it. When information is concealed this deeply, misdirection is always a possible pitfall. The authors have done well to avoid a fascination with superficial surprises, which could have derailed others. Their story is tight, the 'i's dotted and the 't's crossed. Anybody who thinks that this story doesn't fit the research, or that there are leaps in logic, had better work on their attention span.There is a great deal more to this book than the first chapter on Leonardo da Vinci, but he and many others showed us their ideas in ways that could only be seen by those who were bright enough or educated enough to comprehend. I wish there had been more about the templars, because they were all about learning, which was something that the Church could not tolerate. The Church had to determine who would be allowed to learn and the exact things they would be allowed to learn. Even possessing a bible in medieval times could get you executed. The Church has always been antagonistic towards knowledge of any kind, and now it is no wonder why. Fortunately, the most brilliant minds in Europe were able conceal and even pass on their knowledge right in the faces of the cretins and thugs that populated the high offices of Christianity. I had 12 years of religion classes in primary and secondary Catholic schools, and all I can say is, thank God for the Protestant Reformation."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book started off great. The research was thorough, and the authors presented extremely good evidence of the beliefs of followers of the Priory of Sion (including the Templar Knights), the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians. This from a Fundamentalist Christian who, by the way, laughs at the nonsensical and ignorant slams by some of the &quot;intellectual and enlightened&quot; reviewers of this book. The disappointing part comes when the authors try to convince us that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a sexual relationship, based on the Isis religion from Egypt that had similarities in its teachings and rituals that Jesus used. I don't blame them for wondering if Jesus and Mary Magdalene had that kind of a relationship. It's a fair question. But they ask the question, speculate &quot;what if....&quot;, and then later on they say, &quot;now that it has been established that Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a sexual relationship,&quot; or &quot;Now that we've shown that Jesus was an initiate in the sex rite ceremonies&quot; or whatever the wording was. But what a leap of faith, from pure speculation to &quot;this is a fact.&quot; No proof whatsoever. What I personally saw in the authors' findings is the fact that if Jesus was who he claimed to be, then it would only make sense that he would be aware of and have studied all of the old religions; because what he did with the Old Testament faith was to tell the people that they were misinterpreting it and/or misusing it. And he came to correct that. Why not the same thing with the ancient Egyption religion? What stood out for me was that they understood the &quot;marriage&quot; of the masculine and feminine in all things, physical, mental/emotional and spiritual. They realized that God had the attributes of both, and would be incomplete without one or the other. HOWEVER, Jesus would not have endorsed promiscuity with something as sacred as the sexual union between a man and his wife, who in effect join with God in becoming co-creators when they produce a child. Furthermore, I am completely unconvinced that it would have been thought improper for Jesus to have chosen to live a celibate life himself. They stated that as fact, and presented absolutely no evidence. The other thing that was completely unconvincing was their contention that John the Baptist and Jesus had a rivalry. Their disciples had a rivalry; and both John and Jesus corrected them on that at one time or another. Jesus and John were obviously not interested in competing. When John asked his question after being thrown into jail, that was normal. He'd believed Jesus to be the prophesied messiah, but now that he was about to die, he wanted to know for sure. How can the authors state unequivocably that this meant that John had changed his mind, and was replacing Jesus, or had turned against him? Ridiculous conclusion. All in all, I must say that the book was extremely interesting, and I recommend that people read it; just remember to think for yourselves."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The first few chapters of this book were an outright disappointment. Having recently read 'The Hiram Key' and 'The Second Messiah' by Knight &amp; Lomas, I found 'The Templar Revelations'' interpretation of the roots of the Shroud of Turin to be far less convincing than those offered by the aforementioned authors.However, I persevered and I recommend any prospective readers do the same.The insights this book offers regarding the Esoteric/Alchemaic/Johannite traditions which have covertly spanned Europe's past generations are well worth appreciating.However, Leonardo as Shroud fabricator? I don't think so."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The best parts of this book are the descriptions of the Magdalene and John the Baptist cults in the South of France, plus the chapters on Rennes-les-Chateaux, all of which would make a great itinerary for a vacation in that part of the world. There definitely seem to have been some odd things going on in Provence and the Languedoc over the years, but whether any of this really matters much these days is questionable. I was, however, appalled to find out that the Albigensian Crusade was led by Simon de Montfort, who was portrayed as being something of a hero in my history lessons many years ago back in England. I guess it points to the key fact that history tends to get written by the victors. The descriptions of the early history of Christianity in the book are also very thought provoking, but given the passage of time, and the deliberate suppression of alternative thinking by the Church of Rome, a lot of the authors' theories are based on fragments of information and some fairly wide leaps in logic, and are therefore highly conjectural. It does seem that Jesus was not all he is made out to be by the Church, however. This has been profferred by other authors also, including Knight and Lomax, in &quot;The Hiram Key&quot; and &quot;The Second Messiah&quot;. I also find Picknett &amp; Prince's obsession with the Priory of Sion a bit off-putting, not being much of a conspiracy theorist. It's really hard to believe that anyone would bother to keep something like the Priory going through the centuries, particular if the bottom line is the revelation that Jesus was a priest in an Isis cult. Anyway, &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot; makes for a good read, if one remains objective about the topic."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I got this book cos I was researching information about the Templars. After the first few pages I'd had enough. Some books are well written and seem to invite you through them, seducing you as you go along - and some aren't and don't. This book doesn't. It's monumentally badly written which, I guess, is intentional. On one hand its an insult to an intelligent persons intelligence, but on the other its brilliantly confusing and uses plenty of \\"proof\\" (I use speech marks because I found myself asking time and time again \\"this is your idea of proof?\\") to give weak and lazy thinkers some really polemic fodder for throwing into conversations at dinner parties - which is probably who their target audience are.If you asked the two writers to defend their arguments one by one to a bright high school debating group they would be torn to shreds and their evidence thrown into question. This is a shame, cos they have collected so much information, done so much work, talked to so many people, and put together some really interesting ideas that they really shoot themselves in the foot by trying to be too \\"clever\\". Their ideas - about John the Baptist (I'm still not sure exactly what their point about him is) being the real Christ, and Jesus (who maybe didn't die after all) being some kind of Egyptian sun worshipper that preached a modified form of an Egyptian religion that is today called \\"Christianity\\", and that only a handful of members of weird and secretive religious orders (that worship Johns head) know this - are very interesting and could give you hours of fun checking them out on the internet. At worst, even if you did try and verify their ideas and found them to be \\"tenous at best\\" you will definitely have become much more knowledgeable than you were about the early Christian era, Christian relics, medieval history, secret societies and Egyptian religions. I know I have! So in a way this book has been an excellent teacher - even if I didnt actually learn anything from the book itself.Resuming... INHO the way the book is put together implies they had the (brilliant) controversial conspiracy theory idea first, then looked for evidence to back it up later - even if that meant generalizing, distorting and omitting anything inconvenient.If someone has a theory that holds water - and which they really and truly want people to accept and take seriously - then the best idea is to simplify it and communicate it to people. This book does exactly the opposite. But I'm sure anyone that pretends to understand it will impress all his or her friends with their in depth interpretation of Da Vinci's Last Supper. Until, that, is someone who actually looked at a colour picture of the painting (or saw it on the wall) rather than the totally illegible black and white thumbprint picture in the book gives another interpretation (...)My advice: borrow it if you just want to read it, or buy it second hand if you want to have it in your bookcase. At least that way it will look like you actually read it to the end. (...)"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Jesus and John the Baptist may have been rivals, The Knights Templar may have worshipped some pagan god named Baphomet, and the Knights Templar and Masons worship John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene over Jesus. These are just a few of the theories found in The Templar Revelation. Oh wait I forgot the one about Mary Magdalene possibly being a priestess in an Isis Cult and Jesus being initiated into the High Magick mysteries by her! If you are into conspiracies you'll love this book.Its a fun read for people who don't take their Christian roots all too seriously. But I can see how its totally offensive to those who do. The one downside is the book can take a while to get through.In the end they come to no real conclusions just a lot of crazy theories which are quite entertaining. Some other titles that may be of interest are Jesus and the Lost Goddess and The Jesus Mysteries by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy, which I would trust more for facts."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"There is a lot of fiction written about the supposed history of the Templars and if you like that kind of thing, all well and good. However if you want to know the true facts about the Templars, as apposed to speculation, I would suggest that you look elsewhere at other books, such as those written by Barber or Piers Paul Read."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"It was difficult to get through this book. First of all, the writing style skips around. This book wants to be a serious work of nonfiction, but the authors keep drifting in and out of a diary style of writing, as if we cared how long the ride from Marsailles to Nice is. What's worse, they tend to start every third sentence with \\"we\\", so after a while the writing style starts to irritate the reader.The writing style is not the only problem. The content of this book is laughable. The authors make numerous claims without support or evidence. In fact, most of the theories in this book are based on speculation. To give an example, they often start a line of argument with the phrase \\"it could be imagined\\" or it is entirely possible\\", and then present one of their theories. A few sentences later, they then take the previous speculation as pure fact and then build their arguments on that. It is nothing but a house of cards. Also, it should be noted that the authors are self-proclaimed paranormal investigators--hardly a source of serious knowledge. Any educated person would laugh or moan on reading the theories presented in this book and the so-called evidence they bring to the table to prove them. Save your money and buy another book. Any other book. It couldn't be worse than this."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I couldn't put this book down and it seemed to go on forever. It is loaded with information, much of it new to me. I found the whole Jesus, Mary Magdaline, John the Baptist political rivlary senario very interesting. I also found the Black Madonna cult research quite facinating.One thing that kept popping up for me as I read the book was a sense of anger from the author. I'm not sure what that was about but it was mildly unsettleing."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one.The theories expressed in this book should be compiled in the mind along with the writings of Henry Lincoln (&quot;The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....&quot; &amp; his more recent works), &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; by Knight &amp; Lomas &amp; the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right?If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:In \`Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew \`and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is \`not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, \`and then' His dead body was hung on a \`tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text.The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In \`I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made \`a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an \`idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was \`idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as \`The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\""},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I have mixed feelings about writing a review on this book, The Templar Revelation. I thought it was so bad, that I just wanted to throw it out and forget about it, but I felt I should warn others, as there appears to be a few favorable reviews posted here. I had hoped this book would provide some interesting insight into the Knight's Templar, but much of the book is devoted to a derogatory attack of the historical accuracy of the Bible. I have read several books on that topic lately, but what is exceptional about this one is the total lack of scholarship. Picknett and Prince leave no monotheistic religion or fraternal organization unscathed, I think one can find something to offend just about anyone in this book. As for the Templar's they only provide the usual Rennes-le-Chateau, Priory of Sion, black Madonna theories that so many other books of this genre kick around. The big Templar secret is that John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene should have been the New Testament protagonists, and not Jesus. Despite overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary, P&amp;P believe this to be the Templar's little secret. Why do books like this get published? Oh, I know, I bought this book - I just hope others interested in purchasing this know up front what they are getting."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"What can I say about this book? If you enjoy reading rags like the National Enquirer in the States, or anything that is passed for a news rag here in London, this is the book for you because you will believe anything. I half expected Elvis to show up in the ancient paintings they were \\"interpreting\\".The book is supposedly a shocking expose, which illuminates ancient secrets hidden for thousands of years, all of which provide information contrary to the Bible. OK, I am intrigued. So, I pick up the book and after several stops and starts because it is so incredibly dull, I manage to force my way through it. I was shocked; they did get that right. But shocked that their theories were built on such flimsy and obviously biased wishful thinking. Oh, but wait that's not all: they then base even more theories on top of these weak foundations. You will get used to reading several \\"one might assume\\", and \\"if this was true, then this might be' kinds of reasoning on every page. The photos are interesting, and some of the theories (especially the Jesus and Mary - Isis God theory) are worth reading if only for a laugh.This book is so bad; it is almost good in a \\"B\\" horror movie kind of way. I could almost see those chaps on Mystery Theatre 3000 in the foreground making wisecracks along the way. Good reading if you have literally nothing else to do.

The truth is that Picknett and Prince rarely attack the religion head-on; they present what they perceive as facts and their personal conclusions base on them. The book is never forceful in its assertions that Christianity is immoral or wrong; however, it does present fascinating facts and connections that should make a Christian question the origins of his or her religion. In fact, they praise the Osiris/Isis religion (similar to Christianity - the difference being that Osiris and Isis don't actually have to exist and women share an equal role with men) for its message.This book is not propaganda; it's a presentation of knowledge and perceived conclusions...nothing more."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"An interesting book that I read in one evening.

I'm one of those people who enjoys having my beliefs challenged because I think it makes my faith stronger in the end. I don't agree with most of what's written but I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince-authors of TURIN SHROUD-have arrived at some unorthodox conclusions in THE TEMPLAR REVELATION. The authors say that TR grew out of research on the Turin Shroud. Like their prior book, TR is based on a review and synthesis of information from a wide array of mostly secondary sources. In addition to a well footnoted text, the authors include a bibliography as well as two sections of photographs.Picknett and Prince suggest that what really happened in the first century C.E. regarding Christianity has been obscured over the past two millennium by various political forces including the Roman Catholic Church. Furthermore, they say they have uncovered what may be the \\"true\\" and \\"shocking\\" story of John the Baptist. And, they suggest the Templars may have acquired this very same information when they visited Jerusalem during the Crusades.As part of their effort, the authors reviewed material based on translations of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, the Talmud, the Bible, and various other religious texts. Their search led them to discover many interesting details and a not a few inconsistencies. For example, regarding the first, they note the opening of the Lord's Prayer found in the New Testament as well as other material in the gospels may have been taken from Egyptian religious texts.I found the author's discussion of the interplay among the various religious sects and beliefs in the Levant during the first century C.E. illuminating-and the outcome of events that took place in those times are still with us. For example, Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaeans of southern Iraq (known as Marsh Arabs today) appear to believe in an Egyptian mystery-based religion John the Baptist may have preached. The Mandaeans refer to their faith as Johannine Christianity, but Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaean faith is not Christian. They also suggest the Mandaeans may have shared their faith with the Templars who claimed John the Baptist as their patron. Furthermore, these beliefs may have been handed on to the Masonic order when the Templars were disbanded.While most of the assertions of these authors appear to be based on solid research (i.e., Christianity was probably influenced by the Egyptian mystery religions), some of their suppositions are a bit tenuous (possible but may not be probable). Although the book purports to share arcane Templar knowledge, I don't think the link between the Templars and the Egyptian mystery religions has been established conclusively. As the material discussed in the book is available to readers, one can form his or her own conclusions"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I thought it was a great read and very intellectually stimulating. The fact that I come from a liberal city and am now living in the heart of the bible belt makes me crave material such as this. Now I can argue with my fundamentalist friends on a coherent and literal level. The question I kept asking myself through the book was why did the authors choose to ignore Laurence Gardner's Bloodline of the Holy Grail? It seemed to me that he may have answered some of their questions, if in fact he was correct about the dynastic succession and interpretations of the Dead Sea Scrolls."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I have been doing a lot of research into the Da Vinci Code, so I though I would pick up a copy of Templar Revelation, since that was one of Dan Brown's main sources. Little did I know that I had stumbled upon one of the worst books I will probably ever read in my entire life. I'm not even sure where to begin describing how frustrating it was to read this book. This is the most biased book that I can ever remember reading. No matter what the data is, the authors make it fit their theory.Towards the beginning I came across a paragraph that sets the tone for the whole book: \\"So, to begin our story proper we have to return to Leonardo's Last Supper and look at it with new eyes. This is not the time to view it in the context of familiar art-historical assumptions. This is the moment when it is appropriate to see it as a complete new comer\\" (p. 19-20). And yes, the authors stick with this theme through the whole book: ignore hisorical research and look at everything out of context. You can see how much they like historical research by examining their bibliography. It contains almost no actual historical documents (other than the Bible and the Gnostic Gospels, which are both always cited out of context to distort the meaning), nor does it contain any research volumes done by professional historians. Almost EVERY citation in the book is from other conspiracy theorists, and most of these citations are straight from Holy Blood and Holy Grail, which is not exactly known for being a very accurate historical book (I do not know of one single historian who would even dream of citing it as an authority on a subject). They simply cites other conspiracy theorists who can hardly be treated as authorities in historical reasearch. They also like to cite their previous book, which is hardly convincing if they have no source to cite for supossed historical events other than their own previous book which says it happened.On the topic of citations, I find it very telling that the authors make all kinds of historical claims without citing a source. They will say something like \\"historians agree that...\\" and then not cite anything, and most of the time when they do this I cannot immagine that any real historians would actually agree with whatever was just said. Further, for a good number of their claims they simply cite private conversations with people, which of course no one can verify. Many of their major theories come from a man whom they do not even know who met them one day on the street and claimed to be a member of the Priory of Sion and filled them in on all of the secrets of the Priory. It's too bad this guy never talked to anyone else and no one has any way of verifying that he even exists.Also, the authors BLATANTLY skim over problems with their theory and continue in spite of something being proven wrong. The authors ACKNOWLEDGE that the Dassiers Secrets papers (the ones with the list of the Masters of the Priory of Sion as well as a lot of other information about them, including their links to the Meringovian French line of Kings) were a HOAX. The current Master of the Priory (as listed in the papers) admitted to planting the papers to be discovered and admitted that he was on LSD when he wrote them. A search was done on his home and forged papers were found declaring him to be the King of France. So, the authors of this book admit that those papers were a hoax, yet the continue to use them as a main source for their theories througout the rest of the book!!! They use them as evidence about the Priory of Sion, and BASE their conspiracies on them, despite admitting that they are fraudulant! Their blatant use of admittedly faked papers as a major source of their ideas is beyond rediculous. Don't worry though, the authors have the problem solved: if we think about it differently the problem goes away! \\"One dubious connection or apparent contradiction concerning the Priory's activities invariable leads skeptics to denounce the entire theory as errant nonsense from beginning to end. But it must be remembered that we are dealing with Myth Makers, who are often more concerned with conveying powerful and even shocking ideas through the use of archetypal images than with communicating the literal truth.\\" (p. 41). Well, that certanly solves the problem doesn't it?Another example: the authors note a mysterious connection between the number of Mary Magdalene sites and the number of John the Baptist churches in southern France. They the note that, \\"of course the prevelance of building dedicated to John may easily be explained by the fact that the Knights Hospitaler... have always particularly venerated him and they have a strong presence in the area.\\" The authors then proceed to make up theories about it ANYWAY, even though they just explained the reason for it. They spend the rest of the chapter (a good number of pages) trying to figure out just why it is that this connection is there. Rediculous.Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the whole book, however, are the GIANT leaps in logic found all throughout the book. For example- The authors note that some of the Cathars were protected by the Knights Templar (she fails to mention that that was because they were the Templar's customers), so the logical conclusion drawn from this is... the Templars were obviosuly Magdalene worshiping heretics!-\\"Chartes Cathedral... contains a stone carving of what appears to be the Virgin Mary, with the carved 'label': arcis foederis - Ark of the Covenant. In itself this is not very significant, for it was a standard Christian symbol in medieval times. But as Chartes was a centre of the Black Madonna cult [note that the authors give no referrence for this claim], is the Ark being equated with that other Mary, the Magdalen, or even with a much older, pagan goddess? Perhaps it is the Feminie principle itself that is being evoked, using the 'cover' of the Marian symbol.\\" (p. 113). Impressive stuff, huh?Then there's the amazing places where the authors contradict themelves, like when the authors explain that Jesus did not really die and that someone dies in his place. A few pages later, they start explaining that Mary Magdalene was the first to see the post-crucified Jesus and they discuss the significance of that.As you can see, these authors have already decided that the conspiracy exists, then they try to make all of the facts fit their theory. It results in many, many logical leaps and contradictions. The authors literally see Magdalene behind every reference to or image of the Virgin Mary if it is made by a person they have decided must be in on the \\"Magdalene Secret.\\" They find hidden meanings in things which were not meant to have hidden meanings. They could literally look at a pattern on a carpet and somehow find that the Priory of Sion was trying to communicate a deep truth to them through the carpet's design. And then they would cite themselves as a source to back their interpretation up.In conclusion, I do not recommend this book at all, unless you enjoy reading illogical conspiracy theories, because that is all that this book contains. Take a look at the authors' other books and you'll see that they are simply people willing to buy into conspiracy theories. The book that they wrote together after this one was entitled \\"The Stargate Conspiracy: The Truth about Extraterrestrial life and the Mysteries of Ancient Egypt.\\" It described how the Egyptian pyramids were built by space aliens. Their claim at the end of this book: John the Baptist was the real Messiah. Do yourself a favor and read a book more worth your time, because this one doesn't deserve any of it.Overall grade: F"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is an excellent book in the fact that it is very well written and extremely informative. The book flows linguistically and the authors have a definite clear plan in delivering the goods, from beginning to end, the book is hard to put down. The authors have done substantial research of their own as well as digging up existing research done by other writers and historians. It is nice to see that the results build up on previous research that as a reader you may be familiar with (such as M.Baigent's books and other authors). This approach further adds credibility to the findings in this book.The result is a book overflowing with information and jam packed with facts and historical data. What is great about the authors' style is that at no time do they impose their point of view but rather you feel like they are right along with you in trying to make sense of the historical data. You feel like you're being part of the research, and that's what makes it a great reading. I disagree with some of the reviewers of this book on Amazon that feel they have not been \`delivered the goods'. We live in a society where we want everything delivered on a platter without having to think on our own. We want people to tell us yay or nay. Much like religion, history is sometimes based on who writes it and what actually survives the centuries of pillaging, arson and wars that have destroyed much of the information passed down to us. In such case it is much more appealing to be presented with facts and information and an opinion about what happened, rather than a dogmatic approach. We have enough opinions from people, what we want is enough intelligent information that we can form our own opinions.This is a great book ! If you want to know more about some of the most intriguing times in history, this is great reading and makes the Da Vinci Code book look like teenager reading, which in a way it is, but then again, maybe it's time to form your own opinion."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"There is a tradition of books claiming to reveal how deep secrets of the original Christianity is guarded by such unlikely societies as the Templars, the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians. This book is part of that tradition. The problem with most of these books is of course that adding remote possibilities to each other doesn't increase, but rather decrease, the credibility of the theory. If one claims that Jesus was an Isis priest with political ambitions, married to Mary Magdalene in a sacred marriage, that people related to Jesus were responsible for the death of John the Baptist, and that the original Jesus movement was wealthy and with contacts within the Herodian circles - well than you must certainly have more evidence than those presented in this book. The authors try to explain away the egalitarian nature of early Christianity, with arguments similar to those put forward by the followers of the right-wing preacher Kenneth Hagin. They even claim that when Jesus talked to the poor he did it in the same patronizing way as when a conservative MP talks to a working class audience. Well, no conservative MP will ever condemn the rich in the way Jesus did in the Gospel of Luke.Most conspiracy theories about Masons or Templars are of course quite sinister - but in this theory these societies are guardians of important spiritual secrets through centuries. But even if it is true that these so called secrets have been a western underground tradition it doesn't prove anything else than the fact that secret societies want to exaggerate their own importance.Of course, it is a good point in showing that early Christianity had a more nonpatriarchal attitude to women, that they were influenced by a feminine Sophia theology and probably indirectly by Isis worship. Many scholars have done that. But the exaggerated claims in this book more reflect the authors wishes than their research."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one. The theories expressed in this book should be compiled in the mind along with the writings of Henry Lincoln (&quot;The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....&quot; &amp; his more recent works), &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; by Knight &amp; Lomas &amp; the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right?If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:In \`Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew \`and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is \`not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, \`and then' His dead body was hung on a \`tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text.The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In \`I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made \`a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an \`idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was \`idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as \`The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\""},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The blurb on the back of this book declares that 'The Templar Revelation' is \\"painstakingly researched and thoroughly documented.\\" This is in fact the feature that grabbed my attention and caused me to read the book. Boy, was that a bad mistake.The 'painstaking research' that Picknett & Prince performed was laughable at best. The most quoted work in 'The Templar Revelation' was none other than 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail.' In fact, the only research that even came close to being 'credible' was Elaine Pagel's 'The Gnostic Gospels,' and one issue of 'Popular Archaeology.' Besides those recources, these authors did actually quote from the Bible, but often times in order to extrapolate certain texts to try and fit them to their claims. In other words, their hermeneutic was quite poorly performed. The rest of the sources were these esoteric and obscure works that no credible historian would give even a semblance of time looking over and considering worthwhile. This work, just like 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' is built on a pipe dream type of speculation. There is no credible evidence at all for any of the claims these authors make. There is absolutely no evidence that Jesus ever married Mary Magdalene, or that the Templars were anything other than knights who guarded the roads to the Holy Land in the middle part of the Medieval period. There is no evidence that the Templars had hidden 'secret documents' or 'items' or even hidden 'knowledge' of anything in history pertaining to Jesus that would 'bring down' the Roman Catholic Church, or discredit Christianity for that matter.The biggest problem with works like these, and the reason why any credible historian or theologian pays no attention to them is the fact that they are built on unsubstantiated claims that cannot be proven except through wild 'secret' interpretations of art, or obscure literature/documents that have no historical proof backing up the claims attached to them.The huge difference between credible historical claims and these hokey fanatical claims is that there is evidence which substantiates the claims. There is credible evidence that Jesus was an historical first century figure. There is solid evidence that Jesus did in fact die by Roman Crucifixion. There is even credible evidence that Jesus in fact arose from the grave (a solid case could be built on solid documented claims regarding this), but there is no evidence at all that the Holy Grail was in fact the bloodline of Jesus through Mary Magdalene. Picknett and Prince must rely on esoteric sources and unsubstantiated claims in order to write a book like 'The Templar Revelation' because there is no proof that what they are claiming in fact actually happened.If you want a solid historical text regarding Jesus and his life, or regarding the Medieval history of the Church then put this book aside and pick up a copy of Gary Habermas' book titled, 'The Historical Jesus,' or Philip Hughes's work 'The History of the Church.' Other great sources regarding the historicity of Jesus and Medieval History are N.T. Wright's work on the first century and Jesus as well as Norman Canter's 'Civilization of the Middle Ages.' These works are far better and much more credible than what Picknett and Prince offer in 'The Templar Revelation.' That is, unless you really like works of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"After reading all of the other reviews on this book, I am forced to write my own. I have read this book twice: once for the gist of it and a second time to study it and check the research of the authors against their sources for interpretation purposes. As a student of religion and Christianity for almost 40 years, I read many books of this sort. What I've found is none of them have the complete picture. The authors are like the blind men trying to describe an elephant. Each one has his own knowledge and theories, which they seem to guard with great tenacity and jealousy. I find this same attitude to exist among Christian clergy. &quot;My belief is correct, and all the others are wrong.&quot; They're like the old joke about the minister of one denomination going to heaven and as St. Peter is showing him around, he's told to be quiet as they pass a certain mansion. The minister asks St. Peter why he had to be quiet, and St. Peter says, &quot;Those are the (fill in the denomination of your choice). They think they're the only ones up here.&quot; THE TEMPLAR REVELATION is an interesting title with a lot of information between its covers. Good information. The theories put forth and conclusions drawn by the authors are also very interesting. These authors like so many others have their feet firmly planted in reality instead of mythology as closed-minded Christians do. These authors have no problem with the premise that Jesus was a man and not God incarnate. They have a better than fair understanding of confirmed history, which so-called true Christians either fail to see or refuse to see because history paints a picture of Jesus different from that of their religious belief. If you are a so-called Christian - born again or otherwise - this book is not for you. It will only make you angry and fill you with hate (not exactly a Christian tenet) for the authors and anybody else, including me, who has an open mind and who can accept Jesus as a man who lived in the Middle East about 2,000 years ago and who had a wife and children. Yes, children. See below. Just for thought: What does the &quot;name&quot; Barabbas mean? I am offering a reward to anybody who can tell me where else besides in the Christian Bible this &quot;name&quot; appears in history."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"What great books are coming out now on the Templars,Cathars,Christ etc etc This is yet another book I cannot put down.

Its great that Amazon have such a readily available library with book reviews from ordinary people."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Not the best book in this area. The most annoying aspect of this book is how the author makes somewhat of leap to connect the dots. Then in the next chapter that shaky conclusion is referred to again as it was hard and true fact to make yet another leap."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"should buy, and read this book! It's a must read, entertaining, informative, and very well written, once you get past the first chapter it's almost impossible to put down. Loved it cover to cover. It may not be the whole truth, but it's getting closer... after it, read The Jesus Mysteries : Was the 'Original Jesus' a Pagan God? by Timothy Freke... the two works dovetail nicely."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"and no stars for the scholarship. Four or five years ago, I read this book with absolute delight. It was just stuffed with things Pixel Studios could do wonders with...if Pixel were in the religion business. Secret knights dashing about in great heraldic clothing, snorting horses in hoods, earnest Cathars, secret rides by night, blood oaths and cabals and bad guys wearing silly Catholic clothing...I had a great time. Later, of course, I learned through some rather easy research that it was all a pack of hooey, as was \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" I do wish they weren't a load of horsewallop. But they are. I also wish it didn't matter if they were, or if they weren't. The myths, based on other myths, are so much good fun. It becomes much less fun when folks take it all for truths and get into spats over it. Silly, really. Worst of all is missing the spirit of the stories in the wild chase for \\"facts\\" which will never be found because this is all MYTH. For instance, the Grail that many think of as the cup Jesus drank from at the Last Supper, or these days as the bloodline of Jesus and the Magdalene, is actually taken from ancient Celtic myths and legends of their owns gods and goddesses. The Grail cup is a reworking of the mythic horn of plenty of Bran the Blessed, a Celtic god. The Christian legend grew from this in the Middle Ages. Since it did, the Grail could hardly go back to earlier Christian \\"history\\" and have anything to do with Jesus or the Magdalene. I don't know why I enjoy specious books like this one, but I do. For instance, I lovedJACK THE RIPPER: THE FINAL SOLUTIONabout Jack the Ripper. Maybe because I just can't resist a ripping yarn. Now, if people could only tell a ripping yarn from an actual event...or, whether they could or they couldn't, they felt no need to quarrel about it. That'll be the day."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Having just finished this book I would highly recommend it to anyone with the caution that if you are a believer in Christianity be prepared to have some articles of your faith strongly questioned. That said the book is a pretty good detective story at trying to piece together what the real story of Christ was and what he was really trying to preach. This book affirmed a lot of what I had already read in the Gnostic Gospels by Elaine Pagals about Christianity not being as clear cut as we all thought. The evidence is laid out fairly well (although of course it is sketchy at times) and I think it makes at least the case that what is taught by various versions of Christianity is not necessarily the truth; at the most extreme it kind of paints Christianity as nothing more than a political movement and the New Testament a book of propaganda. However someone approaches this book it at least opens the door to doubt and it especially points out the problem with the fundementalist Christians and how dangerous they are, since they are taking literally a work that has severe flaws and contradictions in it. My big complaint about the book is that the section detailing the Templars and Masons and the Priory of Sion rambles a bit all over the place.It was almost like 2 books put together and the first half was somewhat hard to get through for its style(though the factual matter was interesting) and almost made me stop reading it, which I am glad I did not. In response to one prior review:If the Priory of Sion does exist it is not surprising it is underground. Besides the Catholic Church (which if you remember only found Galileo to be &quot;right&quot; in 1994!) there are others in the so called Christian Community who could threaten such an organization and its members, through harassment (via sympathetic government officials)or even the violence that has been extended to abortion clinics and the like by these groups. Ask a practicing Pagan about what Christian groups do to them and you will soon see the answer... Anyway, a great read and eye opening to say the least and recommended, despite some problems with the writing style."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a book that is bursting with information, theories, and questions about the origins of Christianity and its counter-religions, but the message is muddled and it reaches disappointingly few conclusions for all it presents.There is no question that there is a good deal of well researched historical information. The passages about the Cathars and the Crusades in the south of France are very informative, as are the insights into hidden meesages in the works of da Vinci and other artists for those who haven't heard the story before.What hurts the book, however, is it's presentation that buries the reader in an avalanche of information and hypotheses that at times seems to degenerate into a stream-of-consiousness-like rambling. Solid research is often mixed in with wild leaps of logic or conjecture, and topics are presented and diverge with little cohesion or order. It is also ironic that a book critical of the average Christian's lack of historical knowledge about his religion, itself often misrepresents or ignores the context of many of the Gospels it dissects.The authors give the reader little in the way of conclusion, but that appears to be their intent rather than an oversight. Picknett and Prince urge readers to look at the material with an open mind and consider it's implications, not disprove or indict anyone's beliefs.Christians should enjoy this book for the wealth of historical facts, as well as the opportunity to examine their own faith. It is entirely possible for a Christian to read this book and emerge even stronger in faith for Jesus and the church, as the alternate hypotheses presented rely on a healthy dose of guesswork and blind faith themselves. Regardless of your views, be prepared to do some serious reading as well as mental organization to get through this one."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I read this book after Holy Blood, Holy Grail and was surprised that it is as good as the earlier work.Pros: The (hypothetical) conclusion sounds more logical than that in Holy Blood, Holy Grail. The authors seem to have been able to draw upon past research, especially those that were done in the past two decades and compiled/summarised their essence, while providing additional insights. The average reader only has to read this one book to get a brief idea of all the work done on this topic.Cons: The authors seem to discount others' work a little too strongly. It would be wise for the average reader to consciously question the authors' views so as not to get lost in their argument. Their references to Holy Blood, Holy Grail ends up as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. This gets too annoying and makes it seem like the authors have not shown enough thought/respect for others' research.Overall a terrific book on this subject. We are likely to get closer to the TRUTH in the next decade or so if researchers continue to build on each others' work like these authors have."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"QUALIFIERS:yes, Picknett and Prince challenge traditional Christian views.yes, I have no idea if Picknett and Prince have some hidden agenda in creating this book.yes, many of their conclusions are deductions lacking the proof required for a typical courtroom.yes, there is a lot of information in there, and it can get a little dull for those without a penchant for history.yes, for some, the ideas in this book will be very unpopular.MY VIEW ON THIS BOOK:I was raised in a traditional Christian household and find a lot of the interpretations of the Christian church hard to swallow, and thus found the ideas in this book refreshing in their consistency with popular views on human nature and organizational behaviour. (eg - can a powerful orgainization like the Roman Catholic Church be trusted to be completely forthcoming with facts that might convince their devotees to put their convictions and their money elsewhere?)I am convinced that the authors have done a lot of research. They have also included the Bible as a large source of evidence for their ideas. And they have clearly read the Bible in a manner more discerning than most devout Christans do. I'm not convinced that all of their theses are correct, but I am convinced that the Church is not giving people the whole story.In a time when religion is bidding not for our intellects, but rather our emotions, it seems like high time a hard look into our religious past for the sake of truth and understanding."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book began well, particularly with its dissemination of da Vinci's religious art. However, it went rapidly downhill from there as it went of on bizarre tangents regarding Mary Magdelene as some sort of priestess in the Eygptian cult of Isis, with Jesus as one of her acolytes. Its interesting, but where is the evidence to back it up? At no time do they produce any concrete foundations on which to build there argument. There were many times when I could have shredded this book in frustration!Come on Picknett and Prince - treat us as if we have brains!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"If you have any knowledge of the Templar, Rennes Le Chateau tale, there is nothing new here except more speculation - some of it well-founded and entertaining.

The problem is that the average Christian bases his/her faith too much on tradition and fables (Christmas, Easter, etc.) rather than paying more attention to proper history.The starting chapters on Leonardo are fascinating. The commentaries on the coded messages in his paintings to the mysterious Lady M and John the Baptist are very intriguing. Although I am still largely unconvinced on their theory of Leonardo's faking of the Turin Shroud. There are grounds to believe that John the Baptist cults and the Magdalene cults have been around for centuries.However, upon a rereading of this book, I found it to be filled with lots of unproven assumptions and relying instead on the convenient stringing-together of popular conspiracy theories - Goddess Traditions in ancient Christian sects, Gnosticism, Templar, Cathar, etc. etc."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Hard to keep up with Jeff Madison.

Just look at what I pasted below from \\"Valley Treasures\\" cached website after a google search of the first sentence of his review and you'll see what I mean. This should not be tolerated. Just making you all aware of this so as not to take his reviews seriously or ponder voting on them.Customer Rating:Summary: Good overview and interesting hypothesis...Comment: Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince-authors of TURIN SHROUD-have arrived at some unorthodox conclusions in THE TEMPLAR REVELATION. The authors say that TR grew out of research on the Turin Shroud. Like their prior book, TR is based on a review and synthesis of information from a wide array of mostly secondary sources. In addition to a well footnoted text, the authors include a bibliography as well as two sections of photographs.Picknett and Prince suggest that what really happened in the first century C.E. regarding Christianity has been obscured over the past two millennium by various political forces including the Roman Catholic Church. Furthermore, they say they have uncovered what may be the \\"true\\" and \\"shocking\\" story of John the Baptist. And, they suggest the Templars may have acquired this very same information when they visited Jerusalem during the Crusades.As part of their effort, the authors reviewed material based on translations of the Nag Hammadi scrolls, the Talmud, the Bible, and various other religious texts. Their search led them to discover many interesting details and a not a few inconsistencies. For example, regarding the first, they note the opening of the Lord's Prayer found in the New Testament as well as other material in the gospels may have been taken from Egyptian religious texts.I found the author's discussion of the interplay among the various religious sects and beliefs in the Levant during the first century C.E. illuminating-and the outcome of events that took place in those times are still with us. For example, Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaeans of southern Iraq (known as Marsh Arabs today) appear to believe in an Egyptian mystery-based religion John the Baptist may have preached. The Mandaeans refer to their faith as Johannine Christianity, but Picknett and Prince suggest the Mandaean faith is not Christian. They also suggest the Mandaeans may have shared their faith with the Templars who claimed John the Baptist as their patron. Furthermore, these beliefs may have been handed on to the Masonic order when the Templars were disbanded.While most of the assertions of these authors appear to be based on solid research (i.e., Christianity was probably influenced by the Egyptian mystery religions), some of their suppositions are a bit tenuous (possible but may not be probable). Although the book purports to share arcane Templar knowledge, I don't think the link between the Templars and the Egyptian mystery religions has been established conclusively. As the material discussed in the book is available to readers, one can form his or her own conclusions"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"A fine example of the growing illiteracy in this land, Picknett and Prince declaim at length with neither proof nor documentation. We are expected to take their word about numerous events and accept their interpretations of various actions. They provide much interesting fiction, but present it as possible fact. This book is a complete waste of time and money. In a sensible age, this trash would be published at the authors' expense.

The sequel by the same authors, already available in Europe, takes one to the next level - sharing the universe."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a great book with plenty of references for the material. It starts excitingly with all of these secret socities; however, it slows down by presenting the reader with all sorts of mysteries and riddles and the promise of solving all of those later on in the book! I lost track of all of these promises and don't know how many of the mysteries were solved at the end. But the main ones for me were the relationship of all of these secret societies such as Templars and then the Masons with respect to each other and how they were derived from each other which was not clear. Even though the authors were quick to turn down the previous work that was done in Hiram Key and Second Messiah but they did not produce a clear theory to replace the work in those books! One of the mysteries that was not solved is the following: if Jesus staged all of his work to capture every ones attention why was he crucified? There are no theories on what his crime was and how did he end up getting on the cross and if it was so important for him to relive the legend of Isis and Orisis then how come he vanished into the thin air after the crucifiction. The final question is that with all of the historical evidence available about the these religions and their so-called prophets why is it that you still have people following them and still they are No. 1 business in the world? Reading more about the truth behind all of religions has given a different meaning to Karl Marx's statement that &quot;Religion is the opium of the masses.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"What is the hook that captures our imagination for the Knights Templar? For me it is a first hand recognition that echoes in the sub-conscious calling me to remember another lifetime in the medieval days of the Inquistion and their persecution of heretical teachings such as those held by the Templars. Solomon once said that there is nothing new under the sun. Some ancient truths have existed with different champions and martyrs who were willing to die because of their transformative power.This book presents many valid historical references to powerful ancient mysteries. Where it falls short is the last third of the book when the authors' suppositions murky up the possiblities of who and why Jesus Christ was incarnated as the Messiah. To know the person of Christ...one must enter the doorway of the heart and become a fool in the eyes of the popular minds. The Gnostics had a handle on this powerful key to understanding...they were also persecuted and annihilated by the jealous minds of piety in many chapters of history.Let some of the mystery remain in the dark shadows to be uncovered by the hearts of the trully sincere soul, Lynn Pickett. When the author takes the role of priest and presumes to know the Christ without really experiencing Him, the truth becomes a stumbling block to inner transformation. The doors then swing close and cynicism marches on.A book I would highly recommend, that incorporates a real life experience of transformation from the days of the Holy Grail and the Knights Templar, is Eclipse of Fate...my healing journey through past-life recall by Barbara Burritt. It enthralled me as her own journey of realizing these same truths performed a magical transformation that the Templars, Carhars,and the Gnostics knew centuries ago. Again there is nothing new under the sun. What to believe is a choice the reader must determine. Let the mystery determine the truth in each of our souls and stay away from the seats of piety that have wronged so many by narrow-minded reasonings."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"In my research of the templars, I often wondered about the significance of John The Baptist. Why do they always celebrate his \\"day\\"? Now, I think I have a pretty good idea why.This book starts out at a good pace with leonardo da vinci et al being implicated in some sort of odd conspiracy. It then quickly moves to a confusing array of what I felt were poorly substantiated and copious amounts of data to prove a point that gets lots amongst the names and titles. In the second half though, all of the slogging through names and making flow charts just to keep up is rewarded by a page turning wrapping up of facts both obscure and obvious.It's a completely engaging book. If you haven't read the nag hammadi texts, dead sea scrolls, or are a staunch christian, then you should proceed with care. It will make you think and ask questions. Maybe even want to burn the authors at the stake. For me, it was eye-opening and great fun to read.In lieu of accepting masonic conspiracies that abound (not to mention the accepted common views of papal authorities), the authors sought out, as often as possible, a fresh perspective. They even took a look at the life and times of Jesus in as neutral a way as possible.I consider this money well spent.For the Templar conspiracist, it's not a lot of data but bears looking into for it goes in a different direction than oak island or Rosslyn chapel. God knows that's been done to death. For the christian with questions, it's a rabbithole. For the person of unerring faith, it's a challenge. For a gnostic, it's a pleasure. For me, it was great fun just to ask what if and go on a ride with the author's imaginations.I'd give it to you for ST.John's day if I could."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book should not be read as a serious history book, but rather as a fun conspiracy theory, for all those intriguing blanks in \\"official\\" history. The lack of serious scholarship is most clearly seen when examining the notes, which are supposed to lend the work an air of credibility. But when they reference supposed historical facts to \\"as told in conversation\\" with so-called experts, the whole argument falters. The templar bit is ironically the least convincing, as several dodgy sources are cited. The part about jesus being an egyptian sex-magician is fun though.Summa summarum; read it at your leisure, but do so with a critical eye. In fact, read instead the \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", which has more facts, more fun, and almost as whacky and incoherent conclusions."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The authors must have been paid by the word.It is not sensational or new or compelling.

The messages it conveys, in my opinion, are cunningly sketched, as are the rationalised theories, which for me, have too many holes in them to actually believe. Decide for yourselves.Prior to reading this book, one ought to have their foundation in ancient/Templar history sorted, especially when it comes to the Blue Apples.

Of course I didn't take the information in the book to be Gospel (pardon the pun) I chose to do my own investigation into the authors sources.On the whole I found the book to be very interesting and quite believable to a point.

There is a long standing western mystery traditionBoth facts that are well known by most people but its seems that Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince had to spend 8 years researching and travelling around Europe before they could discover these profound revelations.Upshot is that its a lot of fun but best read like a Sunday paper - skim through and don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I put down \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\", wrote my review and then picked this up. After this review I will take up \\"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar\\" I have not read works in the genre before because I have been doing my own investigations and didn't want the distraction of the enthusiastic ideas of others - just facts where needed. But now it is in the thoughts of many so I must see whats here. (At the same time as enjoying Euro (soccer) 2004 here in Portugal- \\"The rise of the Sons of Sir Stanley Matthews\\". On the TV I saw a woman reading the \\"DaVinci Code\\" in the crowd during a lull in the match!)I give this a five - primarily because the authors stick to their brief which is to ferret out the core HISTORICAL beliefs of the Templar/Priory of Sion group and its fellow travellers. They fulfil this brief very well. My only gripes are firstly that they \\"go native\\" in that they show themselves enthusiasts for the beliefs implied in the \\"Priory Narrative\\" and show themselves comfortable with that (particularly the \\"John Narrative\\" and its take on the \\"Magdalene's Crew\\" story). This is not surprising because they show themselves ill equiped to follow further into the female mystery by tossing off an aside about what a bind it must have been for Eve to sew. It presumably would be a bind for this evident \\"Sister of Artemis\\" to break from her running with the boys to learn the exquisite mystery of the finger and the thread - as it would to be \\"menial\\" to carry water - as did the only other woman to be alone with the Lord Jesus - and to be told the truth about herself - like Magdalena).The other failing is more serious in the context of their brief - that is that they are most careful not to mention the group know as the Druse. They were in the right place at the right time - like the Alawi they seem to honour the Baptist and Magdalena (The latter celebrate their feasts above muslim feasts) - unlike the Alawi and the John Church in the Iraqi Marshes they believe both in the value of women and of reincarnation. I presume there is another book coming on them - if they are ommitted through ignorance then I'm afraid I send their thesis back for more work.The thing the Druse have that the other groups do not have is a belief in the power and revelationary capability of village life - their young folk - initiates or lay - do not flee to the cities - they have learnt to manage the lust for \\"Stuff'n'Status\\" which the Priory of Sion has not.There are those who believe that \\"Knowledge is Power\\". Folk who believe this cannot have their eyes opened to let them read knowledge directly from creation as need requires - they must have it well packaged and second-hand from an organised \\"wisdom peddlar (Simon Magus et al) so that it relates to the other tangible and ownable ingredients of their lives. This is because those with wealth (\\"Liquid Power\\") cannot have it any other way. Like most folk of privilege they are picky eaters - but the work hard for the rest of us. They mush have congealed knowledge - they cannot go to the fount and get it liquid - let alone return with it elegant in a pitcher on their heads.What should you/they read next? Try the portuguese/gallician \\"Trovadors\\" - as their name implies they \\"found\\". Their 'Cantigas d'Amigo' are songs of the female to the male at the high-point of tantric ecstasy. She (always a humble girl) goes to the fount outside the village to wash her hair - sometimes with her mother. She lets down her hair (Magdalena would not gave gone about with hers loose any more than she would have shown her breasts in public) - the waters stir - the nearby commotion is a stag.Because the egyptians built vast buildings and wrote stuff down - and knew (and wrote indelibly) that \\"the sky was blue and water was wet\\" - does not mean that the rest of us and our \\"anointed voluntary victim\\" (cf Wicca, Witch, etymology) Lord Jesus needed them to tell us or Him. When St James came to my valley he rested after crossing miles of high heath - he spoke a little and that was enough - the folk here, illiterate though they were, already knew the story - James (\\"Son of Thunder\\") just brought the punch-line. The job was done - the magic was worked - the laws of Karma were modified.s.Our local big church was an Isis Temple, and this whole valley was a virtual \\"Sufi State\\" for many years.

Overall though, by taking on the research of the whole story behind the early years of Christianity, the writers of the books in the Bible, the cultures, the histories that are known of that entire middle eastern and European area, and then to trace the path towards the modern day that the facts, the records, the political and religious factions, the Templars, the nations, the archeology, the physical evidence, etc, this book starts off with a neutral, objective and panoramic viewpoint, and includes a great number of excellent worked-for insights into the absurd beliefs about those histories and the Bible and of course Jesus, that are then illuminated properly under a broader, full-spectrum lighting. The great value is in using the best process for this, is in not trying to latch onto inflexible half-arguments every time an alternative explanation can be found. This book avoids sloppy thinking, and it knows where the questions are left in precarious situations. And it also has a fearless, rational approach to some of these story dead-ends.This book is not primarily out to come to a final statement about some of these issues, but it does an excellent job of pulling in a rounded assembly of research, detail and argument around those issues, and so does point more certainly to how the issues should be resolved, moreso than what the final understanding will be. It arrives at quite a few excellent suggestions, but also appreciates the ability of our understanding to be boosted by new discoveries from time to time.Such things happened with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library, and many other sources illuminate the situation. Expertise in translation improves over time as well. The history of the middle East, Egypt, the Romans, Constantine, etc, have also been known, and the knowledge about them from outside the Roman Catholic church, or Christianity, are not in conflict with what is being discussed in this book.AND, (though this book doesn't really concern itself with it), then there is the very funny history of the various translations of the Bible, and what a stupid mess it's become in some instances. The King James Version used elevated phrasing like in some fine Shakespeare, but it was also a wonderful demonstration of myopic incompetence.So, to discover that this book was a great exploration of the issues was wonderful. The story of the New Testament is based a great deal, I personally think, from all the reading I've done from a variety of books, on a deliberately set up hoax, a phony Passion Play where Jesus was to be some latest incarnation of the dying god Osirus myth, in the Egyptian tradition, but for what cause, really? To focus the people and line them up against the Romans? It's not that simple, and Jesus may have been truely psychotic. What he learned from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and perhaps later in India from the Hindu's and his exposure to the Taoists, didn't have enough immersion time to conflict with his obsessive drive to pull of his stage act, using his outer sphere of rich political cohorts to manipulate his inner \\"disciples\\" core of sheep.Jesus screwed up, according to the Bible (which is a hodge-podge of confused bad writing, assembled over hundreds of years of re-writes and edited by the \\"make it all up as we go\\" Roman-Catholic religion that tried to capture the votes of the clueless like Paul, to blend with the votes of the manic Neanderthals like Peter. St. Peter? For an organization like that, I can see how they'd come to that arrangement. For instance, why were the disciples so amazingly clueless as to Jesus' real intentions? Maybe they had some help in staying stupid to what was really going on.They were crazy times then, and modern day people should realize that our accomplishments of democracy, freedom, rights, etc, are not how it's often been, and to realize that you shouldn't take anything for granted, especially the idea and practice of using systematic \\"leaders\\" structures and processes. For there still are the forces that created the filthy human performances of the past, in the precarious modern day world. Each generation needs to assert it's own freedom, it can't just adopt it or carry it on from the past. Reading up on issues like these, as in the Templar Revelation, is one excellent way to tone up the thinking mind.Remember, a thinking mind cannot be caged! Do it!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The Priory of Sion, Rennes-le-Chateau, Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Cathars, Isis, Black Madonnas, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene, Hermes Trismegistus ... and many more subjects are examined in The Templar Revelation.If it sounds like the book is unfocused, that is likely to be your impression while reading it, at least for quite a few pages. There is a thread linking all these topics: Picknett and Prince are trying to trace the predecessors and descendants of the Knights Templar, who were cruelly suppressed early in the 14th century. They also probe the nature of the secret knowledge said to have been possessed by the Templars and their various offspring.The connections aren't always easy to follow, and for awhile at least you're likely to find yourself at sea as the authors switch from one subject to another in kaleidoscopic fashion. In fairness, the evidence does seem by its nature to be complex and often ambiguous. Prepare to bring patience when you open the book; eventually, a sort of mosaic picture does emerge.Picknett and Prince have certainly gone the whole nine yards in researching the material, quoting from hundreds of written sources and describing their conversations with people who might shed some light on the subjects, and they describe their own travels to relevant sites in the south of France.Organization is not their strong point, but otherwise they are good writers who don't share the weakness of many occult researchers for trafficking in the obscurity and mystification endemic in the material they study. Further to the authors' credit, they appear to weigh the value of the evidence, and are not averse to rendering skepical judgments on some of it. Still, you are constantly presented with deductions that seem like quite a stretch of the imagination based on the minuscule evidence. And while the numerous references are impressive, a doubter could argue that quoting from multiple crackpot writings adds no credibility.Whatever you make of all this -- and I confess I'm far from sure what conclusions to draw -- The Templar Revelation suggets convincingly that there has been throughout Western history an &quot;underground&quot; of individuals and organizations dedicated to preserving secret and often heretical beliefs challenging orthodox Christianity. And even if, in the end, you give this study a Scottish verdict of &quot;not proven,&quot; you will respect the authors' sincerity and find this historical tour of occultism stimulating.As one who judges a book by its cover (as well as its content), I must highly commend the designer of the Corgi Books paperback. (If you have the American edition it may be different, but I hope not.) The main image is an embossed Templar seal overlaid with a version of the ankh; the title in gold foil raised lettering; and the entire cover laminated for an ultra-smooth, almost silky feel. The sensuous surface is a brilliant invitation to the mysteries with which the text deals."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book is exciting because it is a real follow-up to the theories presented in Holy Blood, Holy Grail (by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh), the all-time best of the \\"alternate history\\" books. It was the earlier book that caused many Christians to shed their naivete about the origins of their religion and to question whether Jesus had, in fact, died on the cross. Since that book, other writers have joined the fray and put forward theories of Jesus surviving the crucifixion. Like the Holy Blood, Holy Grail authors, Picknett and Prince say Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, but unlike the previous work, they do not say the two went together to the south of France. They concentrate instead on Magdalene and the many legends of her presence in France. They too allude to an explosive \\"secret\\" preserved by that shadowy organization known as the Priory of Sion.In this ambitious and controversial work we find much more on the legends of France concerning Mary Magdalene and her possible connection to Jesus and the Christian Church. The authors also delve into the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the story which originally inspired Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh to do the investigation which led to their theory of a Jesus who was married and whose descendants founded the Merovingian dynasty. Since that time, other books have also questioned the standard story of Christian beginnings, and have even revived the idea that historical Jesus did not exist.I recently visited a wonderful exhibit on the Dead Sea Scrolls that came to the Grand Rapids (Michigan) public museum which featured actual pieces of the scrolls along with many representations of the Essene community at Qumran, thought to be the origin of the scrolls. The Dead Sea Scrolls are important because they they shed light on the religious and political ideas of the time just prior to Jesus' public life. Some of the material from the scrolls seems \\"Christian\\" but actually predates the Jesus movement. This, like the material in The Templar Revelation, seems to show that the central ideas of Christianity were not new. Other authors have shown that the \\"suffering savior,\\" the \\"dying and resurrected god\\" and \\"eating the divine flesh and blood\\" themes were present in many pagan religions of the era.Picknett and Prince take the idea further and show that the roots of Christianity could be, not in Judaism, but rather in the Egyptian religion, especially the cult of Isis and Osiris. For instance, Osiris was killed on Friday and resurrected three days later by the power of his wife Isis, who then conceives their son, Horus. Even more parallels with Christianity can be found in the basic beliefs of the Isis religion, which emphasized repentance and confession. It was not Jesus who originally brought these ideas (both Egyptian and Gnostic) to the Jews, but another character who figures prominently in occult circles, John the Baptist. John is seen by the authors as a rival of Jesus who founded a substantial movement that continued to exist and even exists today. His followers have never believed Jesus was devine.The most exciting part of this book is the material the authors collected in their travels though France. They found numerous churches dedicated to Mary Magdalene, John the Baptist and the mysterious Black Madonna. The devotion to the Magdalene is especially interesting, since the legends of her presence in this area are so common and there are numerous claims by local townspeople to have her remains or some relic of her. The shrines to Mary Magdalene are frequently at sites formerly associated with Isis. However, after laboriously providing many examples of these themes, the authors never quite pull it all together. They show what seems to be a connection with the Hermetic tradition embodied in the Knights Templar and the Freemasons, but fail to produce any \\"smoking gun.\\" What was the secret knowledge of these organizations that caused them to hold John the Baptist and the Magdalene in higher regard than Jesus? It was, they say, the knowledge of the Female principle once so important to ancient religions. They devote a whole chapter to the history of \\"sacred sex\\" and show how it was practiced in Egypt and persisted through the undergound stream kept alive by organizations like the Templars and Masons. They tell us nothing about the political agenda of these organizations, or the reason for the continued secrecy (after all, there is no more Inquisition).While I find much of the material illuminating, the book is ultimately disappointing. They tell us that Jesus was a rival of John; he was a practitioner of magic and/or the Egyptian religion. His message was altered by the male-dominated Church which covered up the truth about the important role of Magdalene. The authors constantly point out how ignorant most Christians are about the origins of their own religion. Since Christianity emphasizes \\"faith\\" (belief with no proof), why should the existence of proof that Jesus survived the crucifixion and was married and had children make any difference? It's interesting how these books, no matter how persuasive, seem to change nothing.I was hoping to finally learn the agenda of the Priory of Sion and the secret of Rennes le Chateau. I want to know what really happened to Jesus. The books waltzes tantalizingly around all these topics, but never delivers the goods. It does not reveal any Great Truth. But of course, that was always too much to ask."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"After reading the Da Vinci code I found myself wanting to explore more factual work regarding the mystery of the Holy Grail, the Priory of Scion, and Mary Magdalene. I was surprised, and a bit intimidated to find that there were literally dozens of books on the subject.Taking a stab, I stared with \\"The Templar Revelation\\" by English authors Lynn Pickett and Clive Prince. This is, I think, a good jumping off point for people as it delves into many of the mysteries surrounding all of the above subjects in relation to the true identity of Jesus Christ.You will read about the founding of the Knights Templar, and how there may have been much more behind their founding than trying to retake the holy land and convert the heretics. Did they actually know the secrets of Jesus Christ and are the ones protecting the true history? Was the Templar inner circle actually the founding members of the Priory of Scion?Much of the book is spent discussing the mystery of Mary Magdalene. Various theories are discussed such as Mary actually being married to Christ and actually being his most trusted apostle. One theory goes that it was Mary who actually carried on Christ's church after his death, and her work was subsequently covered up by the church and the Gospels that speak of her (such as the Gnostic gospels and Gospels of Phillip) were purposely left out of the new testament.You'll explore relations to worship of Mary Magdalene to the Egyptian cults of the Goddess Isis, and of the startling similarities between Christ's death and resurrection and similar stories of pagan gods death and resurrection. Startling to say the least.Then there is the mystery behind the French Abbey of Rennes-Le-Chateau. A strange and provocative mystery about the priest who seemingly had endless wealth to build a very strange abbey filled with both Christian and pagan symbolism. Where did he get this money from? Was it a secret treasure he found? Was he funded by some mysterious benefactor? Could he actually have uncovered the secret remains of Mary Magdalene, long buried on the site?The theories come rapid pace in this book and it's sometimes difficult to keep them all straight. The authors do not forward any particular theory, but rather try to lay them all out with as much fact as possible. It certainly gives one to pause and certainly devout Christians may have some big problems with the idea of Jesus being married, fathering children, and possibly embracing pagan beliefs.Among the most interesting and somewhat chilling proposals is what seems to be a concerted and diligent effort on the part of the catholic church to not only erase, but to rewrite history. There's no doubt that Gospels were written around the same time as those included in the new Testament, that were left out purposely.As I said, it's a good jumping off point to explore some of these theories and there are many more books out there that delve into greater detail on these various ideas and concepts. But it's definitely a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is primarily a book about Jesus, the development of Christianity, and the origins of certain heresies and secret or occult traditions. The authors share some interesting theories concerning Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and John the Baptist, supporting their ideas with some thought-provoking evidence from a wide range of sources. Special attention is afforded to the beliefs and traditions of certain well-known secret societies and religious sects.The first half of the book is less compelling than the second, and deals with a few of the more curious historical characters, myths and legends that are often associated with these topics, and the authors offer a few novel insights. It is worthwhile persevering until the second half of the book, which presents some very interesting theories and is rich in intriguing scraps of information, scriptural contradictions, conspiracy theory, and unsolved mysteries.Despite the title, the main focus of the book is not the Templars. However, anyone with an interest in the Templars, the history of the crusades, or the occult, should appreciate that experts continue to debate whether or not the alleged Templar heresy was genuine; where the heretical ideas originated and how they might have fitted in with the pursuits of a medieval Christian monastic military order. Some light is shed on these questions in this text, although the authors inexplicably seem to avoid actually stating some of the connections that they appear to be alluding to...This book is easy to follow, informal and sometimes entertaining, packed with interesting information and ideas, and I would suggest it to any reader who would like to read around the subjects discussed."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Picknett and Clive make bold assertions about \\"secret\\" revelations they researched regarding religion and the 'occult' knowledge and practices of the Knights Templar, Freemasons, and Cathars. These groups are presumed to have based their beliefs and religious practices to the time of Solomon and the ancient religion of Egypt, Osiris and Isis. While it is not a scholarly work in the strict scientific sense of the word, these authors do a fine job of connecting symbols, paintings, sculpture, and ancient church architecture to religious practices that do not conform to what was the common practice at the time. This reader is convinced they have revealed some of the \\"mysteries\\" upon which the secret societies and groups of the past based their esoteric knowledge. They include a fascinating mix of myths, legends, and \\"Indiana Jones\\" type archeological research associated with religion, which captures the reader's attention and keeps it transfixed as a complex maze of detailed revelations are brought forth for the reader's examination.Some of the most complex connections made in the book relate to the information about why John the Baptist is held in high regard by the Knights Templar and Priory of Sion. In fact, the Grand Masters are often refered to as \\"John\\". Another interesting fact is that in the south of France, there are many \\"Black Madonna\\" sites where a church is often built to honor the Mary Magdalene. The authors connect the \\"Black Madonna\\" cults to the goddess worship of Isis which was the predominant religion of the area before Christianity. They also connect the concepts of fertility and goddess worship to secret practices within some of the societies. There were two levels of membership in the societies, the outward stated one, and an inner \\"secret\\" level, where only those who were initiated could understand and practice certain sexual rites. There are assertions that Jesus and Mary Magdelene may have been married or,if not married, were participants in some secret rituals of this nature. There are references to gnostic writings which intimate a very different level to their relationship than is depicted in the New Testament version. The role of women as Apostles in the New Testament has been diluted. based on the prevalent Jewish dominant cultural view at the time. The religious questions the authors raise and possible connections they make do point to some fallacies in current religious practice, although there is no scientific proof to the relationship assertions. The findings of the Nag Hammadi scrolls in 1945, have been now revealed to the public. They shed a new light on the religious outlook of different groups of people who were living during the time of Jesus ministry, both before and after the crucifixion and resurrection. His life and teaching is given new meaning ... While this reader can not accept at face value the \\"true identity of Christ\\" as presented by the authors, indeed, there is room for more research. The New Testament books as carefully selected and edited versions of books that were copied and recopied from the past, do not reveal the full measure of Jesus life and teachings either. This was a fascinating book which read partly like a mystery which explained myths and legends, partly like a sociological research paper, and partly like an archeological exploration of religious symbolism and practice. Since it mixes so many unlikely topics, the reader needs to keep an open mind balanced with some healthy skepticism. Highly recommended. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I can't remember the last time I read such an enlightening history book. The authors' scholarship is impressive, and their theory is absolutely stunning. The authors' premise is that Christianity is an offshoot of Egyptian religion. If this is indeed true, it would explain (albeit not completely) why so many of pagan/mythological themes exist in Christianity. Furthermore, the book convincingly asserts that the early Christian fathers competed with other Judaic sects for preeminence and at the same time felt the need to differentiate themselves from the other religious movements. In presenting supporting evidence for this, the authors provide an explanation as to the origins of some of Christianity's more peculiar characteristics - emphasis on the male, misogyny, mind/body duality, and loathing of the flesh. The book explains how the heretics may have understood the not-so-firm origins of Christianity, and how such knowledge threatened the legitimacy of the established Church. Hence, the Church felt a greater need to punish deviance (which would explain the Inquisition and the Church's general intolerance of bold - especially scientific - ideas during the last 2000 years. Finally, I never felt that the conventional history books gave an adequate explanation for the birth of the Renaissance, which seemed to have sprouted into existence in full bloom after more than a millenium of austerity. The theory presented in this book suggests a more plausible explanation for the birth of the Renaissance and its bold new glorification of humanity: that the heretical/gnostic elements, which had existed in the undercurrents throughout European history, gained momentum and manifested itself as the Renaissance. In short, the book's theory sheds new light and understanding on the developments of the 2000 years of European history."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"After finishing &quot;the Da Vinci Code&quot; , I was sufficiently intrigued by the topic to acquire some follow up reading material , and this was one of the works that seemed most relevant to the &quot;sacred feminine&quot; topic raised in Dan Brown's book. I also purchased the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot; at the same time , but have not made much progress on that front.I read the entire book over the period of a week, and re-read several of the chapters selectively. The first impression one takes away is the individual chapters seem to be somewhat disconnected , but by the end of the book everything starts to fall into place better. Then a selective re-reading seems to reveal the true focus of this study. Those with a strong Christian set of beliefs will have alot of difficulty in accepting many of the authors' assertions , since a great deal of the &quot;occult&quot; information presented is , by traditional standards , heretical.The authors take a somewhat slow paced journey through the John the Baptist and Mary Magdelene stories , and attempt to link the Black Madonna shrines in southern France with the Egyptian Isis cult. Much of what is presented is conjecture , but a great deal of rather scholarly thought and logical eveidence is presented to make a compelling case for their hypotheses.Later chapters deal with the Knights Templar , the Rosicrucians , the Masonic lodges , and the Priory of Sion (Zion). Reference is made to the &quot;documents secret&quot; found recently in France that indicate the historical Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion were all brilliant and otherwise famous men in intellectual disciplines. Leonardo da Vinci , Robert Boyle , Sir Isaac Newton , and Claude Debussy are a few of the well known names included.The authors also raise the issue of the Inquisition and the supression of heresy as a political matter. In the early days of the Christian belief , other groups were competeing for the hearts and souls of men besides the Church of Rome. It also lends insight into the male dominated hierarchy of the early church , which felt itself threatened by the Gnostics and the cult of Mary Magdelene.I rated this book only 4 stars based on the following : subject matter and content of the work 5 stars ; presentation in a readable form 3 stars. Not an easy book to read , but worth the effort : 4 stars overall. I recommend that this be viewed as a starting point for those truly interested in the occult or supressed religeous viewpoints of the &quot;heretics&quot;. It might just startle you!

They refer to the New Testament, as we know it, as propaganda written and included in the canon to create the Christian belief system as it has been handed down to us. There may be some truth to that statement but they seem more than willing to quote from it when it serves their purpose. Many of their \\"revelations\\" are not new, such as Jesus' relationship with Mary Magdalene, but the theory that Christianity has it's roots in ancient Egyptian religion was new, at least to me.All of that being said, I actually enjoyed the book even though the evidence presented for the \\"revelations\\" is less than convincing.

According to the authors) Then again I picked it up because I remembered some interesting points: the correlations of Pagan holidays with the birth of Jesus, the crucifiction, resurrection, etc...of course I didn't need to read this book to figure that out. But Mary Magdalene and her story was what really interested me, her purported journey to Alexandria and then Provence or Languedoc, and the cult of the Black Madonna. Also the information regarding architechture I found very interesting and I will never look at the cathedrals of Europe in the same way. The mystery of Rennes-le- Chateau I found fascinating and would like to read more about it.I think if one can read between the lines and sift through some information, this book provides some very fascinating perspectives of the life of Jesus, his relationship with Mary Magdalene, the relationships between MM and the apostles, and the evolution of the Catholic church and some occult groups. I found the bibliography to be rather impressive and have used it to review other books for future purchases.Over all, this book isn't bad. I felt that the author's did try to look at more than one perspective and ended up proving their theories. Whether your theories and theirs dovetails...it remains to be seen."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"If you're intrigued to read some more background on the revelations and secrets spilled in the DAVINCI CODE, this is the book to get.They freely admit to basing their book on HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL but that's actually a good thing. TEMPLAR is a well-paced, easy to read book versus the dense and wandering HOLY BLOOD ...They also bring in some other players of the secret societies - all intriguing. While there are obviously many philosophical and religious points that some people might find difficult to believe either outright or based on the 'evidence' they provide - this book is not really anti-anyone's POV.TEMPLAR REVELATIONS gathers many points of data - including actually traveling to many of the sites and presents certain conclusions but it's scholarly without being strident.They do not pretend that their evidence based on heresay and collected stories are factual - just a collection of info and data points where they have drawn a conclusion that you can agree or disagree on.For people who were entertained and intrigued by DAVINCI CODE, this provides some factual basis for many of revelations in the book and some intriguing details. Ultimately you will believe what you wish to believe, however - knowledge, information and analysis should never be feared and one should also not take everything so seriously."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Being a fan of the whole Templar/Masonic/Rennes-le-Chateau &quot;thing&quot; (for lack of a better term), I was eager to hear yet another viewpoint on it. I have to say, the authors do bring up some interesting points, but are too quick to dismiss the works of others and cast themselves as the &quot;only&quot; authorities. They consistently get the title for the Baigent/Leigh/Lincoln book wrong, which only makes me wonder how accurate their other research is. The chapter on &quot;Sex: The Ultimate Sacrament&quot; becomes wildly off-topic, and while THE HIRAM KEY (Knight and Lomas)may not be the most accurately footnoted book, it cannot be simply &quot;dismissed&quot;. I also worry about the broad &quot;dismissal&quot; of what has become a widely researched and accepted origin for the Qumran Community and the Dead Sea Scrolls (not surprisingly, Robert Eisenman is not even mentioned in the bibliography). Also, they are too quick to dismiss THE TOMB OF GOD (Andrews and Schellenberger). What is ultimately odd about the majority of these dismissals is that the authors eventually come close to arriving at the same points as many of those they dismiss (ancient Egyptian Mystery Schools were also strongly hypothesized by Knight and Lomas). Entertaining at times, yet disappointing too. Reminiscent of Caffeine Free Diet Coke, or non-alcoholic beer."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I am in the process of reading this book and It is infinitly intriguing but slightly hard to read. If you have read the Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, it is a nonfiction, more-informative version of that."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The first 2/3 rehashes some common theories notably that Christ and Mary Magdelane were involved in a mystical marriage ceremony re-creating the Isis and Osiris myth ( as well as other Pagan variations of the dying/rising God myth) and that this mystical oral tradition has been preserved for centuries through various Secret Societes. There is considerable rehashing of the Holy Blood Holy Grail material in the process. The book is at its strongest when it suggests this alternate tradition does not necessarily conlfit with traditional Christianity but enrichens it.The book falls apart in the last 1/3 when it tries to portray the existing Gospels as untrue and to posit an animosity between John the Baptist and Christ. They may open a few doors and ask some intriguing questions but their research is so shoddy and their conclusions are so laughable and in many cases so illogical and contradictory that they are easily dismissed.The first 2/3 is worth reading (along with Holy Blood and Holy Grail) to get some insight into the post-Gnostic mystical Christian tradition and its relation to Secret Societies and oral tradition."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I have recently finished reading Templar Revelation, and would reccomend this book to anyone seeking the Truth. Some of the theories and suggestions put forth by Picknett and Prince are far fetched and difficult to substantiate, but I was impressed by their willingness to say as much. This book will shatter some people's preconceptions of long held 'truths', and will anger others, further hardening a belief system that has always been fragile. As a reformed Catholic, many of the historical events presented here confirmed many suspicions and solidified an idea of corruption and the lust for power. For all those that read the synopsis and reject this book on the grounds that it is heretical and/or blasphemous, I say only this - Why is it so blasphemous? Who is the authority on Truth? The Church and all its self serving dogmatic principles? The Church is a man made entity. Created and organized by men, who are just as vulnerable to the imperfect state of human nature, as the rest of us. If you want to find the Truth, and accept its reality, open your mind and consider the facts as presented by all sides. Erase the conditioning and begin to see the Truth as the victim she has been for over 2000 years. NAMASTE."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book has kept me riveted for days on end. After reading it I am anxious to research many of the issues it touches on. I also appreciate the tone of the authors: they don't talk down to readers from some pompous tower of academicism. Most of the other books on this topic feel much more like Holy Blood, Holy Grain for dummies. Each hypothesis these authors put forth seems at least possible, and then they go through the most extensive historical research to prove it. I should say it is long, and very detailed, but if you are interested in the topics it seems to read itself."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"After reading this book and several reviews of it, I very much agree with [...] others. In its favor it was an enjoyable read and I couldn't put it down. Iwould have given it 5 stars for that reason, but gave it 3 because I felt too that it lacked much of the evidence to back up what the authors claim are facts. Also in its favor - it discusses in Plain English all the myths concerningthe subject (secret rites and beliefs of the Templars, Freemasons, Mary Magdalene cult, Johnthe Baptist sect, etc.) which was helpful to me and it was easier to read and understand then \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail but went over the same theories.It should be read with an open mindwith the realization that most of what is written are only the opinions of the authors gleaned from their and other author's research and it should be left to the reader to form their own opinion - not be influenced or upset by this author's conclusions. I would recommend this work to anyone interested in the subject, but would caution them to remember that most authors want to SELL their books - not necessarily an opinion or idea."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The most important thing when you start reading this book is to keep an open mind. This openmindedness applies not only to your traditional interpretation of the history of christianity but also to you are being told in this book. The authors, in their investigative quest, challenge many of the established dogmas of the catholic religion and the relation of historical characters to those dogmas. However, in their plight to shake the established convictions, the authors indulge in extensive spells of speculation. Most of the evidence supporting the derived conclusions, is highly subjective. Therefore, the extracted conclusions end up being nothing more than an interpretation alternative to the established one and as subjective as this last. I would judge the main contribution of this book to be the illustration of how a history full of loopholes can be moulded to fit the convictions of the reader."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This books starts by telling you what a visionary Leonardo da Vinci was. It then builds on their assumptions that if he was so brilliant then why does his artwork relay that Jesus was not the son of God but a man of questionable character (this of course is just the authors asumption). The book rambles re-stating the same points. With chapter names like &quot;Sex: the Ultimate Sacrement&quot;, &quot;Gospel Untruths&quot; and &quot;John Christ&quot; this book is anything but inspirational.Reading the back of the book and thumbing through the pages, I thought the book would be about the Templars, Freemasonary and a deeper understanding into the christian aspects. Wrong.Though very credible books are quoted in this book - the authors say in the acknowledgements &quot;we must point out that those listed below do not necessarily share our opinions&quot; - I certainly do not share their opinions.If you're looking for a good read on Templars or Freemasons try &quot;Born in Blood : The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry&quot; -- John J. RobinsonBorn or The Temple and the Lodge -- Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I found this book in the Occult section but it deserves more respect. Although in does deal with the occult, it also makes a credible argument about the true identity of Jesus, and what western religion might have looked like had it not been for the success of the Christian myth makers.The first chapter of Book I deals with da Vinci's efforts through his art to establish Mary Magdalene as Jesus' principal disciple, and to establish John the Baptist as preeminent over Jesus as leader of a new political-religious movement. The rest of Book I reads like a dry-as-dust textbook as the authors explain the predominance of Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist cults in southern France. The title refers to the Knights Templar's secret information about the true identity of Jesus. Part of this secret being that John the Baptist was the true messiah, and that he and Jesus were actually rivals.Book I also contains a rather bizarre explanation of the Shroud of Turin: da Vinci invented an early form of photography and somehow imposed a negative of his own image on the shroud. The man on the shroud is da Vinci! Well, he was a genius, and this is as good as any other explanation I've heard. The image is certainly not that of Jesus. If we accept carbon-14 dating for everything else, we have to accept it for the shroud.Book II is more interesting. The authors get into the subject of historical Jesus and some of the deceptions and contradictions of the New Testament, which they describe as a &quot;hopeless muddle.&quot; Any book of this kind has to delve into speculation given the very limited amount of extant material on Jesus outside of the Bible. But, unlike &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; the authors generally resist the temptation to jump to wild conclusions, and they are careful to separate their opinions from fact. They postulate that Jesus was probably married to Mary Magdalene, and that his cult was not based on Judaism but on Egyptian mysticism. This explains the Egyptian ties to the Knights Templar that were carried over into Freemasonry. The Knights, the theory goes, held the secrets to the true identity of Jesus.The gospel writers reinvented Jesus as a celibate Jewish messiah, making a sometimes clumsy attempt to remove Egyptian and Gnostic references from their source material. This might explain the inexplicable gaps or contradictions in some of the Jesus stories. The Council of Nicaea was careful not to include any Gnostic gospels in the New Testament.Some of this is pure speculation, but what else do we have? Any attempt to find the real Jesus has to begin with the premise that the New Testament is a &quot;hopeless muddle.&quot; Most non-Biblical references to Jesus were probably destroyed by the early Christian Church to allow them to perpetuate their Christ myth. In the modern era it is more important that we know the truth. We can only hope that writers continue to study this subject, and that one day Christians will escape from the dark ages of phony dogma and transform their religion into something more honest, natural and meaningful"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I must have been awfully sheltered but I have just never been exposed to most of these apparently age-old theories and thoughts -- and yet they were reasonably well documented leading me to read further beyond this book -- and finding basic confirmation in other source material of much it discusses. Even down to -- yes, it is a woman sitting beside Jesus at Leonardo's Last Supper! Absolutely mind-blowing for me, and truly seals the absurdity of the Roman church \\"sovereignty\\" -- but I think it and all the societies it discusses (to the degree accurately represented) seem to miss one thing -- the basic spirituality and moral goodness of Jesus' teachings, whoever he was and however he died and whatever religion he was teaching."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"If you are a person, that has always asked &quot;too many questions,&quot; this book is for you! Whether you are a Philosopher, Theologian, or Agnostic, this book is a welcome addition to your collection. This book makes you think, so Fun-dam-entalists should probably skip this one.The theories expressed in this book should be compiled in the mind along with the writings of Henry Lincoln (&quot;The Holy Place: The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau....&quot; &amp; his more recent works), &quot;The Hiram Key,&quot; by Knight &amp; Lomas &amp; the other books of this genre. Right or Wrong, this book will get your wheels turning...which is all that really matters, right?If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Another fun book is Brad Steiger's 'Werewolf.' I also really liked Dan Brown's \`Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.The tip of the iceberg: Numerous authorities who had noted the errors in the K.J.V. such as William Kilburne (1650's) 20,000 errors, John Wesley (in 1755) 12,000 changes in the New Testament alone, the Revised Version of 1881 consisted of 36,000 errors and on and on. The NIV, RSV and The Living Bible are also replete with thousands of errors. Do some research!The KJV Bible is the True Word of God! Or is it? Inspired? Or not? I believe all of the one star ratings and rantings are from uneducated Protestants. For example:In \`Acts 5:30; 10:39.' the KJV, in speaking of Jesus' death, reads, &quot;Whom ye slew \`and' hanged on a tree.&quot; The word &quot;and&quot; is \`not' in the Greek text, and by adding it to the text at this point in the verse it leads to some confusion on the part of the readers. The conjunction &quot;and&quot; indicates grammatically that one action followed another (i.e.: two separate actions independent of one another). Some unbelievers have tried to use this verse to demonstrate that Christ was killed first, \`and then' His dead body was hung on a \`tree'. By inserting the word &quot;and,&quot; numerous complications have arisen which could have been prevented by a correct translation of the original text.The KJV translators also did not know what the &quot;Asherah&quot; was (a wooden idol representing a Canaanite goddess), so they translated the word repeatedly as meaning a &quot;grove&quot; of trees. In \`I Kings 16:33' they state, &quot;And Ahab made \`a grove,&quot; which provoked the Lord God to anger. In point of fact, Ahab made an \`idol' here (the Asherah); his sin was \`idolatry', not planting a grove of trees!!In Deuteronomy 33:17 the KJV speaks of &quot;the horns of unicorns.&quot; There are two mistakes in this passage: (1) The animal mentioned here in the original text is the &quot;wild ox&quot; and not the mythical &quot;unicorn,&quot; and (2) in the original text the passage speaks of one animal (singular) with horns (plural).In Luke 18:12 the KJV reads, &quot;I give tithes of all that I possess.&quot; The Law did NOT require one to tithe a tenth of all that he &quot;possessed&quot; (all his capital holdings), but rather a tenth of his increase (that which he acquired in addition to his possessions). This is clearly stated in the Greek word used in this passage.As a student of history I applaud the fresh approach to history and literary criticism this book embodies. The nature of this work is admittedly controversial - but then it must be as \`The Templar Revelation' breaks bold new ground. Research the genre and decide for yourself, but this book is a must read for skeptics and devout Christians alike. \\"He who believes blindly sees not the truth.\\""},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who ever had questions about Christianity, the Church, and essentially the History of how the World today was formed. Do I believe everything that was written in the book? Well... not necessarily, but if I believed everything that I read I would never have picked this book up! A warning: the book starts off a little slow and seems a bit implausible, but the more I read the more it made sense. And part 2 of the book is where it really takes off. FYI, they do mention the title of &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; as &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail.&quot; My copy of HB,HG (1996 Edition) has the shorter title on the cover, but the introduction begins; &quot;On January 18, 1982 'The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail' was published in England.&quot; It looks like the book was originally published under the longer title and Picknett/Prince DID do their research."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The first half of the book is a review of many heretical positions taken by historical organizations such as the Knights Templar, The Masons, the Cathars, and the Priory of Sion. (The latter group may have received a little too much emphasis, as from what I have discerned since the book's publication, the Priory is pretty much considered a hoax.) Nonetheless, many \\"heresies\\" have been held over the ages, such as Mary Magdelene being both the wife of Jesus and the primary Apostle, and the possibility of John the Baptist being venerated as more important then Jesus. These were basically the revelations of the Templars. One chapter specifically examines the ways Leonardo secretly emphasized the Magdalene and the Baptist in his paintings.In the second half things really get rolling. The Council of Nicea in 325 decided that Jesus was divine, although the New Testament Gospels do not confirm that, and that any other Gospels (such as those found in the Nag Hamadi Library) were heretical and not to be considered in looking at the historical Jesus. It was Mary Magdalene who anointed Jesus, and it was Jesus who, as the legitimate descendant of David, planned to be King of Israel--a worldly kingdom, not a heavenly one.Jesus spent his \\"lost\\" years in Egypt learning his trade, so to speak, and was in fact an Egyptian priest in the manner of the Egyptian god Osiris (who rose from the dead)--Mary Magdalene was his priestess in the manner of Isis, who anointed him. Not only that, John the Baptist was what the Essenes called \\"The Teacher of Rightousness\\", the true Messiah, and Jesus' competition. It may even have been someone from Jesus' group who conspired to have the Baptist beheaded!All of this is given with full explanations of each position which they take, and one can easily get the impression that some of their theories are more convincing than the muddled and conflicting accounts given in the Gospels. Reading this with an open mind may just provide the reader with some new and honest insights. The \\"heretics\\" would seem to have a case worth making."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The authors have spent countless hours doing their research. Their conclusions are well-documented and startling to any Christian who should read this book. It is not for everyone, but for people interested in esoteric and academic examination of the secret societies, it is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book is truly eye opening, to some it maybe upsetting,so be it. A must read if you are a mason, especially if you happen to be a knight templar."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is by far the only book trying to link the subjects of Freemasons, the \\"Priory of Sion,\\" Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, Leonardo da Vinci, sex magic, Mary Magdalen, etc etc et multiple cetera, but it must be said that it is one of the better and more well researched, or at any rate extensively and soberly researched, of the mess of them.The authors have written on this subject before, and if you have read any of their other books on related subjects, including the Shroud of Turin, you will find a good deal of overlap in information between that book and this. That said, Picknett and Clive write reasonably well, and are less breathless in their prose, less truly speculative in their conclusions, and somewhat less impressionable in their guesswork than other authors in this field tend to be. They are looking to learn something, they are willing to do real research, and when the evidence is inconclusive (as it often is) they are not afraid to say so.That said, they follow as indicated above several different stories, and try to bind them all together through the interests or activities of the Priory of Sion, an alleged and self-promoting outgrowth of the Knights Templar. The best stuff follows John the Baptist and his cult; the weakest is what touches on the modern Priory (in my opinion an obvious fraud). The popularity of Mary Magdalen/Black Madonna and John the Baptist are well worth study even outside the framework of the whole Templar/Sauniere/Holy Blood story, and the authors do reveal quite a bit of this in their work.All in all, the book is a jumble of information, some new and some very well worn. It rewards a somewhat critical reading a good deal better than the majority of its competition in this aisle of the bookstore."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The unbelievability of the first chapter discussions of Leonardo Da Vinci's creation of the Turin Shroud and the very poorly explained purpose behind the alleged 'secret code' in Da Vinci's works cast a shadow of scepticism over the entire book. Further, the book raises some questions that it answers inadequately due to unfounded speculations. I also found distasteful the authors' attitude that they and they alone have found the correct answer. Frankly, they have neither found nor proven anything; they have merely added to pot, so to speak. In defense of the read, the book's ideas and arguments were not only informative and engaging, but deserve more consideration and serious study."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"As a scholar of religious studies far beyond laymanship and outside theology, I must say that this book is dangerous but not because of its content. Though it gives the reader an insight into Dan Brown's thinking and understanding as he wrote The Da Vinci Code, it is at best shaky scholarship, and this book that superficially looks like hardcore scholarship will have many untrained readers (the target audience) convinced where they should only be open to further discussions. The book is a work of rhetoric more than scholarly discussion. Picknett & Prince use 'perhaps statements' and constant (I daresay-almost exhaustive) repetition of their assertions to attempt to convince their readers.Additionally, while the authors do site some respected and/or at least acknowledged scholars at points in this discussions, for the most part there is little or not citations. This contradicts their repeated assertion that their work is the \\"brave\\" synthesis of more timid scholars' work. It is also soundly against the accepted and expected conventions of academic work of all fields. Picknett & Prince also fail to discuss the counter-arguments by other scholars to their meager sources, which is a general academic sign that one's hypothesis is flawed.The authors have the right intention in the fundamental premise of their book (that is, there is a secret hid from mainstream Western culture), but they are too willing to accept coincidence and analogy has support for their hypothesis while denouncing the mainstream views of certain historical events that contradict their hypotheses on the basis of coincidences and analogous circumstances. This is a common device of rhetoric.I urge people to read this book, but I want all of you to know that this book is not quality scholarship, though an orator would likely applaud it. It presents one view that is tenuously founded upon any accepted scholarship, and despite their insistence that they are not the only ones thinking this, amongAcademia they are."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Typical of similar books that promise a lot but reveal little. Lots of information relating to religion, free masonry, etc., but it revealed no real purpose of the Knights Templar group or any significant accomplishments. This is not surprising since much of the information was about religion, at best a myth and at the worst a terrible imposition on human progress... just as it is today. Not a book to keep as a reference or to ever read again."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book is definitely a great read, on a fascinating subject. But my concerns boil down to two issues: will either the skeptic or the believer be persuaded one way or another by all this massive research, utterly absorbing though it may be? and, since the question of the Priory of Sion interconnects with the central issues in Holy Blood, Holy Grail, and since the Priory seems to have been doing its work at least since the Renaissance, and is still doing it in France in the age of Existentialism and Deconstruction, why all the secrecy requiring all this research? Could any enlightened person in contemporary France still be concerned about the Church of Rome? I'm also a bit concerned that the authors of the present volume consistently get the title of the Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln book wrong. It's not The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. And I also wish the authors had tracked the Cathars back to the Nestorians and Manichaeans, which would explain the link with Jesus a bit more directly. I'm glad they debunk the Merovingian connection, which, if credible, seems as much an aspect of Merovingian mythos as a genuine bloodline. The central issue has to do with faith not monarchism in the late 20th Century. And, there again, I wonder whose mind is going to be changed by any of this, however fascinating the subject may be.I'm coming at this as a student of literature, so I'm particularly interested in the connections with Yeats and other turn-of-the-century dabblers in the pseudo-mystical. Picknett &amp; Prince have given me a lot of food for thought on that issue, since it has a great deal to do with the origins of 20th-century art, despite its questionable relevance to late-20th-century religion or politics."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Long beginning..lots of historical reference but the last section of the book is a real page turner! The reader is taken to places in the mind that defies all accepted knowledge. Jesus is not the Messiah? Mary Magdalene more than a converted sinner? Somehow the authors are able support this theory with documentation that makes the educated reader think more than twice! If you insist that what you learned as a child of Jesus and Mary Magdalene is the literal truth, stay way! The earth may still be flat. But if you need more answers to the 'mysteries' in the Bible, better read this one!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The book reads fast but like most psuedo-conspiratorial literature of its kind it gets imprecise. The New Testament is relied on when beneficial to their argument, but other parts are dismissed as fabrication. I find it hard to pick and choose as they did; thus as a whole I am sceptical of most of their conclusions. Also, themes that were important in the beginning of the book (i.e. the role of Mary Magdalene) tend to lose their weight as the book ends (if she was important to Jesus, and Jesus is not who the world thinks, why is she still important - it's hard to discuss without revealing spoilers!). In this vein, why is it so vital for the Priory to guard the lineage it guards? Had they addressed these and other contradicitons the book would have been too long and less compelling.Overall, the book was entertaining - a fun bit of subversion for Templar hunters."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I found 'The Templar Revelation' to be one of the more well written, seemingly well researched, and more scholarly presentations of this material that I have read in a popular book lately. It was a good read, and presents itself with somewhat more 'gravitas' than some of the more conjectural and related works by Lomas, et. al. on Freemasonry. 'The Templar Revelation' covers a heck of a lot of ground, from the Templars to Freemasons to Sumerian and Egyptian Hermeticism to early Judaism to Jesus and his 'mission', and the Saints John. There is something to be found in this book for everyone interested in the historical connections between these topics.My two negatives: 1) The first came late in the book when the authors delved into a bit of a negative presentation on Jesus and the Catholic Church - I was not affronted on spiritual grounds, but felt that writers could have offered some positive aspects of the Church of Peter while also laying out the heresies. The authors seemed to hint at what perhaps should not be believed in without offering anything to fill the vacuum that belief in their words would create, which left me as a reader unfulfilled at that part of the book. 2) After somewhat of a tour de force, the book concluded rapidly I thought, but maybe it was just that I wanted to keep reading more..."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book leaps from topic to topic and back again, in what seems to me a genuine effort on the authors' part to confuse the reader into thinking they've actually read some sort of proof. I can usually read even the most boring of books that are the same length as this in a day- it took me a week to wade through this \\"research\\". There is not one reference cited in the bibliography that dates further back than 1820. Furthermore, the so called documents cited as proof were second hand at best- the authors did not seek out these documents to see for themselves what information they contained, instead they rely on accounts from other books to describe the documents.As to what the book concludes, personally I think it's definitely possible that Jesus was married,and so on- It does nothing to change my faith in the least, nor do I think it takes away from His divinity. As far as Mary Magdalene goes, I never have thought she was a prostitute, nothing in the Bible ever led me to conclude that- as to the rest of the conclusions, they don't have much merit, if any. Come on people, the Church covered up that she was a priestess to a pagan goddess? John the Baptist was really the Messiah?

Indeed, the book exposes that the legendary priory of sion was, and has been, the keeper of this supposed secret truth for centuries.While the book does an excellent and, as I said, entertaining job of proving that the above mentioned did indeed believe this heresy, it all but totally fails to prove that this heresy has any amount of truth to it. In fact, the revelation that this book pompously purports to bring us is nothing more than conjecture and often, hollow speculation. Not to say that it does not present interesting evidence like, for example, the apparent parallels between ancient egyptian theology and the Christian resurrection story. Only that the evidence, while thought provoking, does not come anywhere near the threshold that would allow the theory to be taken seriously.One interesting aspect that the book does delve into is the possible connection between Mary Magdalene and Isis. Very little, of course, is known about this Mary and I suspect there are probably very juicy secrets hidden somewhere about this mysterious, and underestimated woman. I also appreciate the authors attempt to re-examine her role and importance in the Christian story as I am a firm believer that she is to return to Earth in the end-time as one of the two witnesses of Revelation, along with the prophet Elijah."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The notion that the traditional jesus,as presented in the gospels,and as merchandised by the various christian religions,may be false sticks painfully in the crawls of true believers...Books like this one expand upon this notion wonderfully,even if thier\\"proofs\\" are sometimes a bit thin...but,at the very least,there ARE some proofs to support thier view that Jesus was not the personality that the christian religion claims,which,of course,is more than can be said for what the religions themselves present,i.e.\\"faith\\"...Imagine what a mess this world would be if everything was not backed up with any proofs whatsoever,but were instead belived on faith alone...A world like that would be a haven for liars and confidence tricksters of all sorts..Which,as the evidence argues,is exactly what the original church fathers were,when they transformed an old egyptian religious myth into the jesus story of today...That they MAY have been motivated by something other than selfishness is beside the point.Further,the fact that they had to edit out so many real facts in order to create thier fantasies says much about why,today,almost two thousand years after they began constructing thier jesus fable,it is so difficult to present the sort of evidence that would refute thier myth once and for all..History clearly shows the early church as being intolerant of all doctrines that were in competition with thier own and,further,history clearly shows the brutal lengths to which the church would go to stamp out such competition..Why then would it be in any way viewed as\\"crackpot\\"that the church would likewise make every effort to destroy any evidence that would in any way shatter the image it has constructed around it's version of who and what jesus may have been?That the church did not succeed in destroying all of the evidence relating to this massive fraud is fortunate..Books such as this one,while in many ways speculative,at least rely upon some of that leftover evidence and,unlike the church itself,does not expect the reader just to belive it blindly..."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This book ignores much new information.

They point up the FACT that much was tacked onto Christianity in 325 a.d.and thereafter, while much was also deleted (that which is mystical proving that man's journey through &quot;the valley of the shadow&quot; is one of growth/evolution and not of condemnation and the stupid and spurious notion of &quot;eternal hell-fire.&quot;) in order to render mankind obedient to a &quot;church&quot; instead of to God who is lodged in the center of his soul as Jesus or the higher-self or &quot;super-ego.&quot; The error depicted in this work is that the authors fail to realize that the Bible does not portray veridical history but that of esoteric parable instead. Q: Would the authors of the New Testament elect to follow a policy of which Christ would have adamantly disapproved? A: Certainly NOT. Christ states matter-of-factly that he speaks to the &quot;multitudes&quot; in &quot;parable&quot; and to the elect in open meanings. Therefore, the authors of the NT would have penned their messages in parable and not LITERAL disquisition. The authors' allusions to the feminine aspects of the Savior has nothing to do with flesh and blood people, but, instead, with androgeneity or humanity finding the other gender-halves of their souls (&quot;Anima&quot; in women and &quot;Animus&quot; in men)so that they might re-integrate the halves toward wholeness (vide: Dr. Carl Jung's works.) They do underscore the fact that there is much more to Christianity (Churchianity and religion are to good spiritual health what Twinkies and Slurpies are to good physical health) than we've been told.

Their's is aphilosophy rooted in ancient occult traditions. Success is near, and the infiltration of society byNew Age occultism is the reason for this success. The New World Order has never been solelyabout world government, rather, from the beginning its proponents have been privy to secretdoctrines and it is a spiritual plan more than anything.If one failed to take into account the occult nature of the New World Order, they would beremiss. The UN and the New Age have been bed-fellows since the beginning. America's secretdestiny is the product of Rosicrucian and Freemason forefathers. The New Atlantis as proposed inFrancis Bacon's work is almost at hand. The Ancient Mysteries are being studied for illuminationand enlightenment by the New World Order's elite. Not to mention the New Age gurus -- dutifullyrecruiting on behalf of the Secret Brotherhood.In 1980, Marylin Ferguson compiled and espoused a synthesis involving the theories oftransformation and the secret plan of the Aquarian Age. In her studies of the scientificadvancements of this age involving entropy and syntropy, holism, holographs, paradigm shifts,the uncertainty principle and evolution, she discovered that, \\"for the first time an Americanrenaissance is taking place in all disciplines, breaking the boundaries between them, transformingthem at their farthest reaches--where they all converge.\\" (The Aquarian Conspiracy p.12)BOUGHT AND PAID FOR BY ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION This is how mind control is done.This is how public opinion is created from the top down.Get some goofy professor and pay for what you want..Speaking of the networks and web of influence, Ferguson proclaimed: \\"There are legions ofconspirators... in corporations, universities, hospitals, on the faculties of public schools, infactories, in doctors' offices, in state and federal agencies, on city councils and the White Housestaff, in state organizations, in virtually all arenas of policy making in the country[U.S.]...[including] at the cabinet level of the United States Government.\\" (ibid. p.24) However,other New Age proponents said that this is inaccurate, in that she had understated the influenceof the New Age worldwide, especially in the UN and the EEC.It is no coincidence that America has become the center of New Age and New World Orderconspiracies. The Theosophical and Rosicrucian traditions hold that every nation has a spiritualdestiny guided by a hierarchy of beings using all ethical (or un-ethical) means of manifesting the\\"divine plan\\" through the will of the nation's leaders.A proponent of the New Age and the Secret Brotherhood's plan for a New World Order is RobertHieronimus. In his book America's Secret Destiny, he traced the spiritual vision of America'sfounding fathers and the plan's eventual fruition in what we call the New World Order and theNew Age Movement (both of which are synonymous). He stresses that the founding fathers ofAmerica had the equivalent of \\"Masters\\" and were pupils in a sense, much like today's powerfulElite have Masters and Gurus, following the teachings of the Great Plan.According to the Rosicrucians and Theosophists, supporting the divine plan are great beingsreferred to as masters of the physical and spiritual planes. The evolution of America owes muchto the seed thoughts of four masters--Kuthumi, El Morya, Rogoczy, and Djwhal Khul. Some ofthe founders of America may have been consciously or unconsciously students of these teachers,just as some contemporary Americans are pupils of these masters. In fact, the motto of thehierarchy of world teachers is identical with America's destiny--the brotherhood of man and theFatherhood of God. (p. 95)Another writer, from the opposite camp, confirms the assertions of Heironimus. Willy Petersonwrites:In order to reach their aims of world unity and thus engage the whole world in service to thePlan, \\"enlightened\\" Freemasons and New Agers have been pushing for collectivist motifs thatpromote monistic pantheism and unity. This is why the chief instigators to the globalist League ofNations and the United Nations have been Theosophists, trying to work out the plan. This is whythe verbiage and aims at the U.N. is for world peace and brotherhood. It is a spiritualundertaking in a secular world. Lucis Trust has had three think-tanks located at the U.N. Plaza inNew York for around fifty years. No wonder the former Assistant Secretary General to the U.N.,Robert Muller, is a devoted disciple of Alice Bailey, whose book, A Treatise on White Magic, formsthe basis for the Robert Muller schools. (The Leavening)These people are called the torchbearers or lightbearers of the New World Order. A spiritual planthat has been traced to the time of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, up through to the Illuminatiand onwards. \\"A loosely-knit world conspiracy,\\" David Allen Lewis writes, \\"a so called Network ofIlluminists.\\" \\"Whether the Illuminati has one special organization that is its orginal descendant...we can be very sure that its philosophical torchbearers are represented by literally hundreds oforganizations and individuals in many diverse realms.\\" (Dark Angels of Light)A Blueprint For DestinyRobert Heironomus says that \\"America's Great Seal may be seen as a blueprint for the elevationof consciousness. It says, in part, that we must transform ourselves before we can change theworld, and that it is during the process of self-transformation that we can catch a glimpse ofwhat part we are to play in national and global transformation.\\"The mandala of the New World Order and Illuminati control. \\"Annuit Coeptis--He has Blessed ourBeginning\\", \\"Novus Ordo Seclorum--New Order of the Ages\\". The All-Seeing Eye of Horus, theresurrected Egyptian Sun God, biblically refered to as Lucifer, the angel of light.In occult doctrine it is thought that \\"from the union of spirit and matter (the pyramid is made ofstone, rock, and earth--and represents the unconscious. The capstone is made of an immaterialsubstance--light or spirit--and is conscious), a new being--a transformed being--is created. Theseal's reverse depicts a separation state in the separation of the eye the triangle.\\"\\"The pyramid exemplifies the initiation stage,... it is the house of initiation, in which thecandidate confronts the world of darkness and enters the world of spirit. By passing the tests ofthe elements, the candidate is initiated into the realm of higher consciousness.\\" (Heironimusibid., p.92) After succesfully completing the initiation process, the candidate is reborn, and joinsthe single eye in the pyramid.The New World Order, or rather the philosophy its deliverers hold to be true, is one and the sameas the New Age ideal of man's divinity and self-transformation. In order to partake in this gnosticfufillment of \\"The Great Plan\\" one must awaken to the original sin of Lucifer, as proposed to Evein the Garden of Eden, that \\"we can be as Gods.\\" (Gen. 3:5) So it is not suprising to find thatChristians, specifically, are cited as the main obstacle hindering the success of this New Age-NewWorld Order.The reason for this, is the New Age belief in many \\"saviors\\" and \\"enlightened teachers\\", mastersand gurus--its all good and fine when the goal is the false teaching of man's divinity. The NewAgers see many ways to salvation; Christians proclaim that there is only one Way - Jesus Christ.\\"For the gate is small, and narrow that leads to life, and few are those who find it.\\" (Matt. 7:14)The Bible states that this is in reality the \\"broad way that leads to destruction, and many arethose who enter it.\\" (Matt. 7:13) Therefore, the only religion not compatible with The New Age,and hence the coming New World Order, is the belief and strict adherence in the Word God -with traditional Christianity being looked upon as particularly pernicious.In Dark Secrets of the New Age, Texe Marrs wrote:The New Age is a universal open-arms religion that excludes from its ranks only those whobelieve in Jesus Christ and a Personal God. Buddhists, Shintoist, Satanists, Secular Humanists,witches, witch doctors and shamans -- All who reject Christianity are invited to become trustedmembers of the New Age family. Worshippers of separate faiths and denominations are to beunified in a common purpose: THE GLORIFICATION OF MAN.The Guardians of the MysteriesFreemasonry, by its own accord, practices the ancient mysteries of Egypt, and has as a primarygoal, the re-instatement of this mystery religion for the coming World Order.The magical mystery religion of Ancient Egypt exercised a great fascination over Renaissanceman, which was incorporated into--the newly formed--Lodges at that time. The mysteriousheiroglyphs were considered to be symbols of hidden knowledge. Symbols and gestures becamea means of conveying secrets and \\"truths\\". The cosmos was seen as an organic unity. It waspeopled by a hierarchy of spirits which exercised all kinds of influences and sympathies. Thepractice of magic became a holy quest.Back in 1927, Freemason W.L. Wilmhurst saw the dawning of the Aquarian Age as the fufillmentof the \\"Plan\\". In The Meaning of Masonry, p.4, he writes:In this new Aquarian age, when many individuals and groups are working in various ways for theeventual restoration of the mysteries, an increasing number of aspirants are beginning torecognize that Freemasonry may well be the vehicle for this achievementHe would be well proud, I'm sure, of today's mainstream acceptance of those very same occultmysteries. Another passage on page 46-47, proves the teaching of Freemasonry is the same asNew Age beliefs:He begins his Masonic career as the natural man; he ends it by becoming through its discipline, aregenerated man... This the evolution of man into superman--was always the purpose of theancient Mysteries, and the real purpose of modern Masonry is, not the social and charitablepurposes to which so much attention is paid, but the expediting of the spiritual evolution of thosewho aspire to perfect their own nature and transform it into a more god-like quality.Freemasonry, through its mysteries, will soon usher in a New World Religion for the New WorldOrder. A modern day Tower of Babel and the ultimate unification of the world's religions. TheNew Age welcomes these goals and looks to the \\"light\\" of Masonry as its esoteric basis for occultinitiation into the New World Order. Benjamin Creme writes:The New Religion will manifest, for instance,through organizations like Masonry. In Freemasonryis embedded the core or the secret heart of the occult mysteries, wrapped up on number,metaphor and symbol...(The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of Wisdom p.87)Freemason and co-founder of Lucifer Publishing Company (now called Lucis Trust), Foster Bailey,concurs, \\"Is it not possible from a contemplation of this side of Masonic teaching that it mayprovide all that is necessary for the formulation of a universal religion?\\"(The Spirit of Masonryp.113) Foster Bailey states that Masonry \\"is the descendant of, or is founded upon, a divinelyimparted religion...\\" This religion he explains, \\"...was the first United World Religion. Then camethe era of separation of many religions and sectarianism. Today we are working again towards aWorld Universal Religion.\\" (ibid p.31)To biblical students these are shocking admissions and it adds fuel to the charge of a MasonicAntichrist in our midst. \\"It is these Mysteries which Christ will restore upon His reapearance,\\"Alice Bailey reveals, \\"thus reviving the churches in a new form, and restoring the hiddenMystery.\\" (The Reappearance of the Christ, p. 122) Bailey is giving these \\"revelations\\" by herchanneled Master Djwhal Khul -- a disembodied \\"Ascended Master\\". Her \\"Christ\\" is indeed theAntichrist in the strictest sense of the word. Antichrist means substitute for or in place of Christ.She goes on to say that \\"These ancient Mysteries were originally given to humanity by theHierarchy [of which Djwhal Khul is a part of] and contain the entire clue to the evolutionaryprocess, hidden in numbers, in ritual, in words and in symbology; these veil the secret of man'sorigin and destiny, picturing to him in rite and ritual, the long, long path which he must tread,back into the light.\\" (ibid, p.121-22)So what do we have here:The New Age tells its disciples that they are working for the Hierarchy.The teachings of the New Age are giving by the Hierarchy.The movement for the installment of the Antichrist is giving the go-ahead by the Hierarchy --Djwhal Khul's number one message for New Age disciples is \\"prepare men for the reappearanceof the Christ. This is your first duty.\\" (The Externalization of the Hierarchy, p.614)The Ancient Mysteries, being practiced by both Freemasonry and the New Age, were giving tohumanity by the Hierarchy.The real purpose of Masonry -- taught to man, from the Hierarchy -- is the expediting of thespiritual evolution, to transform their nature into a god-like superman.The Serpent caused the Fall in the Garden of Eden by giving Eve this very same message.\\"Man is a god in the making. And as the mystic myths of Egypt, on the potter's wheel, he is beingmolded. When his light shines out to lift and preserve all things, he receives the triple crown ofgodhood.\\" (Manly P. Hall, The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, p. 92)\\"European mysticism was not dead at the time the United States of America was founded.

Not to say that it does not present interesting evidence like, for example, the apparent parallels between ancient egyptian theology and the Christian resurrection story. Only that the evidence, while thought provoking, does not come anywhere near the threshold that would allow the theory to be taken seriously.One interesting aspect that the book does delve into is the possible connection between Mary Magdalene and Isis. Very little, of course, is known about this Mary and I suspect there are probably very juicy secrets hidden somewhere about this mysterious, and underestimated woman. I also appreciate the authors attempt to re-examine her role and importance in the Christian story as I am a firm believer that she is to return to Earth in the end-time as one of the two witnesses of Revelation, along with the prophet Elijah."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"By the time I reached page 106 of this book, my frustration with the authors and their suppositions, caused my interest level to drop to zero."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"It is hard to accept the basic conclusions of the author, especially if one has faith in the Shroud of Turin.

The authors suggest Christians are unwilling to see objectively the evidence for a pseudo-Egyptian mystery school as the foundation for the emergence of the Christian \\"cult\\". As there were many splinter groups of Judism (and a great many self proclaimed, or otherwise, messiahs), it is unreasonable to assume Jesus was not what the Bible says He was. The conflict between Peter, James, Paul, Barnabas, etc. of Acts and the letters, shows no hint of anything but the problems related to the mission to the Jews and Gentiles and interpretation of Jewish Law for the Gentile believers.It is true that Jesus was a Nasorean or Nasorite, but the term initially meant one who was dedicated to God. His life as recorded in the Gospels depicts one so dedicated.The authors seem to be unaware that there are many aramaic idioms in the Bible which are improperly translated. Jesus did not cry out for Helios, nor did He believe God had abandoned Him, in the last hour on the cross. (See the excellent books published by the Noohra Foundation.) They also seem to be unaware that the gospels contain redactions which fit the viewpoint of the one(s) who did the writing.It is unfortunate that the Church which finally emerged so vehemently condemned all of gnosticism. The teaching has been it is difficult to experience God. For all those who have had mystical experience(s), the opposite is true. The problem is that mystical experience cannot be translated into the four-dimensional physical world of ours in language that is exact, so that another can taste, feel, or see what the mystic has experienced. While the sages of the past taught methods which could bring one to the threshold, the experience is ultimeately a give and take between the devotee and the One who is sought.Actually, for me the teachings of Jesus are similar to teachings found in the body of Jewish mysticism, The Kabbalah."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is an extremely interesting subject. Unfortunately, this particular book is poorly written. The book lacks organization and support for their arguments. It reads like it was written by a committee of high school students.The logic goes something like this: DaVinci's paintings, through symbolism, show an unorthodox view of Jesus and John. Cocteau's paintings show an unorthodox view of Jesus and John. The logical conclusion is that they were both members of the same secret society.Perhaps they both were members, but it does not logically flow from the suppositions. The entire book is filled with these logical fallacies. Although I tend to agree with many of their conclusions, it's not because of their arguments.An extremely interesting subject that is best explored in other books."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"well, when one read this book it seems like a great work of scholarship.

Good job Picknett &amp; Prince"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"While I love conspiracy theories and alternative views of history, I must say this book is mostly garbage.For example, several times the authors state their belief that Leonardo da Vinci created the Shroud of Turin with his own hands. Leonardo was born in 1452.The Shroud is mentioned several times in records going back to 1349.In 1390 the Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a memorandum to Antipope Clement VII stating the Shroud is a forgery and the artist has confessed. In 1453 Margaret de Charney deeded the Shroud to the House of Savoy. There are many other references to the Shroud before Leonardo could have possibly manufactured it.Sloppy historical work? You bet! And their other \\"research\\" isn't much better - speculation and conjecture combined with a dose of gullibility.There is one issue they raised and could have explored to greater profit. Why is it that so many modern day bankers and financiers (educated, sophisticated, wealthy and practical people) belong to secret fraternities and pursue occult (Satanic?) rituals? You'll have to look elsewhere for the answers, e.g. Babylon's Bankers by Joseph Farrell, among other works."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"While i agree with Mr. nomo23, a reviewer who sounds very learned, about the pettiness between authors, I found the book very intriguing. It brough to light alot I didn't know about the dead sea scrolls, and Madonna worship among other things. However, I wonder just how far some things were 'stretched' to make a point at times during the book. I also must agree with one of the other 'Reviewers' that it DOES tend to leave you feeling 'beaten up' at times, as well as seeming to be 2 different books..the first 1/3rd and last 2/3rds. Over all, I'd still recommend it as a good read for anyone with an open mind, and curiosity."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I totally enjoyed reading this book. It provides an engaging and interesting perspective on Christianity and, as other reviewers have pointed out, turns our culture today upside down.While it is interesting however to imagine the world if that theory was true, the book definitely does not have the authority to do that. Poor research, unattributed STRONG statements, sources that are as valid as &quot;a secret newsletter distributed on the streets of Paris in 1890.&quot; At some passages of teh book I felt insulted by the authors for failing to support their conclusionms by evidence or by using their own assumptions as evidence."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"This is a fascinating book, tough not the easiest read. Having read &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; before having read this was a huge help since the former is quoted on almsot every other page. The facts contained here are interesting, and the 2 seperate conclusions arrived at are also. However,they do not fit together. While the conclusion about Mary Magdalene is interesting and , in view of everything else written on the subject, believable, and so is the conclusion about st. John the Baptist, together, these do not flow. it seems that one fo these must be true, but not both.In general, this book is well-researched but vague. One has to have prior knowledge of some of th subjetsfor them to make sense. Some subjects are given too manty pages and turn out to be largely irreevant, while others are brushed over very quickly. on the whole though, the book is mostly very believable, and the information is accurate."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Not the best book in this area. The most annoying aspect of this book is how the author makes somewhat of leap to connect the dots. Then in the next chapter that shaky conclusion is referred to again as it was hard and true fact to make yet another leap."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"In the first few chapters I thought the authors were doing a pretty good job combining their research with a relaxing vacation along the Southern coast of France. As I read further the (not-so-subtle) mood of the book began turning into one of Feminism and, in my humble opinion, as least, to wild speculation that Jesus Christ may have been preaching a blended version of the Isis-Diana cult instead of the Jewish religion. There is this strong undertone in the book that seems to imply that somehow Jesus was nothing more than a bystander or someone with little influence over the events which would lead to his crucifixion. Rather, the women in his life, especially Mary Magdalene, is the heroine of the play - but on what evidence? It is too simplistic to say that just because there were cults like that of Diana and Isis around in Palestine at the time of Jesus, that there is a linkage between the crucifixion and these cults. I think Picknett and Prince did not do sufficient research into the religious aspects/significance of the events leading to the crucifixion and event before and after the crucifixion of the book and instead appears to have written the book in some haste and for little literary reason. Also a large portion of the book appears to b little more than a review of other books written on the links between Freemasonary, Christianity (and Jesus Christ himself) and the Templars."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I began reading this book with open minded enthusiasim. I hoped that it would deepen my knowledge of the Cathars and Templars. What I found instead was startlingly poor research. At first, I kept rereading their quotes and data, because I felt that I must have missed something,because the quotes and data do not support their inferences and conclusions. As a read along, I realized that the authors have collected quotes and have very loosely strung them together to support their theory. There are many factual errors in this book. They really do not understand what the Cathars were all about. Their beliefs developed from the teachings of Mani. The Templars that were founded by Hugh de Payens in 1119 on Christmas day and later endorsed by Bernard of Clairvaux in 1128, have nothing to do with the Priory of Sion. Degenerate offshoots that may have survived after the massacre could have evolved into many of these groups that claim lineage to the original, but these offshoots do not carry on the original intentions and purpose of the founding group.A quote from the authors themselves summarizes this book: &quot;Unfortunately, given the scant information available, it is impossible to do more than speculate.&quot; (pg. 344, 1997 edition)"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Outstanding...

Through this book, for the first time, I came accross the so-called Gnostic Gospels which offer a very interesting alternative to conventional Christianity. I was also most impressed by the research undertaken by the writers, needless to mention the interesting topics covered. An enlightening document indeed: preferably to freethinkers rather than convetional christians who may find most of its contents absurd if not offending.

And in fact, on some level, I did like it because I learned quite a bit from it. The topic is interesting and I could appreciate the authors' meticulous attention to their research. But I honestly could not recommend the book because it was such a struggle to get through.A work of such magnitude, covering so many topics, needs a rigorous hand in organization and connective transitions. This book did not have that. In addition, the first half of the book suffered from a particularly muddled writing style. It improved noticably in the second half of the book, but that remains a relative statement.Overall, I cannot recommend the book. My apologies."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I was completely disapointed in this book. It is a work of fiction which tries very hard to appear objective. While some of the research is interesting, the premises are so far fetched, and full of holes that the conclusions lack any plausibility whatsoever. The authors will take bits and pieces of information, weave them together with \\"perhaps\\" and \\"this could be an indication of..\\", or \\"one might assume\\" and then use these \\"facts\\" to form the foundation of even more theories and hypothesis. The faith required to beleive anything in this book is exponentially higher than the faith required to believe the book it tries to refute - the Bible. If you are looking for a work of fiction and if you can completely suspend your disbelief while reading, you may find it interesting. However, if you are looking for some factual evidence against the Bible, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The book is full of unproven suppositions. They make a poorly proven case for a point in one chapter, then in the next, they allude to it as \\"as we have proven previously\\". Most of their\\"revelations\\" are such: Poorly proven.One example: They say the \\"Gospel Of Mary\\" refers to Mary Magdalene, and say it says so. They don't provide the quote. Well, I HAVE a copy of the Gospel Of Mary, and it clearly states it was wriiten by Mary, wife of Joseph, mother of JEsus.This is only one example of shoddy research writing. They fail to prove any of their points in the book, in fact they should make a discerning reader very skeptical!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"The Templar Revelation began with a very interesting theory - if thats what you call it. Perhaps I should say it began with some interesting points. For example, it details quite clearly a symbolic message Leonardo Da'Vinci painted into his works. One of these messages deals with the upward pointing index finger of John the Baptist whenever he was depicted. At any rate, the beginning was highly interesting and well delivered. However, the authors must have taken a lesson from the teachings of Freud and attempt to explain away the &quot;Secret of the Templars&quot; through various sexual rituals. To be honest, I almost felt as if they &quot;Picked&quot; out the most unlikely of secrets and tried to expound upon it (unconvincingly I might ad) for the sole purpose of shock value alone. For whatever reason, they decided to make the sex aspect the only &quot;real&quot; aspect worth writing about. In a nutshell, the books reads almost like two different books - the first 1/3 and then the last 2/3rds. If you have a seriously open mind, this book will spark your curiosity but then leave you bloodied and beat up along the way. A difficult read at best."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"Claiming on the front cover to be an expose about the \\"true identity of Christ,\\" the book comes to this conclusion on page 352-3: \\"Jesus was not the Son of God, and neither was he of the Jewish religion--although he may have been ethnically a Jew...John did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah. He may well have baptized him, because Jesus was one of *his* disciples, perhaps even rising through the ranks to become his second-in-command. Something went wrong, however: John changed his mind and nominated Simon Magus as his successor. Shortly afterwards John was killed. Mary Magdalene was a priestess who was Jesus' partner in a sacred marriage...\\"After reaching this point in the book, I put it down in disgust, something I am not wont to do (particularly after I've spent hour after hour plowing through a text), and decided to write this review.This book is offensive, not necessarily because of its radical and unsubstantiated claims about Jesus, but because it, like so many others of its ilk, confuses a constellation of conjecture, speculation, supposition, and allegation with EVIDENCE as it seeks to support a very unconventional hypothesis.From its first chapter, in which authors Picknett and Prince discuss the secret symbolism of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings (symbolism that most professional art historians consider spurious, by the way), the following pattern is established:- Explain away the fact that reputable and knowledgeable parties don't agree with your observations by linking these parties with the \\"conspiracy\\" you're attempting to expose.- Ask a question like, \\"what other possible explanation could there be?\\" and then refuse to seek explanations different from your own pet theory.- Use qualifiers like \\"perhaps,\\" \\"could,\\" \\"suppose,\\" \\"might,\\" or \\"conjecture\\" when establishing a speculative data point, and then forget about that qualifier when you bring up that same data point, as an established fact, in the next chapter to bolster the next data point.- Connect all your dots and claim that the picture you've just drawn is the REAL DEAL, all the while ignoring the fact that the dots you connected were all of your own design.I can't honestly say that the book was worthless; it was occasionally a fun read and the authors' ruminations contain lots of interesting, if unsupported, speculations about varied topics. The first half of the book does a fair job of showing possible connections between various esoteric and occult groups in Western history, such as the Knights Templar, the Hermeticists, and the Freemasons. As well, the second half of the book, which focuses on the \\"true identity of Christ,\\" is also interesting, if only because it offers a challenge to those whose knowledge of Christian origins and history is sorely wanting. (Didn't know that the New Testament was put together by a committee of bishops and their representatives? Well now you do.) And the chapter on the Mandaeans of Iraq was also very interesting and made me want to read more about this vanishing remnant of Gnostic religion. Having said that, the authors' tendency to conflate speculation with fact and their lack of hesitancy in passing the former off as the latter ruined this book for me as anything other than a work of fiction.Read it if you must, enjoy it if you can, but please remember that speculation and fact are two different animals. Just because Picknett and Prince have written it, doesn't make it so."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"First of all, this was a fascinating, eye-opening page-turner. The authors discuss a vast array of possibly connected puzzles and peculiarities ranging from the odd features in paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci, enigmatic New Testament characters, mysterious goings-on in the South of France, ancient Egyptian religion, stories of the Holy Grail and of course the murky origins of the Knights Templar. It's a lot of subject matter and although much of it has been written about before, these authors manage to insert some very original and insightful questions into the study of these mysteries.When I finished the book, I felt as if a great deal of information had been brought to light, but that a great deal more was still missing. I was mostly puzzled by the implication that hidden events from Biblical times were still so influential 1500 years later.Then, like finding a missing jigsaw puzzle piece on the floor, I came across a very strange book called &quot;History: Fiction or Science&quot; by a Russian mathemetician named Anatoly Fomenko. According to Fomenko, our accepted version of chronology is way off. Taken together with Templar Revelations, a picture finally begins to come into focus. If you enjoy the feeling of taking the &quot;red pill&quot; as regards the accepted version of Western history I highly recommend both of these books."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"While I very much enjoyed the book I must say that it merely touches the tip of the iceberg on the subject of the Templars and the Secret Tradition. Perhaps this is intentional, I don't know.The authors choose to focus on the works of recent biblical scholars to try to surmise what the Templars may have taught. And, of course, they rely on documents provided to the National Library of France by the Prieure de Sion. This group, to say the least, is a fringe group within the occult movement. There are plenty of other &quot;mainstream&quot; occult organizations which have published works which throw Light on the subject at hand.Specifically, I would direct you to those published by Harvey Spencer Lewis, former Imperator of the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC. His books &quot;The Mystical Life of Jesus&quot; and &quot;The Secret Doctrines of Jesus&quot; amplify the authors' thesis. And significantly, both books were published long before the publication of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hammadi Library."},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"I was watching the History's Channel's story about the \\"Lost Books of the Gospel\\" and after the show searched Amazon and came across this text. I was raised a Baptist, was very uncomfortable with formalized religion all my life, and hated the thought that women were so 'low' in the hierarchy of any of the organized religions. Now I know why.I believe in a higher being / creator spirit, and felt it had to be a female, and this book has actually validated my inner beliefs.What I find interesting about this book -- the authors have documented and foot-noted, and appendixed it beyond the call of duty. If either author makes a statement or supposition in the text, they back it up with anywhere from 1 - 3 various other publications, authorities, and/or writings and documentations from other sources.The authors don't come out and say \\"Jesus was a fake.\\" But, the more I read, the more I feel that the Christian church has pulled one of the biggest con games in history. If they aren't pulling a con, then let the Vatican open up it's library to the public and prove the authors and the public and the Templars wrong!Chapter One and Two of this book are fascinating -- I can see the 'true' details of the story plot used by the author of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and information he may have lifted directly from the Templar Revolution book (in fact some passages seem almost word-for-word duplicative).The rest of the Chapters in the book are very scholarly in their detail, but with effort one can follow along the logic and suppositions the authors draw from their research.The last chapter is the mind-blower, when all their conclusions are summarized - their theory - Jesus was a usurper of John the Baptist, quite possibly from Egypt, a magician, Mary Magdeline was either Jesus' wife or consort/priestess, and the possibility that Jesus' rise to the top was politically motivated to include murder to get that one last obstacle out of the way to his reaching the top of his preaching pinnacle. (Although the authors only theorized this possibility, didn't agreed or confirmed that theory.)Although I normally stick with fiction, this book held my fascination throughout the end -- even the appendix and footnotes have interesting tidbits.The only negative thing I can say is the detailed French related research, with (to me) obscure French names were difficult to wade through and keep straight.Kudos to the authors -- I'd love to read more of your research!"},{"Title":"The Templar Revelation: Secret Guardians of the True Identity of Christ","review":"As is the case in the books \\"Holy Blood Holy Grail,\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" among several others, this book too offers up interesting and sometimes rather bizarre hypotheses about Jesus, his life and death, and his movement: For instance, that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, survived the crucifixion, lived to a ripe old age, moved to France and founded the Merovingian dynasty, through which his bloodline was preserved by a secret organization called the Priori de Sion later carried on and protected by the Knights Templar -- all of which were suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. But this book has the added kicker that Jesus was also in competition with John the Baptist.Some of the author's hypotheses have been repeated enough times to give them a new kind of backhanded cachet -- if not some face validity and sustainable credibility. Hypotheses such as that which claims that Christianity was a mere offshoot of the Egyptian religious cult of Isis and Osiris, are now gaining ground. This thesis has been advanced not just in \\"soft research\\" (such as this book), but also in much harder and much more solid research by independent theological and biblical scholars. I especially urge readers who are interested to look into the very carefully done research of Jason Amod Deus, who has written a two-volume set called \\"The Great Leap-Fraud.\\" This volume begins its history nearly a millennium before the Christian era and carefully tracks all of the shenanigans and goings-on leading up to the development of Christianity. Talk about shock and awe? This carefully documented book will raise the hair on your neck.But more to the point of the present book, another angle used here to pull together the many competing hypothetical strains, is much less convincing. It involves the symbolism mined from Leonardo da Vinci's paintings and the corresponding attributions made to da Vinci himself. Symbolic attributions are \\"read into\\" faces, postures and mannerisms to give new meanings to what Jesus \\"must have been\\" doing at the Last Supper and other biblically important rituals. To put stock into these somewhat arbitrary interpretations, I believe requires a leap of faith that is at least as great as that required to believe in Christianity itself.Giving the authors' complex and ambitious undertaking its due, much of this story still hangs on the slender threat of these peculiar symbolic attributions and interpretations, and thus become increasingly harder to shallow as the text evolves. That said however, some strains have more face validity and archaeological support than others. For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls, which predated the time of Jesus (and thus Christianity), represent hard evidence that the structure and rituals of Christianity actually predated the religion itself?How could this be unless Christianity was simply a later adaptation of these earlier already existing pre-Christian religious forms? Add to this the fact that the Catholic Church did indeed withhold pubic investigation of these tracts for half a century and then released them only after they had been thoroughly vetted and massaged and redacted, and even then released them only piecemeal, and one does not get a warm and fuzzy feeling that the Catholic Church was all that anxious for the unalloyed truth to get out into the public realm. I wonder why not?Given the tenor of the times, it is imminently reasonable to come to the independent conclusion that Christianity must have been as much a political creation as a religious one, and that it almost certainly was a later adaptation of pre-existing religious forms. That this is a highly likely possibility alone leaves the orthodox version of the Christian narrative openly vulnerable to alternatives such as the one presented here as Templar Revelations, alternatives which offer more cogent and more factual interpretations.As a result, one of the upshots of this book is that these authors now join an ever-increasing chorus of scholars who agree that the roots of Christianity are almost certainly a derivative of the Egyptian cult of Isis and Osiris. This thesis of course was a claim made in the very controversial book \\"Black Athena,\\" which at the time caused a stir with what seemed such a radical claim that most thought it to be ridiculous: that Christianity was actually established by black people. It was of course rounded assailed when it came out in the mid-80s.

The large galleries are a great inspiration for artists of all levels.The book is broken into three main sections: forming, surface and firing. The first focus on creating clay objects; both throwing techniques and slab construction are covered here. Projects include making cups, a square covered jar and a slab teapot. The second section concentrates on surface techniques included raw glazing, majolica decoration and using terra sigillata. The third section gives instruction on three different firing techniques including using a gas reduction kiln, anagama kiln and raku-firing.You are guided seamlessly though each project with step-by-step instructions and photos. In the surface and firing sections the emphasis is on the finishing technique being featured, with basic information on how the object to be decorated was created. Some knowledge of the creation process is assumed. Each projects includes &quot;notes for the studio&quot; that I found very helpful. They give great advice on everything from the amount of clay your glazes contain to getting jar lids to fit correctly.There are beautiful galleries of numerous pieces after each section as well. Information on the gallery objects includes the artist, techniques used and size in both metric and English measurements. Contact information on the artists is provided in the back.In addition there are clay and glaze recipes from each artist. There are over 30 in total including a majolica base and Ferguson blue raku glaze. A list of schools that offer intensive workshops in pottery is also included.

Serves home-schooled students extremely well."},{"Title":"All Honourable Men","review":"Gavin Lyall is an excellent, if somewhat under-rated, writer of adventures and spy novels. His latest offerings are set in the years just before World War I and feature Britain's recently established Secret Service Bureau - a small, low-budget, and rather amateur outfit establishing its usefulness through the force of character of its head and the dedicated service of its few operatives.Like others in the series \\"All Honourable Men\\" features as its protagonists the \\"odd couple\\" of agents: Ranklin, the very English army officer with his military career \\"on hold\\" through no fault of his own, and O'Gilroy, the streetwise Irish republican on the run from his former comrades. They each have their strengths and weaknesses - indeed Ranklin says that put together they make one (passable) agent. In this he sells them short. They are very human and engaging characters with their own reasons for the work they do, but they do it professionally and as a first-rate team.In this book they find themselves pitched not just into danger but into high politics. The Germans are building railway through Turkey, which doesn't suit Britain's interests. When they run into a problem they need British help in resolving, Ranklin and O'Gilroy are part of the team sent ostensibly to sort things out. In fact they have secret instructions to make them worse, while not getting killed, or (worse) found out. But they aren't the only ones with an agenda of their own. To Germany, Britain and Turkey add America (or at least American big business with its own interests to safeguard) and France, and you have a veritable witches' brew bubbling away in one of the world's political hot spots. The two spies are in for an eventful time.Lyall shows real skill in bringing people and situations to life. The detail is never oppressive but it transports you back to that vanished time. You get to know Ranklin, and O'Gilroy, and the others, and understand the world they live in and why they think and act the way they do. He also has his fair share of dry British wit and irony, and some fine turns of phrase that enhance your enjoyment while letting you learn more about Ranklin and O'Gilroy, and why they do what they do."},{"Title":"All Honourable Men","review":"Lyall is an under-rated thriller writer. His best books are probably the Harry Maxim series, some of which were made into BBC TV shows. This series, which focuses on the British Secret Service on the eve of WWI, is solid, above average entertainment. Lyall does well with good character development, solid plotting, and reasonable attention to historical detail. Hard to obtain in the US because these books were published in Britain, well worth a few dollars in a used bookstore."},{"Title":"All Honourable Men","review":"I rather liked this book -- a bit different from Gavin Lyall's others where the heros tend to be aeroplanes. Interesting to read a novel set in a forgotton segment of history."},{"Title":"Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2004","review":"Jim Murray is, according to many whisky aficionados, the premier writer on whisky. He has visited virtually every distillery in existence, and has an unsurpassed knowledge and love of whisky.His latest book is tall and narrow, the same size as Michael Jackson's Pocket Guide to Beer, so it can be carried along to stores when purchasing whisky. And this is Murray's intention: the book is written as a buying guide for the consumer. Unlike in his previous books, Murray gives numerical ratings to the more than 2000 whiskies he evaluates, a number from 0 to 100, broken down into numbers for nose, taste, finish and balance, each receiving up to 25 points. Although numerical ratings will help whisky drinkers and store owners, he knows that many in the industry may be unhappy with his ratings.Murray intends his guide to become a yearly publication that will be supplemented and updated throughout the year on the web site www.whiskybible.com.The book begins with introductory material, including a review of the whisky year, as well as a three-page diatribe about &quot;The Evils of Colour Prejudice&quot;, meaning the adding of caramel coloring to whisky. Murray claims that colorization degrades the taste of whisky and in many of his reviews, even very positive ones, he claims that the addition of caramel has taken its toll on the whisky's quality.The book's beginning also contains Murray's award winners for the year in 19 categories, with overall whisky of the year being George T. Stagg bourbon. He then lists, in four pages, all of the whiskies that received a score of 93-97. (One omission: Longmorn 15 year old, to which he gives a score of 93, is not on the list.) Only two whiskies receive a 97, George T. Stagg and Old Malt Cask Ardbeg 1975 Aged 25 years (bottled Oct 00), &quot;without a shadow of a doubt ... the two best whiskies it has ever been my luck and privilege to taste in nearly 30 years&quot;. Along with many expensive and rare whiskies on this list are found widely available relatively inexpensive whiskies. Receiving 94, for example, along with Old Malt Cask Ardbeg 1975 Aged 24 years and Laphroaig 40 year old, one finds Glenmorangie 10 year old, Dalwhinnie 15 year old, and even the Canadian Seagrams VO, which I'd guess is most often used as a mixer.Scotch whisky, including single malts, grain whisky and blends, accounts for about 70% of the book's contents, the remaining 30% being devoted to American, Japanese, Canadian, European and world whiskies. There was no room in this edition for Indian and other Asian whiskies, but Murray hopes to accommodate these in future editions. The book concludes with a Stop Press section evaluating late bottled and additional whiskies, a glossary, and advice on how to drink whisky.As always, Murray's writing is personal and passionate, and the book makes for fascinating reading. His commentary is by turns lyrical, colorful, provocative, angry and funny (see his review of Littlemill Dunglas, to which he gives a rating of 17).Jim Murray is a romantic about whisky whose writing draws one into his intense devotion to the drink. For someone beginning to explore the world of whisky, as well as for the whisky expert, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2004","review":"Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2004 is one of the most delightful whisky reads in existence. It is absolutely loaded with nuggets, ratings, tips and lore. Like Michael Jackson's excellent tome, Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible is very approachable, yet somehow even more engaging. (Maybe it's because Murray's writing is more casual and conversational.) Plus, the 2004 version is at least four years newer than the latest edition of Jackson's guide, so you will find more complete coverage of all the labels and varieties--making the ratings significantly more useful when you tote this book to the local liquor store. Although I disagree with some of Murray's ratings, you can't question his credentials.If you love whisky, this is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2004","review":"A word on the book itself: my edition is from 2006 - this is updated every 2 years I believe, but I suspect only the really hard-core would need to buy every edition. It's long and narrow and has a flexible cover and would fit easily in the pocket as one peruses the shelves at one's local fine liquor purveyor; a warning to those with less-than-perfect eyesight though, the print is quite small. There's not a lot in the way of introductory material - a short rundown on the year in spirits, and very brief intros to the book's main sections - Scotland, Ireland, USA, Japan, and everywhere else. If you're looking for general information on the Water of Life, this is not the book to buy. If on the other hand you're looking for an enormously knowledgeable guide to all that's wonderful (and the little that's awful) in the world of this wonderful adult beverage, this might be the best starting point you could find.Some might find Murray too kind a critic -- on his 100-point scale, almost none of the 3,000 or so whiskys rate less than 80, and the vast majority are 90+ -- but Murray is a hedonistic lover of the spirit in all its guises, not a pedantic finder of faults, and that's all to the good for those like me who are just beginning to find our ways in this distillation of humble grains. His ratings are highly descriptive, effusive, sometimes seeming overboard -- until I try the particular liquor in question, at which point I realize that he's typically on the money even at his most loquacious. I'm happy, personally, that he loves Bourbon and Rye as much as he does, rating them every bit the equal of Scotch, that in fact he is as unprejudiced a whisky writer as you'll find. My edition is from 2006; I will surely be buying updated editions as long as my thirst needs slaking....and I'll be updating this review after I finally crack my bottle of his #1 whisky, George T. Stagg."},{"Title":"Jim Murray's Whiskey Bible 2004","review":"Why would you buy this book? Why not just drink that old bottle of Jim Beam or Johnny Walker? Because you don't want to make the mistake of buying a bottle of blended Scotch for $500 with a rating of 77/100, like a family friend did. Cost or more aging does not necessarily equate to a higher rating or a higher complexity of taste, body, and finish.This book is one of the most detailed and comprehensive guides to Whiskey/Whisky in the world. Covering Scotch (single malt and blends), and whiskey from every whiskey producing country such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Australia, and Austria, Jim Murray rates spirits by Nose, Taste, Body, and Finish (0 to 25 with a composite of 0 to 100). I would not and have not wasted any of my time or money on purchasing whiskey, without referring to this book. From the rare 50 year old 6,000 British pound bottle of Royal Salute to the $18 dollar bottle of Bourbon, this book covers a vast majority of them.Each year he bestows upon various distilleries the best of each class of whiskey (World Whisky of the Year, Scotch Single Malt of the Year, Best New Scotch Single Malt of the Year/Single cask, Bourbon of the year, Irish Whisky of the Year, etc).In the front of the book there is a summary page that shows ratings with the subclassifications (for example, 97 Rating with subheadings of Scotch Single Malt, Bourbon, etc). It is helpful if you're about to go somewhere and try to find 'the best'.His writing style is straightforward and a pleasure to read. Notes are descriptive and accurate, and drinks are rated from a scale of 0 to 100 (although, I have never seen anything higher than a 97). 0-50, he comments as \\"Nothing short of absolutely diabolical\\", whereas 98-100 is \\"Better than anything I've ever tasted\\". He also talks about the latest trends in the industry and each installment of the book rates more and more whiskey, each subsequent year.Even though some of the more obscure barrels of bourbon are not in this guide (for example, Pappy van Winkle 18 year old), it's still a worthwhile investment.Before you buy that $200 dollar of bourbon or that $1,500 bottle of Macallan, you need to read this book. It WILL save you time, aggravation and money. I am still searchin' for a good ol' bottle of George T. Stagg (97/100).HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Speaking Pain Free German The Natural Way /6 One Hour Audiocassette Tapes /Complete Listening Guide and Tapescript (Cassettes)","review":"I am so impressed that someone finally developed a fast and easy German course that made it simple enough for me to communicate with my family members in Germany.

It makes for a maturer read than most commercial yuri, so you should check this out for a change in pace (if you read my other reviews, yes I am repeating myself here. I'm delivering the same message, because none of these volumes deserve to have just one single star). You'll dislike some stories, but they are so varied that you'll still like a couple. My personal favorite story is 'Overboard,' where two girls from foreign countries do not understand each other's language but intimately understand each other nonetheless; it's really cute and sweet. If you're starting out with the series, start with this volume, and if you like it, the next two volumes shouldn't be any different.And the 6th volume of Yuri Monogatari is coming out probably in March 2009, so be sure to add that to your collection too."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Health Law","review":"I used this book last semester in a Health care compliance class.

Tonal expressions are inverted from what they are supposed to be. You'd have to have another reference to understand what they mean. This book would be very confusing for a first timer although they try to sound it out with english words next to the pinying (which is helpful to beginners and not included in many other chinese phrase books with exception to Chinese in 10 minutes a Day).

If normal character-based written entires were included with the text, the traveler could at least use the phrase book for pointing, but with only pinyin romanization (along with Abraham's persistent and distracting toneless phonetic approximations), this book will probably not help much with inevitable language gaps.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"},{"Title":"Chinese Phrases For Dummies (For Dummies (Language & Literature))","review":"I liked this little guide.

Many suggestions are offered to remedy, for instance, a lack of responsibility in doing chores, or being able to meet a curfew.The book also explains how to handle situations that as a parent you don't appreciate-like when your son/daughter hangs around the wrong crowd. The book also has a very interesting chapter on &quot;Love Languages&quot;. These five essential languages are a vital eye-opener and shows how your teens accepts love from others!

After all, this book by Donald Dale Jackson and the Editors of Time-Life Books does not talk about battles or generals, politicians or issues. What it does do is look at what things were like for the common folks back home (a similar volume, &quot;Confederate Ordeal&quot; looks at the Southern side of the equation). Chapter 1, &quot;Fissures of Dissent,&quot; looks at the political divisions that existed in the North, personified by men such as New York &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher and self-appointed gadfly Horace Greeley and Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandigham, hero of the Peace Democrats. Chapter 2, &quot;The Enterprising Union,&quot; covers the economic machine that fueled the Union war effort. Chapter 3, &quot;Mustering the Legions,&quot; details how recruitment eventually gave way to the first military drafts. Chapter 4, &quot;An Artery of Love,&quot; focuses on the Sanitary Commission that was established to support the soldiers in the field. Chapter 5, &quot;The Political Battles,&quot; covers the Presidential election of 1864 in which Lincoln defeated former general McClellan. The book ends with several full-page photographs of Lincoln showing how he changed over the course of the war. &quot;Twenty Million Yankees&quot; has the virtue of covering in more depth topics that are normally not part of the record when reading about the great battles of the Civil War.

The stories are very funny, peppered with the catchy slang of Runyon's small-time con artists, racetrack touts, Broadway characters, and guys who are \\"just around.\\" You don't have to be a Runyon fan to enjoy such stories as \\"Broadway Incident\\" (drama critic Ambrose Hammer goes nightclubbing), \\"Madame La Gimp\\" (hoodlums pass off a bag lady as a society matron), \\"A Piece of Pie\\" (the gang wants to bet on Nicely-Nicely Jones in an eating contest), \\"Delegates at Large\\" (Harry the Horse and his associates attend a political convention), \\"Hold 'Em, Yale\\" (the gang attends a \\"very large football game between the Harvards and the Yales\\"), and many more. \\"Most pleasant\\" reading for comedy fans."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"Damon Runyon's collection of short stories was first published in the early 1930's - and lights up the seedy side of New York at that time. It is a world where all men seem to be shysters, gangsters, crooked lawyers, or somehow on the make - and all the women are Dolls.Runyon has the most wonderful voice - it is disarmingly confessionaly, sort of like you would expect a poorly educated but street smart gangster to talk in front of judge. So for instance in &quot;Blood Pressure&quot; which I think is one of the best stories he writes - &quot;..Charley opens a door and we step into a room where there is a pretty red-headed doll about knee hight to a flivver, who looks as if she may just get out of the hay, because her red hair is flying every which way on her head, and her eyes seem still gummed up with sleep. At first I think she is a very cute sight indeed, and then I see something in her eyes that tells me this doll, whoever she is, is feeling very hostile to one and all.&quot;There are a great number of repeated characters that litter these tails, Nicely-Nicely, Regret, Dave the Dude - and everyone hangs around at Mindy's - a restaurant somewhere in New York.Nice, funny reads - Runyon and Saki rate as the two top short story writers ever."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"I am sitting around one night years ago and my sister comes into the room and hands me these short stories and says ' you gotta read em' cause they got characters in them like Little Augie and Nibsy and ' the Walking Encyclopedia of Baseball Knowledge' and ' Posey' and 'Itchie Samiof ' and all the guys we know from Richman's gambling joint. So I sit down and I begin to read and its like these people on the page are the very spitting image very spitting of those we are meeting every day just on our corner . And these characters are very much like those my Uncles Jack and Reddy are inviting in the house all the time to play pinochle only even more funny and almost as nasty .So I say this book comes out of American life and is the genuine article although someone else tells me a lot of these guys most of been reading Damon Runyan and so started acting and talking like his characters just to make it seem that they are bigshots which is of course what they all are-when they are not broke which is most of the time.Well this has not been a very successful effort at parody or paraphrase or whatever is, but it is a way of saying you will really really enjoy reading about ' Nicely Nicely' and 'Nathan Detroit ' and all the other Runyan characters. Ring Lardner may have been a smarter guy but old Damon Runyan why he could almost make colloquial as good as old JD Salinger would a little later from a bit further uptown.Try it , try it you'll really really like it."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"Damon Runyans writing is very amusing. He is sort of the American P.G. Woodhouse without all the spondulucks. His shorts also remind me of Roald Dahls in their twisted endings.I wish someone would hunt up and publish all his newspaper columns and war correspondence.Read his stories and you will be amazed at how often you recognize his plots in film. He was one of the great American writers and belongs in the same sentence as Twain Hemmingway Steinbeck and London."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"Before reading this book, all I knew of Damon Runyon came from the movies that had been inspired by his short stories: Guys and Dolls, Little Miss Marker, The Lemondrop Kid, Pocketful of Miracles, and such. So I picked this book up more out of curiosity than anything else, but I have to say that I now know Damon Runyon to be one of the absolute masters of the short story, one of the most unique world-builders who ever put pen to paper, and the creator of one of the most uniquely American narrative voices. His \\"citizens\\" and \\"characters\\" are the denizens of Broadway, as you can see in \\"Delegates at Large\\":\\"Sometimes you can see very prominent citizens sitting with me on the bank steps, including such as Regret, the horse player, and old Sorrowful, the bookie, and Doc Daro and Professor D and Johnny Oakley and The Greek...\\"\\"Well, one night I am sitting on the bank steps with Big Nig, the crap shooter, and a guy by the name of Skyrocket, who is nobody much, when all of a sudden I notice three guys standing on the sidwalk taking a very good long gander at me, and who are these guys but certain characters from Brooklyn by the name of Harry the Horse, and Spanish John and Little Isadore, and they are very hard characters indeed.\\"\\"In fact, these characters are so hard that I am glad that none of the depositors of the bank can see them standing there, as such a scene is just naturally bound to make any depositor nervous. In fact, it makes me more nervous than somewhat, and I am by no means a depositor.\\"The language, as the above shows, is one of the greatest delights of reading Runyon. His narrative voice is unlike any other with a cadence and grammar that truly draw you in to his world. This bit in particular from \\"Johnny One-Eye\\" is a good example of Runyon-speak:\\"So Rudolph decides to go on a journey but then he gets to thinking that maybe Freddy will remember a little matter that Rudolph long ago since dismisses from his mind and does not wish to have recalled again, which is the time he and Freddy do a job on a guy by the name of The Icelander in Troy years ago and he drops around to Freddy's house to remind him to be sure not to remember this.\\"\\"But it seems that Freddy, who is an imporant guy in business organization work himself, though in a different part of the city than Rudolph, mistakes the purpose of Rudolph's visit and starts to out with this rooty-toot-toot and in order to protect himself it is necessary for Rudolph to take his Betsy and give Freddy a little tattooing. In fact, Rudolph practically crockets his monogram on Freddy's chest and leaves him exceptionally deceased.\\"Many of the stories take place in the Broadway of the 1920's, 30's and 40's, but Runyon often delights in taking his citizens and characters out of New York and into the most improbable settings and situations: in \\"Delegates at Large\\", a gangster attends a political convention to impress a doll; in \\"Butch Minds the Baby\\", a safe-cracker takes his baby son along on a job; in \\"So You Won't Talk!\\", a parrot is kept as the only witness to a murder; in \\"The Melancholy Dane\\", a Broadway actor meets his worst critic on a battlefield in North Africa; in \\"Hold 'em, Yale!\\" a group of petty criminals end up defending the goal-posts at a Harvard-Yale game; and in \\"Johnny One-Eye\\", an injured kitten becomes the last companion of a wounded gunman.There are thirty-two stories in this collection, and of those thirty-two I would rate at least seventeen as classics that will stay with you forever. Most people when they think of Runyon know only of the comic humor that shows up in the movie versions of his stories, but in the stories you will see the real Runyon, an equal at the very least of O. Henry as a true master of the foibles of human nature and of the unexpected turns and twists of fate on his characters' lives. I cannot recommend this book highly enough; if you love stories that will touch you, that will make you laugh at and/or weep for the people you meet in them, and that will linger in your mind long after you're done, then this is a true must-read."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"In a way, the reviews that talk about how colorful and how much fun it is to read these stories are shortchanging the book.As a great actor will act \\"against part\\", ie play tragedy as if it were comedy and vice versa ... so will a great author. Look at Shakespeare. A well performed \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a laugh a minute, except for the fact that characters you care about keep dying or living hopelessly.Runyan is like that. Under each of these very funny stories is a lost soul surviving in a lost civilization. Even more to the point, I read these stories and I know these people ... I see myself and my friends in here, surviving inches above the gutter, ignoring the despair that lurks so near.This is colorful, brilliant comedy and, like all great comedy, has great tragedy at its heart."},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"I enjoyed most of this collection. I was reading it to help prepare for my role in an upcoming community theater production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. I thought it might be helpful to see where the characters came from. So, I immediately skipped to &quot;The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown&quot; and &quot;Blood Pressure&quot;, as they were the basis for the musical. Both stories were good, the latter better, but still neither was the best.Those expecting the lightheartedness of the musical may be in for a bit of a surprise. There are certainly comical characters (Nicely-Nicely Jones, for example), moments, and even entire stories. But many are gritty with tough-as-nails characters who are desperate, down on their luck and apt to kill you for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.The thing about Runyon is that he writes entirely in first person *present*. And while it is interesting at first, after a while it does become &quot;more than somewhat&quot; tiring, to use a phrase of his. In fact, I ripped through the first 200 pages loving the slang and weird colloquial nuances, only to grow a little sick of it until, by the last few stories, I just wanted to read something else. Not that the stories at the end are any less good. Maybe it's best not to try to read the whole thing all at once...Don't get me wrong, though. I really liked it, but I can only take so many short stories in a row. Most short stories in general seem so hackneyed to me, anyway. Like there has to be some big twist ending that is right out of the &quot;O. Henry manual on short story writing&quot;. These are no different except that maybe they are a little more clever than average.A fun read (especially for anyone who's ever been in the show), but best taken in small doses. Oh yeah, and Adelaide is nowhere to be found...even though the back of the book mentions her name!"},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"This is an excellent night-stand book. A collection of short stories,typical Damon Runyan. Most of its short stories can be read in twenty minutes or less. Some I found uninteresting, others delightful. My favorites are the &quot;Lemon Drop Kid&quot; and the baby sitting bank robber. A fun book for teen-agers also.W. Dannenmaier"},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"Every working class neighborhood produces, if those that I have lived in are indicative, its fair share of drifters, grifters, lamsters, short moneymen, wise guys and just plain big talkers. In classical Marxist speak this element is called the lumpen proletariat and in political terms is a drag on the class struggle and the feeding grounds for fueling reactionary and counter-revolutionary movements. In short, bad news.I am willing to bet, and make that bet 6/5, that any interested reader looking at this review to get the skinny on Damon Runyon's short stories probably did not bargain for the above analysis. Fair enough. Okay, we will suspend disbelief about the true nature of these types for as long as it takes to get through this collection. Damon Runyon has taken that collection of drifters, grifters and con artists and their \`dolls' and headquartered them, mainly in one place, New York's Broadway, the Great White Way of the 1920's and 1930's and given us some very memorable stories about the some time hilarious trials and tribulations of this motley crew.Runyon's great art is to have an ear for the kind of dialogue that those on the hustle would produce if such a rogue's gallery of lumpen types as the Hot Horse Herbies, Skys, Sam the Gonolphs, Bookie Bobbies and the rest of the cock-eyed tribe every had time to talk to each other. It is no secret that every little sub-culture has its own mores, language and sense of what passes for honor. Runyon takes this and exaggerates the effect but also in many cases puts an edge on it. Some stories are just straight out funny like A Story Goes With It, with its improbable ending in the omnipresent world of the race track; some are tragic-comic like Lily of St. Pierre, a vignette of the seamy side of lumpen existence for those on the run; and others are just plain tear jerkers like Little Miss Marker.Some commentators have argued that Runyon was just a cynic and had contempt for his characters (or for the real life characters that he based them on). Maybe, so. But if you want several hours of enjoyable reading about a time and place that never really existed except as caricature then this is your stop. By the way- Buddy, can you spare a dime?"},{"Title":"GUYS & DOLLS: THE STORIES OF DAMON RUNYON","review":"Damon's writings are unique to New York City and represent those wonderful times in the 40s and 50s. It is an education home run for today's youth who think of NYC as a dirty, corrupt city. It's beautiful if you know the history and Damon was the historian."},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"This is THE book to read if one is interested in the history of the Academy Awards. It features all of the essential information about who was nominated and who won, as well as a brief history of the individual year along with a detailed look at some of the winners. However, this is no 5 star book. It looks at the Oscars through very rose-colored glasses; it is very clear that this is a sanctioned look at the awards and not, ultimately, an entirely honest overview. It is clear that Mr. Osborne knows his stuff. One feels frustrated at the same time that his punches are always pulled as he must tow the Academy's line to get this published as the &quot;Official&quot; guide. A pity really, but the only way to get a complete overview of its history to date. Here's hoping that some day he'll be given free reign!"},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"Over the years, I have picked up a few books about the Academy Awards. I did so primarily to get a list of winners but I have also been interested in knowing the nominees. In the early days of the award it wasn't unusual to have eight or nine nominees for a particular award. However, the inference was still that there was something special about this particular movie in regards to this particular awards. I like that \\"75 Years of the Oscar\\" lists not only each award winner but each award nominee as well. I espcially appreciate the listing of all nominees for the Best Foreign Language award. I hadn't come across that before in any of the books I'd found.\\"75 Years of the Oscar\\" makes for a large tome and I did have to send back the first edition of the book that I received due to weak binding for a book this size. The book provides an overview of each individual year as well as each decade of the award. Over the years the Academy Awards have over-rated some turkeys and ignored some movies now considered classics. The Academy has had a tendency, over the years, to focus on five to eight movies a year for 95% of all nominees. It certainly seems that it is a popularity contest more than an artistic examination. However, it's still a fairly reliable source for finding good movies of the past and that's what I use it for."},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"This book is chock full of facts about everything to do with the Academy and it's evolving from nothing to what it is today. It tells how and who started it, and how the different categories for Oscars were added as the years went by. The first 2 chapters or so overwhelm you with dry details which make it tedious reading; at least that is how I felt about it.The rest of the book's chapters go year by year telling you all the nominations and winners of Oscars in all the different categories, and show you dozens of good pictures of the stars. You can also read the acceptance speeches given in the book by the stars that won Academy Awards.There also is a section that lists the names of all the stars that have won 2 or more Academy Awards. This is what I really liked. This is what I bought the book for.It is a huge book to read, so just take your time and read a little bit at a time.I'm glad I bought it because I am a movie fan and have learned from it; and can always refer back to it when I want to find something out."},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"Finally, I can see all the Oscar winners in one book.

Each person loved it.The presentation and format of the historical material is excellently done. The book is a great refrence manual for movie buffs. The construction of the book is also well done, the page stock and pictorial layout is indeed top notch."},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"This book is not a history in the since of most history books. It does not detail how the academy began, or how it changed over the years, or give you any kind of insider view of its workings. Instead, it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony's inception in 1927. There are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images of scenes from the nominated films for each year, so it is not dry in the way many reference books are. In fact, Mr. Osborne's love of film and its history really shine through in the book. It is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time. For example, in 1939, the Academy did recognize that \\"Gone with the Wind\\" was the best picture of the year, which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976. However, in 1941, \\"How Green was My Valley\\" won best picture, which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore, while \\"Citizen Kane\\" was completely ignored. It's also interesting to see how the Academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years. For instance, in 1934 Bette Davis was overlooked in her performance in \\"Of Human Bondage\\". This caused a huge public outcry. The following year the Academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in \\"Dangerous\\"- a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before.This book is full of little insights such as these, and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs. I bought my first copy of this history by Mr. Osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the Oscar, and I enjoyed it so much I have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"75 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards","review":"This book has everything you could really ask for regarding the history of the Oscars.

They are other-worldly (a ghost who gets killed--?); an air-breathing squid-like Martian who is a brilliant bartender of mixes for two humans who revolutionize the use of robotics and androids; some mummified creatures who have a cannibalistic way of coming alive when unexpected; a Lilliputian demon who can't manage the simplest of tasks when asked; and of course, the title player, a college professor-turned-werewolf for love.Not enough? How about a murder that costs the killer more than his life by summoning a creature from his own imagination? Just ask Gorgo, Dugg Quinby, Wolfe Wolf, Guzub, and Snulbug (but don't ask the latter for tomorrow's newspaper. He might bring it and a lot of surprises too.)"},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction","review":"I checked this book out of the local library when I was was MUCH younger and enjoyed it immensely. A nice grouping of short stories that keep your interest and allow you to pick it up and put it down at will without losing much. The characters are delightfully put together and fun to think of, even though they're all fictional."},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction","review":"\\"The Compleat Werewolf\\" gathers together 10 short stories and novellas from the pen of Anthony Boucher, all of which originally appeared in various pulp magazines (such as \\"Unknown Worlds,\\" \\"Adventure Magazine,\\" \\"Astounding Science Fiction,\\" \\"Weird Tales\\" and \\"Thrilling Wonder Stories\\") from 1941-'45. Boucher, whose real name was William Anthony Parker White, was a man of many talents, and during his career, which lasted from the early '40s to the late '50s, he worked as a magazine editor, a book reviewer (for \\"The New York Times\\" and \\"New York Herald Tribune\\") and an author of science fiction, horror and mystery. I initially learned of this \\"Compleat Werewolf\\" collection of 1969 from the excellent overview volume \\"Horror: 100 Best Books,\\" in which author Neil Gaiman sings the book's praises. But even Gaiman is compelled to admit that the Boucher collection is an unlikely pick for a Top 100 Horror list, as only about five of the book's tales are even vaguely horrific, and all but a couple are leavened by a goodly dose of humor. Still, he tells us \\"it contains at least two stories worth their weight in chilled blood,\\" and indeed, all 10 stories are perfectly produced little gems of either horror, fantasy or flat-out sci-fi. A recent rereading of the collection, after a period of around 12 years, has served to remind me of what a wonderful and amusing writer Boucher could be.As for the stories themselves: The collection opens neatly with the novella-length title work, \\"The Compleat Werewolf,\\" in which a German-language professor, Wolfe Wolf, learns--thanks to his new drinking buddy, the magician Ozymandias--that he is a full-fledged werewolf, capable of change at will. Much of the situations are played for laffs, but this longish tale ultimately manages to conflate devil worshippers, G-men, Nazi spies, a Hollywood starlet and a talking cat, culminating with one extremely suspenseful action siege indeed. The tale wraps up in a manner that could have easily led to an entire series of tales about our werewolf hero working for the FBI; I wonder if Robert McCammon was influenced by this classic story when he wrote his 1989 novel \\"The Wolf's Hour.\\" Next up is \\"The Pink Caterpillar,\\" a story of pure horror that is told by one of the G-men characters of \\"The Compleat Werewolf.\\" Here, a \\"doctor\\" residing in the Mexican countryside learns that pacts with rural medicine men don't always come off as planned. This little chiller is one of the more grisly tales in the bunch. An example of Boucher's skill as a sci-fi writer, \\"Q.U.R.\\" tells the story of a trio of men who come up with the strictly utilitarian, \\"usuform\\" robot to replace the humanoid androids then in use. This is a charming story, filled with likable characters, both human and alien. Written in 1942, the tale features a black president (here, actually, as Council Head, more of a world president) 66 years before the Obama fact. In a really right-on passage, Boucher writes \\"...ten centuries ago people would have snorted just like that at the idea of a black as Head on this planet. Such narrow stupidity seems fantastic to us now. Our own prejudices will seem just as comical to our great-great-grandchildren.\\" Let us hope! \\"Robinc,\\" up next, is a direct sequel to \\"Q.U.R.,\\" and just as entertaining, as our trio of inventors gets into major-league trouble after their new robots become a success. Really wonderful Golden Age sci-fi, this. In \\"Snulbug,\\" the first story that Boucher ever sold, a research scientist uses the inch-tall titular demon, raised by necromantic means, to assist him in amassing a small fortune. But naturally, things go consistently awry, in this highly clever, time-paradox tale.\\"Mr. Lupescu,\\" the shortest story of the bunch, finds a child's imaginary playmate to be not so imaginary as it first appears. Boucher skillfully manages to cram two major surprises into this five-page affair! Up next is \\"They Bite,\\" easily the most horrifying and grisliest tale in the collection. Here, a louse of a human being, a seller of wartime Army secrets, discovers that the legend of the Carker clan--cannibalistic desert dwellers in the American Southwest--may not be a legend after all. The denouement of this horrific tale--an inspiration for Wes Craven's \\"The Hills Have Eyes,\\" perhaps?--should linger long in the reader's memory. \\"Expedition,\\" a humorous tale of the first Martian voyage to Earth, told in the form of radio transmissions, comes next. This straightforward sci-fi story features some interesting protagonists (the Martians are described as being hexagonlike bugs) and a rather clever conclusion. The story that follows, the 70-page novella \\"We Print the Truth,\\" is the longest tale of the bunch, and a real winner. In a setup that Rod Serling might well have approved of, a small-town newspaper editor is granted a wish by his mysterious typesetter (who may or may not be a fairy of the Oberon variety). He wishes that his paper, in the future, will tell nothing but the truth, and soon enough, anything that is printed therein has the power to alter reality. What an opportunity for effecting change, for ending wars and bettering lives! But our harried editor soon finds that this godlike ability comes with some serious problems, in this extremely ingratiating tale. Filled with loads of interesting characters and conversations, convincing details of small-town Americana, and endless invention, this might be my personal favorite story of the bunch. The collection wraps up with \\"The Ghost of Me,\\" another clever, short tale. Here, a man's ghost comes back to haunt his house...even though the man is not quite dead yet! The ghost has made a slight miscalculation as regards timing, in this decidedly loopy story...one that yet still manages to pull off a rather suspenseful ending. So there you have it: 10 stories of varied subject matter in varied genres, all with only one thing in common...the ability to mightily entertain the reader. As far as making the case for Anthony Boucher being a writer of great and manifold talents, I would have to say that the collection is a complete--or, rather, compleat--success. More than highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Compleat Werewolf and Other Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction","review":"I found this to be a rather fun anthology and quick read. Unless I am mistaken all the stories here date originally from the early to mid 1940s, which places them towards the end of the Pulps/beginning of the paperback era. Like any anthology, some of the stories are stronger and more appealing than others,with a sprinkling of horror, sci-fi,fantasy,etc.. I found that several of these tales have a distinctive element of humor which I thought was, for the most part, balanced well with the fantastical and sometimes horrific nature of the stories. Sure, some of these are rather dated (they are over 70 years old after all!), but then a lot of it stands up pretty darn well and remains quite entertaining. The namesake story (\\"Compleat Werewolf\\") is well worth the price of admission alone!

Although Shamus comes from old world money he wants to be free and get his photographs into a high class gallery. The bond that ties Carmela to her husband is still strong so that neither has filed for a divorce. Still Carmela has moved on with her life in a professional capacity, opening a store in the French Quarter. Memory Mine sells scrapbooks and gives lessons to customers who want to turn them into art.Next door to Memory Mine is Menagerie Antiques owned by Bartholomew, a man who Carmela believes works on the wrong side of the law. One night while giving a craft lesson, Carmela?s assistant finds Bart dead in the alley, a scissors in his chest. Everyone from her assistant to her best friend expects Carmela to uncover the identity of the killer and she does her best to accommodate their expectations.PHOTO FINISHED is an exciting amateur sleuth mystery starring a heroine that is impossible to not like. She moves at supersonic speed which means a fast plot, plenty of action and a lot at hair-raising adventure though why involvement in a homicide investigation seems stretched. Laura Childs takes the reader on a tour of New Orleans that seems so realistic that the audience will believe they are there. One should not read this novel on an empty stomach because the mouth watering descriptions of foods will make the reader visit the nearest five star restaurant.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Photo Finished (A Scrapbooking Mystery)","review":"Laura Childs' books drive me just a little bit crazy. Sure, they're great for a couple of hours of enjoyment, but...why do I keep coming back, reading each book the woman writes? There is certainly no mental stimulation to be had and after you've finished one you don't get that rush of pleasure and satisfaction that follows a fabulous book. But it just seems to come down to the fact that, even though the books are silly, you are still entertained on some level.My complaint about all of Childs' novels, and *Photo Finished* is no exception, is that her characters are very light and lacking dimension. Their motivations and thought processes often seem suspect. And silly. Have I mentioned the silliness factor? And, another complaint, the mystery is really no mystery at all. Just a crime that gets resolved (and in this case not very efficiently) at the end. The reader is still left in the dark to an extent regarding what actually happened to prompt the crime. Now that I think about it, some aspects of the book are downright aggravating. Like Carmela's husband, Shamus, and everything that goes along with their relationship. (But to go into that would be just too much.)I must say, though, that it is worth it to read this particular title in the Scrapbooking mystery series simply for one of the last scenes, which had me laughing out loud quite unexpectedly. A scene that will no doubt prompt me to read the next book."},{"Title":"Photo Finished (A Scrapbooking Mystery)","review":"One problem I've noticed with prolific, successful writers is it seems like their editors take a break. No one is catching the little errors (and the big plot boo-boos) because they're not giving the same level of scrutiny they would to a greener writer's work. And that is the case in \\"Photo Finished.\\"I really enjoy Carmela and her friends. But hearing about her \\"tawny hair\\" multiple times in the first few pages was a little annoying. And the absolutely inane things she does in the name of chasing down the murderer are just too much (going to an abandoned warehouse at night? messing around the dead man's store, unaccompanied??). And why in the heck did Bobby, the police's number-one suspect, drop in on Carmela? He says nothing of real import, then drops out of sight once again. It was merely a way of furthering the plot that made absolutely no sense. The same with the way Shamus is urging Carmela to attend \\"family\\" functions when the entire Meechum clan -- including Shamus himself -- has made it clear that she's no longer \\"one of them.\\"One final thing -- the yo-yoing with Shamus is getting old. And he is such a cad (flirting with other women in front of her, giving her a hard time about keeping her company when she was afraid, etc.), that if Carmela actually gets together with him, I am DONE with this series.

When she announces an all-night scrapbooking session at the store, the response is good and many of her regular customers plus some new ones show up. When her assistant Gabby goes out in the alley behind the store, she discovers the dead body of Barty Hayward, who owned a nearby antique store. The police department's suspect list at first includes the women who were at the scrapbooking party, but soon it narrows down to Billy Cobb, Barty's young assistant. Feeling that Billy is incapable of such an act, and spurred on by his grandmother to \\"do something\\", Carmela launches her own investigation. It soon appears that Barty was a shady businessman and a number of his associates join Carmela's suspect list. This series is set in the city of New Orleans, which serves as an interesting backdrop for the action. Childs comes up with some interesting characters, and even more interesting names, such as Jade Ella and Sweetmomma Pam.

I enjoyed the 1st book, but this book wasn't as good.Carmela, owner of the local scrapbook store (LSS), holds an all-night crop. During this crop, the neighboring furniture store owner is found dead in the alley. Now Carmela is out to find the killer, even though she really doesn't want to. In the interim, Carmela has to deal with her estranged husband coming in and out of her life. (I found this part unnecessary and annoying).She encounters various interesting characters along the way of her investigation. She becomes involved in an Arts gala as well.The book started off mediocre, but entertaining enough. As the plot \\"developed\\", it lost it's mediocrity and became worse. The book read like the author was tired of the story and looking for a quick wrap up. The dialogue toward the end between the characters became like a movie script and too predictable - nothing original, nothing creative. When you read it, you will understand what I mean. It reminded me of a B movie screen play for your average, stereotypical whodunnit.I have the 3rd and 4th book in the series and plan on reading them, but I hope they will be much better than this sequel."},{"Title":"Photo Finished (A Scrapbooking Mystery)","review":"I think most of us like a light mystery to read when we just want to escape. Laura Childs books do that for me."},{"Title":"Photo Finished (A Scrapbooking Mystery)","review":"The 1st three books in this series were gifts to me (I had never heard of them)from my mother who knows of my love for the scrapbooking craft/hobby. I dove into the first one and moved right on to the second and third ones without delay. I really have enjoyed them. I will say, however, that I can't even remember who exactly the murderer ended up being in this book. That must say something either about the book or maybe just about my faulty memory. But the mystery is secondary to me as I just enjoy the idea of the stories surrounding this scrapbook shop owner trying to make it on her own after being abandoned by her husband of one year. I really like her feisty best friend and have enjoyed getting to know her shop regulars (it does take time, though, because they're not that involved in the stories.) I like the scrapbooking projects she gets into but I don't embellish quite the way she does in her work but it's still interesting and helps me brainstorm ideas for my own projects. I also like that she includes recipes mentioned in the story. I am frustrated by Carmela's estranged husband, Shamus, as well as with Carmela as she doesn't say the things most people would say (scream) to Shamus and his annoying sister. But there's still a strangely likeable quality to Shamus and some potential there for the marriage to survive.

This book could have been a lot better if there was more mystery and more time taken to get to know the characters and less crafts, food and extra characters. There were so many characters and so much going on that had little to do with the mystery that I found myself lost at times. I never quite knew who the different people were or why I should care about them.I love the scrapbook and crafts theme. The main character was so involved with crafts for so many different clients and events that there was no need for the food and recipies already used in several culinary mystery series. In one book there were recipes, scrapbooks, papercrafts involving menus and invitations, pumpkin carving, glass stamping, pendant making, floral aranging and photography. It was all just too much once you added in the descriptions of New Orleans, the mystery and the main character's relationship with her estranged husband and his relatives, friends and dog. The mystery part of the story feels like one of the side plots that gets solved but the clues and motives are never fully explained."},{"Title":"Photo Finished (A Scrapbooking Mystery)","review":"I actually lied when i said i &quot;read&quot; this book.

Unfortunately the first two chapters finished me. The writing seems stiff and the characters unremarkable.

New Strategies of Educational Excellence","review":"It is true that state schools seldom are aware of the phrase \\"customer service\\". Therefore, Vedder's book held promise with the line \\"For-profit schools operating in a competitive environment that are owned in whole or part by the professionals who run them could be a promising alternative, certainly worth experimenting with\\". But it quickly disappoints because, in the words of the '80s Wendy's commercial, where's the beef?When you open the book, the Table of Contents reads 1)Introduction; 2) American Education: Poor Outcomes and Declining Efficiency; 3) Long Term Benefits of the For-Profit Approach; 4) A Historical Perspective on For-Profit Schools; 5) For-Profit Education in America Today; 6) Illustrating the \\"ESOP\\" Approach to Public Education\\"; and 7) Conclusion.He cites monetary statistics for England as late as 1875, but fails to account for inflation or the exchange rate. One pound sterling in the early 1800s was equal to $100 of today's greenbacks, but Vedder says \\"and less than one pound for every child between the ages of five and fourteen\\". He also neglects to say that until 1867, two years after African-Americans won the right to vote, did Englishmen win the right to vote - until then, only the landlords voted that made up 2% of the total population and dictated to the other 98%. His understanding of schooling, both private and state, in England is not quite there - he quotes Herbert Spencer that \\"We may be quite sure that a state education would be administered for the advantage of those in power\\", but seems to not know that the 2% who could vote did indeed invent state schooling in reaction to the Quakers method of Bible-reading borrowed from Indian Muslims at Madras on Qur'aan-reading. Fearing a Jacobin revolution once the population began to read, they invented state schooling. Prior to that, education was a sham in England; only elites had access to it.There are many more caveats - Vedder does not distinguish between corporate and private, between corporate that sucks up state monies and private that struggles on tuition and donations. In the real world, for-profit schools do not exist at the elementary and secondary school levels apart from Challenger Schools in California and Utah. All primary and secondary schools are subsidized by either donations or tax monies in addition to any tutiton charged.The concept of teacher-owned schools is one that needs to be yet be explored, using ethnographic participant-observations of just such schools. A better book for someone wanting to start their own school is Robert Love's \\"How to Start Your Own School\\", which is based on the actual experiences of the Wichita Collegiate School."},{"Title":"Can Teachers Own Their Own Schools?

Author Alan Clayson makes it clear his book is a stylized, highly-personal take on the band, so it came as no surprise the pages were filled with empurpled hipster prose. Yet Clayson succeeds in eliciting trenchant quotes (both archival and new) from each member of the group, and captures the band's seat-of-the-pants creativity with eloquence and humor. On the downside, Clayson can't maintain a narrative and wastes too much ink on irrelevent details about other artists---especially aesthetic peewees like Dave Dee Dozy Beaky Mick and Tich and the Downliners Sect, both of whom make the Seeds look like the Beatles. There are also a number of factual errors (though only a pedant would care that Keith Relf didn't write \\"Shapes In My Mind\\") and a puny chronology almost entirely cribbed from Greg Russo's superior (though more workmanlike) ULTIMATE RAVE UP. The biggest problem with the book is Clayson's unwillingess to allow the band's story to unfold on its own. Virtually every paragraph is crammed to the gills with snoozy hyperbole that says more about the writer's fascination with his prose than it does about the subject. Nevetheless, it's a worthy pick up for fans of the Yardbirds, who have waited eons for the kind of journalistic respect accorded to the Who, Cream, Beatles, Stones and their other rivals. Where before we had to trawl through [the webites] to hunt down a battered copy of John Platt's 1983 book and pay [good money], now we have two quality reads---and despite his pretentions, Clayson's love for the band that gave us \\"For Your Love\\" and \\"Shapes of Things\\" shines through brightly. I can't knock him for that."},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","review":"I didn't really learn anything new about the Yardbirds after reading this. Considering they were one of the most exciting and important bands in rock history, I would have expected more 'meat'. I felt Alan Clayson's writing style got in the way at times, distracting somewhat. However, the photos are really outstanding, particularly the cover shot showing them at Studio 51 in London (I think). What a classic moment frozen in time. Glad I read it. Any Yardbird book is better than no Yardbird book, however, there are better ones."},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","review":"With great anticipation I ordered Mr. Clayson's book, however having finished it last evening I would have to say that I am somewhat disappointed.There is certainly no lack of research or knowledge on Mr. Clayson's part, but perhaps it was his style of prose that put me off. He writes not necessarily in a high-minded manner, but perhaps it is English dry-wit which makes it hard for an American to slog through; in many cases I could almost picture Mr. Clayson and another UK resident nodding and winking at each other across the bar. Annette Carson's JEFF BECK: CRAZY FINGERS was written in a much easier-to-digest style.The Yardbirds were known, at least in my youth here in the USA, as a band much better seen in person than to hear on record. Mr. Clayson certainly explains to the reader why that is so. The description of life on the road, for The Yardbirds, should be enough to put off any youngster with delusions of trying the same; that is, if he could get through to that point in the book.Being somewhat of a &quot;gearhead,&quot; I missed discussion of the bands' equipment or more technical side. The photographs printed in this book are quite wonderful though, and to a degree appeased my appetite; Chris Dreja certainly went through some guitars! It is just a pity that things such as this were not spoken of in the text.I can see where this book would appeal much more to the English market than the American, given the discussion of musical groups never heard of here, and in that way the work is much like Mo Foster's 17 WATTS, where one must sort through that tedium.All in all, not a bad book, but not an easy read. That said, the overleaf shows that Mr. Clayson has published many works on music of the era, so he certainly has the authority of his research behind him. THE YARDBIRDS and his other work are surely the &quot;go-to&quot; source for any trivia you may wish to ferret out."},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","review":"Conveyed new information, so was worth the read for an avid fan, but it dragged on and on."},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","review":"Other reviews of this book are somewhat unfair. They criticize the author for his \\"hipster\\" language or many references to competing white boy blues bands in England in the early 1960s, but Clayson describes the underground and club music scene of the era quite well, and he explains the musical styles with the expertise of an accomplished musician, which apparently he is, but in language a non-specialist can understand, no mean feat. I didn't find his writing style that off-putting, either. He's simply following the model of a lot of travel shows on TV these days where the viewer is meant to follow along with the host on his adventure, his journey, his awakening. It's not a style everyone will like, but it's hardly exceptional. I do wish everything had been deeper in this book, as some reviewers note, but I'm grateful for what I got, and it's not always clear if the author is quoting sources directly or from secondary sources - that was pretty disappointing, I'd say. But the book is not a gossip rag or scandal sheet; it's knowledgeable and informed as far as it goes; and the book's layout is actually quite professional and stylish with lots of easy-to-read \\"pulled quotes,\\" white space and plentiful photographs. It probably should be included in the library of anyone who likes Clapton, Beck or Page or - like me - liked the original Yardbirds including lead singer and harmonic player Keith Relf and drummer Jim McCarty best of all."},{"Title":"The Yardbirds: The Band That Launched Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page","review":"There are lots of pictures of the band throughout however, the author seems rather full of himself and is frequently loquacious (irony intended) simply for the sake of trying to come off as an intellectual, rather than adding anything to the story.

Your view of politics will never be the same again."},{"Title":"The semisovereign people;: A realist's view of democracy in America","review":"Schattschneider takes issue with traditional theories of democracy which suggest that \\"the people really do decide what the government does on something like a day-to-day basis\\" (133). Rather, he contends that such an old conception of democracy does not capture the reality of politics and governance in the US. Rather, Schattschneider contends that \\"Democracy is a competitive political system in which competing leaders and organizations define the alternatives of public policy in such a way that the public can participate in the decision-making process\\" (141). In part, Schattschneider seems to support the \\"responsible parties\\" model, which posits that strong, centralized parties with clear and specific platforms should be in control of government, and only then can be held accountable to the masses. The argument posits that a real majority interest exists, and that the majority - organized around a strong party - has the right to control government. Weak parties, on the other hand, would have difficulty in governing effectively. Officeholders may defect, the party platform may not be binding, and subsequently accountability would be weakened.In part, Schattschneider is arguing against conceptions of pluralist democracy, in which various groups form around similar interest in order to pressure government to adopt specific policies. Schattschneider contends that the pressure is system is biased, and particularly favors bourgeoisie interests. Because such interests are quite powerful, they are better able to pressure the system in pursuit of their particular interests. Because the pressure system is biases, we have to reject the pluralist and group theory assumptions that all people can formulate groups around their own interests and bring pressure to bear on the system.Schattschneider contends that two large, cohesive parties help mitigate problems associated with pressure politics. He contends that the large parties are not aggregates of interest groups. First, pressure groups are too small to make an impact on the party. Second, pressure groups are not party neutral, but like the masses, must align with one party or the other. As such, the party has power over the interest groups, not the other way around. Furthermore, because the big, consolidated parties must mobilize large segments of the population in order to gain control, less supported issues or conflicts are overpowered by bigger, more popular issues with which the masses are more interested in, and have a greater stake. As such, cleavages over large issues divide the political space. The \\"sides\\" of the cleavages can be unequal; we see the formation of majorities and minorities. The goal of the parties is to control or exploit these cleavages. Schattschneider writes, \\"To understand the nature of the party conflict it is necessary to consider the function of the cleavages exploited by the parties in their struggle for supremacy. Since the development of cleavages is a prime instrument of power, the party which is able to make its definition of issues prevail, is likely to take over government\\" (73)."},{"Title":"The semisovereign people;: A realist's view of democracy in America","review":"E. E. Schattschneider was one of the most important political scientists of the middle part of the 20th century. His work has had an influence on many analysts of politics. This slender volume, although brief, is one of his more provocative and influential works. Ideas from this book show up in the work of many others.Let's take a look at just two of the many provocative points that he makes.A central assumption underlying the work (Page v): \\". . .the nature of political organization depends on the conflicts exploited in the political system, which ultimately is what politics is about.\\" Understanding the scope of conflict is a central question in this book. Some want to keep conflict narrowly constrained and \\"private.\\" If so, economic powerhouses will win out, because they would be dominant in that domain. Others, who wish government to get involved, try to broaden the scope of conflict so that political institutions get involved. If this is the case, then a different dynamic will be at work. In his view (Page 12), \\"Democratic government is the greatest single instrument for the socialization of conflict in the American community.\\" By widening the scope of conflict, the people can become important players.A second important argument that he makes represents a critique of the view that democracy is enhanced by the existence of organized interest groups, since these represent the views of many people and inject a democratic influence into the political process. Schattschneider demurs. First, the members of these interest groups are not typical of all people. In a famous line, he notes that (Pages 34-35): \\"The vice of the groupist theory is that it conceals the most significant aspect of the system. The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper-class accent. Probably about 90% of the people cannot get into the pressure system.\\"Anyway, this is a wonderful little book. Of course, there are some issues that emerge: sometimes arguments are not developed enough (brevity in this book is a plus, but it sometimes seems to leave some points \\"hanging\\"); he may downplay some positive aspects of the interest group system. However, in the main, his arguments remain as fresh today as they were when the book first came out, in 1960. Still worth a read!"},{"Title":"The semisovereign people;: A realist's view of democracy in America","review":"This often-quoted book is one of the most classic works of 20th century political science. Despite its age, published in the early 1960s, this brilliant little book is still astonishingly fresh. Schattschneider's account of the expansion and privatisation (contraction) of conflicts, and his description of the structural biases of modern western democracy, is eye-opening.

The cat doesn't feature in the story at all but shows up in funny ways throughout the book as do some other tricks that will appeal to the adult reading this to their little one.I got this and am now wanting to get all the books by Cabrera. Highly recommended for babies on up. My daughter is nine months old and loves it."},{"Title":"Old Mother Hubbard (Routledge's new sixpenny toy books)","review":"I agree with the reviewer from the School Library Journal. This book with it's larger pages and large, brilliantly illustrated pictures would make an excellent book for group story time.Four Stars. It would make a nice gift for a younger child. [Amazon has the age range as 4 to 8 years of age; but I would suggest 4 and under as more appropriate.]Since my children are almost 4 and 6, although we enjoyed a read or two, I would not purchase this book.

My kids love this book and I really enjoy looking at the book."},{"Title":"Araby (Signal Editions)","review":"Ormsby uses the literary and cultural traditions of the Middle-East to create a beautiful thematic collection of poems. There is much to be admired in his poetic technique, and perhaps even more to be envied in his knowledge of the very rich culture of the Middle-East. Islamic mysticism, Arabic poetry, and day-to-day scenery all find equal place in this collection.I feel that this collection is especially apropos currently, when the Middle-East is being so demonized. It helps to make the peoples of that reagion into individuals with a rich culture, not just Kalashnikov rifle wielders. The subject matter aids in making Ormsby's already remarkable poetry even more intriguing.Buy this book."},{"Title":"Araby (Signal Editions)","review":"ARABY is a remarkable and highly unusual book of poems, one that can be read for the beauty and brilliance of the individual poems, but which also develops two characters, Jaham and Bald Adham, a poet and a car mechanic, who both go through their own visionary struggles. To say anything more about either one of them would be to ruin the often humorous excitement of learning about them along the way. By the end, the reader has gotten to know these two men as well as if reading a novel about them.Some individual poems - &quot;Jaham Serenades a Snake,&quot; &quot;Jaham at the Ruins of Recollection,&quot; &quot;Jaham Deciphers the Scripts of Insomnia&quot; - are among the finest I have ever read. As this selection of titles suggests, I may be partial to one of the characters, but I learned a lot from both of them. They're developed with humor, insight and depth (their own and those of the poet) and, combined with the voluminous knowledge Eric Ormsby has of the Arab world, they take the reader on a profound journey through a distinctive culture.In the sheer vitality of his language, Eric Ormsby is a writer of great dexterity, imagination and rhythm, and the excitement of reading his work includes a word-surprise of some sort in nearly every line. ARABY is a tremendously inspired book."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Forest","review":"I received my order earlier than the estimated time I had been told. The book was in good shape, packaged properly, and a great deal. I would definitely place another order with this company."},{"Title":"The last of summer,","review":"Kate O'Brien is a masterful storyteller. I read &quot;The Last Of Summer&quot; without much expectation, as I was on break from writing a novel of my own. I was really surprised at what I found. Her details of the era, rich with history and emotion are crisply described, and only draw you further into the complex story of Angele, a beautiful young actress who returns to her old Irish home to reclaim her past. In doing just that, she uncovers many secrets which lead to her own Father's estrangement from her Uncle and his Family. When her cousin begins having feelings for her, which O'Brien bravely endears, (a hint of her being an author well beyond her time) his decision to go off into the beginning of World War I are thwarted by an ever growing love for this mysterious cousin. I highly suggest giving this a read. Not only is it beautiful in atmosphere and context, but riveting and highly sensual. A work from an Author who does not bow to tradition. This is a triumph."},{"Title":"Hola Amigos! [With CDROM and CD (Audio)] (Spanish Edition)","review":"The book has been delivered in good state.

This book though tells a slightly different story.This book centers on three women who have to deal with the aftermath of Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour.Jane Boleyn was the wife of George Boleyn and the sister in law of Anne Boleyn. Her testimony helped convict both of them leading to their deaths. When Henry VIII decides to marry Anne of Cleves Jane comes back to court to help.Anne wants to get out under the thumb of her mother and brother and so is very excited when she is to become Queen of England. However the relationship between Anne and Henry is tumultuous and only six months after their marriage they are divorced and she becomes Henry's beloved sister.Katherine Howard is the cousin of Anne Boleyn. She lived with her step-grandmother until her uncle says that he wants her to serve Anne of Cleves. Soon she catches the heart of Henry and several days after the divorce she is the new Queen of England. There is only one problem, she does not love Henry. Soon Katherine catches the eye of Thomas Culpeper and Jane Boleyn must help them to keep their relationship a secret from King and court, which ends with both Jane and Katherine beheaded for treason.A very interesting look at history."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"You know it's fiction but it's believable and could have happened.

When I finished the first book, The Other Boleyn..., I immediately went to Amazon and purchased this book.

I've ordered two more books by this author, and can't wait to get started."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I've long been fascinated with the entire Plantagenet and Tudor dynasty's. So when I spotted the Boleyn Inheritance, I bought it, looking forward to some lively reading about this tumultuous time in Britain's history.Phillipa Gregory has written a fascinating in depth book. Rich in detail, Phillipa has created a lively and complex perspective on the lives of the women who lived at the court of King Henry VIII.One of the most compelling characters is Lady Jane Rocheford. This aristocratic woman played a pivotal role in bringing down Anne Boleyn, the second wife of the King. As the story unfolds we catch a glimpse of the searing hate and jealousy that enabled Lady Jane to not only bear witness against Queen Anne, but her own husband George. Her testimony sealed the death warrants for her husband and the Queen.As we watch her squirm under the Duke of Norfolk's merciless demands, we see a creature besotted by power and completely oblivious to the fact she is hated in all the courts of Europe. Yet she shows a softer side when dealing with the long suffering Anne of Cleves, King Henry's 4th wife.Anne of Cleves who had endured the abuses of her brother William, and her mothers fanatical insistence on proper behavior, is initially lost in the bewildering world of Tudor power. When she finds she is to be gotten rid of to make way for Kathryn Howard, Anne finally realizes, that to deny the King is to die. And through this experience, she blooms like an English rose and flies free of the court and it's traps.Katherine Howard, a young girl, who attracts her uncle's notice, becomes a pawn in a vicious game of power. The Duke of Norfolk is desperate to regain ascendancy for his house and uses young \\"Kitty\\" as his catalyst.King Henry, bereft over the death of Jane Seymour, is feeling old, and very depressed. His leg wound never healed and causes him not only great pain, but personal humiliation. The stink of the seeping wound, along with being \\"costive\\" (constipated) follows him everywhere. When he spots Kathryn, she immediately renews his belief in his manhood and his ability.While I enjoyed this book on its own merits, I had real difficulty with Gregory's handling of both Kathryn Howard and King Henry himself. Kathryn was no virgin, but a rather lusty promiscuous girl. Gregory spends much time weaving a nice play of emotions in Kitty. She is a blend of total self centeredness and coltish teen.Historical documentation says otherwise. In an age when girls married young, and.. were considered old maids by 20, it's hard to swallow the naivete of a seasoned young lady. A young lady that had already had at least two lovers before ever arriving at court. A girl trained to understand that to be at court meant possible advancement and great wealth for those willing to play the game. Her behavior was scandalous and very calculated.Henry in this book is portrayed as wholly monstrous. A fat, stinking lecher with a wet slack mouth and no scruples. This is grossly inaccurate to say the least. Gregory has him leaving his wife-Jane Seymour to die alone. Historical documentation states rather clearly that he prized his Jane, and when she died he went into deep mourning. In fact he prized her so much, he was buried next to her.This King led Great Britain into the Renaissance. He was an amateur astrologer, patron of the arts and sciences, famed for his dancing and jousting, and known for his great erudition. When he met Kathryn Howard, he was obese and out of shape certainly. But she created a wellspring of vitality and hope in Henry. Contrary to Gregory's assertions, Henry lost weight, danced, rode and appeared in far better health than he had in a very long time.While I did enjoy the book on its own merits, I wasn't able to swallow the one sided characterizations of two of the books major players. It was in such jarring contrast to her carefully thought out portraiture of both Anne of Cleves and Jane Rocheford, that for myself at least, it ruined the entire book.So, if you're looking for a lightweight summer read, pick this one up. The fast paced story lines and vivid depiction of court life will keep you reading late into the night. If you're looking for a deeper, richer but highly entertaining read, try Margaret George's The Autobiography of King Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"As in past books centered around the rule of King Henry VIII, Gregory captured me fully, once again. After reading any of her books the characters remain in my thoughts as if I was transported back to that time.I remain in awe of Henry's reign. Anyone interested in British history around this time MUST read this book (as well as others in the series)! diane"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I actually like this book a lot better...Mary Boleyn got a little grating, and the story got tedious at some points...with three captivating narrators, you're never bored or wishing for a new perspective."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"If (like me) you loved \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" but found \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" ridiculous and \\"The Constant Princess\\" dull, Philippa Gregory's latest book is good news indeed. It marks a return to what made the first two of her Tudor books so irresistible: believable characters you enjoy spending time with and with whom you sympathize, sometimes in spite of yourself.Gregory uses three narrators: Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, and presents them without bearing judgment on them. Anne of Cleves is a particularly well-rounded character, and even though you know her fate, the twists of her storyline keeps you turning the pages (well past bedtime, in my case). The writing is smooth without being slick, descriptive without being cumbersome.I have just two quibbles: The voices of Anne and Jane are very similar, and the course of events that hardened Henry's heart against Katherine are skimmed over. But all in all it's great to be able to recommend one of Gregory's novels again!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Three women take turns telling the fascinating story of the Boleyn inheritance: Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Rochford. Each character is interesting and unique in her own way. Overall, it's a great read but I thought that it dragged on a bit about two-thirds into the book, with the story wrapping up quickly at the end. Having said that, I did enjoy this book and recommend it if you like to read about the Tudor period."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"\\"The Boleyn Inheritance,\\" by Philippa Gregory, was a very entertaining read. I am fascinated by Tudor England and read evreyting I can on the subject - fiction and non-fiction. Gregory writes a nice story about three women in Henry VIII's life: Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves, and Jane Rochford. I recommend this book to anyone wanting another view of Henry VIII's reign."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I love this book as much as 'The Other Boleyn Girl' though it is a little bit different - the story is told by three woment in turn, chapter after chapter the events are described from three different angles. At first it sounded unusual but then I fully got used to it and enjoy the book immensely (just in the middle of the book now). My recommendations to all who like history and Henry VIII times."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book was not as good as The Other Boleyn Girl. It seemed to drag at the end, going back and forth between the three women: Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn and Katherine Howard. Although I loved finding out what happened to King Henry's next wives, the novel itself fell short for me."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This was the first book I read by Philippa Gregory, loaned to me by a friend. A bit of a history buff, I found this gripping and entertaining. I couldn't put it down, not wanting to miss a thing. I enjoyed it so much, I passed it on to another friend."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance was my second Philippa Gregory book and I enjoyed it even more than the first (The Other Boleyn Girl). I loved seeing how things panned out, depending on which side of the fence the narrator was on, and I really felt like I knew the characters and their motivation by the end. The end just came too soon for me. I'd have liked it to carry on and on, especially Anne's part.Anne's and Katherine's chapters were more entertaining than Jane's but that's probably because Jane's chapters/thoughts/narration were primarily about her own self inflicted torment and delusions over her husband's and Anne Boleyn's betrayal. Her narrative had a definite air of madness about it as the story progressed. By the end she was a broken woman and I don't doubt she was as mad as box of frogs. I don't pity her though.....well, not much anyway.I love that I feel I know these women a little better now (albeit in a fictional way) and will look out for other fictional works which cover the Tudors.King Henry was vividly repulsive in the pages, to the point where I swear I could smell the supporating wound on his leg every time I opened the pages. At best he was delusional, at worst he was a maniac and I wonder how anyone could bear to be around him.All in all it's a great read, I just hope I can find a worthy bedtime read to replace it, now it's finished. That's the worst part of a good book.....it's over too soon."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have read this book twice with equal enjoyment. Vivid characters and a compelling retelling of historical events. Gregory makes the characters, the culture and the emotions come alive. Especially fascinating is the somewhat sympathetic and somehow tragic character of Lady Rochford. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Great book.

This story is written in a wonderful manner; told through the eyes of three woman: Jane Boleyn, Katherine Howard, and Anne of cleaves."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I began reading this book and actually put it down in the middle of it. I was a little bored. I didn't believe it was nearly as good as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", which I've re-read multiple times. I then found that I couldn't stop thinking about it and picked it back up a few weeks later. To me, the story seemed a little slower than what I would have liked but as the story progressed, I started to understand why people were giving it 4-5 stars.I'm glad I stuck around and finished reading this book. I couldn't believe that at some point in the book, I was actually sympathizing with Jane Bolyen. I really did end up liking this book but I don't believe I will ever re-read it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This novel drew me in and captivated me just as much as my favorite book, The Other Boleyn Girl did. I love that it is written from three different perspectives (Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford, the traitor who doesnt see herself that way, Anne of Cleves, the noble fourth wife who escaped with her head still attached to her body and Katherine Howard, the material 15 year old who married a stinky old man of a King and was beheaded for acting her age)These women arent as well known as Anne Boleyn but Gregory seems to have a great talent for taking an obscure character (such as Mary Boleyn, who has very little records) and bringing them to unbeliveable life. I highly recommend this book, even if you arent a Henry VIII fan, it is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"A wonderful explorative look at the position of women's place in the family unit of society.

I could not ut it down. Phillipa Gregory is a great writer."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This was a wonderful book about two wives of Henry VIII and the woman that was the head of the court. Ms Gregory once again shows how the court has a habit of turning ones head away from what is right and sets in motion the beheading of another queen, who just happens to be the cousin of the prior beheaded queen. The story of Anne of Cleaves was also impelling. I loved the way Ms. Gregory tells the historical information and weave a tale of intrigue, and appeasing a tyrannical king just to live. In the end, only Anne wins the right to live by her wits alone. I recommend this book for those that love history."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"It was very interesting to learn the history of Henry VIII's other wives. they were somewhat a mystery compared to Ann Bolelyn.The story of Ann of Cleves told the story of her arranged marriage to Henry & how she managed to evade the beheading that befell the other queens. Also the story of the teenage Kathryn & her demise. It is a novel with historical facts. Well done."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Great to read after the Other Boleyn Girl, leaves out the story of his wife after Ann Boleyn, but captures the story of Queen Ann and Queen Katherine"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This series of the Tudor dynasty by Philippa Gregory has drawn me in with its novelization of history. The first person characters are well drawn, and the plot moves along with energy and tension. Gregory has truly mastered the art of making readers crave the next chapter and the next book. I highly recommend this entire series!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a very good book. It was very hard to put down. Gregory does an exceptional job of developing her characters."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is #3 in the Tudor Court series. This historical fiction takes place at the Tudor Court in 16th Century England. Anne of Cleves becomes the latest of Henry VIII's wives. She comes to England to marry, speaking German and dressed very differently than the latest court fashions. She works very hard at being pleasing to the king and learning English. The people love her, even though the king and court all make fun of her.The story is told in chapters from different points of view-- Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Rochford. Katherine is only 14 years old, but not at all naive when if comes to attracting the king to her bed. She is one of the most entertaining characters of the book, always counting how many dresses and jewels she has, and attempting to learn French. She masters \\"Voila!\\" Jane Rochford acts as spy for her family and advises her uncle as to what is always goiong on. She is the widow of George Boleyn.The story is very entertaining. I enjoyed Gregory's style of writing, even if she does play lose with the facts."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I've read from this series. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"\\"Three women who share one fate: the Boleyn Inheritance\\" (from the back cover)This quote really sums up what I consider to be the third book in the Tudor saga by Philippa Gregory. The Boleyn Inheritance is narrated through the voices of three narrators: Anne of Cleves (the 4th wife of Henry VIII), Katherine Howard (Henry's 5th wife), and Jane Rochford (the late Anne Boleyn's sister-in-law). Each of these women has a lot on the line because of the cloud that hovered above with the name of Boleyn. Each has earned their current place, in a sense, because of the death of Anne.I enjoyed the parts of the book that were narrated by Anne of Cleves the best. She was only really part of the Tudor Court for a very short time and was new to the country of England as well. Her chapters brought an outside eye to the story while Jane and Katherine's brought the inside eye. One thing that I really saw in this book was how easily used Katherine Howard was. She was manipulated by all sides and didn't even have a chance to realize quite what was happening. I wasn't a huge fan of Katherine's sections for that reason - she was completely oblivious to everything that was happening - come on girl! Jane's sections were interesting to see her wrestling with the guilt over what she did to her husband and sister-in-law. It was also enlightening to see the way she rationalized everything she did.I thoroughly enjoyed this book just as much as The Other Boleyn Girl and The Constant Princess. A unique way at looking at this short period of time and the events that quickly unfolded.To borrow a little more from the back cover to wrap this up nicely \\"Anne of Cleves - Her Boleyn Inheritance: accusations and false witness. Katherine Howard - Her Boleyn Inheritance: the threat of the axe. Jane Rochford - Her Boleyn Inheritance: a fortune and a title, in exchange for her soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book! Gregory brilliantly navigates between Henry VIII's 4th wife, Anne of Cleves, his 5th wife, Katherine Howard (she was just a teenager!), and Lady Rochford, whose testimony on her husband, George Boleyn, sent him to the block. The Tudor history comes alive in Gregory's talented writing -- each chapter in their unique voice and character. When I finished the book, I count my blessing that I wasn't living during such horrific period in history where your daily life was filled with constant fear, not because of anything you did, but simply because someone didn't like you. Out of the three women, only one comes out alive. My only complaint about this book is that it's smaller than the other Gregory's books I bought and the print wasn't very good - some pages were faded. But the novel more than made up for it; otherwise, I'd give it a four star."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This novel sucked me in from the beginning and did not let go - all three women were relatable and I desperately had to find out what would happen with each of their lives.This is the first novel by Gregory that I have read where she tells the story from more than one perspective. In this case, it was very effective as the reader essentially got to hear the same story told by three different women who lived it, yet their roles were so drastically different from each others'. What struck me most about these women was how utterly helpless they all were to control anything about their lives. Every single decision was made for them, and even the very strong-willed among them - such as Anne of Cleves, who did everything in her power to be her own woman and make her own decisions - were completely controlled by the men around them. And especially in the court of King Henry VIII, women had no hope. They could do exactly as was expected of them, be perfect little angels who listened to the men in charge and do exactly as they were told, and the king would still find some reason to put them to death, or if they were lucky, exile. As much of a horrible person Jane Rochford was, and as much of a \\"slut\\" Katherine Howard was, I simply found myself feeling so sorry for them. They had no choice in any of their actions. It was actually kind of heartbreaking to read about, especially regarding Jane, who honestly felt like she was doing the best she could for her family, yet was being manipulated by her uncle and suffered an awful fate for it.I loved this book, and I will be continuing to read Philippa Gregory's work until I've finished it all (and hopefully by then, she'll have written more!). It was a fabulous book to kick off 2009, and I highly recommend The Boleyn Inheritance."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is up to her usual standard of a great read. I love each and every book she writes."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book sucks you into history to the dangerous court of Henry the 8th. Gregory does a fantastic job portraying the 3 girls Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn. It is well researched and I could read it again and again and again."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is my 3rd Gregory book and definitely my favorite. I don't usually like stories that alternate narrators but this time it worked well and I liked it. I was completely enchanted by Gregory's portrayals of Katherine Howard and Anne of Cleves (the two of Henry VIII's wives about whom the least is known). I'm more impressed than ever at Gregory's faithfulness to history and her confidence in making up what can't be proved through research. In this book she made history and fiction blend beautifully. No one would ever believe that I--a high school and college history hater from way back--have become so fascinated with these historical figures that I just can't put these books down. Where were these books when I was suffering through dry, boring history classes?"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I read this book shortly after finishing The Other Boleyn Girl. This book was an amazing story of the wives of King Henry VIII after the execution of Anne Boleyn and death of Jane Seymour. This story seemed to take place in a more somber, yet more dangerous, time after their deaths. Madness continued to consume the King, and England lived in fear of him. Despite this, greedy families still sent their young women to seduce him in order to further their ambitions. Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard are two of Henry VIII's lesser-known wives, and Phillipa Gregory did an amazing job of creating 3 dimensional characters out of these women. I really liked this book!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The timeline of The Boelyn Inheritance follows that of The Other Boelyn Girl; Anne and George Boelyn have both lost their heads (literally) to Henry VIII....who is now poised to take yet another wife. The seemingly naive Anne of Cleves--who with her German accent and odd (to English eyes) manner of dress manages to alienate the aging, ill king in their very first meeting. It is, however, a political and strategic union (as most of them are)....but the king has taken an immediate dislike to his betrothed (caused of course by their unfortunate first encounter) and seeks reasons to break the marital contract. Meanwhile, a member of the Queen's court has caught the King's wayward eye; the very, very, very young and dim-witted Katherine Howard.In a tale told from three different perspectives--Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boelyn (the widow of George and sister-in-law of Anne) all detail their experiences with an increasingly paranoid king...living in denial as to his health and sex appeal, and surrounding himself with a royal court who are committed to reinforcing his delusions. And in a time where it has become increasingly dangerous to be a love interest of Henry VIII, Anne of Cleves proves that she may be even a might more clever than the original Anne. Chock full of scandal, betrayal, and deceit, The Boelyn Inheritance is a force to be reckoned with.DYB"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I enjoyed this sequel to The Other Boleyn Girl. Told from the perspective of three different women, it picks up after Anne Boleyn has been beheaded and tells the tale of Henry's successive wives. Full of intrigue and suspense as well as beautiful and mostly accurate descriptions of the place and time."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"KF Zuzulo is the author of A Genie in the House of Saud: Zubis RisesIt's almost as dead Anne Boleyn curses Henry to perceive his marital lot as intolerable, no matter who he was married to. He really was a churlish cur; and, in this version of the tale, he's not even attractive anymore. However, if you liked The Other Boleyn Girl, you'll really enjoy this extension on the story of courtly intrigue and the scheming necessary for survival. You can't blame the chaste Anne of Cleaves for being a pushover, or Jane Boleyn for being a twit, or Katherine for being a silly simp. They were just being the women they were -- the intrigue lies in how that interacts with Henry's reprehensible personality.Gregory conveys all the glamour and pageantry of courtly life in a way that makes you feel you've studied the era -- plus you get all the juicy gossip and scandal. Not as sexy as The Other Boleyn Girl, but definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Absolutely enjoyed this book. Picked it out at the library just to read something different. Fell in love with it! \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" movie came out while I was reading this book. I read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and enjoyed it even more! I am currently reading \\"The Constant Princess\\". I read the trilogy backwards, but it didn't make a difference! I recommend Philippa Gregory to EVERYONE! You WILL NOT regret purchasing this book! GO FOR IT!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Whilst reading this sweeping tale of three women bound together by the murderous lust of King Henry VIII, one cannot help but wonder where Gregory's editor had gone. Many sentences, even pages, could have been eliminated and the novel would have retained its emotional depth. The monotonous repetition of various images and phrases got very overwhelming at times - the point did not need to be emphasized so much. It felt was if the smart author was dumbing down her prose. Fortunately, because the book was so long, one is able to get deep inside the heads of the characters - and even gasps in shock as a major betrayal is revealed in a heartbreaking, morale-lowering climax. The portrayals of the three women are spot on and believable. The entire mood of the novel was that of a Great Epic, and the political intrigue more than satisfies. After finishing the last affecting words of the condemned women, one can literally feel the brush of Death that they themselves describe. This basic literary feat - to transport the reader to another time - is what Gregory did (although not at her best) quite beautifully."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is one of my favorite works of historical fiction, and I have given it to many friends as a gift.But of all the books in Philippa Gregory's series, this one was my least favorite. In part, it may be due to terrific job Gregory does putting us there, trapped within the madness of the court in those last few years. I walked around dazed and depressed for quite a few days after reading it.If you want to finish the series and have the stomach for it, read this book. Otherwise, the history speaks for itself."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory continues to take us into the dramatic world of kings, queens, lovers, and fighters.She paints a clear historical picture that shows us how truly frightening it is to be one of Henry VIII's \\"beloved\\" queens. The inheritance is nothing short of a curse that is cast upon one woman after the next and each queen has to have her wits about her in order to survive. Gregory uses accurate historical description along with a powerful inner voice to bring her characters to life and to draw you into the world of intrigue, royalty, and fear."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Once again, the author captures the imagination of the reader with another wonderful work of historical fiction. In this book, the author continues her Tudor saga, focusing on the events that occur upon the death of the Henry VIII's third Queen, Jane Seymour, after she gives birth to the King's long awaited son. When King Henry VIII decides to take yet another bride, all of Christendom is rocked, as all wonder who will be that most unlucky of brides.The events that follow are seen through the eyes of the three women who will play pivotal roles in all that transpires: Anne of Cleves, sister of the Duke of the Duchy of Cleves, and the woman who will bear the dubious honor of being wife number four; Katherine Howard, a beautiful teenager, the rose without a thorn who becomes wife number five to Henry VIII, but whose loose ways will cost her her head; and, last but certainly not least, the infamous Jane Boleyn, the former Lady Rochford, sister-in-law to the late Anne Boleyn, having been married to Anne's brother George, who met the same fate as his sister, thanks in part to his own wife's testimony.The story is propelled along by the first person narratives of each of the three protagonists. The author manages to give each of these pivotal women, Anne, Katherine, and Jane, a unique voice. Each narrative provides a piece of the story. Anne is the level headed narrator and the one that seems to be the most grounded. Jane is a grasping woman who will do whatever it takes to get that which she wants. It is through her narrative that the intrigues of the court manifest themselves. Katherine is a flighty, mercurial young miss, a typical teenager thrown into a den of lions. Surrounded by all manner of temptation, she is oblivious to the danger around her, caring only for her creature comforts. Yet, all three of these disparate women share a symbiotic relationship.This is an entertaining look at the Tudor court during a tumultuous time. It is well written work of historical fiction, though sometimes a tad repetitive and not quite as good as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". Still, it will not fail to entertain the reader. Fans of the author, as well as aficionados of the Tudor period, will thoroughly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Rather than reading this book myself, I was treated to the performance of three different actresses who took the part of a main character in the court of Henry VIII from the years 1540-1542. Each reader is skillful in portraying the excitement, fright, confusion, and repulsion of her own story with the king. The voice of Kathryn Howard is delightful in her shallowness, self-centeredness, and teenage exuberance of first love. These women do a marvelous job of interpreting the characters. I got much more out of the book than if I'd read it in my own voice or chosen the abridged edition....too many important details omitted.Politics were much more dangerous then and the chance of losing your head was very real. Which of these women will go from a secluded, ho-hum life in the country to the excitement and wealth of the court of Henry VIII? Which will be expected to \\"service\\" a fat, old, smelly, bad-tempered husband, King HenryVIII? Which will be tricked by the sneaky court advisors? Which will end up executed and which will escape? Which will believe the king has lost his mind? And what IS the Boleyn inheritance: Is it the wealth, land, power, beautiful clothes, parties and great castles, maids to wait upon every command, or is it death by execution?"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Of all Phillippa Gregory's novels, I liked this the best. She weaves the story of three women into a complex tapestry of contrasting emotions. Each of the characters pulsated with life against the background of an England mired in intrigue. This is historical fiction at its finest; reading it was a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book was excellent! Particularly because there are a lot of historical truths peppered throughout the book and I just love that. But also because while the story is of the sixteenth century, it is written in common easy to relate to language. I could identify with many of the characters, good and bad, and while I knew what the ultimate ending would be for some people, I just could not wait to turn every page. The author tied up all of the ends perfectly, it was just perfect.This book was a book club choice and everyone loved it too. Some found it slow at first, but once they were into it, they also enjoyed it. I would recommend anyone wanting an entertaining and juicy story to devour, should pick this book up at once!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"While this does not start out quite as fast as the \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", it tells a story that is just as intriquing. Once the scene is set, it is almost impossible to put this book down. Phillippa Gregory does an incredible job at giving her readers a historically accurate tale of Henry VIII wives after Katherine of Arragon and Ann Boleyn, while providing a rich tapestry of who these women were, their aspirations and their fears. The book give readers insight into why so many women would aspire to be one of Henry VIII many wives and how many of them were simply pawns in a greater power play. If you read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", you will love how this book picks right up where that one left off.Just like the rest of Phillippa Gregory's books, this is one that you will want to take with you everywhere, just to sneak in one more chapter..."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is the kind of book I can't stop reading. I was hooked right away by the new voices, especially Anne of Cleaves and Katherine Howard. Although Katherine reminded me quite a bit of Kingsolver's Rachel in The Poisonwood Bible, I would ascribe that to capturing the essence of teen selfishness and self-worship, especially in the persona of an exceptionally pretty but uneducated girl.There are lots of serious books to read, and I've done my share of reading and teaching \\"the real thing,\\" i.e. heavy literature, and I get something out of that too. But when I just want to be diverted, taken away to another era and walk in the shoes of the courtiers of Henry VIII's reign, nobody does it better than Philippa Gregory.Have some fun with this book--the ending is well-known history, but Gregory kept me turning the pages, waiting for the fateful knock at the door."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance by Philippa Gregory reaffirms her place as the \\"first lady of historical fiction\\". Being a fan of her previous historical novels surrounding the Tudor court, such as The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queen's Fool and The Constant Princess, I was not surprised to discover that The Boleyn Inheritance was an intriguing, entertaining and vivid portrayal of Henry VIII's marriages to his fourth and fifth wives, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. The tale is narrated alternately by Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard(cousin of Anne Boleyn) and Lady Jane Rochford; the widow of Anne Boleyn's brother George, whose testimony helped send both Anne and George to the scaffold on charges of incest and treason.The use of three distinct voices is unique, for although all three women may have been witnesses to many of the same court events, their descriptions vary due to their character and personal history. It is for this reason alone that the novel does not become redundant. Historians tend to possess distinct perceptions of the two wives that are the focus of this novel. Anne of Cleves has been most often perceived as unattractive, distasteful, physically repugnant and unsophisticated; while Katherine Howard has been perceived as a silly, stupid, illogically ignorant and a lustful wanton.By the end of the novel, readers concur with Ms. Gregory on the fact that perhaps Anne of Cleves was the most fortunate of Henry's wives, for she gained independence and property upon the annulment of her marriage (something very few women of her time could ever hope for), however Ms. Gregory gives readers a sense of the humiliation she must have felt; to be publicly rejected by one of the most powerful men in Europe- this is a fact many historians, such as Allison Weir, often over look. Katherine Howard does often come across as incredibly silly and nave, but Ms. Gregory deliberately portrays her this way, not as an insult but to remind her readers that nothing more should be expected from a fifteen year old girl, surrounded by people much older and much more sophisticated than she. Ms. Gregory sought to portray these two women in a more humanistic light, to show that as women they lived in a world with limited options, in a world in which a man's word was law, especially if a man was king and most certainly if that man was the tyrant Henry VIII became towards the end of his reign.The voice of Lady Jane Rochford was not as strong, and her characterization not as complex. It is obvious that Ms. Gregory wanted to invoke sympathy for Lady Rochford, but she did a poor job. Not only do Lady Rochford's public justifications for her testimony against her husband and sister-in-law lack believably, her personal justifications (which are given to the reader through internal monologues) lack believability as well. There was no evidence presented in the novel which could make Lady Rochford's betrayal forgivable or even understandable in the eyes of the reader. The only emotion felt when Lady Jane met her executioner was relief, for she was deserving of her fate.The Boleyn Inheritance was a successful novel, it managed to avoid the dark overtones which were consistent in The Constant Princess, but it lacked the magic and romance of The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool. Ms. Philippa Gregory remains the \\"first lady of historical fiction\\" for she approaches her time periods and characters with academic discipline, yet she allows her imagination to carry the story forward. For this reason she is able to present history in unthreatening, entertaining way, for readers who know little about the historiography of the Tudor period will become educated in history just as they will be equally enthralled with the drama. Those with sufficient knowledge of the period will not lack for substance, for the creative aspects and the historical content are equally strong."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"You know the old rhyme: \\"King Henry the Eighth, to six wives he was wedded: One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded.\\" The story of the fickle Tudor monarch captured my imagination when I was growing up --- I must have read dozens of fictional accounts of the executions of Anne Boleyn (wife number two) and Catherine Howard (wife number five), wondering what I would have done in such a spot and probably, in the process, developing a rather grisly and uncertain view of marriage.Well, I still love ruffs and 16th-century madrigals, and Elizabeth I, Henry's descendant, remains, in my opinion, the queen to end all queens. And when I come upon a new Tudor novel, like THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE, I still find myself rooting for the doomed wives against Henry --- wanting them to escape their fate, identifying with their terror, savoring the dreadful tension as they draw closer to the end. But I didn't expect much in the way of surprises from this book. After all, we know how it comes out.Philippa Gregory proves me wrong: She has written an historical thriller with all sorts of marvelous, poignant suspense. Although her novels are consistently well researched and generally anachronism-free, they are not simply dutiful re-creations: She always manages to throw a wild card or two into the mix. THE CONSTANT PRINCESS, for example, is a sympathetic treatment of Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife, that emphasizes her Spanish/Moorish heritage. THE VIRGIN'S LOVER (is that an ironic title, or what?) charts Elizabeth I's reckless affair with Robert Dudley (Gregory's Tudor novels were not written in chronological order); THE QUEEN'S FOOL, narrated by a young Jewish woman, offers a positive, revisionist view of the much maligned Mary I, Henry's daughter; and THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL focuses on Anne's sister, Mary, who was the first of her family in King Henry's bed.In THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE the character who Gregory scoops up from the anonymity of history is Jane Boleyn, widow of Anne's brother, George. She testified against both Boleyns at their trial for treason and so was indirectly responsible for their deaths. Now she is brought back to court to be lady-in-waiting to two more queens: Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard.Think of this book as a female trio, with three alternating first-person voices in counterpoint, distinct yet somehow complementary. The title indicates that each of them is replaying, in some fashion, the sad, brief life of Anne Boleyn. Anne of Cleves, a princess from a small Flemish duchy that is crucial to England's European alliances, is a stranger in a strange land, vulnerable to the same sort of betrayal as her namesake --- she has no sooner learned to speak English and be a real queen than she is rejected by her aging, increasingly unstable consort.Katherine Howard is Anne Boleyn's cousin and, similarly, a lady-in-waiting who catches the king's eye and ultimately marries him; a beautiful, boy-crazy teenager, she is as smart about seducing men as she is stupid about everything else (\\"No power on earth can make a sensible woman out of Katherine Howard because there is nothing to work on,\\" Jane comments sardonically. \\"She is lacking in education and training and even common sense\\").And Jane --- an artist of betrayal, a John le Carre character transposed to the 16th century --- is the secret agent of her uncle-by-marriage, Thomas Howard, the Machiavellian Duke of Norfolk. They will stop at nothing to promote the ambitions of their family (\\"There is always dirty work to be done,\\" Jane says, \\"and that is our specialty\\"), even if it means betraying two more queens. Looming over it all is Henry --- not just a fickle fellow with an understandable obsession with producing heirs to the throne, but a sick mind and pitiless dictator, increasingly out of touch with reality. Says Anne, \\"He is not a safe man.\\"Historical documents tell us what happens to Anne of Cleves: Although the rhyme calls her \\"divorced,\\" in fact the marriage was annulled. In the novel there is a dangerous period during which it seems unlikely that she will escape the axe, but she lives on, spending the rest of her days in England. Catherine Howard's story is almost a repeat of Anne Boleyn's. But I didn't know whether opportunistic, damaged Jane (whose husband and sister shared an intimacy that shut her out) would survive the royal machinations --- and I'm not telling, for fear of spoiling the chilling denouement.THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE is a private view of history, emotionally charged and irresistibly readable. Gregory gets inside the hearts and heads of her characters from the start. The motive power of her book is psychological, never purely circumstantial: She looks inward, then out. Most historical novelists go the other way around (and never find their way much past the quaint language, antiquated clothes and incessant wars). It's like Method acting compared to a more traditional sort of stagecraft. We feel that the three narrators are speaking to us directly --- or, perhaps more accurately, talking to themselves.But, of the three, Anne is clearly Gregory's heroine. We watch her evolve from an abused sister and reluctant, awkward wife and queen into a genuinely independent woman. There is a bitterly realistic scene in which she and Katherine, then her lady-in-waiting, realize that they are both trapped: \\"We are two women who have recognized that we cannot control the world. We are players in this game, but we do not choose our own moves. The men will play us for their own desires. All we can do is try to survive whatever happens next.\\" Once Anne is living alone in the castle Henry has given her as compensation, however, she revels in her freedom --- dressing, riding and worshiping God as she likes: \\"I have never in my life before been Anne of Cleves, Anne by myself, not a sister, not a daughter, not a wife, but Anne: pleasing myself. ... It may be a better thing to be a single woman with a good income...than to be one of Henry's frightened queens.\\"I'm glad that Gregory resisted the impulse to furnish Anne with a (fictional) romance. In letting her stand alone, she gives THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE a feminist edge (perhaps a bit too contemporary-sounding at times, but completely plausible and quite inspiring). Marriage, or at least love, is still part of most women's destiny, but we also need more autonomous space to figure out who we are and who we hope to become. As we chart our tentative path between wifehood and solitude, Anne of Cleves --- an unlikely role model --- seems to reach out from history to help.--- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I found The Boleyn Inheritance to be the most realistic and intriguing of Philippa Gregory's novels of the Tudor era. Her depiction of the three focus characters' point of view was exceedingly vivid - strong in emotion and reflection. Despite my being very well versed in the history of the period, I had to remind myself that there was speculation and embellishment. Her illustrations of the hidden motives, emotional upheaval, intrigue, and, in the case of Katherine Howard, rank naivete, could make one think one was reading actual correspondence from the characters rather than fiction.It is tempting, with historical perspective, to see Anne of Cleves as the \\"Flanders mare,\\" to whom Henry was generous and kind. Philippa Gregory gives this young woman, so a pawn to political intrigue, a queenly dignity which makes her supposed stupidity a clever means for survival. Yet she captures the constant fear with which Anne must have lived, her awareness of Henry's tyrannical whimsy, and the pain she would have experienced when Henry (typically, but terrifyingly) blamed her for his own inadequacy. Few of Anne's biographers have presented a portrait to contradict Henry's condemnation of a supposedly ignorant and unattractive woman, and Philippa's portrayal of her is totally plausible and multi dimensional.Jane Rochford, once again, is the image of total self absorption and ugly deception. The exploration of her character and motives is chilling and perceptive. By the end, when Jane is feigning madness to escape the scaffold, the intense picture of one rotted to the core by jealousy and disloyalty is both frightening and possibly extremely accurate.Katherine Howard is the tragic heroine. Her ignorance (not unusual for the very young girl it is easy to forget she was) strips her of the image of a whore snapping up the spoils of a tyrannical widower. She comes across as the soul of naivete - vanity making her blind to intrigue around her, her trust in her own charms leaving her totally vulnerable.One comes from reading this work with a sense of compassion and (as far as Anne is concerned) esteem for the women, and a heightened awareness of Henry's treachery and reputation as a dangerous lion. Philippa's speculation is all very reasonable, where some of her other books about the era went over the line into the fantastic. I would highly recommend this title."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I feel as though this book was written as a sort of afterthought. All the other books in this \\"series\\" are based on a single woman, which offers increased involvement in the story. Meanwhile this book lacks the same plot development and time spent on the characters, as there are two wives who share the book along with at least two other major characters. This book could definitely be written more satisfyingly as two individual novels.You definitely don't want to read these books out of chronological order; you just won't get the same richness out of them. Gregory's phenomenal skills with character development is lost without the background from each previous book.For reference, the order to read these books is:The Constant PrincessThe Other Boleyn GirlThe Boleyn InheritanceThe Queen's FoolThe Virgin's Lover"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I've been having a love-hate relationship with author Philippa Gregory ever since she wrote her first novel set in Tudor England. I love the fact that she's writing about this dynasty of monarchs where treachery and excess ruled, but I absolutely hate her writing style and the liberties that she takes in the hunt for the sensational. And to my dismay, I've kept reading some of her work in the vain hopes that she just might improve.Her most recent novel, The Boleyn Inheritance, almost did it for me. Continuing her saga of the many wives of Henry VIII, this time she tells the story of the fourth and fifth wives, Anne of Cleves, and Katherine Howard. King Henry VIII hasn't had much luck with his spouses so far -- he broke the heart of his first wife, Katharine of Aragon; the second one, Anne Boleyn, was beheaded for adultery, and the third, Jane Seymour, died in childbed after giving Henry the precious son he so craved.Now the king wants another wife, and his chancellor, Thomas Cromwell has arranged an alliance with a small German principality, and the choice has fallen on Anne of Cleves. Across all of England, women are angling for the duties of ladies-in-waiting to the new queen, all of whom are hoping to find wealth and possibly romance. Gregory tells the story through the eyes of three women, all in first person narrative.Jane Boleyn, once Queen Anne Boleyn's sister-in-law, and who helped to send her husband and the queen to the headsman's axe, lives in a lonely and bitter exile in the countryside. She has recieved nothing of the riches that the Boleyns once had, and only her title of Lady Rochford has remained. Still, there's a chance, especially when the head of the Howard family, the Duke of Norfolk, decides to sponser Jane into the royal household, wanting to have a reliable spy among the Queen's women. Jane happily accepts, knowing that by helping the duke, she can rise to wealth and possibly even a new marriage for herself.Katherine Howard, the duke's very pretty niece, has been raised among a multitude of Howard cousins and dependents. She's vivacious and lively, and more than tempting to men even at the young age of fourteen. Already there are secret romances flourishing at night in the girl's dormitory, and pretty little Kitty has already fallen for the charms of Francis Dereham, another ward of the Duke. They've made a rather clumsy and secret betrothal between themselves, but when the Duke decides to dangle her as bait for the aging king, she's delerious with the prospect of going to court.Finally there is Anne of Cleves herself. Raised in a strict Lutheran household, she doesn't know any of the skills that a lady of Henry's court would know -- no dancing, singing, music-making or gambling for her! She's endured a hateful relationship with her brother, who may have shut their father up to starve to death, and only her resolve to make the very best of what the future may have is what is keeping her together. Too, she knows that she is not very pretty, but she has a grace and dignity all her own, and arrives in England not knowing the language or the customs of her new kingdom.Worst of all, her first meeting with Henry is a dismal failure, both parties being taken aback by what they see. Henry is now in his forties, aging and bloated, with an old injury nearly crippling him and stinking to high heaven. He's grown irascible and hovers between rage and quiet, and Anne quickly learns just how dangerous the life of an English queen can be. There's no one that she can trust, not even the oh-so-helpful Lady Rochford, nor the charming Katherine Howard, and when the marriage lurches to the inevitable failure, Anne begins to live in terror of losing her head as well.Katherine Howard dances and plays, finding the royal court to be a delightful world of young men, a doting king and an endless stream of presents and jewels and pretty gowns. So much so that she can scarely see what is simmering underneath, and when the opportunity comes as the king turns his attention to her, Katherine is simply delighted to be the next Queen. All she has to do is produce another son for the king, and her future will be secure. But the reality of the king's nightly visits is a far cry from the pleasures she knew with Francis, and when Jane Rochford suggests that a younger man might be what she needs, Katherine hasn't the sense to say no...This time, Philippa Gregory stays pretty much within what is known with her story. For those who have already read about King Henry VIII and his many wives, there's very little that is new. What is interesting is how Gregory tells the story. By using the personal perspective of Jane, Anne and Katherine to tell the story, the reader gets to know these women on an intimate level, seeing their secret desires, their weaknesses, and how each of them cope with setbacks and the web of treachery around them. That's the strong point with this novel, and Gregory manages to make each voice somewhat distinct.However, given my previous experiences with Gregory's work, I wasn't expecting much out of this novel either. She tends to introduce supernatural elements into her story, and here at least stays away from that, and keeps pretty much to what is known. Too, she relies heavily on the work of Retha Warnicke for most of her sources, a scholar whose theories are questionable at best -- I loathed her novel, The Other Boleyn Girl, and here she uses the idea of Anne of Cleves being charged with witchcraft, a notion that is ludicrous, as a means of clearing the way for Katherine Howard.However, the portrayal of Katherine Howard as a featherbrained nitwit is pretty much spot on, and Jane Rochford is one of the more distasteful characters to come down in history. Gregory tries to make her sympathetic, with mixed results.Another problem that I had with this was Henry. Here he's a nasty, farting, bleching monster of a man, flying into rages and fits of ire at a moments notice. His scathing comments to Anne of Cleves in an early sequence didn't quite ring true -- like any good showman, Henry was very careful how he treated others in public, leaving his more violent side in private, and preferably in the hands of others. His treatment of Anne of Cleves was actually quite careful, and in all of the accounts that have survived, he treats her with great kindness.But the biggest problem is the use of the three major characters speaking in an 'I' voice. It's damn confusing at the start, without any real way to keep everyone separate. Too, they all tend to think and speak alike pretty much, and Gregory has them endlessly ruminating on things, and going over and over and over again the same territory. It gets very tedious throughout the book, slowing down the plot and hardly giving any real motion to the story.Despite an author's note, and a reading guide for book clubs with various questions, what really is lacking here is anything about Anne of Cleve's life after Henry -- it gets interesting, and she was able to maintain a close relationship with all of Henry's surviving children, even including Mary Tudor.Still, for those readers who can't get enough of England's Tudor kings and queens, this will probably be an enjoyable read. If you don't know much about them, this makes an interesting starting point, but after this, I would suggest the more scholarly works out there, such as the ones by Alison Weir and David Starkey. A forthcoming biography on Jane, Lady Rochford is planned for later on in 2007, titled, Jane Boleyn: The True Story of the Infamous Lady Rochford by Julia Fox, a book that I am looking forward to.Three and a half stars, rounded up to four. Somewhat recommended, depending on how much the reader knows about the facts of Henry VIII's life and court."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Countless books have been written about the court of Henry VIII and his six wives and the basic story is quite familiar. Nevertheless, it is literally difficult to put down this novel, which focuses on three comparatively little-known characters: Anne of Cleves, Henry's fourth wife, who survived her divorce relatively unscathed, Katherine Howard, the fifth wife and the second to be executed, and Jane Rochford, sister in law to Anne Boleyn, wife number two. These three very different women navigate the treacherous waters of the Tudor court, dominated by the increasingly tyrannical Henry. A great read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I did not think that after CONSTANT PRINCESS, Phillippa Gregory could top herself. She has, in this fast moving and eloquent novel of three women whose fates are tied directly to their relationship to Anne Boleyn.We read in three voices, and three different styles, the narratives of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn.Gregory switches back and forth from one woman to another with ease, no loss of continuity, no omissions of recall.I loved this book and hated to put it down so I read it in 3 days which is fast for me, I savor each word. I have a whole new picture of Henry VIII that is much different from previous ones, and it was very satisfying to get inside the heads of the women via narration.I hope Gregory will return to Katherine of Aragon as she left her in PRINCESS, but until or unless she does I have had a memorable visit with the court of a demented king.At times terrifying in the hopelessness of those at the mercy of Henry, nonetheless the depth of probing into the psyches of the women seems easy for Gregory...Anne is the one sensible and practical woman determined to escape with her life. Katherine is the vapid and immature beauty who thinks the world will always love her, and Jane chills us with her relentless scheming to come ever nearer the throne of England.A great triumph for Ms Gregory."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Maybe it is because I've read too much about Tudor times and know too much about the fates of Henry VIII's six wives that I found this book too predictable. It took me weeks to get through the first half, but admittedly, I got more engrossed through the last third (eventhough I knew the ending). I found the writing style of making each chapter representative of an individual character frustrating. I would have so preferred that the characters stories meshed without the constant jumping back and forth from one viewpoint to another; it made for too much redundancy.Ultimately, I enjoyed the book, but wish that Ms. Gregory would slow down and stop trying to put out book after book so quickly and get back to the quality of her earlier releases."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I've read a few other PG novels, and while I mildly enjoyed one (and dispised the other), I thought I'd give this one a try. I thought that the perspective of 3 women (Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard) would make it interesting, and as not much is known about Anne of Cleves or Katherine Howard, I figured it'd be harder for Ms. Gregory to butcher the history (as she did in TOBG).Even with my low expectations, I was disappointed. The extremely repetative theme of the book (from all three women's perspective) was : \\"The king is old, the king is fat, the king is impotent, the king is smelly.\\"The chapters from Jane's POV were incredibly redundant with her thoughts of \\"Oh, I miss George (Boleyn) and Anne (Boleyn), Oh, I'm so sorry I testified against them, Oh, I wish they weren't dead, Oh, I'm so sad.\\"The chapters from Anne's POV were again redundant with \\"Oh I just want to be a good wife and queen, Oh I hope the king doesn't plot against me/ kill me.\\"The chapters from Katherine's POV were incredibly dull, with her only concerned with how many dresses and jewels she had, how pretty she was, how many young men she could get to notice her and flirt with her.All in all the characters were one-dimensional and didn't develop as the story went on. Jane was irritating with all of her hand-wringing about Anne/George, Katherine was just ridiculous and utterly unrealistic. Anne was mildly interesting, and had the potential to be a great character, but only if she had had more depth and development.I would suggest passing on this one, or if you're dying to read it, get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance continues where The Other Boleyn Girl left off. Henry is once again looking for a wife and this time he looks to Cleves. Anne's arrival to the English court follows intrigue, passion and more romantic drama as the perpetually fickle Henry falls for yet another lady in waiting to yet another queen. For those who enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl, this is a welcome addition but not necessarily as fast-paced. There is a lot of introspective repetition i.e. characters thinking out loud the same thoughts over and over again. Jane Boleyn's character touches the reader, as does that of Katherine Howard. Jane leaves a slimy, deceptive impression on you in the previous book but in this one, PG deliberately makes you confused in what you feel for her.The book is very well written and the characters are extremely strong in their impact. The story is obviously based on actual history with a few stretches. Towards the middle of the book, I felt... disgusted. Why? Well I felt disgusted with Henry VIII once again. It is amazing, the number of people he sent to the block and stake just because they did not agree with him. The helplessness of his people, family and his tyrannical rule almost put a fear over the reader. Every tale entwined in Henry's life starts with a castle and ends with the execution block. I think this disgust is PG's success in writing a very good book. I will now turn to something lighter, like fantasy!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have to admit that as much as I enjoyed \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" I liked \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" a great deal more. First and foremost, we are treated to a story about three women from English history that have been for the most part relegated to footnotes and back-burners, with the sole exception being Katherine Howard, who has received a more substantial amount of attention lately; however Anne of Cleves, Henry's fourth and most obscure (though not uninteresting) wife whose marriage to the king was a very short-lived 7 months and Lady Jane Rochford (sister-in-law to Anne Boleyn and wife to her brother, George Boleyn) whose false accusations were considered the catalyst for their fall from grace and, ultimately, execution are sometimes played off as minor historical figures in a time and place that never lacked for larger than life personalities. The novel is narrated by all three of the aforementioned women and we see how their lives, though, woven in many respects, were very separate and their narration tells us as much. While serving as a lady to the king's new protestant German wife, Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard catches the eye of the aging king whose lust and sense of romance are rekindled by her calculated flirtations and feigned innocence. As a willing pawn for her ambitious family, headed by her ruthless uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, she has little idea of the price she will pay for a childhood indiscretion that surfaces soon after being crowned queen of England. Lady Jane Rochford named Queen Katherine's lady-in-waiting, quickly becomes her greatest confidant, a role that will ultimately lead to her downfall, as court secrets and accusations of betrayal surface and she's named a conspirator in the queen's affairs. Throughout all this, Anne, who thought she'd gained relative safety when Henry annuls their marriage, declares her his sister and grants her various properties, among them the Boleyn ancestral home, Hever Castle, soon realizes the precariousness of her position when the king's fickle and suspicious nature rears its ugly head and her quiet existence is threatened with fear of imprisonment and, perhaps, even death. Just like with her earlier novels, Philippa Gregory's storytelling is both succinct (no padding here) and first rate, with every character given ample attention, which keeps the story moving along at a breathless clip. The narrative never wanes and the climactic exchange between Lady Jane Rochford and the Duke of Norfolk is alone worth the price of admission, as it were. The ferociousness of the encounter is such that it will not soon be forgotten. By far, my favorite PG novel, so I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Turned out to be a pretty good book. It was a little confusing at the start since there are 3 characters points of view, but once you get to know the characters it gets really good."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I found all three main characters to be absurdly naive at the beginning, which was annoying and distracting. However, as events unfolded, the characters became much more realistic and, consequently, I was able to get into the book a lot more. It turned out to be a great read!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Gregory provides a fresh angle to the \\"done to death\\" story of Henry VIII and his wives. Historically accurate, suspenseful, and insightful character development make this book a pleasure to read. I was lucky enough to listen to it on CD where three marvelous actresses read the parts of the two queens and Jane Boelyn. While sometimes it's wonderful to curl up with a book--the CD performances made the story come alive."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book definetly demonstrates the trials and tribulations that woman in medieval England had to face. This book basically picks up where The Other Boleyn Girl left off, with the exception of pretty much skipping Henry's marriage to Jane Seymour. My only complaint is that Philippa skipped that queen.. In beginning of this story, she has died in child birth. Anne of Cleves, I cannot say enough about her character and her silent charm. This queen struck a chord deep within myself. I felt for her and admired the way she overcame both a domineering brother and King Henry and his court. Katherine Howard, frivolous stupid child that meets a tragic ending for following her heart. This book goes back and forth between the viewpoints of these two queens and the one always observing it all, Jane the traitor. Some of you will remember her from The Other Boleyn Girl. I personally enjoyed the back and forth narration, my mother, however did not. Truly something to consider when contemplating the purchase of this book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Although I didn't like this novel as much as I liked her Wideacre series and The Other Boleyn Girl it was still a great read. I really like how she split the book among three characters, but told the same sequence of events from their point of views. I didn't want to give it a five, however, because I felt that the book was a bit hurried and glossed over a lot of events and character development. The book could/should have been longer, but it was a great read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Its got the essentials: romance, drama, murder and mystery. It kept me at the edge of my seat. I recommend to read this just after The Other Boleyn Girl (its like the second part of that book)."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Nicely written follow-up to The Other Boleyn Girl. Interesting insight into the lives of relatively unknown women. The narrative style of all three women's stories added another dimension to their personalities. Very enjoyable and left me wanting more."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Can Philippa Gregory write a dull book? She certainly proves herself more than capable of stealing all your free time with this novel."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I enjoyed the reading of this excellant book. Since my eyesight is bad, I rely on audio books. This one was very good."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I enjoyed this light bit of fiction as much as I do nice chocolates. I could not put it down. Am glad that I had read The Other Boleyn Girl and The Constant Princess first. If you like reading fiction about Henry's wives, then you will enjoy this book. A little racier than two aforementioned works of fiction, it's still not a romance per se. So, if you're looking for a\\" bodice ripper,\\" this is not for you."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Returning to the court of Henry VIII, this book is the story of three women, Henry VIII's fourth wife, Anne of Cleaves, Henry's fifth wife, Kitty Howard, and Jane Boleyn. Anne of Cleaves travels to England in order to marry Henry VIII. Expecting a dashing older gentleman, she is put off to discover her new husband is a large, putrid self-absorbed and indulgent man. When Henry VIII is unable to consummate his marriage his attention turns to young Kitty Howard, a flirtatious lady-in-waiting. Jane Boleyn, the sister-in-law of the late Anne Boleyn, coaches Kitty to become the next Queen of Englang. Wanting nothing more than riches, Kitty Howard plays to the King, as he decides to set aside Anne and marry Kitty instead.Unlike other Gregory novels, the characters appear a bit stereotypical. Kitty is a young flirtatious teenager, thinking of nothing more than riches. Anne of Cleaves only wishes to escape her brother and quickly adjusts to her new role as the King's \\"sister.\\" Jane Boleyn is a bit self-deluded and irrational. Overall, this book is not as good as Gregory's other novels, however, it is still worth a read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Just when you thought you knew it all about those Boleyn Girls, Philippa Gregory reminds you that there was one more. Who could forget George Boleyn's wife, Jane Boleyn, the one rumored to have betrayed her husband and her famous sister in law, Anne? Gregory delights us with the story of Jane Boleyn AFTER the beheading of Anne Boleyn and her relationship with the two next queens of King Henry the VIII, Queen Anne of Cleves and Queen Catherine Howard.That each woman \\"speaks\\" in her own voice is very effective. Queen Anne is a sympathetic character - strong, charming, and intelligent. Queen Catherine is hilarious and views the world with a childlike innocence although she is very keen in the ways of men. Jane Boleyn is just plain creepy. Jane is the mostly willing pawn in the Howard family's rise to power but is she really safe member of the family? And what about that business with George and Anne? Did Jane give the evidence that damned them both? Anne of Cleves simply wants to survive in this crazy kingdom. Will she survive when the first three wives did not?As Gregory spans the period of time from Queen Anne's rise and fall from the throne to the end of Queen Catherine's reign there are few questions that remain unanswered. I had the great honor of visiting Hampton Court last year and we were told that Queen Catherine haunts the halls there. After reading Gregory's well-researched and intricately woven tale, I don't wonder why anymore. The Boleyn Inheritance is well-written and cleverly designed - a story you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is surely one of my favorite books on Henry VIII's court. A must-read book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is the third Gregory book I've read, and I find that her characters consistently lack development. They are always a bit flat and one-sided, in contrast to the realistic details and intriguing historical settings of her novels. She's a decent historical fiction writer, but not the best."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book is absolutely enchanting. Each chapter is a seperate diary entry from Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn, and Katherine Howard. Each chapter is a first person's view of court life; no details spared. You get to read each one of these ladies point of view starting after jane's death and henry going from one wife to the other.She describes everyone and everything so beautifully in this novel. This is an absolute read for anyone who enjoys Henry VIII history or any historical fiction novels. It's also a must read once you have read The Other Boleyn Girl, also written by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I was intrigued into the story of Kathryn Howard and Jane Rochford after watching the Tudors. I knew that the series wasn't completely historically accurate, and this book was a great attempt to reach historical accuracy. They way it was laid out and narrated was done beautifully and made it reader friendly and enjoyable. The 3 different women who speak from this book have their voices heard in and their stories told in the most unique way. I found this book to hold me the best of all the novels I've read thus far regarding the Tudors reign and King Henry's wives. If you do not wish to read a 500+ page book, I found the book-on-tape/disc to be equally if not more enjoyable to hear because the book is truly brought to life through the women speaking. Highly recommended for a leisurely read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory's books are all amazing. But among the best I think are The Boleyn Inheritance, The Other Boleyn Girl, The Queen's Fool, Wise Woman, and The Virgin's Lover. And Virgin Earth! I love them all...if you are considering reading one of Gregory's books, you won't be disappointed. I was hesitant with buying a few of her books after reading some of the reviews on here, but I have read most of her novels (still working on the 18th and 19th centuries) and I was NEVER disappointed. I will be VERY sad when I run out of Gregory books to read!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The book is even better than the movie. Every detail is well written to follow history.

Some of what came out was startling and sent me to google for more facts and confirmation. Why they did what they did, in the face of ample examples of persons who paid the ultimate price for daring to cross the line, still eludes me. Unfortunately, I can't seem to rid my mind of a visual image of a fat, flatulent and putrefying Kind Henry who killed at will, just because he could."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance is an even more intrigued and interesting read than The Other Boleyn Girl. A must read for anyone who is interested in reading friction intertwined with rich historical background."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a great book it has everything from love to betrayal, the book is set in (1539 to 1547) It starts off with a little bit of where one of King Henry's past lady's in waiting for many of his past queens life has taken her from being in one of the richest courts to being a poor spinster, it then leads on to the fight between many young girls for the crown for queen of England with Anne of Cleaves finally wining. Anne's household then sets off to the court of England many events take place and the King finds he dislikes his new bride but one of his queen's maids have caught his eye it then goes on a thrilling journey that in the end leads to the scaffold.

I liked the historical base and the adding of the story line. The Author at end of the book included what was historical and what was fiction. For a first time Henry reader I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I'm a fan of Philippa Gregory and would recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction and can't get enough of the Tudor era. It is a well-crafted story that focuses on Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, wives four and five of Henry VIII. Anne is especially sympathetic; Katherine less so, though by the end of the novel the reader is nonetheless moved by the tragedy of her story.I wasn't too sold on the use of first person present tense throughout the novel; the immediacy was nice but there were several times in the story -- especially toward the end -- where the reader has the sense of not being where the action is, due to limitations of point of view. Also, the last third of the book dragged on just a little; maybe one too many scenes with Anne, who by that point didn't have much to do except fret in her castle at Hever.I very much enjoyed Gregory's unsympathetic portrait of Henry VIII at this stage of his life, and the honest madness and decadence of his court.The Other Boleyn Girl, which first put me onto Gregory's fan list, was a better novel. But this is also a fun book, and like I said, if you are into historical fiction and the Tudor era, definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Ms. Gregorry wrote another beautiful book. This time whe writes about The Bolyn Girls whom vie for the love of King Henry. Another beautifully written Historically written book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having just finished the last page of this book, I'm still feeling rather trembly(if that's a word!) and shaken at the picture of complete horror and terrible fear painted so brilliantly by Philippa Gregory. Poor, Katherine Howard was the 5th wife of the murderous Henry V111, a pretty but vapid child of fifteen and as silly and stupid a 15 year old as one could imagine. The poor ditz of a creature was used by her family, the aristocratic and ruthless Howards, who also produced Queen Anne Boleyn, and manipulated into captivating the King who had deteriorated into a madman with a gross, infected and ulcerated body and who had become a complete megalomaniac. The other part of the story which was more interesting to me, was the story of Anne of Cleves who was Henry's 4th wife but who, through dint of cleverness and good luck, escaped the headman's axe by agreeing to the annulment of her marriage. Not much has been written about Anne but she must go down in history as one of the luckiest women in the world. I found this book to be an excellent read and an absolute page turner to the end."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having only recently stumbled upon Gregory's books and very quickly read The Queens Fool and The Other Boleyn Girl, I was very enthusiastic to get my hands on a copy of The Boleyn Inheritance.Firstly I do need to address the fact that there appears to be many reviews and comments made by people who claim these tales are historically incorrect. My advice to those people would be to look up your definition of \\"historical fiction\\". The fact of the matter is that people can only allude what happened in the time of King Henry VIII. We can really only make educated guesses as to what actually happened with all of these people. We have letters and personal accounts dating back hundreds of years written by who may be very biased or spiteful people. We have historical evidence of what happened only in the most general of terms. Philippa Gregory has provided a story about what may have happened, not what actually did happen. Whether the historical facts as we know them pointed to something else entirely is beyond the point - this is a fictional tale which uses characters who really existed all those years ago.Now, as for the book itself, I found that I enjoyed it probably a little better than The Other Boleyn Girl. The pace seemed to move a little quicker - probably a by-product of the fact that each chapter in the book is written by one of three women, all different in mind and matter. I'd have to say that, to me, Anne of Cleves and Jane Rochford (Boleyn) were the characters who pushed the story along. Katherine Howard is portrayed to be a silly, self-centered, unintelligent and idle child and seems to have a very adequate role of a puppet between the two older, stronger women. She bounces perfectly between Anne and Jane in a way that befits the way she was written.Anne seemed to drive the story for the first half of the book while Jane's chapters in the last half became more and more intense. I thoroughly enjoyed the subtle changes in Jane's character which climax at the end of the book. If Gregory was aiming for people to feel some small amount of grim sympathy for Jane in the fact that she may very well not been entirely to blame for what happened with Anne and George Boleyn, she succeeded with me.All in all, this is a fantastic follow-on from The Other Boleyn Girl and a ripper of a book. I couldn't put it down and can blame Ms. Gregory for a few very bleary-eyed mornings."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I loved the way this book was told from 3 points of view. I found it entirely engrossing and couldn't put it down. You really don't get to read much about Anne of Cleves, so it was interesting to read what she might have been like. There isn't much known about her, but she certainly can be considered the luckiest of Henry VIII's wives! I always thought from her Holbein portrait that she was pretty, so I've always wondered why Henry was so repulsed by her. This book gives a convincing reason that could very well have been the truth. If you liked the other books by Gregory, you will enjoy this one also. In fact, it's my favorite of the 3."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance is the story of Henry VIII's fourth and fifth wives, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford.Anne of Cleves comes to England, the product of a dynastical alliance between the Duchy of Cleves and Tudor royal house. She arrives speaking no English and quickly becomes distasteful to her husband when she rejects him. And even when they divorce six months after marriage, Anne of Cleves is still not safe from the tyranny of her ex husband. Ultimately, she's the character we most sympathize with. Her inheritance is the lands that once belonged to Anne Boleyn, which she was given at her divorce.History has a bad impression of Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford. The former sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn, Jane Boleyn sent her sister-in-law and husband to their deaths--allegedly to save her inheritance, though more likely than not because of jealousy. Part of the story is told through Lady Rochford's eyes, and its an interesting view. She sees herself as utterly blameless. At the very end, she pretends that she's mentally unstable so that she won't be executed--a gamble that eventually doesn't pay off. This was a detail that Gregory made up to show that Jane Boleyn was mentally unstable for having sent her brother and sister-in-law to their deaths, though I would argue that, in order to fully realize what she had done, Jane Boleyn was completely sane.In the Author's Note at the end of the book, Gregory claims that she wanted to show Katherine Howard as anything but silly; but there's no other way that Henry VIII's foolish and vain fifth wife can be portrayed. Married at sixteen to the fat, aging king, Katherine Howard has an affair with Thomas Culpeper, the handsome Groom of the Bedchamber. She naievely believes that, because she's Queen of England, she'll be saved from the ax. Her inheritance is the block, which she requested be brought to her chamber the night before her execution, so that she could practice.This is the best book I've seen from Philippa Gregory in a long time. The Boleyn Inheritance is a welcome change from the single-person narratives she's written in the past, where the main character is seen as utterly blameless and pure. I liked The Boleyn Inheritance maybe more than I enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book was fascinating since it was told from varying points of view. Having read, with mixed opinions Phillipa Gregory's other works, I found this to be the best. Told from the viewpoints of Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, it offered a sympathetic look at the women of that era and was well researched."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Once again Philippa Gregory writes a beautiful tale of women that were forgotten and were very scared of a murderer they called king.Anne of Cleves lived an awful life in in Germany and the thought of becoming Queen of England was almost God sent. Little did she know that she was about to be married to the notorious wife killer Henry VIII. She had no understanding of the language or the manners of court, and for the few months of her reign she did well. Until the king, of course, set his eye on a newer model.Katherine Howard is a little girl, with no knowledge. She is frivilous and desires nothing more than new gowns and jewels. Related to the late Anne Boleyn, Kitty becomes the eye candy to many men, including the King. Even with the King as a husband, she turns back to her old ways, with a new man.Jane Boleyn is serving yet another Queen after the divorce of one, the death of one, and the behading of another, that one who happened to be her sister-in-law Anne Boleyn. She lives with the fact that she sent Anne, and her own husband George to the scaffold so she could save her title and her dowry.I love Tudor history and was happy to find another wonderful book about the forgotten fourth and fifth queens of Henry VIII. Sadly the word back then as dangerous, especially for women, since they were used to get titles for their families. This story ends with the hacking of heads for two, and absolute freedom for another. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book comes after The Other Boleyn Girl & it is just as good as TOBG. This book is told from 3 points of view: Katherine Howard, Anne of Cleves & Jane Rochford (George Boleyn's wife Jane Parker). Its very interesting and Philippa really makes history come alive. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having been thrilled with Philippa Gregory's \\"The Constant Princess\\" and \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", I couldn't wait to pick up \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\". While this narrative did not disappoint, I must say that it wasn't as thrilling of a read as the first two Gregory novels that I read.\\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" picks up somewhat where \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" left off. Skipping Queen Jane Seymour and the years of Henry's abstinence from marriage after Jane's death in childbirth, Gregory tells a story of Anne of Cleves, a plain looking Duchess from Germany whom Henry VIII decided to marry purely for political reasons. Gregory tells the story as seen by Anne of Cleves herself, as well as from the point of view of two other women - Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford: the wife of George Boleyn, whose testimony cemented the death sentence both George and his sister Anne Boleyn received; and Katherine Howard, a young, frivolous and vain maid-in-waiting to Anne of Cleves. Gregory's writing was expert in that she wove the three narratives so expertly that the reader can always see different situations from different angles.Anne of Cleves is very happy to escape from the Duchy of Cleves and her abusive brother William (Wilhelm). Arriving England, Anne is somewhat apprehensive to be married to a King who was already married three times and whose wives are all dead. After the disastrous first meeting with Henry VIII, Anne's apprehension grows even further, along with her disgust for the obscenely obese King. Henry VIII is no longer the young, handsome prince, but a bad-tempered, monstrous lunatic, with a festering leg that stinks of rotting flesh and delusions of being the direct link to God. Jane Boleyn, after being the lady-in-waiting for Queen Katherine of Aragon, Queen Anne Boleyn and Queen Jane Seymour, is now back in the role of lady-in-waiting, this time to the new Queen Anne. Jane's role is predominantly that of a spy for her uncle, Duke of Norfolk, but she can not help but become friendly with the humble and pious Queen Anne of Cleves. Katherine Howard, all of fifteen years of age, is appointed Anne's maid-in-waiting, and her primary concern is her looks and which dress to wear, as well as which boy to flirt with. What Katherine does not expect is for her flirtatious behavior to catch the eye of the old King Henry, who finds Anne of Cleves displeasing to his tastes. After only six months of marriage, Henry claims that his union with Anne of Cleves was never consummated, which Anne wisely agreed with, and their marriage is annulled. Due to Anne's agreement, she is afforded all the honors befitting a Princess of England. His marriage dissolved, Henry is free to marry Katherine, a girl young enough to be his granddaughter.While Anne of Cleves inherited Anne Boleyn's house at Hever in Kent, Jane Boleyn became a lady-in-waiting yet again, to Henry's fifth wife, Queen Katherine Howard. Jane has a hard time controlling the capricious young Queen who is her own cousin, and, following Duke of Norfolk's direction, Jane arranges for Katherine to meet young courtiers, all with the goal of producing the male heir for the increasingly impotent King Henry. No one at court counted on Henry being all-seeing though, the fact that would become the undoing of both Jane Boleyn and Queen Katherine Howard.While \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" is largely based on historic facts, the author once again asserted that the novel is fictional, possibly to avoid the constant bickering of the historians as to which particular piece of information is true and which isn't. Gregory hence advises the reader to enjoy her novel as pure entertainment. One should not read Gregory's novels as scholastic works on Tudor England, as her books are meant to entertain only. I liked Gregory's narratives, though they were not as engaging as those from her previous two novels. Gregory gets the reader into the minds of the three main characters with an ease one learns to expect from Gregory. While the novel concentrates mainly on Henry's wives, the reader also follows Henry in his increasing madness and paranoia. The reader also sees the changing life at court, the changes occurring with the changes in moods of the aging King.All in all, \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" is a highly readable, entertaining novel in the style of Gregory's previous books on the Tudors. The book is very easy to read, comprehend and follow, even for those who are absolutely not familiar with the Tudors. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is the second Philippa Gregory book I've read. Next to \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" this one is no less dazzling although it does not carry as much sexual flair as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" I'm quite a fan of the history of the British Monarchy and have read nearly every non-fiction book I can find on the subject. Someone gave me the \\"Other Boleyn Girl\\" and now I'm hooked on Gregory's talent for weaving fact with fiction.\\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" is about the lives of mainly three women---Anne of Cleves-Jane Boleyn-Catherine HowardThe book is structured such that each chapter is told by Anne, Jane or Catherine in a first person narrative. I like this format because we see what each of them may have been thinking during the tumultuous times if King Henry VIII's waning years.If you don't know the history, you may be a little lost. I would suggest reviewing the Tudor/Windsor family trees to keep track and to truly appreciate the complexity of the story. Anne of Cleves comes from Germany and is the 4th wife of King Henry VIII. The book details her departure from Germany, arrival in England and subsequent short marriage to Henry. Anne is pushed aside for Catherine Howard who becomes his 5th wife. Anne is set up as a 'sister' of the King in a palace near-by but always worries for her safety given the King's history with Anne Boleyn. Catherine Howard was only 14 when she arrived at Court, works in Queen Anne's household and is portrayed as simple but beautiful and fun-loving. Jane Boleyn is the widow of George Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's brother (both were executed regarding Anne's supposed affairs/treason accusations detailed in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"). Jane is complex and clever, but her actions seem really evil. There is much irony at the end of the book regarding Jane, the Tower, and her husband/sister-in-law's fates. There are other important characters including a Boleyn uncle who orchestrates much of the drama with Catherine Howard. Also, princesses Mary and Elizabeth are heavily noted and both are future queens.\\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" will take you from Anne of Cleve's departure from Germany (right after the King's beloved Jane Seymour's death) through her role as \`sister' to the King and on to Catherine's miserable end. It truly is an amazing tale... Buy it, read it, share it, enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is the first P. Gregory book I've read and was disappointed. It seems, at times, as though it should be on the juvenile shelf.I give it a 3 because I do like the fact that it's told from the viewpoint of three completely different women, and I really like that it gives one a glimpse into what it could have been like for Anne of Cleves. I know so little about the 4th wive, and I was delighted to have that perspective.However, once the king marries Katherine Howard, the story goes downhill and becomes incredibly repetitive and filled with the exhaustive, melodramatic lamentations of these three women.This book would have been fine had it been shortened to about half its length.All in all, not a bad book ~ just over long. I would still recommend it to certain people."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having enjoyed so many of Philippa Gregory's other novels, particularly The Other Boleyn Girl, I pre-ordered this and waited eagerly for its arrival. I started out with high hopes, but soon tired of the redundance and two dimensional characters. Telling the story from the points of view of the three women is a good idea in theory, but didn't lead to the characters being developed in any meaningful way with depth, especially Katherine Howard and Jane Boleyn. Jane spends a good deal of time bemoaning the demise of her husband and denying her role in his conviction and death, while at least half of Katherine's parts deal with her counting how many dresses she has acquired and describing how she is the prettiest girl in court (yes, a la Paris Hilton, but how interesting is that?). Anne of Cleves comes across as a sympathetic character, but I felt like I was beat over the head with the metaphor of her as a gyrfalcon. The multiple descriptions of Henry's rotting leg and passing gas and the \\"miasma\\" of odors under the sheets also got annoying. Uncle Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, is reduced to a Voldemort type villian, with no complexity. There's little explanation of what he stands to gain by having Howard girls on the throne - beyond riches. Surely his quest for personal power could have been explored a little more, as it was in the earlier work. This novel provides few of the historical details and little insight into the social mores of the time that made Mrs. Gregory's previous works so readable and interesting. I was surprised that so many reviewers liked this novel as much as The Other Boleyn Girl. I didn't want want that one to end because I found it so intriguing, but cutting The Boleyn Inheritance by 100 pages or so would have made a better book. Perhaps Mrs. Gregory has exhausted the Tudors and it's time for her to move on to another historical period. Eleanor of Aquitaine, anyone?"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"You can never go wrong reading a Philippa Gregory novel...She is a terrific writer and her books just take me away,rightinto the story that she is telling...I completely lose myself in her books..In fact I have read most of them..They just so exciting.leaving you wondering what in the world will happen next to each character..and you also learn a lot about history,because she researches everything she writes,so you come away with a lovely story and a history lesson..I just love them...Try it if you want a real adventure and some knowledge to boot..."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I mostly like Gregory's books, and I love the genre of historical fiction. Personally, I feel this is her strongest book yet.I learned a lot about King Henry, Anne Boylen, Jane Boylen, Anne of Cleves, and Kitty Howard.The book is told in three points of view that alternate. You get Jane Boylen's pov, Anne of Cleves, and Kitty Howard. This format makes the book fast paced and for me, facinating. All three are differnt, have different personalities, and differnt outcomes with King Henry. King Henry, by the way, was a real whack job, and that comes through loud and clear in this book.If you love history more than fiction, then this book will not like this book, as it is more fiction than history, but for me, it has enough history to make it worthwhile for me. And, at the end, unlike any other Gregory book, she adds some history notes at the end of this book.I felt this was the best of her work, the most facinating, and the best of her work yet. This is a great place to start if you want to find out about her writing."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory has written an intriguing page turner in the Boleyn Inheritance. It is the story of the court of Henry VIII told through the first person narratives of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's sister-in-law. Anne of Cleves is an abused young royal who is anxious to leave for England to get away from her abusive mother and brother. Her lack of knowledge of the mores of the Tudor court, leads her to an unfortunate beginning with husband to be Henry VIII. Katherine Howard is a vapid yet pathetic young woman, used as a pawn by her unscrupulous relatives, in particular the Duke of Norfolk, who in the end betray her. Katherine is the teenage bride of Henry VIII who is ultimately doomed to disgrace and execution. Jane Boleyn is the guilt ridden widow of George Boleyn; she had earlier betrayed George and his sister Anne, helping to expedite their respective guilty verdicts and executions. Jane Boleyn too is used as a pawn, by the shady and unscrupulous Duke of Norfolk. As history knows, Anne of Cleves was the sole survivor of the three, living out her days as the King's \\"sister\\" and being devoted to Henry's children, Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward. Gregory paints the three protagonists as having flaws but sympathetic at the same time. Katherine's and Jane's errors of judgement and being dupes in efect doom them. Anne of Cleves who did fear execution also, survived--she is portrayed as a well meaning young woman who doesn't understand the customs and the language of the English court. This is an excellent book and with the Other Boleyn Girl comprises the best work of Gregory. It is far better than the Constant Princess the book about Katherine of Aragon; I hope Gregory revisits the Tudor court and writes about Jane Seymour and again about Katherine of Aragon, particularly during the time of the King's Great Matter and also emphasizing her relationship with her beloved daughter, Princess Mary."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I am writing this review to encourage potential readers not to be intimidated by this book's subject matter. Even though it is based on historical figures from five hundred years ago, it has an almost modern feel to it. The writing is extremely accessible and each of the three main characters could easily be a modern day woman being oppressed, manipulated or used by someone other than the King of England. And the message, while admittedly feminist in tone, paints a much bigger picture about personal freedom and responsibility.Even though it's been days since i've finished the book, the characters continue to haunt me. Each of the characters are free now and sadly no longer require me as a confidant. If you do read this, I urge you not to judge these characters, but to try to see a little of yourself in them. Even if we live a life with the quiet dignity and grace of Anne of Cleves, there's still a litte Kitty Howard and even Jane Boleyn in all of us.\\"Let's see, what do I have now?\\". This is how Catherine Howard begins many of her journal entries. She is taking account of her material belongings. This book will have you asking the same question of yourself, but on a much deeper level."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Enjoyed this book immensely. Finally, more written on Katherine Howard & Jane Boleyn (Lady Rochford). Lady Rochford finally gets hers in the end after what she did to her husband, George, & sister-in-law Anne Boleyn she deserved what she got. What a scheming wench! Poor Kat Howard was not innocent in the biblical sense, but was an innocent in her mind. Anne of Cleves also starred in this novel; she was the lucky one. She avoided the plots & deception in Henry VIII's court & the madness of Henry himself."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Like a previous reviewer, I too pre-ordered this book and eagerly awaited its arrival. (It fortuitously arrived on my birthday). However, unlike this other reviewer, I was enthralled with the novel from the first page until the very end. I read the last 60 or so pages in a bus waiting area and almost missed my connecting bus because my mind was in the Tower. Brilliantly crafted, this novel is narrated through of the points of view of three different women, all of whom had the courage to do what was ncessary for survival.As someone currently doing research for a novel on an 18th Century Royal, I find Gregory's style of re-creating a century on a page to be masterful. She brings the Court of Henry to life, both in its politics as well as in its humanity. She manages to take a character (Henry VIII)historically despised for his barbaric treatment of his wives and turn him into someone who occasionally could almost be pitied.All Gregory fans should buy this book. It is nothing short of spectacular."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book sneaks up on you...it starts out seeming like light historical fiction, but gradually turns into a compelling and emotional biography of three very important figures in the Henrician saga, who have been sadly overshadowed by their more notorious contemporaries (Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn, Princesses Mary & Elizabeth...).Author Gregory captures the alternating sensuality and madness of the Tudor court, cleverly juxtaposing three first-person narratives taht serve to expertly depict their stories. Page turning entertainment, especially for genre fans."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I stand by my belief that \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is still the best out of all of Philippa Gregory's Tudor historical fiction novels, however, \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" has a special captivating quality all it's own, and it's a fantastic novel for fans of historical fiction.When I first began reading the novel I was a little confused, because it's written a little differently from Gregory's other novels. Instead of following one important historical figure on their journey, this book follows three! Each chapter heading has a name, which tells the reader who's point of view that chapter is told from. The three people the book follows are Anne of Cleves (Henry VIII's German wife after Jane Seymour dies in childbirth), Katherine Howard (Henry VIII's wife after he puts aside Anne of Cleves because he did not like her), and Jane Rochford (George Boleyn's wife and accuser when he was on trial for committing adultery and treason with his sister, Anne Boleyn).Once you get used to the format of the book, and how it jumps around from different viewpoints, it's much easier to read, and very enjoyable because you are able to get a better understanding of these three women and the impact that the Boleyn inheritance of land, wealth, power, and corruption has had on each of them. Each character deals with it in their own way. Anne of Cleves concentrates on her survival. She was forced to survive her brother's tyranny, and then she was forced to find a way to survive King Henry VIII's tyranny. Katherine Howard is nothing but an ignorant child, who doesn't understand the danger she is in when she agreed to become Queen of England, and Henry VIII's fifth wife! She can only concentrate on her own greed and guilty pleasures, never understanding the quagmire of political upheval going on around her. Jane Rochford, on the other hand, sees and understands everything, and is at court in employment to her Uncle, the Duke, who is hell bent on not squandering this second chance at the throne for the Howard and Boleyn family. His ruthless pursuit to raise his family high above all others is legendary, and he uses Jane to help him do it.Manipulation, secrets, forbidden love, betrayal, and fear are all common practices among courtiers in Henry VIII's court. If you can't navigate through the shark infested waters, you will perish without pity, and someone else will step up to take your place. The three women depicted in this novel know that better than anyone.Like most, I absolutely love Philippa Gregory and her Tudor historical fiction novels, and \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" was definitely worth the purchase. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction, and those who are fellow Gregory fans won't be disappointed in this latest work of art."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Reading this novel was, in a phrase - sheer joy. I read it while I was in Israel, mostly during the long bus rides from one city to another, and I tell you: knowing that this story was waiting for me made what could have been the most boring part of my days into eagerly anticipated moments of literary pleasure. The novel takes place in the English courts of Henry VIII, a setting familiar to Gregory fans who have read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" This time, however, she tells the stories of three women: Anne of Cleves (the rejected wife who survived), Jane Boleyn (the cousin who betrayed Anne and George Boleyn) and Catherine Howard (Henry's second-to-last wife). In each chapter Gregory perfectly captures the voice of one of these women, giving life to her hopes, fears and dreams. You feel Anne's determination to escape her controlling German family, and feel sorrow when the happy marriage she imagined brings her nothing but humiliation. You knowingly shake your head when Catherine naively strives to seduce the King, then hold your breath as you watch her tale unravel before your eyes. There are some books that are so good that they leave you feeling torn between the desire to find out what happens and not wanting the story to end. This is one of those books, and I adored it. I only wish I could forget everything that happened so that I could read it all over again. If you are a fan of historical fiction then this is one novel you should definitely add to your collection."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Great book!

I have recommended this book to a couple of my friends and they are looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"As a sequal, the Boleyn Inheritance did fulfill my desire for the story not to end. But it did not top the first book. I felt too much had been skipped over, for instance Henry's marriage to Jane Seymour is glossed over completely. Katherine Howard was not nearly as likeably as Mary Boleyn, nor as savy as Anne Boleyn. I felt the book ended too soon, and should have ended with Henrys death, not Katherines. I do think Gregory has a talent for bringing historical characters to life, to make us think about how their lives must have been in context to the times. I think she is nearly as good as Josephine Tey, and I will look for more books by this author."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I like all of her books.

Arthor's research was amazing!!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Loved this book and the service I received. Would definitely purchase again from this seller."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"It was with great trepidation that I picked up The Boleyn Inheritance by Phileppa Gregory. The Other Boleyn Girl made me angry the first time I read it (long before the movie), being filled with a great number of historical innacuracies which I could not get past. However, after debating about TOBG on a Henry VIII group on myspace, I decided to read the book from the point of view of one who doesn't know the history, and finally I could appreciate Gregory's twisting and ommitting of historical events.In my reading of The Boleyn Inheritance, I have found some history that is untrue. However, I am very much impressed with the three women in the book who are all telling their story from their own first person narrative-- Jane Rochford (the wife of George Boleyn), Anne of Cleves (Henry's fourth wife) and Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife).I kept comparing Gregory's interpretation of Katherine Howard to Jean Plaidy's interpretation of Katherine Howard in the book The Rose without a Thorn. I find this Katherine, if not a more reliable narrator, to be a little bit more real and personable.As for the narrations of Anne of Cleves and Jane Rochford, I'm very glad Gregory decided to include both of these women in her novel, as their part of history is oftem glazed over.All in all I have been excited in my reading of The Boleyn Inheritance. Even though I know what happens (simply because I know the history) it is quite a page turning novel, a novel which has not pissed me off the way The Other Boleyn Girl initially did. Anyone who is a Henry VIII history fan or simply a fan of the book and movie The Other Boleyn Girl will like this newest addition in Phileppa Gregory's repertoire."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book is an interesting contrast and continuation of the story Phillipa Gregory started in The Other Boleyn Girl and The Constant Princess. It tells part of that story from a different viewpoint while also showing how Henry VIII changed as he aged. I was fascinated by her portrayals of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard, two of Henry VIII's wives about which little is known. Also, Gregory paints a very humanizing portrait of Jane Boleyn, the woman who sent Anne and George to their deaths. I am a big fan of Gregory's work, and while this book isn't as much of a page turner as The Other Boleyn Girl and The Virgin's Lover, it fills a void in the continuum of her stories."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a fascinating, and frightening, read. Anne of Cleves has always been an interest of mine, so this book appealed to me because of that, but the portraits of the other two women are just as telling.A note on Gregory's history, though (and the reason I gave the book four stars instead of five): there actually was documentation provided to prove that Anne's betrothal to Francis of Lorraine had been voided, so her annulment from Henry was based on his inability to consummate the marriage."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Easy to read as the story rotates between three major characters - Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Rochford - although the main character running throughout is Henry VIII. Excellent read for anyone interested in the Tudors."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I greatly enjoyed Gregory's previous two Tudor novels, but The Boleyn Inheritance is IMHO her best yet. I was thrilled to see that the story includes Anne of Cleves who has been my favorite of all Henry VIII's six wives ever since I read Margaret Campbell Barnes' novel \\"My Lady of Cleves\\" many many years ago. It is rare to find any fiction written about Anne, and to have it as well done as \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" is even better. Christmas came early for me this year!!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I devoured \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and was so looking forward to \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" only to be severely disappointed. The three person narrative was awkwardly executed and yes, Ms. Gregory would have done well to give us a rich portrait of one of the ladies. I found her voice of Anne of Cleaves the most interesting and wished that Gregory had written it entirely from her view. Jane Boleyn's narrative and some of the dialogue exchanges between her and the Duke read like a bad over the top Spanish TV novella. The most annoying part was the endless repetition of Jane's remorse over the events that happened in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" Much of the book felt like filler, as if the reader was getting banged over the head with the same emotion(I get it already!). I felt like I was reading some V.C. Andrews ghost writer. I wasn't interested in revisting Jane's remorse over and over and I also felt that people that hadn't read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" would miss some of the references. A book should stand on its own with or with out having read the previous.Another complaint is the liberties she has taken with the history. In both books she often makes many characters younger than they should be. Kitty was 19 at the time of her marriage. And many liberties where taken with the Henry-in-disguise meeting Anne, another event that was repeated and mulled over so many times it was incredible.It seems like this book was rushed and the characters and events not fully developed. If you edited out all the repetition this book should have been about 200 pages tops.I don't recommend it. However \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is brilliant."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I love novels like this one and the author's previous works that make me want to learn more about the subject or characters. King Henry VIII is seeking a wife. Anne of Cleves is picked to be his fourth wife. She is welcomed to England as Queen but is ridiculed behind her back for her awkwardness. Anne has skills that were not highly regarded in the Henry's court. Young Katherine Howard captures the king's attention and Anne is quickly turned aside. Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford, is a lady-in-waiting for Queen Anne, and is named head of the Queen's household with Katherine. Katherine is a dutiful wife, beautiful but nave; and falling dangerously in love with someone other than the king. The chapters alternate with each woman telling their stories. The author's inclusive research adds a great sense of authenticity to the novel."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have read other books by this author, and I really like her writing style. I especially liked how this book was a little different in that it told the story from the point of view of 3 different women. Talk about putting yourself in someone elses shoes! It was very entertaining seeing inside the mind set of THREE of the characters in King Henry's court!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really liked 'The Other Boleyn Girl', but I LOVED 'The Boleyn Inheritance'! I read this every chance I got, and finished it in about a week, which is no small task since I also have a 15 month old running around.I think what really made this book so enjoyable for me was Anne of Cleves. She had all the grace and class that Jane and Katharine were lacking. Ms. Gregory did an outstanding job with the very different voices of each woman.Painting Jane as an almost sympathetic character, yet also very mentally ill. Katharine as the silly, young, clueless girl thrust into the heavy shoes of a Queen. And Anne, far wiser then her 24 years, who was the only woman to survive a marriage to Henry VIII.Just as with her previous Boleyn novel, much of this was fabricated. She says herself at the end how little is actually known of Henry's fourth and fifth wives, but the gist of the story is true. What these three women endured in the horribly frightening latter days of Henry's reign was all too real, and this story as she tells it was an absolute pleasure to read. I will definitely be picking up some of her older novels as I just love her ability to absolutely capture your complete attention with her stories."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The timing for my reading of this book was perfect as The Tudors, Season 3, is presently being aired on TV and it covers the same period in history as The Boleyn Inheritance does. Henry's beloved wife Jane Seymour has just died as a result of childbirth and he is encouraged to take another wife.So begins this 6th Philippa Gregory book dealing with the life and many wives of King Henry VIII. This last book in the series takes on his marriages to Ann of Cleves and Katherine Howard. If your memory of what happened with these two wives is scarce, it's probably better because the book then becomes that much more of a page turner. I stayed up until 2:30AM finishing it because I simply could not put it down. I had to know what was going to happen before I went to sleep. With a book like this, it probably wasn't the best idea because it only leads to dreams of The Tower and the \\"axe\\". I say this is the last book in the series but I do not know this definitely because there is still one more wife, Katherine Parr, so perhaps Gregory is going to take us into that marriage as well.This book has three different narrators and each mini chapter is told from their individual voices. We first meet Ann of Cleves as she is hoping to get chosen as Henry's 4th wife. Then there's Katherine Howard, who is hoping to go to court serving the new Queen. Lastly there's Lady Rochford, better known as Jane Boleyn. It was she who was married to Ann Boleyn's brother George and it was her testimony alone that sent him to the scaffold.I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book. Gregory intersperses her own dose of fiction into the already written history about these years in Henry's life. When you think of the time in history you yourself are born into, you can't help but think \\"thank God I wasn't born in England during this period\\". It was such a time of turbulence with an unstable tyrant of a King. I can't even fathom it and, more to the point, I can't even fathom wanting to be his Queen.I guess there's two ways to read this series....either chronologically or the order in which Gregory wrote them. I chose the latter starting with The Other Boleyn Girl and ending with The Boleyn Inheritance. As it turns out, the first and last books written ended up being my two favorites. I guess an argument could be made for reading them either way but I'm happy I did it the way I did. There's nothing better than beginning and ending a series with two \\"great\\" books.So I encourage any lover of historical fiction to read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a great book that combines fact and fiction to make a wonderful story. Be sure to read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" first before reading this book though."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory's \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" picks up three years after the end of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", Gregory's blockbuster novel about Anne Boleyn and her sister Mary. Many of the characters from the earlier novel make a return appearance here, but the story is told from a different perspective--with three narrators, Anne of Cleaves, Kitty Howard, and Jane Boleyn. These three narrators give a very different perspective on Henry VIII's court than is seen in the earlier novel, although all three women are subject to Henry's rapidly changing temper. The court is now one of fear instead of the golden court of the earlier novel, and everyone has to watch her back to keep from getting caught up in the Boleyn Inheritance. As first Anne, and then Kitty become Queen and then quickly fall, the treachery of the English court is explored with all of Gregory's usual detail and intrigue.Although I don't think this book was as good as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" or \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" it is definitely a strong addition to Gregory's \\"Boleyn\\" series. The novel is a fast paced and easy read, and it keeps moving to keep the reader interested. I wished frequently that Gregory would have spent more time getting into the head of each of her characters--sometimes the chapters felt a little rushed. But overall I did feel like this was an enjoyable read that captured the spirit of the Tudor period and life at court.I would recommend this book to fans of the Tudor period or people who enjoyed Gregory's other works."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed this book as much as the Other Boleyn Girl. This is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance is a marvellous story! The characters are so full of life and are superbly detailed. The story has a wonderful flow and the plot twists make you love the book all the more. I felt such a strong sense of loyalty to the new Queen Anne of Cleves and I very much wanted her to succeed on the throne. I was also very intrigued by the beautiful young and naive Katherine who was too immature and dense to realize that she was being manipulated by her betters, to influence and manoeuvre the king to their advantage. Jane is perhaps the most fascinating character in this novel because of the mysteriousness of her past and her absolute determination to rise in importance. She seems to live in a somewhat warped reality, no doubt caused by trauma of her husband's death, for treason. The plot is very intriguing and I enjoyed all the stealthy manoeuvring and arrogance of many of the characters in this story; all vying for attention, riches and importance in a kingdom run by the overbearing tyrant, King Henry. The three main characters in this story are bound together by their connection to the throne of England. Anne, Katherine and Jane all have their duties to see to and family titles to enrich through their skillful work and scheming determination. One woman must spy on the new Queen. Another is involved in a plot to draw the kings attention away from the Queen, to herself. And one woman wants nothing more then to be a good queen to her people and have a happy, peaceful home and kingdom to live in. Either through marriage or blood, they are all a part of the Boleyn family.This entertaining story will pull you in and satisfy your cravings for some mystery and romance, while stuffing you to bursting point with the scandalous delights and terrors of the Royal court.I very highly recommend this book!!(10 out of 10 Diamonds) - Absolutely LOVED it!!2008-2009 Bobbie Crawford-McCoy (Book Reviews By Bobbie).All rights reserved."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance reviewPhilippa Gregory \`s very own version of the Boleyn's and their inheritance, has you on the edge of your seat the entire book. She takes the simple story of the Boleyn's and made it into a magnificent book. Props to Phillipa Gregory!The book took place in the 1500s when king Henry the 8th was the king of England. The story The Boleyn Inheritance, consists of three main characters: Anne of cleaves, Jane Rochford, and Katherine Howard.Anne, who at first is a duchess in cleaves, becomes the queen of England, married to no other than king Henry the 8th. Her sentence of the story is wrong accusations against her and false witnesses.Jane Rochford, a devious woman who sends many to their death by false accusations and witnesses by her. Two of them including her very own husband George Boleyn, but don't stop their! Anne Boleyn was also beheaded because of her. Her guilt is practically eating her alive. Being insane wont keep her from the scaffold though. But at least she has the Boleyn Inheritance with her as she dies.Katherine Howard, first comes to quart as a lady-in-waiting.

The axe is her only friend toward the end of it all.I, personally thought this book was absolutely excellent.

We also meet Jane Boleyn known mostly in history only for her part in seeing her husband George and her sister-in-law Anne go to the scaffolding. We follow the tale from Cleves when Anne is being selected, right on up to the scaffolding and eventually the Kings death, and the whole book will hold you spell bound.I could hardly set this one down, and yet at parts I had to. It is so descriptive and so heart breaking you will cry for the way these women are terribly caught up in this court. Henry VIII truly was a mad man bent on his own whims, his own desires and no one ever dared tell him no, for if they did they could, and would end up dead. Watch as the body counts of those sent to the scaffold tally higher, for small crimes like simply loving a girl. And those who are the true masterminds of the plots get away from the axe man like a slippery snake in the grass.You will shake your head at how stupid and frivolous young Katherine is as a Queen. And yet you will feel utterly horrified for her in the end she was really only a child of 16 years who could not possibly know right from wrong when she only ever did was she was told. I believe in the end the only one I did not feel sorry for was Jane Boleyn, to me she made her own bed. Through pure jealousy, ambition and self preservation, in the end she got what was coming. Though preferably no one should have died because of the whims of a selfish King, who thought he was a god. If you haven't read this book yet, do. You will be emotionally grabbed and riveted to each and every page."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Oh my gosh! I first read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" by Philippa Gregory.

I love books but, since I have ADHD I tend to take forever to get through a book. Not this one though!! I kept reading and reading!! You will not be disappointed with this book.

The thing I most appreciated was that each woman was written in a different voice - you could imagine them speaking to you. Katherine Howard was my favorite - she is well written as a self-obsessed, vain, but naive little girl. This broke up the novel rather well."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Philippa Gregory is an excellent writer, hands down.The book has three different womens points of view: Anne, Katherine and Jane. Two women of whom were King Henry VIII's wives (Anne and Katherine) and the other (Jane) who was a lady in waiting.Jane is as insane as the day is long. She is jealous, manipulative and some what cocky.Anne, is my favorite character in this book. Her innocence draws you in, her kind heart makes you smile and her intelligence is often over looked by many. She's the only wife that survived King Henry VIII ( besides his last wife, who was saved only because of his death ). Anne, a foreigner, marries King Henry VIII and looks forward to being queen. She also befriends his daughter, Princess Mary. After Henry divorces her, she lives in fear that one day he might kill her whether it may be for her religious beliefs or one of the other countless reasons that innocent people died back then.Lastly, there is Katherine. She's a mere 14 years old when she catches the king's eye. A girl that becomes queen after Anne leaves the throne and becomes Henry's fifth wife. The king is almost 50 by this time. She is greedy, immature and thinks only of herself. The king gives her what ever she desires. A short time later, she becomes involved with Thomas Culpepper. The rest, they say, is history.I enjoyed this book immensely. The author is talented beyond words. She gives you a front row seat to all three of the womens lives. You can taste the fear that he put into so many people."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I LOVED this book! One of the best onesI have ever read. The author is fantastic!From this book, I am reading her other books."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I found this book to be a very fantastic read and really enjoyed the story, the characters, and the excitement of it all. This book added to the story line and helps peak the interest of the reader. All of Philippa Gregory books are well written. I find it very interesting to learn about the history of England's king and queens. I have read all of her books in the series except The Other Queen which I did find to be written poorly which is a disappointment that I had to pay for something written this bad. But Other then that book all the others are worth the price. A Must Read"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book is best read after The Other Boleyn Girl. It takes up only a few years after that book. It could be read as a standalone, but I think you get a better introduction to some of the characters by reading the other first.Three very different women come together in this book. Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII's fourth wife. Jane Boleyn, disgraced wife of George Boleyn who was Henry's 2nd wife's brother. Lastly, Katherine Howard, a cousin of the Boleyn's who was Henry VIII's fifth wife. With a troubled homelife, Anne is eager to start anew as Queen of England but soon finds herself at the wrong side of Henry's temper. Grown to a miserable old man, he doesn't like to realize he is gross and unattractive and Anne makes him feel this way. Meanwhile, Katherine loves court and all its intrigues and will do anything to have more pretty things. If this means flirting with a King old enough to be her grandfather, so be it, it can only lead to her advantage. And Jane will guide them both stopping only to think of herself and how it will effect her.I really like how Gregory wrote Anne. I thought it was a very sympathetic description and she was one of the nicest characters I've ever seen in one of Gregory's books. She was just very likable. Katherine on the other hand was a ninny, harmless, but somewhat boring at times. Jane was a bit strange and its hard to like her because of the other books and her actions, but you can pity her easily. By far the most outrageous character of the book was the Duke who played all the Boleyns like pawns; he is truly evil in this series.I like the premise of this book and how it tells the tales of some of the lesser known Queens of Henry. However, I am no historian so that doesn't have any bearing on my enjoyment of the books. This could be different for someone who actually does know European history better than I. I wasn't a big fan of how the book jumped around between the three women's points of view. It just made it so choppy and to be honest, I could have done without Jane's input at all. I liked Anne's input the best and think she should have been the voice of the whole novel. A word of warning to some is that this book doesn't shy away from descriptions of sex, rotting wounds, and other things that may not agree with some. But it does make it very realistic.A good continuance of the series. I look forward to reading more by Gregory.The Boleyn InheritanceCopyright 2006516 pagesReview by M.

Actually I got the audio book version and listened to all 15 cd's during my drive to work every day. Fantastic format with three different narrators (actresses really) taking the part of Joan Boleyn, Anne of Cleves and Kathryn Howard. Delicious delivery; vivid details, great plot device having three narrators - made my miserable commute fly by every day. In fact I had to stop myself from sitting in the driveway and listening to the book. I relished every errand, and every trip to the grocery store.

It's a little hard at first to get into the fact that every chapter changes points of view again, but once I settled into that pattern I plowed through this at lightening speed. It is AMAZING how well P.Gregory can become three people who are so incredibly different from one another and still play each of them as if she isn't \\"playing\\" at all. Her transitional skills are hard to beat. I was utterly convinced she'd tapped into the humanity and heart of each woman and she made me love each one, while not covering up their faults at all. Jane is even more dispicable than one would assume from reading the history, and still I felt sadness at her death. Katherine's silly shallowness and all-too-short life broke my heart, and Anne had me cheering for her own wisdom and courage.This book is a keeper and one to recommend.

I've read just about all of Gregory's books and my favorite was still The Other Boleyn Girl. However, this one now wins hands down."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This was my very first Philippa Gregory novel & although it is set to be an indirect sequel to The Other Boleyn Girl and the Constant Princess, I had no trouble reading it as a novel that stands by its own.I know that some readers who are not familiar with the story of Henry VIII and his six wives may find this book quite confusing if they read it without reading the previous two but even if you had a general knowledge of the story, You'll understand this book quite easily.The Book talks about the lives of three women (Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard (Ketty Howard) and Jane Rochford (Jane Boleyn) who was Anne Boleyn's sister in-law. The novel is said in the Point of view of each of the three women. And although there is a constant switch in the narration between those three, it made the book quite interesting instead of confusing as some people may think. There is no third person here, the story is told by those three women as narrators each of them by her own point of view.It took me a long time to read this novel, 10 days almost I don't usually take that much time to read a novel especially with less than 600 pages but the switching between the three women made me slow down but its simply because I'm not used to this type of narrations.Regardless it was a good book, a good read I liked the fact that even if Philippa Gregory took some liberties in forming the thoughts of those three women she kept the accuracy in her work. The Only thing that I had a problem with was Katherine Howard's age in this novel the author made her to appear as a 14 year old maid when she served in the court of Anne Of Cleves, which made her 15 when she became Queen and 16 when she died. I know that Katherine's real age was unknown but it is set to be that she was anywhere from 17-21 when she was beheaded. However despite the fact that the author had made Katherine very young in this novel, it wasn't much of a big issue because it suited the novel very well and it also suited Katherine's personality.You may get confused by all the switching back and forth between the three ladies but its an enjoyable read and it really gives you a good look at the court of Henry VIII."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The strongest points of this book were the convincing, fascinating characters, and the fact that we saw a different portrait of this particular period in history from their points of view. Gregory meant to flesh out both Catherine Howard and Anne of Cleves, and she really succeeded at this. We also get a more complex perspective on Henry Tudor. As a result, we feel the drama, the tension, and the danger of the events here, and this version of events really does make the most sense given the historical facts as we know them.The weakest point, though, is the characterization of Jane Boleyn. I think that the author is too content to just make her into the horrible villainness of the piece, which is the same thing that history has actually done. Julia Fox's very detailed biography shows through recently available documents that Jane wasn't the monster she's been made out to be and probably wasn't at fault for most of what she's traditionally been blamed for (her husband George's death along with Anne, Catherine Howard's betrayal, etc.)The problem I have is that Gregory makes a point of saying at the end of this book that \\"the character of Jane is drawn from history... few novelists would dare to invent such a horror as she seems to have been.\\" Well, no; the traditional character of Jane Boleyn is *exactly* the kind of character that does get invented as a scapegoat. Everything got blamed on her. And if Gregory is going to go on and on about how \\"women have to be free, and a key to their freedom is how they are perceived\\", then she knows better than to join in with the chorus of the historical scapegoating of Jane Boleyn. For example, Bertrice Small's *Love, Remember Me*, went over the same ground (of Henry Tudor, Anne of Cleves, and Catherine Howard.) While it was a far inferior book otherwise, it had a much more complex and interesting portrait of Jane Boleyn. She was portrayed as having been tricked into giving testimony against her husband George (which is probably much closer to what actually happened), and as waiting for her chance to get revenge on the king, which was why she covered up for Catherine's affair with Tom Culpeper when she had to know how dangerous it was for her to do so. When it didn't work out as she'd planned, she went mad. Truthfully, I think that there needs to be an entire historical novel concentrating only on Jane Boleyn, because there hasn't been one yet.So basically, that's the only real problem with this book, and although it's a very good book otherwise, it did bother me. Gregory does such a good job with all the other aspects that it's hard to see her drop the ball so thoroughly with Jane Boleyn."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"During my vacation I have read both \\"The Constant Princess\\" and \\"The Boelyn Inheritance\\". The former, while good, tended to drag a bit in my opinion. On the other hand, I could not put \\"The Boelyn Inheritance\\" down! Gregory does a great job of making you feel invested in these people. Although as history teacher I knew what Katherine Howard's fate was, I still found myself in tears when she met her death. You really felt sorry for this girl whose only fault was wanting to be able to act her age and love the man of her choice. On the other hand, it was great to see Anne of Cleves create a new life for herself away from her brother and King Henry. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of good historical fiction!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"...one died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded. So goes an old English children's rhyme about one of history's most famous monarchs, and Philippa Gregory follows up her account of the tortured life and death of Anne Boleyn with a fascinating tale of three women who impacted on Henry's life afterwards, two directly and one tangentially: his fourth and fifth wives, the least known of the six, and his ex-sister-in-law and Anne's nemesis, Jane Boleyn.The story recounts the period between 1539 and 1542, opening at the death of Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, who died tragically of childbed complications following the birth of Henry's only living son, Edward VI. Henry is urged to marry again for political reasons, to form an alliance with the duchy of Cleves against the threatened alliance of France and Spain. His choice is Anne of Cleves, a shy, retiring young woman who has been derided in the history books as looking like the north end of a southbound horse. Actually, Anne didn't look that bad at all, if her portrait is anywhere near accurate. Gregory says that Anne welcomed the marriage as a way out of an unhappy and abusive home life. But she puts a fascinating -- and who knows, maybe true -- spin on the tale by speculating that it was Anne who was turned off by Henry, who was by then no longer the handsome young king who had married Katherine of Arag&oacute;n and Anne Boleyn, but a fat, gross, middle-aged monarch, reeking from a suppurating open sore on his leg, and Henry was so affected by Anne of Cleve's repulsion -- probably seeing himself for the first time as other people saw him and appalled at the picture -- that he was unable to consummate the marriage. After only a few months Anne is packed off to live by herself after wisely agreeing to a generous divorce settlement, and had sense enough to keep a low profile during the subsequent years until Henry's death left her a rich and independent woman.Free of Anne, Henry turns his attention to Katherine Howard, a fifteen-year-old airhead whose sole virtues were her extreme youth and a very pretty face. Poor Katherine is overwhelmed by the prospect of being Queen and having as many pretty dresses as she wants, and for a time she tries to be a good wife to Henry, but it's not easy, as he's older, fatter, smellier, and all Katherine really wants is to be able to love a young man nearer her own age. She is helped to fulfill her wish by Jane Boleyn, one of history's most reviled (perhaps rightfully, perhaps not), and actually least known characters.As presented by Gregory, Jane Boleyn is a spiteful, bitter harpy whose sole motive in lying about an incestuous relationship between her husband George Boleyn and his sister Anne Boleyn, which got them both sent to the execution block, was jealousy. Jane Boleyn takes a seemingly motherly interest in young Katherine and encourages her to take young lovers behind the King's back. Why in the world she did this, knowing how Henry would react, especially considering the danger to her if Henry even suspected her complicity, is anyone's guess. It's possible that Jane Boleyn simply felt she belonged in the center of the action, instead of being relegated to the sidelines as she felt she had been by George and Anne Boleyn, and she got considerably more than she bargained for.Gregory weaves her tale by alternating chapters narrated by Anne of Cleves, Katherine, and Jane Boleyn, and does it so well that you never lose track of any of the three plot lines. Anne of Cleves was more or less in the background after Henry cast her off, but her life was never secure as long as Henry lived, as he grew more suspicious, vengeful and cruel with each passing year. She must have lived on tenterhooks until his death, never knowing if someone would come knocking on her door in the middle of the night to haul her off to the Tower. Katherine narrates the rise and fall of her fortunes like the superficial airhead she is, listing the growing or declining number of her dresses and jewels, unable to understand why everybody is making such a fuss over her dalliance with a younger man. And Jane Boleyn becomes more and more unwrapped as she finds herself trapped in a mess largely of her own making, used and discarded with equal contempt by her uncle Thomas Howard, the third Duke of Norfolk, whose personal and family ambitions managed to wreck several lives before he himself was arrested by Henry on a charge of treason.Gregory has given us a fascinating, well-written tale of three unforgettable women. This book is definitely her best one to date.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book was amazing, loved it more then The Other Boleyn Girl. It may have been the three POVs that made it better or the fact these women could be so different from each other but almost want the same thing or that they were more, more something that Mary Boleyn's great story was not. Even knowing before reading this how history played out there was something about this book that couldn't put down until I was done. Of course there are inaccuracies between this book and history but that's why it's fiction people. Unless it's in a diary no one really knows what anyone from back then was thinking but reading an opinion about what might have lead to the events from then is just so exciting. I almost didn't want the book to end because it was great seeing into that world (despite really disliking kind Henry and some of his men and advisers) and what people might have been thinking."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"THE BOLEYN INHERITANCE is in some ways a follow up to The Other Boleyn Girl, Philippa Gregory's most renowned novel to date, but this striking retelling of the Tudor court after Anne Boleyn could easily stand on its own.The Boleyn Inheritance is the story of three women: Jane Boleyn, the widowed Lady Rochford; Anne of Cleves, the fourth wife of Henry VII; and Katherine Howard, his fifth wife and second to be executed. While most history buffs will know the story, Gregory has done the remarkable by breathing life into all three of these real historical figures. Each of the three has their own distinct personality, and even if Gregory had not informed you of whose turn it was to narrate, you have been able to figure it out based on their unique literary voice. As it was, I enjoyed the roving point of view, especially when it was Jane's turn. Jane is not someone who is beloved by history, but Gregory made her seem more human than I've ever read her.Katherine's narration was also a pleasant surprise. It made me feel even worse for her at the end because she was shown to be truly a child, someone far too young to be Queen of England, much less Henry VIII's wife. Her naivete is shown in a mixture of the brainless things she sometimes says and the soft bent of her thoughts, relatively an innocent compared with other courtiers. She doesn't realize until it is too late that no one can be trusted in Henry's court.This story is never boring and readers will be immediately struck by the color Gregory brings to known historical events, not sacrificing accuracy for style, but having them both in equal measure. Truly a delight to read. You won't want this book to end."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The thing is, this was so obviously a sequel. There were so many mentions of previous queens, of better queens, of the good old days, and of \\"back when Henry was a golden prince and not a fat blob\\" that eventually I felt bounded over the head by the redundancy. It isn't Philippa Gregory's fault that history repeats itself, but when you're the fourth and fifth queens and you end up exactly the same way the first and second did, albeit with a lot less pomp and intrigue, it's hard to come up with anything fresh to say.From the perspectives of three different women, we got, \\"Oh lord, I hope this doesn't end up the same way it did last time\\". This left me with a vague sense of impending doom that loomed over the book like a dark cloud, because, of course, we all know that things never end well for the wives of King Henry VIII. The difference here is that now the wives know it too.This said, I didn't totally dislike the book. The short, crisp chapters from alternating viewpoints worked for me, because as soon as my attention span was starting to droop the narrative moved on to something else. I've always been a fan of novels in the first person, and this was no exception. Although there is no denying that the characters were somewhat two-dimensional, I still felt sympathy towards them and found myself hoping in spite of myself that somehow things would, impossibly, work out for them.As far as disliked characters, I had the most trouble with Jane, whom I normally feel bad for in novels. If I, a sympathizer, found her constant moping about George irritating, I can only imagine what it did to everyone else. Remorse would have been fine, but a blatant denial that she was ever guilty in the first place, even if she was only using this lie to make herself feel better, seemed enormously ridiculous to me, and more than a little annoying as well.In summary, I felt that The Boleyn Inheritance was a good book for what it was. Its downfall was that, as a historical novel, it was obligated to recount the events of history. They may be horrendous and depressing, but they are by no means new to us in this day and age where the Tudor era has become so popular. Henry may have been insane, but unfortunately for the modern reader the self-absorbed brat wasn't very creative. So, I think that perhaps it's time for Philippa Gregory to turn her often ingenious eye to a different era of history."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is Philippa Gregory's best novel yet! Not many writers would bother to go so deep into the lives of the women who changed the course of history. In a time when women were thought of as inferior and bothersome, Gregory opens the eyes of the reader and makes them realize that without Kathrine of Aragon, or Anne Boleyn, or Jane Seymour, or Anne of Cleves, or Katherine Howard, or Katherine Parr, Henry VIII would not be remembered as he is now. He would not be that infamous king who tore his own country apart for the lust of a woman. It was the women in his life that made him famous(and the same goes for many other men in history). That's what I like about Gregory, she makes these people real, she turns them back into flesh and blood before our eyes. She makes them laugh, love, and cry. She gives them humanity. This is not just another one of her fantastic triumphs as a writer, but full proof of her knowledge of the human nature."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory continues to entertain and beguile with this latest entry to her Tudor-era historical novels, \\"The Boleyn Inheritance.\\" This time around, she focuses on the tumultuous events that take place (1539-1542) following Jane Seymour's death in childbed, when Henry VIII decides to marry again, only this time he has decided to make a political alliance with the Protestant kingdom of Cleves in order to check the threatening Catholic alliance of France and Spain. \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" concentrates on what occurs because of this decision, as seen through the eyes of three of the women most effected by the events -- Anne of Cleves, the Protestant princess that Henry marries; Katherine Howard, the vivacious and lively young English beauty that Henry falls for; and Jane Boleyn, the widow of George Boleyn, whose testimony sent her husband and her infamous sister-in-law, Anne Boleyn, Henry's second wife, to the execution block. Believe me, if you're in on the lookout for a well written and absorbing page turner, \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" will definitely satisfy.In 1539, Anne of Cleves, prepares herself for marriage to one of the most powerful men in Europe, Henry VIII of England, who has already been married three times -- once to Catherine of Aragon, whom he divorced and broke from the Catholic Church in order to marry the tempestuous and beguiling Anne Boleyn, whom he later beheaded on the suspicion that she was playing him false, and lastly to Jane Seymour who gave him the son he so devoutly wished for before expiring herself. It is not exactly the kind of marriage that most princesses would dream of, but then Anne's situation at home is hardly an ideal one. How was Anne to know that she had exchanged the firing pan for the fire? For once in England, she finds herself alone, without a proper understanding of the English language or the customs; and worse, that her new husband, Henry, dislikes her at first sight, and immediately makes his disdain known. It also soon becomes evident that Henry has taken a liking to one of her ladies in-waiting, the beautiful and vivacious Katherine Howard, and that the old monster is looking for a way out of his unwanted marriage to Anne. Has Anne come all the way to England only to face the threat of the axe like the previous Queen Anne? With few friends, and practically no one to rely on, Anne will need all her wits and a lot of luck in order to keep her neck and her good name intact...Philippa Gregory doesn't exactly cover new ground here -- \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" covers much of the same ground that many casual historians are familiar with. What a brilliant idea then to make one of the chief protagonists of this novel, Jane Boleyn, a woman who has been reviled for her part in sending her husband and her sister-in-law to the execution block! And what a good notion it was to show all the backroom intrigues of the Duke of Norfolk, et al in their quest for the upper hand as seen through Jane's eyes. It added an air of immediacy, danger and poignancy that might have otherwise been absent if we'd been left with a one person point-of-view. The plotting was well done -- even and with a sense of continuity that made for smooth reading, and the juxtaposition of the three narratives was not jarring at all. Also brilliantly done was the character portrayals of the three women and of the monstrous Henry. I'll admit to being quite partial to Anne of Cleves, and so was really pleased that Philippa Gregory portrayed her as possessing courage, tenacity and intelligence. I also appreciated the author's portrayal of the heedless, pleasure seeking Katherine Howard, and surprisingly enough, found myself feeling for Jane Boleyn, and appreciating her ability to navigate the treacherous court she so ardently wanted to be part of. In all, this was a well written, very fast paced and tightly constructed novel that was a joy to read from beginning to end. Just the thing for a good winter night's read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having not merely read but absolutely DEVOUREDThe Other Boleyn Girl, I was eager to read more from Ms. Gregory, and I decided to go in chronological order by history, rather than publication order. Thus, this book came next.I suppose it's fair to say that I liked \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" so much that in all honesty, anything coming after it would have little chance of living up to my massive expectations. I wanted another book that both informed and transported me, another invigorating read that made me forget the world around me and sucked me into a world I had scarcely ever imagined. But unfortunately, that simply never happened with this second foray into Ms. Gregory's meticulously researched world. Throughout this book, I was never able to lose sight of the fact that I was reading about people Ms. Gregory never actually knew personally. I never had that feeling reading \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". In that book, she always made me feel as if I was reading about real, living, breathing people -- not just historical figures being recreated on a page.In Gregory's defense, there is not a lot known about the private lives of the three women she tries so hard to bring to life here. (She explains as much in author's note at the end of the book, in a move a more cynical reader might call covering her rear end.) So she had little to draw on, and perhaps she should not be faulted if her characters come off as a little flat, simply because she was unwilling to substitute juicier details for scant facts. However, it must be said that she compounds the problem by splitting her narrative into three parts. Instead of giving us a full, rich portrait of one woman, she chooses to give us a pale sketch of three.The first woman is Anne of Cleves, King Henry VIII's fourth wife, and the first one who managed to outlive him. She comes from Lutheran Germany as part of an arranged marriage and a package deal -- her hand in holy matrimony for her brother, the Duke of Cleves' word that he'll align with Henry against his Papist enemies. Unfortunately for Anne, she has two strikes against her before her marriage can even begin. For one thing, as soon as Henry meets her, he decides that he doesn't like her. Ms. Gregory's imagining of what went wrong during this first meeting to engender such instant spite from the King is ingenious, and I'd bet dollars to donuts that what she imagined is pretty close to what actually happened. Second, the great nations of France, Spain and England at that time were like schoolgirls on a playground in the way they constantly changed allegiances and teamed up against one another. In the month or so it took Anne to get from Germany to England, many of Henry's advisors had already convinced him that he no longer needed the partnership with Cleves. Her marriage to Henry lasted barely six months, so a book solely about her would have been a slim volume indeed. She starts off as a fairly interesting character, but after she loses Queenship Anne's narrative becomes dull, and most of her passages are obviously just breaks from the actual story that's happening with the second Queen Katherine, at court.Katherine Howard is one of the weaker elements of the book. She's a paper-thin creation, characterized only by youth, beauty and simplicity of mind. Unsurprisingly, this gets very repetitive very quickly. She is guided by her uncle, the same sinister Duke of Norfolk who stood as a shadowy, controlling figure in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". Unfortunately, his appearances in this book lack the same threat and menace that he had before, and even he stands diminished in this new tome. Also diminished is the character of King Henry VIII himself. In \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", I understood him more as a person, and could clearly see his motivations through the eyes and actions of the characters around him. In this book, the people around him simply settle for constantly referring to him as \\"mad\\" or \\"a monster\\", and little explanation is given for how exactly he got that way, except for old age and the wound in his leg.The most diminished of all, however, is Jane Boleyn. When she chose to make Jane a protagonist and tried to humanize her, Ms. Gregory took a humongous risk, and I do not believe that it paid off. When she's not busy trying to lead yet another queen to the scaffold, she endlessly moans about her lost husband -- a man SHE helped condemn to death in the first place. Reading her endless whining and moping about how much she loved George and Anne Boleyn highlights one of the books most dismaying flaws: its repetitiveness. The characters repeat the same things over and over again, sometimes within the same paragraph! As the book goes on (and on) it becomes more and more painfully obvious that it's been deliberately fluffed up with filler, since there was so little content to be had here. I wish Ms. Gregory and her editors had simply settled for having a shorter book. After all, there's no rule that says your book will be taken less seriously if it's less than 400 pages, is there? Let's hope not -- the repetion was so bad that in some places, I honestly started to think that maybe Phillippa Gregory didn't write this entire book.On the whole, I wasn't SO disappointed with this book that I'll stop reading Ms. Gregory's books, but I have to admit that I've lowered her pedastal a few feet. And I'll keep reading the other books in this series in hopes that at least one other will match the brilliance of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I'm always up for another round with Henry VIII and his wives, so I put myself on the library waiting list for The Boleyn Inheritance.And I'm pleased to report that I enjoyed it immensely.The Boleyn Inheritance is told by Jane, Lady Rochford, widow of the executed George Boleyn; Anne of Cleves; and Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Howard. Jane, self-justifying and self-deceiving, is obsessed with her past yet determined to do whatever she has to do in order to restore her life to its former glamour. Anne, no stupid Flanders mare but a sensible, honorable young woman who longs for freedom and respect, finds that she has exchanged the humiliations of her brother's court for the reign of terror of Henry's. Kitty is an airheaded teenager, with an endless capacity to push aside unpleasant realities in favor of her more satisfying interests: young men, jewels, and pretty clothes. Manipulating Jane and Kitty is the sinister Duke of Norfolk, and stalking through all three women's lives is the unpredictable, increasingly tyrannical Henry VIII.Gregory juggles the heroines' stories masterfully. Even when Anne of Cleves is relegated to the background and the machinations of the Duke of Norfolk and Jane take center stage, Anne remains to comment on what she sees around her. She, the outsider, becomes both the moral center of the novel and the narrator on which the reader can most rely for an accurate perception of events. Kitty's adolescent preoccupations and mercurial character are captured wonderfully, while Jane, morally repulsive as she is, has a normalcy about her that keeps us reading her story and wondering at her motivations.There's a certain humor here, often quite dark, that was missing altogether in the very earnest Constant Princess. Much of this comes from Kitty's youthful blatherings (\\"France would be wonderful, except I cannot speak French, or at any rate only \\"voila!\\" but surely they must mostly all speak English? And if not, then they can learn?\\"), but the more cynical Jane Rochford contributes some memorable lines: \\"If she declares herself Dereham's wife, then she has not then cuckolded the king but only Dereham; and since his head is on London Bridge, he is in no position to complain.\\"And neither am I. Read this one."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"In what may be her finest work, historical fiction novelist Philippa Gregory (who loves the Tudor era at least as much as I do) returns to Henry VIII and his complicated lifestyle with \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\". It is here she finds her voice and a better editor to create the court and the women who compelled it after the death of Jane Seymour, Henry's third wife.In 1998, in his book \\"The Hours\\", author Michael Cunningham created a book with three voices, all heroines, in different eras. The characters were brilliantly brought to the screen (in a film that was devastatingly long and depressing) and captured an Academy award for Nicole Kidman and some serious applause for co-stars Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris. The writing tool, that of three points of feminine view, has been used many times since then; one memory is the delicious\\"Mrs. Kimble\\" by Jennifer Haigh in 2003 where the convention was spiced up in that the three women who tell the tale were all wives of the infamous Mr. Kimble.Gregory has used that device here, and it has improved the story immensely. She chooses to tell the story from the viewpoint of three unlikely and very different women, who were brought together in one place and one time by the demands of the difficult Henry. Anne of Cleves, the young German noble who became Henry's 4th wife, Jane Boleyn, the Lady Rochford who was featured in Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and Katherine Howard, the poor teenaged girl who enchanted Henry and became his 5th wife, all see the times from different viewpoints. All three captivate in Gregory's novel.You will come away respecting the acts of Anne of Cleves, and by being alternately annoyed and captivated by Kitty Howard (and sad at her horrible demise).But the true genius of Gregory's novel is the third point of view. I hated Jane Parker Boleyn in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" for being a vapid, stupid pawn. Jane betrayed her husband, Anne Boleyn's brother, George, and gave the evidence that caused both Anne and George to be killed. In this book, we see how Jane herself is played as a pawn of the Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Jane understands and hates her betrayal but tries to save her own life, her fortune, and to ultimately try to convince her uncle to find her a future mate. In return, she spies for him, and does his bidding with a variety of machinations she accomplishes in the background, as a lady in waiting to first Anne and then Katherine. And although both see her for what she is, both are compelled to trust her and heed her advice.Late in the book, when confronted with her true nature by the Duke, in a scene so full of verbal brutality that it difficult to read, Jane nevertheless hatches a plan to save herself.Seeing Anne and Kitty through Jane's eyes, (and vice versa) and seeing Henry's evil nature and utter power from the viewpoint of all three women; feeling their fear of death whether they have or have not been true to the crown, leaves you with a powerful sense of actually witnessing events.It's a powerful work of historical fiction, one that I can highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a must for lovers of reading anything and everything Tudor. A fascinating look at two of Henry's little known queens, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. This book might be difficult to get into at first if you have no prior knowledge of Henry VIII and his wives, but it's worth sticking with it.I loved the way the author told the story from the viewpoint of Anne, Katherine and Jane Boleyn (who was married to George Bolyen, the first Anne's brother). The characters were brilliantly portrayed and came alive before my eyes. Anne, just trying to stay alive in a court riddled with intrigue, Jane scheming with her uncle to put another Howard on the throne, and Katherine (LOL) the not too bright but very beautiful 15 year old who just wanted to look pretty and have pretty things and be admired by handsome men. There were times I was laughing out loud at Kitty's comments, and the chapters that repeatedly started with another accounting of \\"what do I have now?\\", as she counted her jewels and clothes.Through these three women we see Anne and Kitty caught up in something they are helpless to stop, Henry's lusting after young Kitty and his determination to put Anne aside at any cost to have Kitty. Most fascinating of all is the way Henry is portrayed through all three women, and he is terrifying indeed. An absolute ruler, with complete power over all around him and mad as a hatter. And wonderful to see that of all of them, Anne was able to come through the terror unscathed and a free, independent woman.Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Anne of Cleves. Katherine Howard. Jane Rochford. These three women share an inheritance born of deceit and political ambition, cast upon a stage with monarch Henry VIII, a man who has deluded himself into believing he is the direct recipient of God's word. By the time Henry has given Anne Boleyn over to the court for execution, he is infected with a persistent madness that touches all those around him. Advised by the Duke of Norfolk, who raised two Howard women to the throne of England only to see them die and the pliant inquisitors who do the king's bidding, Henry has become a terror: \\"He is a danger... be warned.\\" In this fascinating novel, Gregory reveals the inner lives of Anne, Katherine and Jane, their dreams and terrors, interpreting their lives from a female perspective and their place in history, ever at the mercy of powerful men.Not long after Jane Seymour dies in childbirth, Henry arranges a marriage with Anne of Cleves in 1539. Anne arrives at court unable to speak any language but German; her lack of communication causes a faux pas that costs her Henry's enmity for the duration of their marriage and nearly her life. Fortunately for Anne, Henry is anxious to put her aside to wed Katherine Howard, a fifteen-year-old in the queen's entourage who takes his fancy, allowing the aging king to imagine his youthful manhood reinvigorated. Katherine is clearly a fool, but ignorant of the dangers of court life, falling into a trap of the Howard's making, left to fend for herself when the king turns against her. Lady-in-waiting to both queens, Jane Rochford, wife of George Boleyn and sister-in-law of Anne, gave evidence against brother and sister, thereby saving her own head in lieu of theirs. A convenient and loyal pawn of the Duke of Norfolk, Jane does his bidding in an attempt to secure her future no matter the cost to the queens she serves.Anne is stolid, Germanic in temperament and not pleasing to Henry, yet the most fortunate, her stodgy ways separating her from Henry's wrath once he has put her aside as wife. When he desires Katherine, Anne is only worried for the girl's lack of common sense. Jane Rochford is the most challenging in her self-delusion and easy complicity with the Duke's plans, rationalizing her behavior, resisting to the end the shame of her existence. In the voices of Anne, Katherine and Jane, the story spins out over a few years, the court out of control under Henry's truculence and ill-temper, the country in thrall to the whims of a madman. By the time Katherine is beheaded, the women have played their parts, puppets of a megalomaniac and his minions. In this chilling account of life in Henry's court, betrayal abounds, the days harrowing as Jane, Anne and Katherine scramble for security. As hardy, brave and complex as any of their counselors, paramours or agents, Gregory's female characters are infinitely compelling, rising from the pages of history to claim their own inheritance. Luan Gaines/2006."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"If (like me) you loved \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" but found \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" ridiculous and \\"The Constant Princess\\" dull, Philippa Gregory's latest book is good news indeed. It marks a return to what made the first two of her Tudor books so irresistible: believable characters you enjoy spending time with and with whom you sympathize, sometimes in spite of yourself.Gregory uses three narrators: Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn, and presents them without bearing judgment on them. Anne of Cleves is a particularly well-rounded character, and even though you know her fate, the twists of her storyline keeps you turning the pages (well past bedtime, in my case). The writing is smooth without being slick, descriptive without being cumbersome.I have just two quibbles: The voices of Anne and Jane are very similar, and the course of events that hardened Henry's heart against Katherine are skimmed over. But all in all it's great to be able to recommend one of Gregory's novels again!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"\\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" is a fine historical novel. Philippa Gregory, the author, uses an interesting narrative device to tell the story of two of Henry VIII's queens, Anne of Cleves and the clueless and luckless Catherine Howard. The story is told in brief vignettes from the eyes of three women--Anne of Cleves, Catherine Howard, and Jane Boleyn.Boleyn is a master of treachery. She had consigned her husband and sister-in-law, Anne Boleyn, to death by her testimony against them. In the process, she protected, in her mind, \\"the Boleyn Inheritance.\\" In this volume, she serves both queens as a part of their staff.Each of the three characters provides some light on the ongoing narrative of Henry's inability to produce more sons. Henry is displeased with Anne when she does not recognize him and responds in horror at his advances toward her; Catherine Howard is portrayed as something of a self-absorbed dimwit, who cares for herself and little more.High politics leads the Duke of Norfolk to work with Jane Boleyn to make \\"Kitty\\" Howard queen at sixteen years of age. Anne escapes with her life in the process, to serve as the \\"King's sister.\\" Katherine is not so lucky, as she falls in love with someone other than her huband, Henry VIII. In the end, her foolishness and poor choice of staff doom her. And, in the process, Jane Boleyn as well.Altogether, the novel's device of a story told through the eyes of three different people works pretty well. This is a very readable book and provides a flavor for life in England under a miserable, rapidly aging king who is a tyrant. For those interested in historical fiction, this is well worth looking at."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory fans have much to celebrate.In this latest installation of The Other Boleyn Girl series, Ms Gregory, today's supreme diva of historical literature, crafts a magnificent rendition of the lives of Anne of Cleves, Lady Rochford (Jane Boleyn), and Katherine Howard with her trademark mesmeric and empathic story telling ability.It is 1539. England is held in submission by a tyrannical and aging monarch of increasingly aberrant behavior. As Henry VIII descends into madness and pain, it becomes impossible to predict how or by whom he will be offended. The consequences are mortal: death by decapitation or worse. The wife killer seeks a bride, and political machinations by Henry's courtiers and the Bavarian Duke of Cleves lead to an arranged marriage with the Duke's sister Anne. She arrives hopeful, dutiful, and eager to begin a new life away from her virtual prison on her brother's estate. She aspires to be a good queen, and an asset to her people. To her shock she enters a world more frightening and occult than she imagined possible. The duplicitous and insane Lady Rochford, head of Anne's privy chamber, is the sinister pawn of the evil Duke of Norfolk, and together these two reptilian allies scheme to oust Anne and install Katherine Howard as the queen.Told in three distinct voices, we watch as the terrifying events unfold. The suspense builds, and is not diminished by the fact that the reader likely already knows from their history lessons how the story will end. Anne is the true victor; the one who survives the lunacy to live a semi-independent life in the country. Her story is at once poignant and magnificent. Katherine Howard is clever but fatally naive, and reminds one of a sixteenth century Paris Hilton style party girl. Lady Rochford begins the story as predatory, and ends as... well I'll let you read that for yourself. Gregory's artistic license is well employed.I can hardly wait for the next book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"\\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" picks up right where \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" left off. This novel focuses on two more of Henry VIII's unlucky wives: Anne of Cleves, the German woman hand-picked by Henry himself and whose disastrous first encounter with the king dooms her reign before it even begins; and Katherine Howard, a beautiful but rather stupid young girl of 15 who is ordered by her family to cause the much-older King Henry to fall in love with her.Although this book isn't quite as good as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" (and really, how could it be?), I enjoyed it very much. Author Philippa Gregory tells the story from three opposing points of view: Anne, Katherine, and none other than Jane Boleyn, who manages to wiggle her way back to court after condemning her brother and sister-in-law to death. The multiple narrators offer a variety of perspectives on life at court during this fragile period of time. I enjoyed the chapters narrated by Katherine most of all: her vanity and ignorance are apparent in every word, making everything she says and does laugh-out-loud hilarious, which makes the tragic ending of this book all the more painful.I enjoyed \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" immensely. It's a rather long book, but I devoured it in just a couple of days. If you enjoy historical fiction and are a fan of Gregory's other work, you should definitely pick up a copy of this book."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and loved it. I then listened to \\"The Queen's Fool\\" and now \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" on audio disc. I would have to say I enjoyed \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" the most of all three, perhaps because of the fantastic performances of the three women who perform it on audio. Philippa Gregory writes fascinating literature, and the performances of these women added even more drama, intrigue, and humor to her writing.I particularly enjoyed the performance of the woman who played Catherine. But I was fascinated by the way the character of Jane Boleyn was written. She is portrayed somewhat sympathetically, yet all along I was thinking that she's completely out of touch with reality (based on her actions in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"). I definitely felt that I was dropped right into the psyche of each of these women.Highly recommend both the content and the audio performances."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"In The Boleyn Inheritance, Phillipa Gregory takes a unique and thoughtful approach in her characterization of these lesser known figures from Henry VIII's throughly examined life. The story is told from the viewpoint of three women all trying to survive in the harsh and unforgiving environment of a tyrannical madman's world. An interesting perspective. The three separately reveal their thoughts, motivations and ambitions during the time following Anne Boleyn's death and leading up to the execution of Henry's fifth wife, Katherine Howard. The author does a very credible job in imagining what must be going through the minds of Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn and Katherine Howard while their lives are in Henry's hands. I've read a lot of fiction set in Tudor England as well as nonfiction and I always enjoy Phillipa Gregory's books."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Through the viewpoints of Jane Boleyn, widow of George, of Anne of Cleves and of Catherine Howard we view the court of an ageing Henry VIII.Jane Boleyn is a survivor - at any cost. Her viewpoint gives us a clear view of the ugly side of court politics, of dynastic struggles for influence over Henry VIII and potentially for more direct influence over the monarchy once the King is dead.Anne of Cleves gives us a firsthand view of the trading between countries in marriage partners. By becoming the only wife of Henry VIII to exit marriage without losing her life, her influence thereafter is benign. Her viewpoint, as portrayed in the novel, is invaluable in providing an insider view which is less emotionally coloured than the views of Jane and Catherine.Catherine Howard - portrayed as a foolish young woman. A victim of the dynastic politics of her own mendacious family as much as of her own inability to see or plan beyond today.And, in the background, an ailing King who has not come to terms with the consequences of age, who is desperate to add princes to the line of succession, who is ambivalent about reforming the Church and who needs to be surrounded by beauty.The combination of viewpoints in this book works well. The characterisations fit, reasonably well, with what is known about each of the women.Highly recommended to those who are interested in reading good fiction about some of the lesser known players from the reign of Henry VIII.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This was the first Gregory novel I had ever read. I picked it up in a bookstore on my way to the airport, not expecting much but a few hours of mild entertainment or at least distraction. It caught my eye because of \\"Boleyn\\" in the title. I've always wanted to read about that particular period of British history and the Tudor monarchs, but wasn't quite sure how to break into the genre (can't really force myself to read strictly historical novels). I read very heavy scientific literature as part of my career, so I am always looking for something clever, yet not too daunting, to read for pleasure. This novel did not disappoint! Gregory's description of the political and sexual maneuvering in Henry VIII's court is juicy and delicious without being distasteful. I could not put this novel down once I had picked it up. In fact, my fiance was a bit angry with me for ignoring him and doing nothing but reading for the first couple days of our vacation. I've since gone back and read the first two novels in this series (The Constant Princess and The Other Boleyn Girl) and they were just as wonderful to read. I am actually on amazon.com at this moment to get my hands on every other Gregory novel I can find! I'm planning on reading \\"The Queen's Fool\\" and \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" next, as I suppose they are the next books in chronological order (following the reign of two of Henry's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth I). Highly recommend Gregory for intense, dramatical plots that are \\"based on a true story\\", so to speak."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I had somewhat low expectations of this book considering I enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl so much. Hence, I was incredibly surprised when this book had me even more enthralled than the other, with a quick moving story told from alternating viewpoints of the conniving and mentally unstable Lady Jane Rochford, the steady and wise Anne of Cleves and the foolish girl-child Katherine Howard. I had a difficult time putting the book down, and thoroughly relished in P. Gregory's ability to transport the reader to Tudor times, where the uncertainty regarding church reform led to very difficult times for those in the path of Henry VIII's mad and causeless retribution. Great book - I highly recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction, especially the Tudor era."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Don't be fooled by the other reviews boasting of the excellence of this novel; it is a great disappointment to anyone who has read The Other Boleyn Girl, The Virgin's Lover and the The Queen's Fool. Much like the Constant Princess, this book is full of repetition--so much so that it is a wonder that Ms Gregory's editors let her get away with it. Her characters did not grow or change as a result of their ordeal, but, again and again repeated almost the very same words as those said in the previous chapter. While the conceit of the story is interesting--telling the tale from the point of view of each of the 3 female protaganists, the execution is amateur. In truth, this book should be no more than a few chapters long. As I said, a great disappointment that must be laid at the feet of Ms. Gregory's need to publish a book each year. This is my 6th Gregory book and the last that I will read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have found that some of Ms. Gregory novels are hit and miss. I hated the Queen's fool, had lukewarm feelings for the Virgin's Lover and thought that Constant Princess was a decent read. The Boleyn Inheritance is outstanding.It is told from three different perspectives. At first it was a little confusing, but as I continued to read the book I did not have a problem.The three women in the story are Queen Anne(Henry's plain wife)pretty Katherine Howard and poor Jane Rochford who saw her husband and sister-in-law Anne Boleyn go to their deaths.Each woman has their own distinct voice in this novel. Frankly I felt sorry for all of them. They were victims of their time and they were used as pawns. The men in their lives used and abused these women to get what they desired and if death was a result..no one seemed to care. Ms. Gregory gives these women a voice and you begin to feel sorry for their plight. They were trapped in a world they could not escape nor could they control.This has to be one of Ms. Gregory's best books. I daresay it is better than the Other Boleyn Girl.

But I love Anne of Cleves - she's easily my favorite of Henry's wives, so when I saw she was one of the narrators, I took the plunge and picked up Inheritance.Well, I devoured it. I loved The Other Boleyn Girl (once I made my peace with Anne's characterization), but The Boleyn Inheritance edges out as my favorite of Gregory's Tudor novels. The three-narrator device is very well handled (although a few of Anne of Cleves's sections do come across as \\"filler\\"). Jane Boleyn's talent for self-deception made her as controversial and intriguing character as Gregory's Anne Boleyn, and despite being convinced I'd dislike her, I really felt for her by the end.But my favorite characterization by far was Katherine Howard. I don't think I've ever seen a self-absorbed teenage girl's voice portrayed so convincing. Her narration has an almost stream-of-consciousness tone as she bounces around from one half-baked idea to the next. It's by turns hilarious and quite sad, especially as she faces her execution.One wish: a second edition with about half of the examples of the phrase \\"Boleyn inheritance\\" taken out. Each of the three leads gets her own \\"inheritance.\\" We get it.

I admired Anne of Cleves and felt truly heart-sick about poor Catherine Howard. While she may be right (or wrong) about Jane Boleyn, she presented a vivid characterization.

I was a bit dissapointed comparign it to The Other Boleyn Girl. The characters were not as easy to love as in the other book, and i personally do not think that narrating from three person's point of views worked for this book. Narrating this way seemed to take away my oppurtunity to deeply connect with a character. I found the Anne segments boring, and to long, while i loved the Katherine segments, and wished they were longer. As far as Jane Boleyn, i liked those parts because it was like a flashback to The Other Boleyn Girl. I found some parts of the book to dragged on, while others were to short, and some of the rushed parts were very important.

I get a story along with facts that wouldn't have ever known enless i pick up on of Philippa's books.

There are three narrators in this book, and you would never mistake one for the other.The author gives each such a distinct narrative voice, that it is a delight to read. She also has a talent for giving a telling detail, rather than dry description.I doubt there can be anyone who will come away from this book without thinking of Henry VIII as a monstrous serial killer, but given the facts, that rings true.This author can make you care. You'll feel sorry for vain and foolish Kitty Howard. You may even feel sorry for Lady Rocheford.If you get a chance to listen to it on audio, you may like it even better. It was engaging, exciting, and compelling."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This novel is written from the viewpoint of three very different women - the naive yet quick-witted Anne of Cleves, the calculating Jane Boleyn and the greedy and childish Catherine Howard. They take turns by each chapter telling their view of events as they occur over a fairly brief period of time. Anne is set aside by the King in favor of Catherine, and it's the best thing that could have happened to her. She's the only one of the King's wives to survive a parting in a fairly benign (compared to the others) way.Catherine ignores her revulsion in order to be the new Queen, all so that she can get pretty new dresses and jewels. She is completely and idiotically heedless of the dangers that await her in this vicious court and, even more stupidly, seeks comfort in the arms of a man within her new husband's household.Finally, Jane Boleyn, the woman who pretends to be the friend of all the queens and really is only a friend to herself. She is only the marionette of the duke, the uncle of both Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, but she has plenty of evil all on her own, and was, based on her behaviour, quite possibly insane. I knew nothing of what happened with these three ladies so every page brought a new surprise, and the writing is so evocative of the period and illustrates emotion in such a compelling fashion that I was loath to set the book down until I had finished it.Philippa Gregory's books gets knocked for being historically inaccurate, and that's a fair complaint. However, they provide an excellent introduction to the period and, once interested, a reader can continue into non-fiction discussions of the times about which she writes by seeking out the volumes listed at the end of each novel. I know that I will be doing exactly that."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I had no knowledge of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and very little on Jane Rochford. I was more familiar with Anne Boleyn and Katherine of Aragon. I was very interested to learn more about these 'lesser' known women in Tudor history.I was very pleasantly suprised to find this book enjoyable. I couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it rather quickly. I savored the stories and how the lives of these women enterwined. As a result of this book, I started to look for others on these women so that I can find more information.I found the writing to be wonderful and captivating. Im not sure how much of the book was fact, but my knowledge level of these women has risen and I was entertained in the process."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed this sequel to The Other Boleyn Girl.Philippa Gregory tells the story of what happens in Henry VIII's court after the beheading of Anne Boleyn. She offers the reader insights from the perspectives of three very different women; Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. And they tell their stories in continuous and sometimes overlapping narrative, which I really enjoyed.These three women are very different, telling this story with all of their perspectives adds another dimension and makes it more interesting.Jane Boleyn is the sister-in-law of the executed Anne Boleyn. She testified against her own husband and sister-in-law and helped send them to their death. She repeatedly tells us how in love she was with her husband. She is indebted to her uncle who is very powerful and ambitious.Anne of Cleves is composed, graceful and smart. She is unfortunately chosen to become Henry VIII's fourth wife. Through her eyes the position of women in the world is examined.Katherine Howard is an immature and flirtatious fifteen year old girl who thinks mostly of herself. She is spellbound by the jewels and dresses and wealth of the king and gives little thought of what has happened to his queens.I was once again frightened by King Henry VIII's rein of tyranny and all that was considered treason. I'd be interested in reading a good non-fiction book about him and his madness. Can anyone recommend one?"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Ms. Gregory has done it again.

It's normally easy to read in the sense it's not dry like most regular history books. This book started off well, and when I wasn't reading about Lady Jane Rochford, the book was easy to read and enjoyable. The chapters that were in Lady Jane Rochford's voice, however, were so off base it was impossible to read. The writer made Lady Rochford sound innocent and nice, rather than the vindictive and malicious woman she was. It would have been easier to read if she hadn't been portrayed as pure as she had been portrayed. She may not have been as malicious as some people believe, but she wasn't guiltless when you consider her testimony sent her husband and his sister to their deaths."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This was a really enjoyable novel and the author has made a very upsetting time in women's history, interesting and bearable even with some humor. Only when I discuss the plot with others, do I realize how disturbing the reign of Henry the VIII really was. It makes me glad I live in the 21'st century!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I LOVE history and historical novels, but it really bothers me when an author takes real historical people & events, and completely changes the story! If you want to write absolute fiction, then do that! Don't use real people, places, & events and misrepresent \\"history\\" to people who think they are getting \\"historical\\" information in the novel! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR TO ANYONE!!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This book could easily be edited down to 1/4 of it's length. It is extraordinarily boring, slow moving and deeply repetitive. I do not have amnesia nor am i a simpleton. I do not need to be reminded of mundane details every 3 or 4 pages. I kept reading this book only to see if anything was every actually going to happen. I was sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"In this book the story continues w/Henry VII after beheading Anne Boleyn and the death of his third wife, Jane Seymounr. Narrated per chapter by Jane Boleyn (Anne B.'s sister in law) Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. I enjoyed Anne of Cleves point of view the best but this is not a favorite of Gregory's books, I was disappointed. It certainly presents Henry VII as the insane, terrifying murderer that he was. Pick it up at the library and read it-- is my suggestion- before purchasing it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I found this book boring and an awkward read. Phillipa Gregory's other books were MUCH better and more interesting! Wish I had waited until it came out in paperback OR had a higher discounted price!!!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I enjoyed this book even more than \\"the Other Boleyn Girl\\" - the period is brought vividly to light.

I have read all her books and can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have read all of Philippa Gregory's books about Henry VIII and his wives. If you enjoy historical facts interwoven with a great story, you will love the history and mystery of the English Court."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I loved The Other Boleyn Girl, but in my opinion The Boleyn Inherityance is not nearly as good. The story is told by 3 people--Katherine Howard, Ann of Cleves and Jane Boleyn (George's wife). These 3 are not nearly as interesting as Mary, Anne and George Boleyn were in The Other Boleyn Girl. Also, Henry the VIII in The Boleyn Inheritance is grossly obese, has a smelly leg wound and is using his power to behead and persecute lots of people, so there is no real love story as there was with Katherine of Aragon; Ann of Cleves and Katherine Howard both find him repulsive."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read the first one \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" for a book club and I just had to see what happened next.(In the story I mean. I knew as far as in history) I think this would be an great book if you enjoy drama and twist on history."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is just as good as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"...need I say more?"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"By 1539, thirtyish widow Jane Boleyn continues her plotting to gain power and wealth as she more than just survived the execution of her husband and her sister-in-law, the late wife of King Henry VIII six years ago. She insured she was not associated in any way with the \\"plot\\" against the Tudor monarch, which also meant her spouse had no outside champion to save his life.Henry chooses the Germanic Princess Anne of Cleves to be his next wife based on the recommendation of his Thomas Cromwell, in order to obtain an ally in the ongoing cold war with Spain and France. Jane plans her demise as her ambition is to be the last woman sitting on the throne. At the same time the Duke of Norfolk brings his precocious beautiful fifteen years old niece Katherine Howard, a cousin-in-law to Jane, to court to tempt the aging ruler with the energy of youth as he sets his schemes in motion.Told predominately from the perspective of the three females, readers obtain a powerful insightful look at the court of Henry VIII in which Machiavellian manipulations is the only way of life. The contrasts in personalities and supporters between the three women make the tale a winner for historical fans especially those intrigued by the Tudor court. Jane is the professional schemer using her wits to tear down her opponents; Anne is a naive outsider used to being ordered about and is uncomfortable with her new role; and Katherine is a vain kitten flirting with everyone but mostly with the King. Philippa Gregory follows up her THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL with an excellent intriguing sixteenth century tale of court manipulations and spins that readers and Karl Rove would appreciate.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I like the use of descriptions to describe the dress and atmosphere. I was not prepared for the way it is organized. It switches from the viewpoint of three different characters. So it tells of an event through one character and then switches and tells the exact event again through the other two characters. So you are basically reading the same events three times. It is nice to see the different viewpoints, but after a while it gets predictable. I became bored with the same event being told three times."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Philippa Gregory has done it again. The story is told from the perspectives ofKatherine Howard, Anne of Cleves and Jane Boleyn. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Spoilers (In this review and in history!):So I was one of those crazy people who didn't like \\"The Other Boleyn\\" girl because of the bad history and undeveloped characters. I found \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" to be a better in both departments, although so little is known about the three protagonists of this novel it would be much harder to mess it up.Anne of Cleves- Was the most interesting character of the first half of the novel, for the short time she was Queen. I found her to be the the most likeable, and I thought her story (escaping from one bad situation, right into another) was amazingly relatable to anyone, even in the 21st century. I don't know much about her history, so I can't comment on whether Philippa Gregory's depiction of her was very accurate or not. However, when Katharine Howard becomes Queen, Anne's chapters begin to dwindle and soon become far and few in between as she no longer really participates in daily court life and lives single far away from her new \\"brother\\" the King. I began to miss her character!Jane Boleyn - Her character was kind of odd and delusional. I understand that the author intended to have her portrayed as mad, but I actually felt a little awkward when reading her chapters while she talked about how much she missed Anne and George who were portrayed in the last book as never liking her, not even a little bit. Plus her story presented a plot hole in the continuity of the story from the Other Boleyn girl, as a lot of the things that Mary Boleyn discovered to be true about Anne (and George) in the first book were then seen as lies Jane made up in the second book. Just kind of odd.Katharine Howard - I think some people might have found her endearing but to me her whole repetitive \\"I want pretty dresses, jewels, and presents\\" got quite boring after a while for me. I understand that she was supposed to be very young (Howard's age is debated, but Gregory seems to always like to make her protagonists very young) but please give us young women some credit - we're not all so stupid! Although Katharine WAS actually reported to be quite dim, I found it hard to believe that she would not grasp the danger she was in by the end of the novel - she knew what happened to Anne. However, Kitty Howard (her nickname in the book) provided some real comic relief, so she could make an enjoyable read sometimes.Other things:Okay, I am a college student and I usually multi-task, one thing I do being read and eat at the same time. The long and repetitive descriptions of the king's open leg wound stinking and filling with pus, plus his digestive problems made this very hard to do!Gregory sometimes uses words and phrases that would not have been natural to use in the 16th century. Minor, but still kind of bothersome.The story did suck me in for the most part, and I felt the characters all had good and bad sides (minus the King who is now just completely off his rocker all the time).You CAN read this if you haven't read TOBG. Just brush up on your history prior to this time and you're good to go!3.5/5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"While I wanted to love this book, the constant switching of perspectives sadly left me mainy confused. The highlight is reading from Katherine Howard's point-of-view but that is not enough of a plus to make me want to read it again."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I guess I should have read a bit more about the description. This is not a full size book, it is small and I don't like this size."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I don't know if you like reading about dead royalty as much as I do, but if you're drawn to a full skirt and a ruffled collar, it might be tempting to pick up this book. :-) As with her other novels, this is a long, dark, look at the inevitable destruction of the main characters. Gregory gives you three lead females who you can only feel pity for, and the only men in the story are pigs and plotters. There is not a single noble or redeeming act done at any time in the entire story. I know there are a million novels out there, Why can't I read more that leave me lighter and more hopeful? If you're reading this, and you can recommend some, please do. (ps, I don't like Karen Kingsbury or the Mitford series)I gave it a C rating because it's at least interesting, and at least gives you some historical lessons- a \\"What not to do\\" sort of thing."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"First of all, let me start by telling you I am almost as obsessed with Gregory's books as I am with Tudor history - and that's saying something. This is a wonderful book, told in 3 ladies point of view. I was really excited to read this, because I didn't know much about 2 of the 3 ladies. All of that being said, however... as much as I did enjoy this book (and I give it 4 out of 5 stars), I was so disappointed because the story line seems so... simple. I would have thought this was a young adult book, except... it's not a young adult book. I kept waiting for more. I did thoroughly enjoy the portrayal of Anne of Cleves & slightly less so of Lady Jane Rochford, but Katherine Howard... childlike, immature, beautiful, vain Katherine Howard, just drove me nuts. I have never believed her to be as simple as Gregory pictured her.All in all, I'd recommend to other history buffs, but it's not a book I'd read again."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I've read alot of books about the Tudors (long before the show came out)and this discusses some of the people surrounding Anne andHenry VIII. Not as helpful as some other books, but is good book,especially if you're just looking for a little extra information."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory makes it easy to read history.Very good novel.A pleasent reading."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Although it wasn't as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, it was very good. It gave an interesting perspective to the women following Anne Boleyn. I found it a great read, and enjoyed the characters."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I was worried about being disappointed in the sequel. Not the case at all. In both books, I became totally engrossed in that period of history. They are not just entertaining, but also very informative as to what life must have been like at court in that day. I think the author has done her research well! I plan to read more of her books."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"If you liked \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" then this is definitely worth a read. Continuing the theme of how women in this period were used as pawns in the rise (and fall) of men, Gregory fleshes out two of the lesser known of Henry's wives -- Anne of Cleves and Kathryn Howard. Perhaps most interesting though is the perspective and fate of Lady Jane Rochford, who escaped the beheading of her husband and sister-in-law and is \\"rewarded\\" for her skill in navigating Henry VIII's court. Interesting perspective on Henry's later years, illness and apparent madness.In general, for a whole researched, but fictionalized perspective on Henry and his wives, I prefer Margaret George's \\"Autobiography of Henry VIII.\\" It is interesting that she and Gregory have both done extensive research, but have reached somewhat different conclusions about several characters. I'm not sure exactly who to trust without going to the more scholarly sources myself, but Gregory's portrayal is certainly compelling and a bit \\"sexier.\\"In general a very enjoyable read, and you may even learn a thing or two!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Detailed, informative yet engrossing listening. On an editing note, however,I do wish, that the narrators could take a little more trouble with pronouncing quite well known place names and dynasty names ... some annoying errors were made and when there is more than one reader and they give differing pronunciations it shouts 'lack of care in editing'."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I bought the audio book for a road trip that I made recently. It is a great novel and it has put me into a craze with her books. I plan to read each of them!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"After reading the Other Bolyn Girl I didn't want to stop reading about these characters. What a great follow up."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"After reading The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen's Fool, I decided to take a break from Ms. Gregory's books but I picked this up to skim through it and 3 days later I had read it from cover to cover. She does very well in giving different \\"voices\\" to each of the women she portrays, and crafts a good story, advancing the plot while switching point of views."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The book was a compelling historical read, but the characters did not grasp me like the Mary and Anne Bolyen from the previous novel. I feel that the jumpiness that came from the switching of point of view made it hard for me to relate to anyone character. I realize that Gregory is just playing with history, but the events depicted seemed disjointed with the factual events she included, especially in the end of the novel. I feel that this book was just okay when compared to other books of hers that I have read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I loved the Other Boleyn Girl, so I was excited about picking up this sequel. Although it was readable and I enjoyed bits here and there, like a few other reviewers, I found the book INCREDIBLY repetitive. Jane's sections were the worst with the \\"how I loved George...no, I must not think of it.\\" Over and over and over again. And after TOBG, I couldn't buy Jane as someone mournful of George and Anne. Anne of Cleves was generally dull and repetitive (although not as bad as the other two). I found Kitty Howard's sections the most amusing because she had a unique \\"voice\\" and some of her stupidity made me laugh, but even she was insanely repetitive (\\"the king is fat,\\" \\"the king stinks,\\" over and over and over again).It wasn't a good book or a bad book, it just wasn't anywhere near as good as the Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"A sequel to The Other Boleyn Girl. You don't need to read them in order, but if you don't know anything about the reign of Henry the 8th, I would read TOBG first. I don't think that this book would be the same without a good understanding of what was going on at the time and the crazy stuff that Henry did. I also think it helps to have a sense of what Henry was like as a younger man to appreciate how messed up this period in English history was and how things progressed with Henry's growing power.This book is from the point of view of three women, Anne of Cleves(Henry's fourth wife), Jane Boleyn (The wife of George, Anne Boleyn's brother) and Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife). I normally don't like it when the point of view changes from more than two characters, but it was done very well and I didn't mind at all. It did not feel segmented because when it changed POV character, the new character picked the story up from where the last character left off.This is good historical fiction and a worth reading if you enjoy the genre and a must read for those of you who are interested in the period.As a woman I find it utterly frightening to imagine living in Henry's court. To live in a time where you are owned by the men in your family and traded to another man, like a horse. To have little or no choice about anything in your life and your worth is judged on your ability to give birth to a boy child. To live in fear of being drug to a scaffold, kicking and screaming, to be beheaded on the whim of a madman, with no trial, or proof of a crime. It's chilling. I find it a whole lot scarier than anything Stephen King's written in the last twenty years."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I was really pleased with this book and I'm glad that I left it for last. It was a really good way to end the series, so far.I highly enjoyed the three person narrative. It wasn't confusing and it gave different POVs on the same situation, which was really interesting.I really felt for Anne of Cleves. Her home life was a shambles and she wanted out. But unfortunately she went from one mad house to another. I don't think it was fair of Henry to call her stupid and ugly. From the picture I've seen she seems to be the prettiest of his wives, or it's a good painting. She's the true voice in the novel. I think her lack of English made the court nervous because she could only speak the truth of what she saw. The truth seems to be the first thing you learn when speaking. Her disastrous meeting was more so for Henry than herself. He finally got the truth and couldn't handle it. His court did him no favours in continuing to tell him lies. They did themselves no favours by lying. I was really impressed with her decision to leave without a fight, and in doing so ended up with more than she would have elsewhere. Her decision to not go to court often saved her life. Stupid she was not.Katherine Howard. My, my, my. She would be sweet if she wasn't so outwardly stupid, and 85% inwardly stupid. Though she could tell the truth about Henry, and kept it to herself, she was just...boring a bit to me. Let me see, what do I have? Always counting her gowns and jewelry, as if nothing else mattered. And it's possible nothing else did matter to her and that's what's a bit sad. I think Gregory wanted to portray her as not as stupid as everyone says, but even the glimpses of intelligence were short lived by her pushing them out for shiny things. She was truly a child. I found her musings on speaking French quite funny though. She learning French, but the only word she knows is \\"voila\\". Then she uses it at the weirdest times. She then says that if she goes to France then they should speak English, or they could learn. I'm thinking, \\"Idiot, in France they should speak French.\\" It's almost a modern commentary though for people who think when they go abroad everyone should speak English.Jane Parker, Boleyn, Rochford; Lady Rochford. I didn't like her in The Other Boleyn Girl at all. I found her nosy, simple and annoying. In this not so much. Most of the book she seemed sincere about being sorry for giving testimony against Anne and George Boleyn. But in her memories she stills holds on to the idea of them being lovers in a slight way. It wasn't until the end of the book when she truly showed her colours. No matter how much she may delude herself into think she's an OK person in the end she's not. She truly is a liar, schemer, malicious, evil person. I should mention she's also selfish. I truly think she has a touch of madness, but only because she brought it on herself.This is a really good book. I read the majority of it while waiting for laundry to be done and forgot the laundry. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I think that Philippa Gregory is a wonderful writer! She pulls you into the lives of the people in her books. After reading one of her books I ran out and bought 4 more of hers. Each one that I read; I kept finding myself unable to put them down."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a wonderful look behind the scenes into the lives of the women in Henry's life.

Date: December 2006* Publisher: Simon & Schuster Adult Publishing* Sold by: Simon & Schuster Digital Sales* Format: eBook, 528pp* Sales Rank: 4,580* Series: Philippa Gregory Tudor Series, #3* Product Browse duration in Minutes: 60* File Size: 603 KB* ISBN-13: 9780743298544* ISBN: 0743298543The Boleyn Inheritance is told from three points of view: Jane Boleyn (wife to the deceased Thomas), Anne of Cleaves (Henry's fourth wife), and Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife). Jane is the expert maid in waiting. She is called upon by the Duke of Norfolk to keep an eye on the new queen and report back to him anything that she does. Jane owes her life to the Duke, and so she is in his pocket to survive. Jane poses as a friend to the new queen Anne and attempts to be in her confidence as the story continues. However, Jane begins to like the queen and when plots against her begin to crop up, she has doubts whether she can put another queen to death as she did to her sister-in-law Anne Boleyn. The thoughts of Anne Boleyn and her husband Thomas haunt her throughout the book. Jane poses as the wise older woman who has been through quite a lot, but her transformation towards the end shows that she still has a lot to learn.Anne of Cleaves is considered an unreformed woman by her family, but she is chosen to become the new queen of England because an alliance between England and Cleaves would be helpful. She does not speak a word of English, but as she moves into her new life, she learns quickly. Because of her troubles at home, she has no idea how to please the king in bed. This leaves their marriage unconsummated. Henry also detests her after a mix-up in one of his games. Although she is a pure and strong girl, she often finds herself bending to the will of the men that she finds in charge of her. When she is dethroned, she becomes a sister to the king and finds herself much happier in the countryside. She loves England, but counts herself lucky to be one of the few that survives King Henry's marriage.Lastly, Katherine Howard is a young, flirty girl. Her beauty catches the king's eye and he courts her while he is married to Anne and Katherine is a maid in waiting. Katherine's uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, wants to see the king and Katherine wed. He schemes and encourages the flirtations until it actually happens. Katherine is a flighty little girl and only measures things in what materials she receives. She often begins her narration with a list of what she owns. This is probably because she is only around fifteen when she marries the king. She attempts to please him in bed, but it is difficult work when he is so old, fat, and wounded. Finally, with the help of Jane, she takes on a lover. Then, as with Anne Boleyn, all hell breaks loose and the king attempts to kill everyone.I know that I keep saying this, but I have been on a historical fiction kick. I really enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl (book only, movie was terrible), so I decided that I would continue with this series. As time moves on, I am hoping to go through each one. Gregory has a way with characters. It's like you get to see into their souls and travel inside their heads with them. Anne of Cleaves was by far my favorite character in this story, but all three women were beautifully illustrated. As I was reading, I could feel my moods shift with the difference in narration. Katherine was always bubbly and it made me want to read her parts faster as if I was speaking them like a young girl would in a quicker, happier tone. The plot is predictable, but that shouldn't surprise anyone. It is nothing new what happened within King Henry's court. Her books are much more interesting than anything else that I have read about him though. I'm sure that she has taken liberties with parts of history to make her tales more enchanting and personable, but I would recommend it to people who want a glimpse of what he was like. Gregory's tales are definitely worth a reread and they are something that I will keep upon my shelves.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Phillipa Gregory breathes life into this historical fiction based on King Henry VIII's fourth and fifth wives, Anne of Cleves and Katharine Howard.

Since reading The Constant Princess, I have been hooked on her books and find myself totally absorbed in her storytelling. The Boleyn Inheritance was no different.The story is set between 1539 and 1542 after Jane Seymour dies and King Henry VIII decides to marry once again. He marries a German princess, Anne of Cleves, but after a bad first encounter with her, he quickly begins to hate her. Once Anne is in England she finds herself alone and barely able to speak the language, with a husband who will not consummate the marriage and who dislikes her from the start.The story is told from the points of view of Queen Anne, Katherine Howard who is a lady in waiting, and Jane Boleyn, who is George Boleyn's widow. Jane's own testimony helped send her late husband and his infamous sister Anne Boleyn to the chopping block.I enjoyed this book very much. The Boleyn Inheritance has been the perfect read on a cold winters night. There was drama, romance and plenty of interesting characters to keep me hooked. I was completely hooked on the last few chapters and was up until late into the night reading. Philippa Gregory had me on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I was a bit dissapionted with The Boleyn Inheritance. After reading The Other Boleyn Girl and absolutly LOVING it I immediatly rushed out to the bookstore and bought this book expecting the same, or an even better experience. The plot moves along slow with a few jumps every now and then but it was hard for me to get through. I really had to force myself to finish it. It took me a month to read this book because I couldn't focus on it for that long because at times I found myself well...bored. Now while the imagery and description is absolutly beautiful the plot is just eh. I will continue reading Phillipa's books because I still do consider her tp be the best historical fiction writer out there,I mean you can tell that she does her research. But as far as recommending this book to other people well...I just can't bring myself to do it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"After reading The Other Boleyn Girl, I yearned for a sequel. The Boleyn Inheritance quenched my desire to know what took place in King Henry the VIII's court after the ending of The Other Boleyn Girl in an entertaining way. If you haven't read that novel first you should or else The Boleyn Inheritance won't be as interesting because there are many reminiscences of Anne and George Boleyn by Jane Boleyn in this sequel. By the end of the sequel you're given answers to doubts or questions you may have had after reading the previous novel. I thought Gregory did a fine job \\"showing\\" her readers that George's wife was a psychotic, vindictive, and delusional woman."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"As much of a page turner as The Other Boleyn Girl. The Other Boleyn Girl left me hungry for more Tudors history and this was the perfect fix! King Henry and the Duke of Norfolk are perfectly detestable villains, the kind you love to hate. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this read!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Once you pick up this book, you will not put it down until you are finished. Being a fan of \\"The Tudors\\" I did not think I would find anything new in this book. How wrong I was! Reading about the lives of Anne of Cleves, Jane Seymour, and Kathyrn Howard in the first person is a wonderful way to enlighten the reader about these lesserr known figures in the Tudor court. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"divorced, beheaded, survived. For me, at least, this book combined as a little history lesson about two queens one does not often read about in this genre and some great fiction. I was impressed by Ms. Gregory's development of her characters and the way she allowed the reader to see the Tudor court from three distinct perspectives. I found this book to be superior to The Virgin's Lover, and somehow more tragic than the Other Boleyn Girl. Perhaps it was the youth of Katherine Howard or the seemingly inescapable tyranny of the Henry that is portrayed in this novel, but I found this one particularly sad and intense all at the same time. Overall, an engaging read for any Philippa Gregory fan or a fan of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Tricky business developing three female characters, each so different in attitude and age. It took a little time, but I was soon impressed as Jane Boleyn, Anna of Cleves, and 14 year old Katherine each became real, and in Jane and Katherine's cases, even their far-fetched delusions became understandable to me.This is the first book in which I not only sympathized with Jane Boleyn, but felt the sting of the lash as Uncle Thomas Howard annihilated each and every illusion by which she had kept her person intact,reducing her to a puddle like the Wicked Witch of Oz. He decimated her, and it was painful to read the words Ms. G. chose to spew forth from his mouth.I was a bit puzzled by several references to Anna of Cleves' beauty,(post-Henry), as I have never read that she blossomed to this extent during the later days as his 'sister'. However, it made perfect sense in the flow of the book, and as Anna is such a loveable character, one is happy for her.For me, Katherine's character took the longest to jell, until, with constant repetition, the light went on for me: this really is all there was to her! She was simply who she was -- a quick study with a love of material things and attention, no hidden depths, no empathetic capacity. And above all, a child. She could as well have been 4 as 14, and would have been no different had she lived to 44.All in all, for the book I had thought might just be the 'leftovers' book, I liked it and appreciated the interesting new twists."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised when I read this book. I was expecting a good read but this exceeded my expectations. I found that the method of telling the story through the words of the 3 main characters made the story even more interesting."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"After reading The Other Boleyn Girl this book a breath of fresh air.This is not a review for The Other Boleyn Girl so I will not say anything on that except that there no love lost between me and that book. I say that only to say this, The Boleyn Inheritance gave me the hope that the rest Philippa Gregory's books were worth reading.It was told from three points of view: Jane Boleyn, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. I was interested in what all three of these Tudor Era women had to say and the story that would be weaved through them.What I loved?:1) It was nice see to see Jane Boleyn portrayed in a somewhat positive light. I feel that most often she is views as weak at best and vindictive and spiteful at worst. In this book you see her grieve and mourn and she is even regretful at times. I find myself able to sympathize with her and the terrible position she was put in.2) Anne of Cleves is a character who grew throughout the story. She grew from a nave girl who easily bullied to a confident and Independent young woman. I enjoyed that journey from beginning to end.3) Katherine Howard was almost unlikable. Take note, I said almost. I found her silliness and her selfishness almost endearing. She was tad one dimensional but I am not sure I have a problem with that. I think the development of her character worked well.I don't have much to say in the way of criticism. I was well pleased with this addition to the Tudor series. It gave me hope for more well written works from Ms. Gregory and I have not yet been disappointed. I whole heatedly recommend this story to others."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The premise of this book is fine. Three women telling about their life at Henvy VIII's court. However, I found the first person narrative to be confusing. Each chapter is told from one of the women's point of view and you had to stay very aware of who was narrating, especially when there was dialog amongst the women. It was difficult to always know who \\"I\\" was. I'm also a little skeptical about some of the historical accuracy. Granted, this is a work of fiction, as was the tv series The Tudors and others. However, most things I've read presents as fact that Queen Jane Seymour facilitated the reconcilliation between Henry and Mary and Elizabeth. In this novel it indicates that when Henry marries Anne of Cleves, he still is not reunited with either daughter. Also, in the tv series, Charles Brandon escorts Anne from Cleves to England. In this book he only meets her after she arrives on English soil. Again, with recognition that both are works of fiction it is not a serious breach, however, it does make one suspicious about the historical accuracy of both. With these factors in mind, all in all it is a pleasant story and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I found this book to be a riveting continuation of the story of the wives of Henry VIII. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" was the beginning of the saga and should be read first. This story is an in-depth treatment of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. Both books are written in a style that is easy to read and successfully pulls you into complete involvement with the story. It's hard to lay the book down to take care of things like dishes and laundry! I highly recommend this and look forward to reading other books by Philippa Gregory."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl, I was excited for this book, especially because it was told from the first-person of three different characters.I'm not completely disappointed, but this novel was not the work I had expected from Philippa Gregory. Mrs. Gregory knows how to create well-rounded characters that breathe, we all know that, but this novel just didn't do it for me. It was too long for its content (yeah, I get that some 400-page books are great, but that doesn't mean we should all strive to write 400 pages with the content to fill 250).In The Other Boleyn Girl, the characters are dramatic and--well, people. In this book, they were all just complaining about how stupid and mean Henry VIII was, which, albeit probably true, is not what I want to read in a book. Henry VIII was probably an awful man to deal with, but that shouldn't hinder character development and personality. Unfortunately, in this book, it did.However, while it had its"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Another hit for Phillippa Gregory. Most of her books are top notch and hard to put down. This was one of those. I've read quite a few and am now on Wideacre triology -- first one is pretty depressing."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"\\"Three Women Who Share One Fate: The Boleyn Inheritance\\"Phillipa Gregory breathes life into Tudor England once again...times three. Instead of taking on the voice of one famous heroine from the gilded court of King Henry the VIII, she brings three very different young ladies to life: Anne of Cleves, Kitty Howard, and Jane Boleyn.One can't help, but feel bad for poor Anne of Cleves. She doesn't speak English, her husband, King Henry hates her, and she hasn't a single trustworthy friend in all of England. She can't even rely on her own brother to save her neck if Henry decides to set it on the chopping block, which he would very much like to do.Kitty Howard is portrayed as a flirtatious dolt who unintentionally gains Henry's affections. But once her scheming uncle realizes the King's desires, he uses Kitty to gain family favor. Kitty steals Henry away from Queen Anne as instructed by her uncle, but finds herself quickly bored with her impotent husband and starts a flirtation with young Thomas Culpepper. Then, of course, there is the widow Jane, who had been married to Anne Boleyn's brother before he lost his head at the king's orders. She is the spy for the wicked uncle and advises both Anne and Kitty, but with her own intentions in mind.Gregory takes on the persona of each woman, masterfully crafting three distinctive, alternating first-person narratives. Each girl tells her side of the story. As I read, I felt fear and pity for these women who were at the mercy of ruthless and impulsive men vying for their own desires without a care to the well-being of their own family members. The pace of The Boleyn Inheritance did, however feel slow at times. Perhaps this is due to Gregory's commitment to historical accuracy and detail. All in all, I found The Boleyn Inheritance to be a compelling read and I highly recommend it to lovers of women's historical fiction, fans of Tudor history, and writers looking to improve the distinctive voices of their own characters.Review Written by Andrea Cefalo, author of The Fairytale Keeper series and Chief Editor of Obelisk Historical Fiction Review"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The author is both a writer and a historian and I really enjoy her detailed attention to history while making these stories come alive. I read this soon after reading \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and immediately purchased the next one,\\"The Queen's Fool\\"."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Three narrators tell the story of Henry VIII's fourth and fifth marriages in this novel that mixes betrayal, greed, ambition, conspiracy, intrigue and even death with vanity and frivolity. I devoured every juicy tidbit, and with my lack of historical perspective, had no idea how these women would fare in the end. Not knowing the outcome made this novel even more enjoyable than The Other Boleyn Girl. We have Jane Boleyn, wife of George, who gains the confidence of each successive queen, despite the fact that her testimony helped send her beloved husband and her beautiful sister-in-law Anne Boleyn to the scaffold. Her scheming is all at the urging of the Duke of Norfolk, who has no scruples whatsoever and uses Jane as a manipulator and spy. To make sure that her betrayal of Anne and George Boleyn was not for naught, she keeps trying to save herself, doing the Duke's bidding, even when she knows that more lives will be lost. Anne of Cleves is the buttoned-up, dowdy woman destined to become Henry's fourth queen but without enough guile to gain the interest of the fat, stinky, lecherous old man who can have any woman in the kingdom. Instead, he diverts his attentions to Katherine Howard, a beautiful, flirtatious, teenage maid-in-waiting. She is quite the opposite of both Jane Boleyn and Anne of Cleves, in that she is too nave and vain to realize that her deeds jeopardize the lives of her loved ones. Sometimes in her efforts to keep us informed about all three women, the author becomes a bit repetitive. We don't need frequent reminders that Anne of Cleves is just biding her time after the King discards her in favor of Kitty Howard. The fate of these three women pivots on the whim of a man who has no qualms about executing anyone who presents the slightest threat to his sovereignty. Consequently, life in his court is apt to be short-lived, and at one point the author raises the question as to why anyone would choose to be there. Those who deem themselves safe are the most at risk."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Phillipa Gregory is a mediocre writer. For whatever reason, she's had great commercial success as a writer of historical fiction. However, I am usually disappointed in her books. This one was no exception. The first half was dreadful. It was repetitive and trite. The second half was much better though - hence the 3 star rating.This novel is about the 4th and 5th wives of Henry VIII. It is told in the first person with the narrative shifting in each chapter between Anne of Cleves (#4, a younger sister of the Duke of Cleves), Katherine Howard (#5, an impoverished much younger cousin of the ill-fated Anne Boleyn and niece of the powerful Duke of Norfolk), and Jane Boleyn (the mentally unbalanced wife of Anne's brother George - the one who gave the testimony which Henry relied on to have Anne and George beheaded for incest).Gregory does a great job in giving a reader the sense of terror that Henry's wives felt when they could not win his favor. I think she created an interesting picture of the sycophantic court and clearly showed that Henry was severely disturbed and had an innacurate sense of self. Gregory really pounded home (really really pounded home) the reminder that Henry was fat, flatulent, and had a festering wound on his leg. Really, I can't tell you how many descriptions the various characters gave of Henry's stink. She also did an ok job with characterizing Katherine Howard. Katherine was presented as flighty and an unapolagetic teenage floozy. The final execution scene was really sad - Katherine was a ditz who really did not ask to mary Henry and did as she was told. I felt for her. I think her characterization of Jane Boleyn was good too. Gregory did a good job of conveying her self-importance and her delusions about the role she played in her sister-in-law and husband's downfall. I also think her portrayal of Anne of Cleves was plausible, explaining why she would have married Henry and why she was willing to agree that she was precontracted. However, Anne was a boring character and I didn't really care much about her.I thought that Rose Without a Thorn was a better portrayal of Katherine Howard. I can't really think of a better one about Anne of Cleves - I haven't read anything about her before. I'm sure there is something else out there. The novel, simply put, is not well written. I like my historical fiction to be more about politics rather than scandal. I couldn't really relate to any of the three women."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance picks up where The Other Boleyn Girl left off: Anne Boleyn and her brother George have been beheaded as traitors, Jane Seymour has died in childbirth, and King Henry is searching for his fourth wife. The story is told from the alternating points of view of three women central to this period in English history: Anne of Cleves, the unlucky fourth wife whom Henry despises almost from first sight; Katherine Howard, a maid to the queen who is almost as witless as she is beautiful, and Jane Boleyn, who sent her husband and sister-in-law to the gallows on the order of her uncle, whose scheming service she finds herself in once again. These three women struggle to survive in a court that can bless its favored with riches one minute and condemn them as traitors the next, each one longing to be free of the men who seek to control them, each doing whatever is necessary to survive.Gregory's books aren't for children - there's a fair amount of sex and sexual innuendo in them - but if schools taught history like this, we'd all have aced it."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Philippa Gregory is in fine form as she continues her examination of the Tudor era with the stories of Henry VIII's fourth and fifth wives (Anne of Cleves and Katharine Howard) as told by each other and their mutual lady-in waiting, Jane Boleyn (who as sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn helped send Henry's second queen to the block by testifying against her own husband (Anne's brother) and Anne.We all know the story, but it's the insight into what made these women tick that keeps you coming back for more: Anne's determination to escape a domineering brother (only to find herself in peril from an even more dangerous husband), Katherine's childish cunning and ultimate cluelessness in pursuit of a prize that gives her no joy, and Jane's deluded hopes of finding happiness at the end of a path of betrayal. The use of alternating voices, often to describe the same events, works very well here. I'm a big Gregory fan and would not hesitate to recommend this book to others who enjoy good historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Be warned, those who enjoyed the juicy romanticism of The Other Boleyn Girl may be disappointed here. But the facts of the story have a little less debauchery as history writes...The author was daring as she split her tale between several women's voices... and in the end wove them back together again. (I listened to this novel on my iPod, and this gave the story a better cohesion.)Lade Jane Rochford, Anne Boelyn's sister in law, whose husband went to the scaffold for incest with Queen Anne is the narrator.QUEEN- Anne of Cleves is a well drawn character.QUEEN- \\"Kitty\\" Howard is given a flippant air.and the Duke of Norfolk attempting the regain standing after the Howard girls' spiraling defeat.This novel gave meaning to many elements we could not understand looking back centuries later. It touched on the political structure and strings being pulled in Europe. It touched on the influence of the church and a wave of reform crashing through Europe.It spoke clearly of the tyrant Henry had become, touching on those whose livelihoods depended upon the moody man. The perspective on a monarchy, vassals and power within a court... these are the HIGHLIGHTS of this novel. Not the juicy (historical licensed) affairs and torrid romances in Henry's youth. In truth, the tone of the court had changed. Henry's focus, although always self serving, had changed. Be ready for the divergence.So this is not The Other Boleyn Girl. But the story told is a solid, entertaining one. And when you are writing about history, it is also well known the outcome. This is a fluffy, entertaining historical novel."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Henry VIII, especially the many intrigues surrounding politics and religion during his reign, not to mention his six wives, has always fascinated me. There is so much material that can be covered during and after his time as king of England that hundreds of books, novels and quite a few films and television series (including the latest on Showtime, The Tudors) have been created. And why not? His life was like a giant real-life soap opera. I read Philippa Gregory's The Other Boleyn Girl years ago, and I hadn't read any of her books centered on the Tudor dynasty ever since. The Wideacre trilogy was a great read (except for the third and last book), but I hadn't picked anything of hers ever since, and that was about two or three years ago. I recently picked up The Boleyn Inheritance, not knowing what to expect. This is one of the best historical novels set against Henry's reign I have read in a long time.Katherine of Aragon dies a lonely and undignified death after Henry divorces her, Anne Boleyn is beheaded for supposedly committing adultery, and Jane Seymour passes away shortly after giving birth to a son. Now it is time for Henry to take another wife. With France and Spain plotting against England, an alliance with the Cleves is necessary. And so, here enters Anne of Cleves. After enduring a power-hungry, abusive brother, Anne sees her marriage to King Henry as a ticket way out of her insufferable life at home. She imagines King Henry as he once was -- handsome and charming to the ladies. Instead, she gets an aging, overweight, angry bear of a man who rejects her after she publically humiliates him. He wants a divorce; she wants to remain the queen of England. Yet she knows what would happen to her if she dares to defy the man who has sent three women to an early grave. Her only option is to return back home to her abusive brother, ruined. But she can't let that happen. What will she do? Meanwhile, it appears that one of her ladies-in-waiting has gotten the king's attention. Katherine Howard is young, beautiful and flirty. She is also wise and sensual beyond her fourteen years. She loves to attract the attention of young men and think she is simply humoring a piggy-eyed old man when she flirts with the king. So imagine her life as King Henry's wife. This is all seen through the eyes of Jane Boleyn, Lady Richford. She is back in court after she made the testimony that destroyed both her late husband George and her sister-in-law. Now, under the Duke of Norfolk's demand, she must spy on Anne and Katherine. It appears that Anne Boleyn has left a legacy of tragedy and betrayal not only to her family, but also to all of England.This is a riveting read. Historians/anglophiles will probably find that this novel isn't very innovating. I for one thought it was fascinating. It's beautifully written, the first-person POV from all three protagonists are clear and well put-together. You never get them confused. Jane Boleyn is the most interesting one of the three. A woman whose testimony sent her husband and sister-in-law to the block, she wasn't likable at all in The Other Boleyn Girl, but it was never clear to me (at least not in the real-life events) whether she'd done it from her free will or if she'd been forced to make the testimony. This novel implies that she had indeed been persuaded into making that choice. As for Gregory's characterization, I appreciate the fact that Katherine Howard is depicted as nave and flighty in this novel. She is what I imagine most fourteen-year-old are like, vain and silly, which makes it especially jarring for me to know that Henry would marry a child. Then again, what could be expected from someone such as he? And also, they married them young in those times. It's like they were forced to go from children to adults at once. Out of all of his wives, with the exception of Katherine of Aragon, I think that Katherine Howard's demise is the saddest. I could understand why she'd want to be with men her own age and not with one old enough to be her father or even her grandfather. Philippa Gregory humanizes these three women in more ways than one. I enjoyed The Boleyn Inheritance and I look forward to reading Gregory's other books set in the Tudor era. I've already got The Constant Princess lined up."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Historical Romance is focused on female readers. As a male I have, however, enjoyed this genre. Philippa Gregory's latest book concerns itself with the lives of two women who had the great misfortue to be wed to the 300 pound tyrant known as Henry VIII. Jane Boleyn the sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn is also spolighted. Henry reigned from 1509 until his death in 1547. The story is told in short chapters in which the reader is addressed by the three women who share their stories.1. Anne of Cleves-She is the German princess who was wed to Henry in January, 1540. The wedding was a political one in which the Protestant Anne would link Cleves with England in case of an attack by France or Spain, Anne had a miserable life being ruled by a harsh mother and a cruel brother. She was only married for six months before Henry had it declared that she had previously been in an earlier relationship; this meant she was no longer a virgin when she came to his commodious bed. The marriage was probably not intimate. Anne was allowed to keep her head. She lived out her sad life on a distant estate; she died ten years after Henry. She did live in fear that the evil king would implicate her in a plot against the throne. This did not happen. Anne was kind, smart and religious. She impresses the reader as the best of the three women whose tales are told by Gregory.2. Katherine \\"Kit\\" Howard was a 15 year old girl when she was forced to wed 48 year old Henry. She was used as a pawn by the Howard family to ultimately seize power once Henry was dead and Kit produced a male heir.Katherine had affairs with Francis Denham and Thomas Culpepper. Both of these men would be executed by Henry. She was fatuous, flirty and comes across as a naive young girl who died tragically upon the block on February 13, 1542. Gregory's writing about young Katherine practicing her death by borrowing the execution block is the best part of the novel.3. Jane Boleyn is a despicable character. She was the sister in law of the beheaded second wife of Henry the infamous Anne Boleyn. She testified that her husband and Anne's brother George had engaged in incest. Anne and George were duly executed. In this novel, Jane schemes to keep her properties. Her fate would not be happy as she spied on both Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard.Towering above all these women is the towering figure Henry VIII. At the time of the novel he is grossly obese, suffering from a running wound on his bad leg and is an oversexed monster of self indulgence.This book was better than I thought it would be. Gregory can hold the reader's interest but some of her other books are livelier and better."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I believe this is my fifth Philippa Gregory book and, while (to me) it is not nearly as good as The Other Boleyn Girl, it's an entertaining read nonetheless. The Boleyn Inheritance is told from the alternating first person perspectives of Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard and Jane Boleyn, each short chapter jumping between these three lesser known females who inhabited Henry VIII's court. I enjoyed Gregory's exploration of sweet and simple Anne of Cleves (Henry's fourth wife), dimwitted and self -absorbed Katherine Howard (Henry's fifth wife) and scheming yet tormented Jane Boleyn (lady in waiting to Anne and Katherine as well as sister-in-law to Anne Boleyn). Anyone who enjoys historical fictional, particularly involving Henry VIII and his wives, will likely enjoy this book ... but just do not expect to enjoy it as much as The Other Boleyn Girl."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"The Boleyn Inheritance gave me an unexpected passion for Anne of Cleves. Little is known about her and I found this book to be a great history lesson. (Wouldn't it be nice to have learned history this way in school? If so, I would have been a history major for sure.) I very much enjoyed her strength and even though I knew she wouldn't end up on the block, I found myself nervous for her all the same.Katherine Howard was another poor little girl caught in the web of her family's plot for position. Phillipa Gregory portrayed her as a self-centered, yet naive girl who I wanted to rescue.Jane Boleyn is portrayed as a woman without a soul and always carrying out her family's wishes no matter what the cost. But even at her end, I wished her better.I feel P.G. did another excellent job bringing the 16th century to life. Although this book is historical fiction, it's altogether possible that the stories of these three women's lives could actually hold some truth.A really good history lesson once again."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Wow, what a book! Life in 16th century Europe was some kinda scary. Read this sequel, find out what happens to everyone at court after the death of Anne Boleyn.

She is truly an outstanding historical fiction writer, much better than the current \\"romance\\" or historical fiction writers that are so popular with Oprah and other book clubs. This book is one of the best by Philippa Gregory; I couldn't put it down. Definitely a must read for anyone interested in the Tudor era or in a good story."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"While not as excellent as The Other Boleyn Girl, The Boleyn Inheritance is a darn great read! It has intrigue, romance, murder, lust, betrayal, suspense, humor, irony....I read this 500 page book in 5 days, it kept me reading late at night. (Not something I do often with a toddler who wears me out during the day!) There wasn't a boring page through the entire thing- the 3 main characters Queen Anne, Queen Katherine and Jane Boleyn are not to be forgotten. Each are intriguing in their own way and their stories pull you in. Even if you aren't very familiar with this period in time, like myself, you can still enjoy this book because the author does a good job at setting the background, filling in information and giving you tidbits of knowledge. The author's attention to detail is superb. Gregory does it again!!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I have read the Boleyn books by Philippa Gregory and found this one to be just as interesting as The Other Boleyn Sister and The Constant Princess (which I love). This one focuses on three different women, two queens and one woman who waited on both of them. The characters are all different from one another and makes for a great juicy story. I am not familiar with these women during the later years of Henry's life, so I am not reading this to get an accurate sense of the history piece. I read this for entertainment and perhaps get my curiousity piqued, which it did.I think of all the characters in this book, Anne is my favorite. She is the only wife to have survive Henry's wrath (besides Katherine Parr, who just merely survived Henry's death). She was raised in a strict Protestant home by a strict mother and a loving father. Her brother arranged for her to marry Henry, and their marriage really was made for political reasons. In spite of Henry's aversion to her, he treated her well, even though she ended her life alone without children ten years after he had died. She used her head throughout the tumultous reign of Henry and the reader can sense the fear, hopes and sadness of this woman.The next person is Kitty Howard, a young pawn in the Duke of Norfolk's hands as he greedily schemes for power to put the next Howard/Boleyn child on the throne. Kitty in this book is a vain and not very smart woman, more concerned with getting \\"presents\\" and being surrounded by handsome men, beautiful things and laughter. She really is a child and it is hard not to feel sympathy for this character because she is young and silly and a very weak pawn in the game of chess her uncle was playing with the future of England at sake.And Lady Jane. I wish I had the copy of The Other Boleyn Sister on hand so I could go back and refer to it again. I have to think that this woman is the most deluded character of this book. She betrayed her husband and her sister-in-law out of jealousy. She watched them die and she managed to escape from death by the graces of her uncle, the same Duke of Norfolk. Sent to court to help Anne of Cleve, she also betrayed her by saying that the queen's marriage was not valid since she was precontracted before. (To Anne's credit, she didn't deny it even though it meant a lonely life for her without a spouse or children. However, in comparison to the other queens, it was worth it.) Lady Jane then tries to lure Kitty down the path of destruction by arranging Kitty to meet with Thomas, her lover in hopes that Kitty will get pregnant and that child will be the future king of England, thus restoring the Boleyn/Howard lineage to royalty. Lady Jane really is a pathetic character who is also repulsive.I am currently watching that popular Showtime series, \\"The Tudors\\" and this book is fueling my interest in the Tudor family again. It isn't hard to imagine Henry getting older, fatter and more insane. It is a fascinating look into the royals of that time ... but it is also sad to realize, that things have not really changed all that much since then.This is an excellent read and a wonderful insight to two queens that I know nothing about. It is an excellent insight to human nature as a novelist can provide. This is a wonderful rainy day book. If you like historical fiction, you will like this one. The stories are interwoven and easily followable. It is just a fanastic book!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"While it certainly shouldn't be taken as gospel, Gregory's novel provides some very interesting insight into a dangerous era in English history, where the people were subject to the whims of a once golden prince who had descended to the ranks of any petty tyrant. This book ought to be required reading for those who insist that the past was a kinder, gentler place and that violence is peculiar to modern society. Henry VIII is just one proof that those who stand in the way of a despot are liable to pay with their very lives.The book is told from shifting perspectives, which makes it all the more interesting and rounded. Perhaps the most intriguing character is that of Lady Jane Rochford, the same woman whose testimony assured that her husband, George, and his sister, the infamous Anne Boleyn, were beheaded. Gregory makes quite a villain of Lady Jane but her portrayal is also that of a woman determined to see to her own well-being and life, whatever the consequences and whatever the price. Gregory makes the argument here that, while Lady Jane may not have been entirely in her right mind, she was also subject to the whims of the Duke of Norfolk, whose endless schemes ensured that no one was sacred, that two nieces could be used as pawns in his endless struggle for power and position. Though Lady Jane isn't exactly a sympathetic character, the duke almost makes he look like a kitten. As a pair, these two can't help but send a chill up the reader's spine.A second perspective is that of Anne of Cleves. Eager to escape her boorish brother, Anne arrives in England eager to prove herself a good queen and to do what she can to better the nation. Unfortunately for her, she unknowingly insults one of the most vain kings in history and is thus blown about by the storms of his anger for the rest of her life. I found Anne to be perhaps the most well drawn and appealing of the three. She is a woman doing her best to survive on her wits alone and she cannot depend on any man to offer her protection. Though her ambassador does try his best to help her, it is ultimately Gregory's Anne who survives through sheer cleverness and a canny attention to the changes of the world around her. She was the only one of Henry's wives to meet a good end and Gregory does an excellent job of arguing that this is due to her intelligence.The third perspective is that of Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Howard, an empty-headed teen who is shallow but also pitiable. Kitty is a notorious flirt who thinks of nothing beyond counting her possessions and making every man she meets fall in love with her. This is not to say that she is a strictly unlikable character for I found it hard not to feel sorry for her when her uncle uses her to catch the eye of a vain and foolish king, who thinks himself her equal in looks and youth. When Kitty's past comes to light, the king quickly grows disenchanted with her and the poor young woman will pay the ultimate cost for the follies of youth.The portrayal of the lives of these three women is so extraordinarily vivid that it is downright visceral at times. Gregory really breathes life into the past and shows that it was every bit as dramatic and suspenseful as anything the modern soap opera can cook up. What is truly disturbing about the book is the way in which women are used by men--and by the Duke of Norfolk and Henry VIII in particular. It must be distasteful and frightening for any modern woman to reflect on the treatment of women in those times. The king had the power to make any wild accusations against a woman who had displeased him and she was powerless to defend herself in any manner. Gregory does a wonderful job of showing how these women cope with that power--Kitty, who tries to go along with orders; Lady Jane, who tries to profit from them; and Anne, who uses her brains to protect herself from them. It's a truly chilling and harrowing read."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a good historical read, particulary for Phillipa Gregory fans. It focuses on three women who lived during the reign of Henry VIII.The first is his 4th wife, Anne of Cleves, perhaps the least known of all of Henry's wives. The marriage was short, certainly in part for the reason's Ms Gregory suggests, but primarily because of the shifting politics of Europe during the Reformation. She nonetheless managed the remarkable feat of not only surviving her husband, but remaining in England as his \\"beloved sister\\". This could not have been a comfortable post, given Henry's increasing bad temper and failing health. Tormented by an ulcer in his leg and used to a lifetime of deference and flattery, he became truly monstrous in his dealings with his family and associates. Ms Gregory deftly describes a court constantly on edge and terrified of him.Katherine Howard, Henry's 5th wife, is better known, primarily because she followed her cousin Anne Boleyn to the block on Tower Green. Her story is a tragedy of family manipulation, naivete and young lust.The most interesting character is Jane Boleyn, Anne's sister-in-law, whose testimony almost certainly doomed her husband George, and his sister Anne to execution. Who was this lady? Having escaped great danger when her husband and sister in law were executed, what possessed her to return to court and apparently assist another Queen to commit adultery? Ms Gregory makes a good effort with this, but it doesn't really explain this strange person.In summary, this book sheds some interesting light on two lesser known women who lived at Henry VIII's court. One fault: It is written in the present tense, which was probably meant to convey immediacy but is both distracting and pretentious."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Just when you though the Boleyns were exhausted, Gregory breathes new life into one or the other! One of her best!

It's an entirely absorbing story, made even more so because it's from the perspective of Anne Boleyn's sister. A great dimension in melding history lesson and human experience. Very well written, sopped with medieval court intrigue..very much an insider's view. Although very little is revealed about the daily life of \\"commoners\\", one feels totally involved in the lives of the noble characters."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"This is a review on the audio book version of The Boleyn Inheritance. Read by three different women.This is the story of Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn, and Katherine Howard. Having read all of the other Phillipa Gregory books (The Constant Princess, The Other Boleyn girl, The Queens Fool, and The Virgin's Lover) I already knew the story surrounding King Henry the VIII court. This book, which goes back before The Queens Fool and The Virgins Lover to the time after Anne Boleyn's beheading and the death of Jane Seymour, to Henry's 4th Wife Anne of Cleves who was a German girl, supposedly very plain and pretty much unworthy of Henry's advances. It also is about Jane Boleyn the widow of George Boleyn the brother of Anne who was executed for treason. And Katherine Howard a girl of 16 years, cousin to the Boleyn's, who catches Henry's eye at court and eventually becomes his fifth wife after he annuls his marriage to Anne of Cleves.All three women are coming from a different place in court, and all three go through so many changes throughout the book. Having three different women read this was an amazing idea, and worked out very well. Anne has a German accent, Jane is calm and collected and Katherine is as giddy and immature as a 16 year old is supposed to be.The Boleyn Inheritance, for each woman, is different. Anne inherits the duties of being queen to a King that is no longer handsome and virile, he is now fat and sick and quite mad with power. Jane inherits her dead husbands and dead sister in laws duties of progressing the family name and fortune not knowing of course that her own neck is on the line, and Katherine inherits the bad fortune of being just another pawn in her families game. I couldn't imagine going into a marriage, as Anne of Cleves did, knowing that 3 wives before you are dead and your husband has the power to anytime pronounce you either a witch or traitor and off goes your head! Thank god she escapes the block, and quite literally remains untouched by the stench of Henry's heavy hand. Jane, on the other hand, gets what is coming to her having betrayed her own flesh and blood to save her own neck; she eventually loses it in the end anyway. Poor Katherine, or Kitty Howard has the brains of a gnat and a libido of a horny rabbit, she follows her hormones right onto the executioners axe. Henry, who we got to know in earlier books as a handsome brilliant and lively young king has turned into a festering obese impotent old king and he has the habit of covering his own faults by pronouncing people treacherous. The mans legacy is written in blood, and his only good doing was fathering the princess Elizabeth who later revives England into its golden age.I completely recommend anyone who loves Phillipa Gregory, The Tudors, or just a really good read to pick this book up, in audio form or paperback. Its worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"Having been fascinated by \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", I was very much looking forward to \\"The Boleyn Inheritance\\" and was not disappointed. A sort of sequel, the latter carries forward a character from the first book, Jane Boleyn, and also includes Henry's fourth and fifth wives, Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard. The story moves forward through alternating accounts of events by the three women. In my opinion, the author does a good job of capturing each one's spirit and voice. In addition, the story is fairly accurate historically, so provided a starting point for additional research on Henry and his wives."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It is a longish book but I flew through it. At first, I was kind of thinking \\"been there, done that.\\" But as I read more and more, I was drawn in by the multiple points of view - Anne of Cleves, Jane Boleyn, and Katherine Howard. Gregory does a wonderful job of showing their unique personalities. I have to admit one of my favorite things was how Katherine (Kitty) Howard - a 14 year old teenager at the time she married Henry - would open her segments with how many gifts and dresses she had been given/had.Even if you already know a lot about Henry the eighth and his many wife, this is a great addition to the Gregory's series on this segment of history."},{"Title":"The Boleyn Inheritance","review":"One of Philipa Gregory's finest novels - as intriguing and captivating as \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". Each woman is portrayed in a unique and captivating way that depicts Tudor England at it's best and worst. You commiserate with each of the three main characters as they struggle to overcome the sordid ambition of the men in their lives. Anne of Cleves - a clever and naive young woman; shunned by both her family and her husband, the King. Catherine Howard - an energetic and often spoiled teenager; no more than a pawn to her Uncle, the Duke of Norfolk; and Mary Boleyn, often portrayed as a less than desirable historical figure is here portrayed as a woman simply doing her best to survive in a society where the faintest whisper or thought could cost her her life.\\"The Boleyn Inheritence\\" is exciting, captivating, and beautifully written. A MUST read for any lover of historical fiction!"},{"Title":"Causes of the Iraq War (The Road to War: Causes of Conflict)","review":"The first thing to understand is that we really do not have a historical perspective on the \\"Causes of the Iraq War\\" the way we do the American Revolution, Civil War, World War I and World War II, which are the other volumes in The Road to War: Causes of Conflict. George W. Bush is still in the White House and except for Colin Powell all of the members of the Bush administration listed among the Notable Figures at the start of Jim Gallagher's book still hold their positions. What these figures will say after they are out of office, when they start writing their memoirs, will provide information and insights that historians will find interesting. Then there is what might come out during the trial of Saddam Hussein, and while I think it is safe to say that few people expect any weapons of mass destruction to be found, you have to assume there are key things that are not known to the general public and the future historians of the Gulf War.Gallagher begins with \\"A Deadline for War,\\" with Bush's ultimatum for Saddam to step down, based on the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, which gave Iraq a \\"final opportunity\\" to disarm. Saddam agreed to comply with UNSCOM inspections, but when initial reports indicated this was not the case, Bush declared Saddam's time had run out and 90-minutes after the deadline had passed, the Iraq War began. The next chapter, \\"Colonialism, Nationalism, and Oil,\\" looks at the root causes for the Iraq War (and the Gulf War), coming back to when the Ottoman Empire took control of Mesopotamia. What is fascinating here is how Kuwait remained an emirate, since eventually so much oil would be discovered underneath it; if Kuwait had always been a part of Iraq, how different would recent history have been? This chapter does a good job of detailing the complex relationship between Iraq and Kuwait over the centuries.The third chapter, \\"Rising Tensions in the Gulf,\\" focuses on how the rise of the Baath Party in Iraq and Iran becoming an Islamic republic led to the Iran-Iraq War. Gallagher explains how the aftermath of the war led Saddam to invade Kuwait. The Gulf War is covered in the next chapter, \\"The World Responds,\\" as well as the aftermath with the conditions the U.N. Security Council set for peace, which included ordering Iraq to get rid of its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs. What happens here is not so much an explanation of the causes, but a rather comprehensive chronology of events for a book aimed at this age group.The fifth chapter reveals the key causes of the Iraq War in its title, \\"The Threat of WMD.\\" This is not a claim that Iraq had WMDs, but rather that in the context of September 11th, the \\"war on terrorism,\\" and the invasion of Afghanistan, the threat of Iraq acquiring them warranted taking action. The key sentence in this chapter talks about how key players in the administration \\"argued that a preemptive war launched to prevent a future attack could be considered self-defense, rather than a war of aggression.\\" This becomes the central element of the Bush Doctrine. When the National Security Advisor and the director of the CIA were declaring publicly that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, young readers can see how war became inevitable. Again, Gallagher details the chronology of events that led step by step to Bush's ultimatum and the start of the Iraq War.The final chapter is entitled \\"The Occupation of Iraq,\\" not just because the Iraq War only lasted five weeks, but because the occupation has proven to be much more dangerous. In this chapter Gallagher critiques the official justifications for the war, that Iraq had WMDs and links to terrorists, and finds both to be weak. He does grant that Saddam Hussein was a murderous tyrant, and teachers and students alike should go back and read this book again in light of these revelations to consider again the causes that had been laid out to make their own judgments as to what really caused the war. The information provided here, just in terms of laying out all of the events that led up to the Iraq War, is the most impressive part of the book and hopefully students will appreciate the level of detail because it does allow them to make up their own minds about this ongoing controversy (which will certainly not end after long after the occupation, for which there is currently no real end in sight). Since these events served as the basis for the current U.S. foreign policy, knowing about them is important for any decision regarding continuing, changing, or abandoning the Bush Doctrine, which is going to be the key political debate for the foreseeable future.The back of the book includes a Glossary of terms from \\"autonomous\\" to \\"weapons of mass destruction,\\" which appear in bold type in the text. There are to lists of books for Further Reading, one for Students and the other for Older Readers, to go along with Internet Resources that can be checked out as well (with descriptions of what you will find there and who runs the site). The book is illustrated with color photographs and maps, including images you may well have seen on the television or in magazines (which also makes this book seem like it is not yet a history book). Hopefully this series will be continued, with volumes devoted to other wars throughout history. Obviously there are more wars in which the United States has fought (e.g., War of 1812, Spanish-American War, Vietnam War), but there is no reason that this series cannot be expanded to include other conflicts as well (e.g., the 100 Years War, the Crimean War, the Six-Day War, etc.)."},{"Title":"Causes of the Iraq War (The Road to War: Causes of Conflict)","review":"The \\"Road to War: Causes of Conflict\\" series from OTTN Publishing features outstanding titles that introduce young readers in grades 4 through 6 to the causes of five American wars over the last two hundred years that saw significant American involvement.

I found The Keeper's Son to be a particularly good read; it was believable, well crafted, exciting and informative. In short, all the things one likes in a book. The Ambassador's Son was touted to be its immediate sequel. Perhaps. It struck me as contrived, formulaic, short on logic and long on suspension of belief and coincidence. In short, a major disappointment. This book is a miss. Too bad"},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"I haven't read the first Josh Thurlow book yet. The great Francis Livingston cover painting caught my eye (I'd love to find a framed print or copy of it) and the synopsis told me this was the kind of book I love for beach reading: Action, history, some tongue-in-cheek historical figures moving through, tropical settings, fast boats on balmy seas, headhunters and cargo cults... All in all a pretty good formula for a fun read.The book annoyed me somewhat: I found Capt. Thurlow's misfit crew to be pretty much one-dimensional and interchangable.Most annoying was the characters referring to the Japanese as \\"Jap,\\" the way the British used to call their German enemies \\"Jerry.\\" \\"I want to get back at Jap,\\" or \\"Jap doesn't like being on the defensive,\\" being examples. I've read more accounts of the Pacific War than I can count, and I've never heard of American GIs referring to the Japanese in that manner. Mr. Hickam's research seems to be top-notch, so perhaps he found a credible source that I'm not aware of that led him to use that bit of slang. But it was still annoying...The story is pretty good, even if it takes awhile to get going. There's a bit of mystery as Thurlow and his boys go after a Marine officer who's gone native. JFK is here, but he really doesn't do much for most of the book. And there's an implausible reason Thurlow has to either capture or eliminate the Marine officer.The cargo cult stuff is fun, but kind of secondary to the main plot. The cult chief and his big plot is supposed to be interwoven with the renegade Marine's story, but that aspect of the yarn doesn't really gell together. Richard Nixon and a couple other notable folks wander through as well. And there's a section with a Japanese pilot that's somewhat puzzling...Although I almost put this book down in the beginning, I stuck it out it did get better as it went along and wound up being a fairly compelling read by the time I got to the last 1/4 of the book. I'd definitely recommend it for some light, action-packed beach reading. If you like the tropics, PT boats, beautiful native girls with flowers in their hair and misfit Americans trying to make sense of it all, you could do a lot worse than this book."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"This was perhaps the most contrived and ridiculous story I have read in many years. I enjoyed the Keeper's Son and October Sky, but this book was truly horrendous. Imagine, Jack Kennedy and Richard Nixon and James Michener and all the characters from Keeper's Son all in one place! Plus cannibals and naked native girls. The only character missing was Elvis."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Given the pre-publication Amazon blurbs for this I had moderate hopes for a more nuanced exposition of the ultimately devastating affects of the Pacific War on the Solomon Islanders, ex-pats and servicemen, including JFK, engaged there.Bad mistake.Sadly, for those even remotely interested in recent history - never mind historical fiction - this very amateur effort is a travesty. There is little to engage either mind or spirit in such a poorly-researched (which is not to say an altogether poorly-written) book. The islanders are portrayed as cargo-cultists, savages and cannibals. The ex-pats who made this part of God's paradise their home, are hardly better served, and ALL the women serve as nothing more than \\"love interests\\" of the leading American male characters.And let's talk about them. Ostensibly about Josh Thurlow (a cardboard cutout)and his erstwhile Coastguard crew (including a black pilot - VERY rare, though not wholly implausible even in the 1940, a most un-PC period), this book has been marketed to innocent readers as a truer-than-fiction account of Jack Kennedy at war (with guest appearances by Dick Nixon and Byron White, future Supreme Court Justice, among others). This is utter nonsense.And as for Hickam's expressed opinion that this wartime episode represented \\"very nearly the last time John F. Kennedy was truly a happy man\\" [page 337] - what a bunch of bananas!!!This infantile tripe masquerading as a good read is an affront to anyone who served in the Pacific War, never mind those who suffered its immediate affects or those who lived and worked in the Pacific theatre - pre and post war. And don't get me started about the anachronisms!Given all of this I should not have been surprised - but nevertheless still was - when the author's mediocrity met mendacity - with Hickam's totally unsupported and vicious implication that Rosemary Kennedy was lobotomised because her father may have sexually abused her. [have a look at pages 261-262 and tell me I've read too much into the text].I've read a lot of bloody awful calumnies against the Kennedys but this is amongst the worst.OK, Joe Sr. wasn't a saint. And from the perspective of our so-superior-more-enlightened-times, it does seem obscene that a paterfamilias decided (sans consultation with either wife or children) to embark on a relatively untested surgical procedure for his daughter. However, it was one that, at the time, promised to ameliorate the increasingly violent and uncontrollable behaviour of his beloved - and retarded - 3rd child (sloppily and mistakenly described as JFK's older sister in Hickam's book - page 126: \\"Well there's Rosemary. She's the oldest of the girls. In fact, she;s the first born of all the Kennedy kids\\", and; \\"Ready sensed Kennedy's discomfort in talking about his older sister\\")- and who, until that moment, had lived her entire life openly at home with her family (which WAS ver unusual for the period).It's an outrageous and unforgivable slur.Which is not to say that The Ambassador's Son is a complete waste of time.It's just to warn the uninitiated that this tome provides a wholly unrealistic portrayal of almost everything it seeks to enlighten us about."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Just finished Hickam's last Thurlow epic. I was enthralled throughout. Great characters, though far tougher and more nuanced than in the Keeper's Son. Once a reader is immersed in Hickam's Thurlow world, it is as if you have stepped into a vivid, non-stop place. This is not a standard World War II novel. There is something very different about the Thurlow stories. For one thing, there is woven in the text a spirit unlike anything I've ever read. Penelope and Joe Gimmee and Dave the megapode are all more spirits than real it seemed to me. There are matters of the heart and soul that peek out through the story that are perhaps disappointing to anyone who just wants to read a war story. Hickam's Thurlow novels are going for something else and this one has cranked up everything a notch. I quite often laughed out loud at the very comic style of some scenes and then the next page I was immersed in a terrible battle that was so real, it seemed like I was a part of. Maybe Hickam, who is a combat veteran of Vietnam, is bringing out the insanity of war. He's a writer to watch, this one, but not one to read if all you want is the ordinary."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"I can easily say that Homer Hickam is my favorite author. I was hooked when I read The Rocket Boys (October Sky) and Sky of Stone. Every book Mr. Hickam has written has been just as good as or better than the previous book, which is VERY high praise. Hickam manages to spin creative tales with interesting characters and interesting plot lines, time after time.Some authors, after a little success, begin to get predictable, or they begin to lose their creative edge. Not so with Homer Hickam! In my opinion, there are two authors that consistently produce outstanding works - the great John Grisham and Homer Hickam. I can only hope that Mr. Hickam's career as an author turns out to include as many books as John Grisham has produced.This is a wonderful, epic tale of World War II life, and, even for younger readers like myself, born two decades after World War II, we can almost feel like we knew what it was like to be there. I mean no disrespect to the honorable World War II veterans (and all other veterans) out there - I truly appreciate your service and I thank you for all that you did.For a good, entertaining read, RUN OUT AND BUY THE AMBASSADOR'S SON!

I saw the movie October Sky and thought the guy was a rocket scientist but then read Rocket Boys and his other Coalwood books and was impressed by his ability to write. These \\"Josh Thurlow\\" novels are certainly a long way from his first novels but I also noted with some surprise that he wrote Torpedo Junction, an excellent U-boat non-fiction book I'd read many years before October Sky came along. So now that I've read both Josh Thurlows, I'm interested in anything else he has to write. The Ambassador's Son seems to me to be a bit \\"Catch 22-ish,\\" though not so outlandish as that novel, a bit Michener's \\"Tales of the South Pacific\\" and also a bit of Hickam's wit and wisdom he showed in the Coalwood/Rocket books. Thurlow is intriguing as he is quite often wrong, very wrong in fact, in how he sees things. He has evolved quite a bit in the two books. He seemed simpler and sweeter in \\"The Keeper's Son\\" but has hardened in Ambassador's. Hickam is a clever writer and just when you think you're onto him, he switches gears. Quite often, he made me laugh. Both Penelope and Felicity in this novel are caricatures, yet I fell in love with both of them. How could a man not fall for women who are as likely to kill you as love you? The novel can be approached as an adventure, pure and simple, or, as I think it deserves, as a deeply moving tale of humans cracking under a great deal of pressure.

For my money, this author delivers. What a great story of life, love, adventure, sex, and war in the South Pacific. Jack Kennedy is perfectly cast as Josh's sidekick. The cameos by Dick Nixon, James Michener, and Whizzer White had great dramatic effect. Hickam is an author who does his homework. He also is a writer who will make you laugh. His style is a combination of Steinbeck and Twain. Once you get into the rhythm of it, it's impossible to stop turning the pages. Great characters, great plot, great writing.

This is an adventure story that moves along at a rapid pace, but doesn't drown the reader in too many small details. That is a trick for an author writing a fiction book about historical events. You have to add details, but not enough that you lose the story for the reader. Hickam is one of the best at doing this. To read this book, it helps to Read Hickams other book \\"The keepers son\\".

I would recommend that one read \\"The Keeper's son, in order to know more about Josh Thurlowe and crew. I did miss the characters of Killakeet, but came to really enjoy the new ones in \\" The Ambassador's Son\\". Pongo, Dave, Felicity and Penelope where a great additions.

I don't know how he does it, but I hope he keeps it up.Jeff EdwardsAuthor of \\"Torpedo\\""},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Homer Hickam has such an easy style of writing that it makes me mad! I'm an aspiring novelist and it bums me that he makes it look so easy. I've recently heard him speak so I can tell you he is also a very good out loud story teller. But he also gives good tips on writing to future writers so I can't fault him because of that.Anyway, about this novel. I read The Keeper's Son and looked forward to reading about Josh Thurlow's further adventures along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. But,, no, he's in the South Pacific now (duh, maybe I should have looked at the cover), My favorite character from \\"Keeper's\\" was Dosie Crossan but she's not in this one except for a letter early on that makes Josh thinks they're no longer a couple. So this frees him to go after other women. How typically male! But I have to confess that Josh is not actively chasing women so much as they seem to just be there and very interested in well, what you might expect hot-blooded women in the tropics to be interested in.But to the plot. There's a missing Marine officer and it looks like he's kidnapped the beautiful young native wife of a Solomon Island colonist who also heads up a vicious native militia. Of course that's bad but it gets worse when Josh finds out the officer is a close relative of President Roosevelt. Josh also knows the man. But Josh is given the assignment to go after him to bring him back dead or alive. And so begins an adventurous chase across the South Pacific with young JFK recruited to help out. Josh, however, gets stranded on an island with a mysterious nearly naked native woman who soon seduces him. Her name is Penelope and she carries a mean machete which she uses to dispatch men with some abandon. In any case, JFK must carry out the mission.A character is introduced in this novel who I really liked and identified with. She is Felicity, a colonial woman who is trying to get back to her copra plantation. A tough woman, no great beauty, but still sexy, she is quite capable of using her pistol to blow away anybody who gets in her way. She is also the mother of all mothers, protective of her young son who is with her. She hooks up with JFK, helps him and teaches him a few lessons, too. I have to say it was very interesting to learn something of life on a copra plantation of that era. It was also interesting to learn more about young JFK. Hickam is a great researcher based on his non-fiction Torpedo Junction as well as The Keeper's Son. I trust him here, especially since Nigel Hamilton, JFK's biographer, vouched for his research. I learned a couple of things about Jack Kennedy and his family I never suspected. Also, learned something about young Richard \\"Nick\\" Nixon! The poker game between him, JFK, and \\"Jimmy\\" Michener is priceless.My boy friend read the book after me and really liking it, pronouncing it a \\"guy\\" book but I didn't see it that way at all. I am very much a woman and thought it was a romantic book, in a sort of bloody adventurous way. Anyway, I guess bottom line is I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"This is my kind of book, filled with adventure and great characters. I love books about islands and tropical places, too, so I was really attracted by the cover. I hadn't read anything by Hickam so didn't know what to expect but now I'm going to go back and read everything he's written. A little about this story. The hero is Josh Thurlow, a Coast Guard captain, and he's in the Solomon Islands, given the job by the Marines to go find a Marine Lieutenant who apparently has deserted. The Lieutenant is related to the President so it's a tough assignment since Josh is also supposed to kill the man. Along the way, Jack Kennedy, yes JFK himself, joins Josh and the others, and also Dick Nixon, yes tricky Dick himself. If that sounds sort of outlandish, the way Hickam writes it, it all makes sense. Both Kennedy and Nixon were there at the same time. They have this great poker game which I laughed all the way through. I love the style of this writer and like I said, I'm going to go back and read all his stuff. Try it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Homer Hickam knows how to write a romantic adventure novel in an age when so few do. He's the new Jack London. He is, based on his past books, a thorough researcher. I suspect in the guise of fiction, he's letting us know a few things about the Kennedy legend that we've swallowed gullibly over the decades. This isn't to say that JFK is handled roughly in this novel. Not at all. When Josh Thurlow needs help, \\"Shafty\\" Kennedy is there. This is a tour de force, a roman a clef, that grabs the reader from the first and carries us across the grand, wild South Pacific of the early 1940's. A Marine officer is missing and along with him the beautiful native wife of a local colonist. Josh and his boys have to find him. Why? He's the cousin to FDR, the President of the United States. He's also the son of an ambassador. What follows is a sometimes tongue-in-cheek (too bad the reviewer from Australia didn't realize that part of American humor) escapade that brings out the humanity of all concern. Certainly, the women on board are presented as strong, competent types who confound expectations. There's Penelope, Josh Thurlow's guide across New Georgia. And Felicity, the colonist who loves her plantation more than her life and iis willing to risk all to save it. Josh gets more complex each novel. He's a rough sort who goes a bit mushy around certain women, even Penelope who lops men's heads off, a warrior queen. Nixon's cameo appearance is great. I learned something about him, too. And all the others including Joe Gimmee were good characters. It's good to track what's happening to Josh's friend Eureka Phimble, too. Although a black man in a time of discrimination, he's advanced to pilot of the crew's PBY aircraft. The PBY has apparently been built by Josh's resourceful crew from scrap. Hickam doesn't say how Phimble gets to be pilot but it's clear he hasn't had formal training. I hope the author will get to this back story in another novel in the series as Bernard Cornwell has done in the Sharpe series where novels fill in the cracks. No matter. Certainly, the author kept me guessing all the way on what was going to happen next. Bottom line is I loved this novel and look forward to more in the series including maybe a prequel where we'll find out how Josh and Phimble met in the Arctic. Also I hope we'll read more about Dosie from The Keeper's Son. She's a great character in her own right."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Ever since reading \\"The Keeper's Son\\" I knew that its hero, Captain Josh Thurlow, was headed for bigger things. As WWII escalates, Thurlow is moved from his home waters of the Outer Banks of North Carolina to the mysterious and dangerous jungles of the Solomon Islands.Hickam weaves a gripping tale with Thurlow and his quirky Outer Banks crew, carrying out a mission that makes it clear that friends and foes are not always clearly defined. Along the way, they work with real-life heroes such as JFK and interact with the native population and expatriates who have been swept up in the war.Hickam's fame comes from his autobiographical \\"Rocket Boys\\" (made into the movie \\"October Sky\\") but his best writing to date comes in the less restricted environment of fiction. It is clear that Hickam did his research in making this story accurate and believable. Anyone who enjoys a fast-paced action tale will love \\"The Ambassador's Son\\"."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"This book just feels lazy. I miss the old day's when I couldn't put Hickam's books down as I read about rockets, and boyhood dreams, life in a coal town, in a small town, of the struggles within. I miss the painstakingly researched and detailed account of the submarine battles off the east coast in Torpedo Junction. I even miss the wild ride back to the moon.Now I am stuck with boring one dimensional characters with poor choice and often confusing adverb-names such as Once, Again, and Ready. Well once again, I was ready for Hickam's magic that he showed in earlier books, but this his by far his worst attempt. The book just wreaks of laziness, impossible events, insulting \\"historical\\" fantasy, and \\"fantastic\\" coincidences. It seems as if Hickam is going for another movie deal because the things that happen in this book can and will only happen in the movie theaters - no check that - late night B grade movies on TV.Take this masterful passage:\\"I can't do it!\\" Fisheye cried. \\"It's Ichikawa-san!\\"\\"Yes, and in a second, he's going to fall back, get on our tail, and that'll be the end of us.\\"Fisheye knew Phimble was right. Ichikawa was still waving at him, nodding, and smiling. Fisheye swiveled his gun around, sighted along it long snout, and pulled the trigger.\\"Three big slugs slammed into Ichikawa's engine. It sputtered a few times, then Died. Ichikawa was surprised, but then grateful that his friend Fisheye had become such a fierce warrior that he would unleash a suprise attack, even on a friend. He was proud that he was such a good teacher. He had turned the simple American into a true Samurai! He waved to Fisheye in salute; then he could no longer hold his Rufe level, mainly because Fisheye had fired again, this time directly into the Rufe's canopy. The Rufe fell away, spiraling into the sea. There was no Parachute.\\"??? Blech! That is insulting to the Americans, the Japanese, the Samurai, and to his readers.

Homer is a great author. I've read Rocket Boys,The Dinosaur Hunter, The Coalwood Way, Sky of Stone, Torpedo Junction and The Keeper's Son ...all 5 stars. See my reviewsThe Ambassador's Son is book 2 of 3 in the Josh Thurlow series. Its action packed and is a page burner with no boring parts. I read the 337 page book in 2 days. The reader wants to continue reading this interesting and enjoyable book.Much of the book is based on true facts. We see JFK a USN LT JG after his PT109 boat is cut in two by a Japanese destroyer and after saving his men to a deserted island. Also we see Richard M Nixon as a supply officer that can get \\"anything\\" and barley beats JFK in a huge poker card game.We learn JFK is also the son of a US ambassador and something about his brothers and sisters especially Rosemary and her lobotomy. Kennedy names the converted PT/gunboat \\"Rosemary\\".There are head hunters and a group of cannibals headed by an Australian \\"Whitman\\" who marries a beautiful black \\"Marie\\" that Josh gets romantically involved with.I wont ruin the great plot of this book for you.Here is just a little of what going on. Josh is given a secret mission to find and bring back a deserter... LT marine who is a US Ambassador's son. He needs a PT boat skipper and is shown a non wanted JFK who is waiting for his Court Martial for having his PT 109 cut in two. Josh's men steal a PT boat and convert it to a gunboat.With a sea plane and JFK as \\"PT/Gunboat skipper\\" they go looking for the Lt Marine/ambassador's son/relation to FDR. Its a story but with some actual true information used. Great action/adventure. Fascinating.Josh has information about the sinking of PT 109 and that it was not JFK's fault and will report to Admiral Halsey and get JFK cleared. In fact JFK is a hero. 30 years ago I read PT109. A great 5 star book. After reading The Ambassador's Son by Homer Hickam Jr, I wanted to read PT 109 again. So I bought an old copy and will read it again and review.The Ambassador's Son 5 stars and recommended. I'm also reading the third book of Josh Thurlow... The Far Reaches and will review."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"I gave up after reading 2/3 of the book.

You won't be able to put them down once you start. The action forces you from one chapter to the next. The thourough historical background is also an outstanding feature at least for me.

For The Ambassador's Son, without giving anything away, the answer is yes.This book is tremendously entertaining and is much more than just another good book to be enjoyed and put aside. Do not hesitate. The Ambassador's Son represents time and money well spent. Read this book. You will love it.UPDATE: May 31, 2006: I gave away my copy of The Ambassador's Son months ago. Of course it was never returned so my second reading of it was the paperback edition. I still don't want to say more than that, which make this writing more of an assurance than a review: It is really good."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"While the Ambassador's Son is entertaining and cleverly conceived, the cumulative weight of its characters, subplots, and genres feels a bit excessive. It reminds me of a bald eagle's nest, ever-growing in size and scope, risking ultimate collapse by its unnecessary weight.Trying to pigeon hole the book isn't easy. Early on it seems an like an atmospheric historical WW II novel, ala Tales of the South Pacific; then a redemptive journey, ala Huckleberry Finn; later it morphs into the eccentric and absurd, ala Arsenic and Old Lace. (I was less patient with the McHale's Navy-like high jinks.) The skillful use of some historical cameos, ala Forrest Gump, had all the earmarks of an amusing, revisionist \\"fictional history.\\" But then we get hit with graphic gore and butchery, ala Lord of the Flies. And you're only halfway through the book. At this point you feel as if you've over-indulged at Thanksgiving, but you still have to eat virtually the same meal at your mother-in-law's house in an hour.The author's odd coupling of realism and the absurd kept me off balance at many points in the narrative. This is evident in the characters-and there are simply too many of them vying for the spotlight. Their behavior is best described as farcical. For instance, Penelope is way overdone and contradictory. A sort of I Dream of Genie for Our Hero Josh, she lives hand-to-mouth in the jungle (yet sweet-smelling and with perfect teeth) in little more than a voluptuous \\"lap-lap\\", deftly quoting The Last of the Mohicans, but at her best when dismembering foes with a machete. Equal parts sweet and cunning; trusting and threatening; nurturing and deadly, this Solomon Island boy-toy, like the story itself, morphs along in unexpected and unappealing ways. Through all of this, Our Hero Josh, a self-important cad we're supposed to like, remains unflinchingly smitten with her.The book doesn't edify or illuminate anything, but then maybe it isn't supposed to? It's kind of fun, but then so is overeating, until you check the scale."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Josh Thurlow was first introduced as a Coast Guard Lieutenant in the bestselling wartime novel THE KEEPER'S SON. There, with the assistance of his rather unusual but seaworthy hometown crew, he helped fend off German U-boats from North Carolina's outer banks during the opening days of World War II.It is later in the war now, and Commander Josh Thurlow and his boys are seeing action in the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific on special assignment under direct orders from Admiral Halsey. When an Ambassador's son, war hero Marine Lt. David Armistead, disappears under suspicious circumstances, Josh and his men are sent on a mission deep into Japanese territory to find him, assess the circumstances of his disappearance, and take appropriate action. The fact that the Lieutenant is a cousin of President Franklin D. Roosevelt doesn't deter Josh from fulfilling his duty as he sees it.Josh needs a smaller craft that will carry him and his crew into the jungle rivers on the mission. He encounters a PT boat captain named Shafty, who is recuperating from injuries suffered when his boat is run over by a Japanese destroyer. Shafty, also known as John F. Kennedy, is awaiting court martial in a military recuperation camp on one of the Solomon Islands, when Josh enlists his help in acquiring a PT boat from the Navy. Lt. Kennedy plays poker with a military procurement officer named Nick to win a boat.Homer Hickam uses liberal license to bring together real-life characters who will one day become president, as Nick is Richard M. Nixon. A third at the poker table is a young journalist taking notes on the war by the name of Jim Michener. Whether these three men ever met, let alone played poker, in the Solomon's is a bit of conjecture, but because they all served at about the same time in the region, who's to say differently? David Roosevelt Armistead is a real Marine officer who disappeared during the war under the circumstances first described in the novel. Many nonfiction and fictional accounts of his apparent desertion have been chronicled, and this is perhaps the most fanciful of them all but may be closer to the truth than we might imagine.Romance blossoms between Josh and a fierce Tonganese warrior maiden when he is separated from his crew and meets a headhunting tribal chief who holds one of the islands. Kennedy must continue Josh's mission and search for Josh. Both men wage fierce battle scenes as the Japanese bomb and plunder this remote tropical paradise.THE AMBASSADOR'S SON is rich with authentic characters and laced with occasional humor as Hickam spins yet another tale of the war in the South Pacific.--- Reviewed by Roz Shea"},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Everybody seems to have extreme opinions about this book! Five stars or one star! The reviewers who love it love it a lot. The ones who don't hate it and wish Hickam would write his old books over again or think it's not historically accurate. Well, give a writer some slack, people. This is fiction. Fiction means it isn't true. I liked this novel although it isn't perfect. But it kept me entirely entertained and I was ready to know more about all the characters at the end of it. I closed the novel and then went back and read the history at the front, just to recall the historical truth. This further prompted me to order some of the books Hickam cites as his research materials such as Headhunting in the Solomon Islands Around the Coral Sea by Caroline Mytinger. Mytinger tells quite the tale and I could see where Hickam got much of his information on colonial life in the Solomons. Solomon Time by Will Randall tells a funny story about modern-day life there. I'm intrigued enough to want to go visit those islands (even though I live on one) and interested enough by all this to even write this review, my first ever. I won't give Hickam five stars because this is a series novel, and it may not be his best work. But it is very, very good work, much better than anything I've read lately, and I say good on you, chap, for your willingness to not just write the same book over and over."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"I read and thoroughly enjoyed Hickman's previous Josh Thurlow book, \\"The Keeper's Son.\\" (By all means, read it first.)

If possible, I'd give it 4 1/2 stars.I do have to say that I did have to suspend disbelief on several occasions as Hickman tried too hard to work two famous real life characters into the book. We spend a lot of time with John F. Kennedy, who joins Thurlow's crew after PT-109 is sunk. And Richard Nixon makes a couple of appearances as well. It's true that they both served in the Armed Forces in the Pacific Theater during World War II, but the story would have worked just as well without them.

Josh Thurlow is a guy I look forward to reading about for many novels to come. He's a rough and tough adventurer and a man's man. But honestly, it was the women I admired most in this story. Penelope, of course. Others in their reviews have talked about her, this goddess with a machete. I felt like I needed to take a cold shower after reading about her. But she has a spiritual side to her, too. Such as how she got one of the killers who had slaughtered her village to atone according to the principles of what the missionaries had taught her. She shows Josh how she convinced the man to atone by lifting his head out of a stone jar. What a woman! Now, Felicity. Not a beautiful woman but so intent, so straightforward, nearly every man falls for her. She is on her way back to her plantation and no one, not even Jack Kennedy, is going to stop her. It climaxes in a battle across the sea and Felicity's island. Mix in cargo cults, Richard Nixon, tropical beaches and lots of rum . . . never a dull moment.

Most of us thought oh no, it's a war novel and we didn't want to read that. But the characters are great, there's lots of romance in it, and Hickam's research shines through. I think I came to know the real Jack Kennedy as he was as a young man through this novel. Sometimes fiction reveals the truth better than non! Of course, I enjoyed The Keeper's Son so following Josh Thurlow on his next adventure was great. And Penelope, Josh's new girl, is a true delight. A real woman we all enjoyed talking about!

Now, while book two is nicely self-contained so that a reading of the first is not requisite, I am certain that most who read TAS first will want to read TKS for the sheer joy of it, and will not suffer in the least for having read the two out of order.Who is the ambassador's son? That would be John F. Kennedy (Joe Kennedy Sr. was the giddy US Ambassador to England), though there is another ambassador's son in the book, Lieutenant David Armistead, fictional cousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I have emphasized the word \`fictional', because one reviewer maintained that he was real.Josh Thurlow and the entire Killakeet Island crew are on special assignment in the Pacific theater, directly under the command of Admiral Halsey. When Lt. Armistead goes AWOL, or worse, is suspected of going over to the enemy, Halsey saddles Josh and the boys with the duty of tracking him down. In their subsequent travels, Josh and crew meet an unusual assortment of fellow warriors and local denizens.Jack \`Shafty' Kennedy is an unhappy, anemic, and inexperienced former patrol torpedo boat skipper-I say \`former', as his vessel (the now famous PT-109), has been cut in half by a Japanese destroyer. Headquarters cannot imagine that a destroyer could cut a PT boat in half unless the crew was asleep at the wheel, and so it is their intent to court-martial the young Naval officer. Kennedy, suffering from malaria, dehydration, dysentery, coral cuts and bruises from the mishap, along with his chronic back pain, only wants to find the local hospital and secure some much-needed medical attention.Richard \`Nick' Nixon runs a business empire reminiscent of Milo Minderbinder and his M&M; Enterprises in Joseph Heller's Catch-22, only we discover early that Nixon's intentions are nothing but the best. Oh, sure, poker games, massage parlors and souvenir shops abound, along with laundries, coffee houses, bars, hamburger stands (serving indefinable meat and cheese products-somewhat like McDonald's), and the like. But the profits go to provide R&R; for the troops, and that's a good thing. What happens when Nixon and Kennedy, along with James A. Michener, square off in a poker game for high stakes and a new boat? You'll have to read the novel to find out.Felicity Markham is an English expatriate, a colonist who came to Noa Noa with her husband to build a coconut plantation. Now he is dead, the war has driven her from her home, and she and her son, John-Bull, make every attempt to return to their adopted island home.Penelope, to my mind the most fascinating character of all, is a machete-wielding banshee, dark and dazzling as the night sky, who falls for our protagonist. She leads Josh deftly on his journey, guiding him through thick jungles and along unseen paths, though he sometimes does not trust her as he should. She calls him Josh Darling and he calls her Penelope Dear. Together they cut a wide swath, she with her two-foot long blade, and he with his razor-sharp Aleut ax.Whereas in the first book Josh's crew was limited to travel by sea in a Coast Guard cutter, they now have the luxury of a Catalina, an amphibious aircraft, with the questionable capabilities of Ensign Phimble at the helm. At first, it is not clear where Phimble obtained his flying lessons, and we later surmise that he probably never had any. Still, his tenacity manages to get this heavier than aircraft airborne and landed again, though with varying degrees of success.Author Hickam paints his picture of the people and events in his tale with a detachment worthy of the gods themselves, allowing the story to unfold naturally without editorial interference or moralizing about the extant cannibalism (native custom), savagery (on all sides), oppressive and hypocritical missionaries, Imperialist Japanese, Imperialist Christians, Imperialist colonists and the formerly isolationist and now overly-zealous Americans; all who come to conquer, steal, subjugate, liberate, destroy, and generally wage war on these South Pacific islands known as the Solomons, with little regard for the land itself or the native peoples who inhabit it. After all, this is wartime, and that justifies all. Doesn't it?So adept is Mr. Hickam at his craft of dream-weaving that the average reader will not even be aware that, by reading TAS, he or she is receiving a better history lesson than any taught by most high schools in four years.Also, at no time does this book take itself too seriously, and in the lightness there are high points of humor, such as the time a USO troupe assaults (and insults) the Imperial Japanese Army with jokes; or our own Ready O'Neal from Josh's crew suggesting to a young James Michener, \\"You should write a book about this place.\\" Or my favorite: Author Hickam has one character call the American base in Hawaii \`Hickman Field', when it is really Hickam Field; yet even Microsoft Word (2003) is programmed to try to change the name \`Hickam' to \`Hickman'.I cannot praise this tome highly enough for its ability to take the reader on a journey beyond expectation, reveal the intricacies of a world that actually existed, and speculate, with reason and research, at what could have been.This is first-class, highly creative and compelling entertainment from Homer H. Hickam. Buy it, read it, enjoy it. Share it with your friends."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"This book is a good read. Plain and simple if you like reading historical fiction and like the WWII era in the South Pacific, then this is something you can curl up with and get lost in...just check your queasy stomach at the door if you have one. Homer Hickam has done a great job describing the people and places in great detail and his strength is certainly his looney-toons characters. But there's also a very dark side to this novel that can cause a large lunch to seem not so tasteful somewhere around the middle of the book; one word-Cannibals! This story graceful combines what did happen with what we want to believe happen with what we hoped didn't happen all in one fantastic tale. If I have a criticism it would be the hasty disposal of two characters in the end as almost an afterthought. I felt they deserved better recognition than the amateur way they were rubbed out in no less than two paragraphs each. Don't worry-I didn't ruin anything for you by saying that. Also, it seems that no one in this book is just normal. Every character is phenomenally memorable and so far in my life, few people have actually been this kooky, so having so many in one tale is a bit overwhelming. The last criticism is the sudden dichotomies of prose. In one sentence, we hear the spiked vernacular of the good \`ole North Carolina boys followed immediately by Mr. Hickam's educated storytelling narrator that sometimes doesn't blend. Overall, though, it was hard to put down and I even managed to annoy my wife by reading it endlessly. I definitely recommend it for any history buff, WWII historical novel fan, or someone who just wants to be a cannibal-fighting, hot-chick-chasing, overly-rambunctious-pilot for a few days."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"Liked this book best of all - full of interesting facts and surprises - unsual point of flow with the birds - in the series - great fun to learn somethings not widely know about our Presidents."},{"Title":"The Ambassador's Son (Josh Thurlow Series #2)","review":"I love series books, especially ones that complete a couple of my absolute requirements: (1) That they are page-turners with an interresting lead character and supporting characters and (2) that each are different enough that I don't feel like I'm reading the same novel over and over again.Hickam's \\"Josh Thurlow\\" series accomplishes both of my requirements. In The Keeper's Son, Josh was clearly a tough young man who had been through a lot but Dosie and the Keeper and the other Killakeeters who'd known him as a boy kept him from being as tough as he could be. In fact, you could almost picture him melting any time one of the islanders had a word although he certainly had no problem blowing the German U-boaters away. But in this novel, Josh has no one to restrain his deepening anger and resolve and, how to put it, his bloody-mindedness. He has learned to cut throats of an enemy who nearly demands it before he will surrender. He feels as if he has to teach others to be cruel to this enemy, too, such as the idealistic and soon run-away Lt. Armistead. Josh also has no problem using a letter from Dosie to justify getting involved with the beautiful Penelope. He is a complex character and I honestly have no idea what direction he'll go next. It seems to me that he may be cracking up. There's quite a lot of commentary about how men go mad in the Solomon Islands all the time and don't even know it. This uncertainty is refreshing for a series lead. Yet (and I like this) his Killakeet boys remain as sweet and untouched as they were back in North Carolina although Ready is starting to toughen, too. And my goodness, what a great character Felicity is. The chapter about her aboard the lifeboat fighting off the sharks was nearly poetic. Bloody, yes, but the author has a way with words, never doubt it. Bottom line: if you like writers who have a touch of Jack London adventurism about their novels, you'll like this series. If you don't, go read a Nicholas Sparks or something. Nothing wrong with Sparks, it's just Hickam is going for something quite a bit stronger here."},{"Title":"Cat Book","review":"&quot;CAT BOOK&quot; by Emily Weinstein is an exquisite volume of fine feline fare extraordinaire!

Think not that He expects anything from you but your whole trust in Him until He has first saved you by His grace. He will faithfully do according to His Word the moment you have chosen positively to rest your salvation in His saving power and grace alone. After you have thus believed, he purposes to supply all the enabling power to meet all the problems and the needs of your daily life. You need not fear, only believe His Word. His wisdom, strength and bounty are sufficient for you. -117That is how the final chapter of Lewis Spery Chafer's classic book Salvation: God's Marvelous Work of Grace begins. The book, as the final chapter is called, is an appeal for the sinner to come to Christ and to embrace the gospel. This classic is an evangelistic in its nature, but it certainly is not a track where the gospel is over-simplified. Instead, the theologian walks the reader through every basic aspect of the gospel from sin to the cross to the atonement to the resurrection to redemption to the sinner's response to the believers benefits to the assurance of salvation to eternal salvation and to our final destination.Chafer pounds the pages with Scripture references. He helpfully provides a Scriptural index in the back of the book which reveals just how prevalent the Bible is in this book. Oftentimes Chafer will state and thesis and essentially list a number of passages that defend his argument.There were many moments where I was shouting, \\"Amen!\\" In the third chapter of the book Chafer deals with those who challenge the doctrine of penal substitution. It reads as if he were writing today. He points out the empty rhetoric of his day and ours that suggests that the cross makes Christ a victim of an abusive, vindictive Father (the cross is \\"divine child abuse\\" for example). Chafer rightly condemns and corrects any notion of immorality in believing in substituionary atonement.Though there were many Amens, there is one section in particular that highly disappointed me. Chafer was a leading voice in the Lordship controversy that argued that one only needs to believe, but not repent. This is not the place to fully lay out everything regarding the Lordship controversy of a few decades ago. However, Chafer dedicates a large section of one chapter to this issue. He painstakingly suggests and tries to defend the notion that repentance is not necessary for salvation. His argument is weak. One is hard pressed to read the Old or the New Testament without seeing that God demands repentance from His children.Overall, however, this is a great book. Though I have some reservations in certain sections, this is an extremely helpful book in laying out the gospel. Although I would not put it into the hands of a lost person for various reasons, it is a helpful guide to those who might be considering embracing the gospel and also to believers who need to hear that message again (and we all need to daily!). If you can get by the Lordship issue (and that is an important issue to say the least), this is an excellent read.This book was given to me courtesy of Kregel Publications for the purpose of this review."},{"Title":"Atlas of Oregon Lakes","review":"Has almost all lakes in Oregon.

There is a great section on data validation and a clear explanation on how to use the Application, Session, and Cookie objects. ASP developers should have little trouble ramping up to ASP.NET quickly. Be aware that the coverage of ADO.NET is sketchy at best.All in all, Programming Visual Basic .NET is a good book. Not the best book you'll ever read on the subject, but a good beginning level book. If you've every had any experience with Visual Basic or ASP, most of the examples will be very easy to pick up on. However, you'll want to pick up at least one additional book to cover some of the gaps left by this book."},{"Title":"Programming Visual Basic .NET","review":"Programming Visual Basic .NET does an excellent job of covering all of the language elements and associated .NET framework topics that a developer will need to become an effective VB.NET programmer. This book is successful by getting straight to the point and tackling the issues that programmers need to understand the new language, how it fits in with the .NET framework, and how it differs from Microsoft's previous incarnations of Visual Basic.In the early chapters Dave covers all of the important VB.NET language constructs and the .NET framework with a clear tone and effective examples. The chapters on Windows Form development are particularly helpful in understanding GUI programming in the language, and how to take advantage of the many new features in .NET including control docking and anchoring, and menu programming. He covers both using the tools in Visual Studio.NET, as well as exploring the creation of Windows Forms through code. This type of in depth information is very helpful for any developer who really wishes to know and understand what's going on behind the scenes of Windows Forms.The later chapters are similarly well presented and explain the important aspects of additional technologies of the .NET Platform that are central to successful application development. The chapter on ASP.NET does a great job of explaining user controls, form validation, and security in ASP.NET. I've found this information critical in designing solutions that target the web. While the chapter on ADO.NET is perhaps not as comprehensive as the rest, I found the information to be quite helpful and informative enough to implement complete data access solutions. Similarly, the chapter on programming web services in VB.NET has been a great help in understanding how web services function, and their importance in communications across the internet.Overall I find this book to be a great introduction to the Visual Basic .NET language itself, as well as a great tool for understanding how to use Visual Basic .NET to harness many of the exciting features of the .NET platform."},{"Title":"Programming Visual Basic .NET","review":"This is an OK book but there are better books. The treatement of the essential language issues isn't very good: for example, Cornell's book is *much* much better at teaching the Visual Basic .NET language and in particular the Object Oriented Principles you need for VB NET. Troelsen's book (also from Apress) is much better for applications than this book. The book &quot;Coding Techniques for Microsoft VB NET&quot; by John Connell is also a book to consider over this one. In sum, while there is nothing very wrong with this book, there are just much better books.(Question to O'Reilly - why didn't you just port Liberty's book from C# to VB NET.

Reading this book is like having your best friend or a loving parent there to urge you on, just when the going gets tough!Many books are written around the metaphor of a journey of a thousand miles beginning with a single step. This book, too, employs that metaphor, but also extends it to include the almost equally popular metaphor of the journey being the end rather than the means. I found that conjunction of the two metaphors to be powerful and interesting.The tone of the book is supportive and understanding, but it is also remorseless in urging you to move on to the next step . . . whatever that is. To help you find that direction, another favorite metaphor is used . . . that there are no external forces to affect you. &quot;In The Land of I Can, there are no barriers -- no limitations.&quot;Well, where to then? &quot;What does your Soul ache to do?&quot; I love that question. It is inspiring and inspired. I hope you will find it as powerful and helpful as I do.Naturally, there will be delays, setbacks, and heart ache along the way. Susan Gilbert acknowledges and accepts those unavoidable experiences, and shows you how to keep from being distracted by them away from your purpose. These sections are particularly helpful. For example, consider: &quot;Cry your tears. Feel your sadness . . . . To feel your sadness now, will allow you to feel joy . . . [in the future].&quot;The book is strengthened by the living energy of the illustrations by Jill E. Holden, which give the words more tangible meaning and emotional significance.This book is both a good resource to always have close at hand for yourself, and a good gift to share with others when you cannot be there to give them your support in person.I strongly urge you to take several minutes each day to consider if you are on the right road.

Allen, Jr. is a correspondent for The National Catholic Reporter. He has penned a biography of controversial Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of the Vatican, and has already contracted to cover the future election of the new Pope for Fox News. Many Americans cannot remember the media focus and the world attention that the death of a popular Pope and the election of a new Cardinal to fill \\"the shoes of the fisherman\\" draw, since the event has not happened since 1978. Allen gives us a stunning view of the likely scenarios, issues and the potential for transformation that the Catholic Church faces as John Paul II's days as the most powerful leader in the Christian world draw to a close.From Allen, we get the history of the papacy and the relevance of the way today's church works. He presents issues of bioethics, the church's positions on celibacy and sexuality, the need for church collegiality throughout the world, the need to balance centrist Vatican powers with the role of the world's bishops, and many current Catholic doctrines that will be continued or changed, depending on the election of the new Pope. He presents a dignified and on the mark representation of John XXIII, Paul VI, and John Paul I and II. He is both informative and relevant on the ceremonies that will transpire when the current Pope dies, without leaving any sense of a \\"lameduck\\" status for the existing Papacy and Vatican staff.It's noteworthy that Allen tries to stay neutral on the current stand of the church on the issues, and on his introduction of the conclave participants - the world's cardinals. There is a little liberal and reform bias here, but he is careful to point it out. His choice of 20 of the most prominent or likely candidates is well thought out, and although he is clear that there are many prominent European candidates, the reader learns why the next Pope will not be elected from the USA, and clearly outlines why the 6 Latin American and 2 African Cardinals are serious contenders to lead the Catholic church in the new millennium.A fascinating frontspiece to one of the world's great dramas, \\"The Conclave\\" makes for interesting reading for Catholics and non-Catholics alike."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"There is a vertiable sub-genre of books anticipating, analyzing, and seeking to influence the next conclave. John Allen's highly readable \\"Conclave\\" is the latest installment; specifically, it follows in the footsteps of Margaret Hebblethwaite's extensive 2000 revision of her late husband's \\"The Next Pope.\\" Other books in the genre come in the form of political science (Father Thomas J. Reese's \\"Inside the Vatican\\"), quasi-history (Gary Wills' \\"Hitler's Pope,\\" Francis Burkle-Young's \\"Passing the Keys\\"), and fiction (Edward Sheehan's elegant \\"Cardinal Galsworthy,\\" Father Andrew Greeley's paper-thin \\"White Smoke,\\" Malachi Martin's \\"Windswept House\\").Both Allen and Hebblethwaite are votaries of the \\"Catholic left,\\" and share an agenda that seeks to conform (or \\"reform\\") 2000 years of Church doctrine, discipline and tradition to the political agenda of the contemporary cultural left. This involves the \\"devolution\\" or \\"decentralization\\" of authority in the Church, and greater \\"innovation\\" and \\"experimentation\\" with Catholic doctrine. The Church is an instrument to achieve political ambitions: moral decentralization coupled with political centralization, the Netherlands writ worldwide. Above all else, success in this program lies in electing a \\"reformist\\" Pope, someone who \\"gets it,\\" as the saying goes. Allen's chapter on \\"Voting Issues\\" is understandable in this context. But to his credit he gives some space to fairly describing the reasoning of those who defend traditional Church teachings.Allen's chapter on \\"How the Conclave Works\\" is also quite good. It describes the unfurling of events in the aftermath of a pope's death: from destroying the \\"ring of the fisherman\\" through the novemdiales (nine days of mourning), to the conclave itself, the announcement \\"habemus papam\\" (we have a pope\\"), and the installation mass of the new pope. Allen even suggest the restaurants in Rome that journalists will watch to see which cardinals are dining together, and what that means.The book's categorization of the cardinals into four \\"political parties\\" is imperfect but acute, and not entirely unlike that of traditionalist Russell Shaw. It is a valuable resource for those new to this area and seeking to make sense of over 120 electors. Border Patrol cardinals want to take the world up on its boast that \\"diversity\\" is the highest value by preserving space for the Universal Church's Deposit of Faith against the hostile forces of cotemporary culture. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of Munich, the great theologian, is a leader among these cardinals. Salt of the Earth Integralists (or \\"restorationists\\" in another description) want Church teaching to be realized in civil law. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, and Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera of Mexico City are among this group.Salt of the Earth-Social Justice cardinals focus on using Church credibility to force government action on \\"social justice\\" issues. The classic examples of this type are the Brazilian Cardinals Paulo Evaristo Arns and Aloisio Lorscheider; Cardinals Dionigi Tettamanzi of Genoa and Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa (Honduras) are among their number, too. Finally, Reformist cardinals seek a fundamental restructuring of the Church, devolving power from the pope and permitting greater experimentation with church doctrine and discipline. Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini of Milan is the leader of these cardinals.There is necessarily overlap between the Border Patrol and Integralist cardinals, and between the Reformist and Social Justice cardinals. Also, many cardinals do not fit comfortably into one category - e.g., Cardinal Jaimie Sin of Manila -- would be considered both a Social Justice Cardinal and, to a certain degree, a Border Patrol cardinal.One of the shortcomings of this book is its failure to discuss the role of Grand Electors in the conclave, those cardinals who by virtue of their knowledge of languages or personal authority can strongly influence the vote of other cardinals. Even among a flock of shepherds, some are sheep; indeed, there are likely to be far more sheep than shepherds. Yet there is no consideration of the impact of the recent deaths of three cardinals thought to be likely Grand Electors -- Cardinals O'Connor of New York, Bernardin of Chicago, and Hume of Westminster (London). The book also does not take account of recent scandals in Belgium that might effect one of Allen's favorite Reformist Cardinals (Godfried Danneels) or the hostile comments of another favorite (Social Justice Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga of Tegucigalpa ) on the American media, which (together with he worldwide media) Allen believes will have the greatest impact on who is elected. (Imagine the editorial boards of the Guardian, Le Monde and the New York Times sitting in conclave.)Probably of greatest interest to readers will be Allen's discussion of his \\"top 20\\" prospects for election. Allen and Hebblethwaite make two contrary assumptions - he says Italian option is not the most likely, she says it is; he says the cardinals do not know each other well, she says they know each other better than ever before - and yet they they choose many of the same cardinals as their leading candidates, showing the powerful combination of politics and sentiment whatever the factual assumptions.Martini of Milan is very much the sentimental favorite of Allen, with Tettamanzi of Genoa being an evidently acceptable fall-back option. Allen also places in his top twenty - one of whom, he says, is very likely to be elected the next pope - several cardinals that would find it very difficult to be elected because of their pronounced hostility to Church tradition - e.g., Cardinals Walter Kasper of Rotterdam-Stuttgart and Karl Lehmann of Mainz (Germany) - and excludes other that appear far more \\"papabile\\" (or electable) - e.g., Cardinal Antonio Maria Rouco Varela of Madrid. Other names - e.g., Cardinal Walter Napier of Durban (South Africa) - that have nod widely appeared on other lists seem to make an appearance here only to offset cardinals that Allen would find less congenial. (Napier seems to be there to provide an African alternative to Border Patrol Cardinal Francis Arinze of Nigeria, who is widely considered papabile.)A rough count of the entire college on the basis of Allen's descriptions suggests there are approximately 74 Border Patrol and Integralist cardinals and 47 Reformist and Social Justice cardinals. Some will drift where momentum pulls them, thus highlighting the role of Grand Electors. The count also suggests the greater likelihood (or at least pronounced plausibility) of the election of Cardinal Ratzinger (a possibility Hebblethwaite takes seriously and is, surprisingly, open to, but one that Allen totally excludes), Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Vienna (who Allen in similar language to Hebblethwaite dismisses, despite his appearance in the \\"top 20\\") and Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris (here too, both authors use the same explanations to diminish his electability).Overall, Allen's selection of his top 20 reflects his view that he Church suffers from a crisis of institutions, not a crisis of faith; and this explains the identities of his favorites. But what he never explains is why the Church should have as its supreme leader those among his top 20 (Martini, Kasper, Lehmann, Danneels, among others) who want to give up the good fight and surrender to the worst instincts of contemporary culture. As such, though the book, filtered for partisanship, is a good guide to the next pope's election, it struggles to get past its ideological moorings."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":". . .but marred in places by the author's political viewpoint.&quot;Conclave&quot; is a well-written and informative book about exactly &quot;how&quot; the Catholic Church will go about selecting the new Pope upon the passing of Pope John Paul II. The author, a Rome-based journalist, has already been selected by Fox News as their correspondent and &quot;expert&quot; when the time comes. Especially helpful is the &quot;step-by-step&quot; description of what happens in the Vatican from the moment the Pope dies straight through his Coronation Mass. Also helpful is the information concerning the various &quot;political parties&quot; within the College of Cardinals and useful biographies of those Cardinals whom the author sees as papabile (those for whom election is possible).Less helpful, and indeed off-putting, was the author's obvious bias toward the left wing of the Catholic hierarchy. This is seen, not only in his direct comments, but also in his subtle ridicule of conservative Cardinals. This ridicule is usually effected by the relating of &quot;humorous&quot; anecdotes which serve to make conservative Cardinals look silly. The more a Cardinal is portrayed as a moderate or liberal, the less likely the ridicule.Other than this bit of childishness, the book is a valuable tool. But the conservative or traditionalist reader will have (many) moments of (great) annoyance.Three stars."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"As a general overview, I heartily endorse the review posted below by Nathaniel Avignon. However, now that the event for which this book was prepared is upon us, I would add a few points.Allen's overview of the process and personalities of Conclave strikes this non-Catholic reader as a remarkably thorough one, and a valuable resource to keep by your television and newspaper in the coming weeks (especially since Allen himself will be showing up as a commentator on Fox News). As they say at the ball games, you can't tell the players without a program, and \\"Conclave\\" does a fine job in explaining both the curial offices (camerlengo, Vicar of Rome, etc.) and the specific roles they play in the period from the death of the old pope to the election of the new one.Allen includes profiles of most of the leading *papabiles* and capsule biographies of nearly every other eligible Cardinal, circa 2002. Because the book is a couple of years old, some of the information is slightly outdated. By and large, however, the names in Allen's books are the names in today's newspapers.I've read a number of books about papal history, conclaves, and \\"inside the Vatican\\" expos&eacute;s over the years, and plan to read one or two more in the next few weeks. But few have exposed the inner workings, the implicit (and sometimes even explicit) political and theological groupings, in the way this title has. If you're looking for a title that makes the whole historic, secretive, but incredibly interesting process now unfolding somewhat more transparent, \\"Conclave\\" by John Allen strikes me as a very hard book to beat."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Sadly, with the passing of Pope John Paul II yesterday, this book has suddenly become topical. Many people will likely be looking for resources to give them some clue as to what happens next. In particular, how is the next pope chosen? Many people may be familiar with the term \\"conclave\\" but many not be certain as to what it all really entails. This book spells it out quite well.A thin volume, of particular interest is chapter 3, \\"How the Conclave Works\\". Mr. Allen, a longtime reporter on Catholic issues, does an excellent job of taking us through the steps from the moment of John Paul's death through the process of the election of his successor. However, this book actually does much more as one might expect from someone conversant with the working of the Vatican. There are chapters detailing the duties of the popes, the issues facing the electors and some of the factions within the college of cardinals. He also has some interesting points to make about how the intense media scrutiny of this election will effect things for the better and for the worse.The weakness of the book, of course, is that it is somewhat dated. Written three years ago now, the chapter on \\"the candidates\\" could use an update. Also, the child abuse scandal that has rocked the Church in the past couple years needs to be addressed. However, it is somewhat surprising how few of the names have changed: some have aged beyond eligibility, some have passed and some have changed jobs, but a surprising number have remained basically unchanged. The Church is nothing if not slow to change.In this time of change, it is nice to know that there is someplace to go for answers to the basic questions. Mr. Allen has provided some of the answers for us and I recommend this book as a useful tool to understanding the days ahead."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"CONCLAVE is a well written analysis of the processes surrounding the inevitable passing of Pope John Paul II. It also contains a brief, yet cogent outline (albeit somewhat \\"left of center\\") of the issues which will play a role in the selection of the next pope.The author, John Allen, is a veteran reporter and Vatican correspondent who brings a depth and breadth of knowledge in identifying the key players and issues which will loom over the next papal election. Issues include collegiality and authority within the church, sexuality and bioethics, the roles of women and laity, doctrine and social justice. Key players include many relatively well-known cardinals already in the inner circle as well as others who have emerged into the spotlight in recent years. Mr. Allen offers a fascinating description of the various political factions or \\"parties\\" within the College of Cardinals.The book also describes in clear detail, the rituals and procedures for the entire process from the death of the Pope to the conclave culminating in the election and installation of the new Pontiff. While detailed in its explanations, the book is surprisingly easy to read, yet never stoops to a level of superficiality despite its breezy style. The brief biographies of the cardinals are also helpful, although I would have expected to see several other names in the list of probably contenders."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Now that we have gone through one Papal election, and given Pope Benedict's age will possibly go through another within a decade, it is appropriate to review how useful and accurate John L. Allen's \\"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election,\\" was. The answer is: not very. Other reviewers have noted that Allen has hopelessly muddled thinking on the difference between discipline, doctrine, and dogmas of the Church, and for this flaw alone he deserves zero stars: he has misled and misrepresented the faithful, and has misinformed those outside the Church. Such ignorance is not invincible, and rather more startling, to be clear on these points in this book is a large part of Allen's job. Allen clearly did not do that job.Where Allen is of limited usefulness is his \\"USAToday\\" style of journalism and covering some mechanics and some personalities of a Conclave. His work on explaining the difference between Cardinal Bishops, Cardinal Priests, and Cardinal Deacons, for example, was somewhat helpful. But even his few good paragraphs are thin gruel, and during the last Conclave I found more accurate coverage with better detail in such diverse sources as The American Spectator, The Jerusalem Post, and The Wall Street Journal.Which brings me to my conclusion: this is a sloppy work written with an agenda and an ax to grind, a \\"liberal\\" view from an author who intentionally misrepresented the Conclave as some sort of robed meeting of politicking Mafioso. It was also clearly written to make a fast buck, and smacks of lifted paragraphs from an archived news que of \\"backgrounder\\" pieces.Both Catholics and non-Catholics alike deserve a better treatment of the process and personalities of a Conclave. Allen's isn't it."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Hope springs eternal among liberal Catholics. At least that is what one gathers from reading John L. Allen's Conclave. Written as a guide to what would follow the death of Pope John Paul II, it also seems to serve as wishful thinking by a memeber of the delusional Catholic left.The book actually can be functionally divided in two. First is the description of the course to be followed in the election of a new pope. Here, Allen is excellent and gives a solid overview both of the mechanics of the process and an interesting breakdown of the function of various church officials in the unfolding events. Anyone curious of the internal mechanics of the process would be well serverd by reading Allen's account.It is in Allen's analysis of how the issues facing the Church and the personalities involved that he goes completely offtrack. His theolgical liberalism is only exceeded by his lack of understanding of the nature of Christian doctrine. In his eyes, the theology of the Catholic Church should be in line with contemporary liberal beliefs. The idea that the Church should hold to eternal truths of the faith does not seem to hold much weight in his reasoning.Worst yet, Allen allows this bias to cloud his judgment of a likely next pope. Allen ignores the fact that Pope John Paul II had a quarter century to stack the deck with theologically conservtive cardinals. Allen also glosses the Catholic Church's traditional makeup outside the West (Allen admits non-Western Catholics are an increasingly key factor). In ignoring that third world Catholics would favor a more traditional candidate, he projects his Western liberal sensibilities on those for whom it has little if any appeal. The result is a hodgepodge of modernist myth and wishful thinking.At every turn, Allen belittles those traditional and conservative cardinals who were considered \\"papable\\" and praises liberal candidates and even radicals on the margins of Catholicism. He goes to great lengths to rule out men such as Cardinal Josef Ratzinger but inludes among his candidates those with little support. One wonders Allen's reaction when Pope John Paul II passed away and it was indeed Ratzinger who was given the nod as next pope.For an understanding of the mechanics of the process of electing a pope, Allen's depiction is still worthwhile reading. However, his analysis of the Catholic Church's future and the relative standing of the various theological parties within Catholicism has been proven erroneous. Because of its fundamental bias, Conclave cannot be recommended."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I purchased this book over a year ago but didn't start reading it until Pope John Paul II was dying. I wanted to have an authoritative book handy so when the time came I could understand the Vatican's transition process and politics. Eventho' Allen wrote his book three years ago, it's contemporary enough so that virtually all of the notables are still around and the backgrounds on them and the issues are largely unchanged. I appreciate the insider's look Allen knowledgeably provides, eventho' I'm no longer Catholic (see Amazon's webpages on my book \\"Concepts: A ProtoTheist Quest for Science-Minded Skeptics). Allen's book is well written, a pleasure to read and a valuable guide to the emerging events."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"The election of a new Pope will obviously have a great impact on the lives of the One Billion or so Catholics around the world. The selection of a new Holy Father however, will also have a very far-reaching impact on the rest of the people of the world. Not only does the Pope have a great influence on world affairs but as the Catholic Church opens more and more dialogue with other Christian and indeed non-Christian faiths the selection of the next Pontiff is of supreme importance. It is for those reasons, and of course my deep Catholic faith that I decided to read this book.I am very happy to say that John Allen has written a book that will not only be informative to life-long Catholics but also to new Catholics, Protestants and anyone else who finds this subject to be of interest. He very clearly enunciates the differences that exist within the College of Cardinals on all sorts of issues, both spiritual and temporal. He also leads his readers through the side issues that may also decide the conclave's choice. As examples, many within the Church apparently would like to see a third world Pope, there is little chance that John Paul's successor will be from Eastern Europe, and because of John Paul's long tenure there is little chance that the next Pope will be young. That thought had never crossed my mind but apparently many of the Cardinals are not fond of long reigns.The best part of this book however, was the section dealing with the details of how a new Pope is elected. Allen takes his readers on a step by step journey through the process, from the Pope's death until his successor is elected and he accepts the job. It is a fascinating process and Allen does a tremendous job making it understandable and highly easy to read. There is even a glossary at the back of the book to help the reader keep up with some of the titles and terms used in the book. Thanks to John Allen I now know just what a Cardinal is, and that knowledge alone was well worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I found this book an easy enough read on a subject, which many may believe to be a bit to heavy. However it is worth bearing in mind that this event will take place at some point in the future and with 24-hour television news coverage it will be hard to ignore as a major news story. With this in mind I would suggest that this book could prove a handy reference guide to many of the events rituals, which will unfold, between the passing of the pope through to the election of his successor.The book is quite detailed in terms of outlining the age-old customs, which are still adhered to following the death of a pontiff. It also sketches out the cast of characters who will administer the church during the Interregnum and who will probably be among the most prominent on out TV screens during the process. Of course the real action will take place behind closed doors during the election process, which will take place in the Sistine Chapel away from the glare of the media. In this respect the author outlines the rules and procedures, which will govern the conduct of the conclave.The author also looks at the front-runners and discusses the reasons why he believes each candidate may or may not be an attractive choice for his fellow cardinals. He also discusses the dynamics of the conclave and assigns groups of cardinals to voting groups in order to determine what these groups may want from a candidate.I would recommend this book for its detail but as I said earlier this will be a major news event when it happens so a handy guide to what's going will not be wasted."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Though I bought it on the chance that there could be a papal election sometime soon, it wound up not making much of a diffrence in terms of the enjoyment I got out of reading this book. It is fun to speculate, I admit, and you can't help but wonder how your own views will be represented in the next papacy. So, I approached this book with questions about the likely future at the Vatican. After reading I do feel that I have a better grasp on what the future may bring, but moreso I have a much better understanding of the nature of the politics, mechanics, other earthly matters that affect the Vatican. It is made-up of people, after all, and I came away with an appreciation for the way it works as an organization. Through the author's eyes the Vatican seems a lot less byzantine (if you'll pardon my choice of words) than I had previously thought. Anyway, I recomend this book for anyone interested in current affairs, Church history."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"This book delivers exactly what the title tells you it will, but I think it reads a little more interestingly than that nuts &amp; bolts description might lead you to believe. John Allen also gives fascinating bits from the history of the papal elections, but then gets down to a straight-forward assessment of the current political climate at the Vatican. He also gives a helpful overview of all the members of the College of Cardinals, from whom the next pope will be chosen. It's a quick and enjoyable read if you're interested in the subject. At times I wonder if Allen doesn't have more conservative leanings, but I'm not taking off points for that because in the end I think he's striving to be as objective as possible."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"When John Paul II died in April 2005, my Catholic friends and I decided to place bets on who would replace him. Both of my friends who participated picked Giovanni Cardinal Re, an Italian, who was 71 at the time. I picked Joseph Ratzinger, based on what I read in this book. I ended up winning $13 from my two friends. If it were not for this book, I would have had no idea who to choose. This book is amazing. Allen covers every aspect of the Conclave in great detail, and he also lists every eligible Cardinal, and gives a short biography about them, including whether they are a conservative or a liberal. I recommend it to everyone who is interested in learning about the Papal elections."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I really enjoyed this one. Since I knew next to nothing about how the Vatican works I came at it from a below novice perspective so I had lots to learn. The author does a good job of taking nothing for granted in the reader's understanding but it never feels like he's talking down to you. I won't say that it was such a thrill that I couldn't put it down, but (and maybe it's just me) I found it really interesting. Probably won't do any more reading in this area but I'm glad I now know what I do from this."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I can't imagine it will be long before the next conclave is called into session, and this book is a handy guide to what we can expect. It also answers the interesting question of what the Pope does with a job description that should put any Cardinal off the job. Whatever the Pope does, from the intensely spiritual to the mundane, will satisfy no one. Although Catholics are united in the Creed, we're polarized in the particulars, divided by scandal, and so spread out - geographically as well as ideologically - that someone or anothers ox will always be gored. Nevertheless, Mr. Allen, has given us as close to an inside view of the procedures, politics, and personalities of a conclave as we're likely to get. \\"Conclave,\\" also serves as a handicappers guide to the election with a rundown of factions, front-runners, and dark horses. Ah, but what about the intervention of the Holy Spirit? The cardinals are adepts of political power, but they are also deeply spiritual, and it's the spirit that is the wild card in any Conclave, and though that story is much more fascinating than the bargaining for a Pope, we'll never plumb the mystery of how that works, and the only author I can recall who explores that territory is out of print. That would be Malachi Martin and his \\"Final Conclave.\\""},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Thank goodness I found this book--It really is exactly what it says it is. Allen writes quite well, in typical journalist fashion, but the information he captures makes me wonder if he isn't primarily a historian.

I recommend it as well to anyone who wants to better understand their church."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I would recommend Conclave as a handy reference guide for its chapter describing the conclave process, for its listing of cardinals eligible for selection as pope with background information, and for its glossary. But the analysis in the book is uneven in quality due to instances of liberal bias. Most disturbing is the omission of relevant information that might detract from cardinals that the author chooses to view as \\"liberals\\" or \\"reformers.\\" Another problem is the apparent inclusion of some cardinals as frontrunners because they are perceived as potentially sharing the author's liberal agenda. There is also the unexplained exclusion of prominent conservative Cardinal Ratzinger from the list of top contenders. In March 2002, the author wrote that neither Ratzinger nor liberal Cardinal Martini would be elected pope because they were too divisive. Yet, in this book the author includes Martini in the list of top contenders, but excludes Ratzinger without explanation. Consistent with my analysis above are the comments of NBC Vatican affairs consultant George Weigel who found \\"fully half\\" of Allen's top contenders to be \\"utterly implausible,\\" and who also found the biographical portraits of the other cardinals to be \\"strangely awry at numerous points.\\"Moreover, in a recent column, Allen admits to including a particular candidate in his list of top contenders \\"not so much because . . . he's a realistic front-runner\\" but because Allen personally admires this particular cardinal (Column, Oct. 22, 2002). So much for an objective list of realistic front-runners. The purported front-runner list appears to be more spin than fact. In addition, Allen himself has since noted that one cardinal informed him of a series of errors in the book. So, if the intent of the book is to somehow influence the deliberations of cardinals in the next conclave, the book's widely noted defects have reduced the likelihood of any such role."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"As the world watches Rome, this slim book goes a long way to explain what will happen as the Cardinals gather to select a new pope. Though somewhat dated (2002), the book provides a great general overview of the \\"parties\\" and the twenty most likely candidates for the papal office. This book is far more beneficial than the countless snippets of news coverage that we will now be inundated with brief overviews of the process. I especially liked that Allen illustrates many of his points with examples from past Papal elections. Though the value of this title may greatly decline in a few months, it is the perfect read for the current times in which we face an event the likes of which several of us younger readers have not seen in our memory. I feel far better informed after having read this volume."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"A brilliantly written account of what transpires between papacies. Yet, the title is a little misleading. For the most factual account of what goes on in a conclave I would suggest Lucien Gregoire's Pauper Who Would Be Pope."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"\\"Conclave\\" is a nice little summary of the papal election process. It is very readable and actually spurred my further interest in the topics of Church structure, procedure, and politics.It is, however, left-leaning. Not in the sense that Mr. Allen shoves his viewpoints down the readers' throats, but rather in the sense of saying things and bringing up issues that an orthodox Catholic would not. He gives the false impression that the Pope has authority to change church teachings on women's ordination, contraception, homosexuality, and the usual liberal priorities. And he refers to heterodox theologians as \\"reform-minded\\", and frowns upon Rome's insistence on orthodoxy.Anyway, \\"Conclave\\" begins with a job description of the papacy and then details the main issues about which electors will be concerned. (I found this background information especially helpful.) Mr. Allen then explains exactly what will happen in Vatican City from the moment the Pope passes away, walking readers through the announcement of the Pope's death, the funeral arrangements, the assembly of the cardinals in Rome, the actual voting process, and into the first few days of the new papacy. Contained in the final chapters are explanations of the various voting blocs--for lack of a better term--within the College of Cardinals and biographies of possible candidates.John Allen's \\"Conclave\\" is a concise, erudite, and, above all, fascinating account of the history, politics, and process of papal elections. Lay Catholics will benefit from this book; for me, it served as a solid introduction to the Vatican as an institution and to the issues that face the Church today."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"Anyone with an interest in how the next pope will be selected and the Vatican's internal politics ought to buy this book now, because there will be undoubtedly be a run on it when the critical time arrives. Allen gives us snippets of papal history, describes the procedure for electing a pope, and discusses the underlying politics. (One fascinating tidbit: Did you know that bishops were elected by their priests until the mid-1800s?) Also, 55 pages serve as a reference manual to the cardinals who will be voting in the next conclave - each cardinal gets at least a paragraph summing up his unique characteristics and doctrinal stance.Some reviewers have accused Allen of being 'liberal' - an accurate label from the sort of Catholic who believes birth control is a sin, but most Catholics will find the author to be quite moderate. The author is not heavy-handed about his doctrinal views, but the book does convey how far typical North American practice has deviated from the pope's clear instructions. For example, according to papal decrees, divorcees must not be given communion, eucharistic ministers can only be used in unusual circumstances, and Catholicism is the only genuine path to God. There is a widening gap between the pope's decrees, which are being ignored with impunity, and ordinary practice.Allen predicts that the College of Cardinals will tilt toward the moderates in the next election, even though John Paul II has appointed almost all of the current cardinals. Time will tell. The Vatican's last remaining shreds of credibility are at stake in the next papal election."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"This is an interesting book that is perhaps most valuable for its index of (at the time) eligible Cardinals that is found in the back with detailed summaries of the history of each eminence.I think that John Allen does a pretty good job at presenting an introduction to the conclave process prior to the actual 2005 happening.While not the best of Allen's work, it is a nice addition to any Vatican watcher's library.Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"As one who is intensely interested in papal possibilities I devoured this book. It is written by a National Catholic Reporter correspondent, but the NCR bias is not too overt. He lists 20 Cardinals who he says are the group of which one will be the next Pope. But instead of listing them in the order of probability he lists them alphabetically! One of the 20 is already dead (Cardinal Nguyen Van Thuan), another has turned 80 (Cardinal Etchegaray) and will not even be in the next conclave. He does include in his list of front-runners Dionigi Tettamanzi, Cardinal Archbishop of Genoa, who for some time now has been my prediction for next Pope. Most of the book is pretty accurate as far as I can tell, tho I did note that on Page 119 he describes Pope Paul V as &quot;the Borgia Pope,&quot; which is incorrect, he being from the Borghese family--not from the Borgia family. A little older book which deals interestingly with the same topic is Passing the Keys: Modern Cardinals, Conclaves, and the Election of the Next Pope, by Francis A. Burkle-Young. That authority listed five papabili, but only three of those five are in Allen's top 20. Cardinal Neves is omitted because of his health problems, and Cardinal Piovanelli I presume because he is already 78--and the conclave is not imminent. This is an absobing book, as was The Inner Elite: Dossiers of papal Candidates, by Gary MacEoin and his committee, which I read 25 Aug 1978 and after reading which I predicted that Albino Luciani would be elected--and he was. But then when he died I predicted Sebastiano Baggio--and we all know that he wasn't elected. You should read this book and then see if you can predict the next Pope when the time comes for him to be elcted."},{"Title":"Conclave: The Politics, Personalities, and Process of the Next Papal Election (Revised & Updated Edition)","review":"I was very excited when I ordered and recieved this book in the mail yesterday. Today I have sent the book back for a refund. It was my belief that the book would reflect an accurate picture of a conclave, yet for Catholics the book is problematic. As a Catholic Theology student I could not help but notice that the author has a great misunderstanding of the difference between discipline,doctrine, and dogma. That women can not be admitted to the priesthood, and that artificial contraception is instrinsically evil are not simply church disciplines that can be changed. They are not, as the author would otherwise suggest, things that can over time be changed. Church disiplines include whether Latin or the Vernacular is predominant at mass, or whether the priest says mass towards the people or with his backing facing them, etc ( though they can be changed without compromising the faith, the faithful are oblidged to follow even church disciplines!). Obviously church teachings on Christ, his mother Mary, the sacraments ( such as the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist), as well as teachings on morals such as contraception and homosexuality are derived from scripture and tradition and are therefore church doctrines. Doctrine DEVELOPS, but does not ever change or contradict itself. The doctrines and dogmas about Christ developed as the early church fathers/mystics/theologicans etc. studies, meditated, contemplated Christ's mysteries. They are unchangeable, they are the foundation of the faith. A dogma, then is simply the papal proclamation alone or in union with the college of cardinals of a doctrine that is already held as infallible in the church. A dogma simply put, more greatly empowers the doctrine in a way that people become more aware of the unchanging doctrine. Thus, it was upsetting to see the author of this book in error on this subject. I ended up skimming the book last night in great disappointment. I will admit the author probably does have some interesting historical data and facts in the book, but that the book is theologically flawed turned me away. We can rejoice though that the holy spirit has guided the church in the selection of our new Pope, Benedict the XVI this day. Though popes may have at times led scandalous lives themselves, it is there teachings that are infallible, not their own lives. While many of them have been holy men of God, they are after all human, but the spirit has guided and led his One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic church for 2000 years through them. The journey continues. Certainly some points for the author of this book to ponder."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a bullfighter fan ( I am Spanish ) and in my life I have taken to bullfighting to many foreign friends, I know well their point of views about the fiesta in the beginning but when you explain what's all about and the so many rules and regulation a corrida has, and the so many things that are happening but you don't see, they absolutely enjoyed.I wanted to read this book in English because I would like to know the english vocabulary of the fiesta and how the fiesta was in 1931 that my father used to tell me, after finishing it I have to say that this is absolutely the best book about bullfighting I have ever read so far!.It is awesome how this american could achieve so vaste knowledge about this matter.I love the enthusiastic way he describes all the aspects of the fiesta,the bullfighters and their different technics,everything is here, even the two roads which existed in the age to get from Madrid to Seville.I like very much the comparision he does at the beggining of the book between wine and bullfighting.I thought I knew a lot about our national party but after reading this book I realised I was partially wrong.And what to say about the way Hemingway writes... It is absolutely phantastic, pure magic and amazing...My advice is if after reading this book you want to assist to a corrida do the possible to go with an aficionado you will enjoy the triple!!."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This book is for those who love bullfighting, those who loathe bullfighting and those who would like a few writing tips from a master.I read this book while I was in Spain, but I did not see a fight until I had finished. Going to a bullfight without knowledge or someone to guide me would have been overwhelming. But seeing the details Hemingway descibes come to life made it that much more exciting.For those who object to bullfighting you have that right. But don't object without knowing the how's or why's of what goes on. The most eye-opening thing you will see at a fight is the crowd getting upset at a fighter who takes liberties with a bull. Hemingway descibes in detail the purpose for every action taken in the ring, which gives clearity to what looks like cruelty.And finally, Hemingway gives advice on writing no writer should ignore. &quot;When you write, don't write characters...write people.&quot; If you are a writer, whether interested in bullfighting or not, you should read this book for the invaluable advice of a master.I can hardly think of a better way to spend an afternoon than hanging out with Papa Hemingway."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway is at his best when discussing the fine art of bullfighting. He demonstrates a great appreciation for the bloodsport without romanticizing it. However, the writing is uneven. He throws in incidental pieces such as his running dialog with an old lady which only serves to detract from the subject. I suppose he was having a little fun with his publishers who probably thought a book on bullfighting wouldn't wash with the general readership, but the old lady becomes a nuissance and I was happy that he dropped her a little over half way through the book.At the time, bullfighting would have probably seemed foreign to most American readers. But Hemingway notes the handfull of Americans and other expatriates who took part in the corrida. He laments the modernization of the sport in which the art of killing seemed to be lost. He provides an excellent description of the disciplines of bullfighting, the way in which it plays out like a three-act tragedy for the bull.The time frame is ca. 1930 but it doesn't seem the sport has changed much since then. It is one of the many traditions in Spain that has survived the upheavels of the 20th century. The Socialists tried to eradicate it but failed. Bullfighting takes on a metaphysical aspect in some of the matadors and bulls he describes. It is wonderful reading and a great introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway loved bullfighting. And Spain. His affection for these comes across in this book. Death in the Afternoon is also infused with Hemingway's personality, which has been called his greatest artistic creation, and that makes this book especially personal and interesting.This is a great book to read on a flight to Spain, particularly if you plan to see a bullfight. With your newly-minted expertise in bullfighting, you'll apreciate the pageant much more.But Death in the afternoon is not just about bullfighting. Hemingway discusses such topics as death, often death, war, writing, art (a comparison of the painters Goya, Velasquez and El Greco), love and Faulkner. This book is more than a guide to bullfighting -- it is good literature."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I don't approve of killing animals for entertainment, and this book did not change that disapproval. I endorse this book because of its qualities as a model for introducing a subject to a new learner, rather than for its subject matter.If you like bullfights, you will like this book because Death in the Afternoon will expand your understanding of what you see. If you want to go to bullfights, this is a good book also because it will tell you how to do so in the most enjoyable way for you.Most people will never attend a bullfight, because of ethical concerns, some personal dismay about their potential reaction to the violence and horror of the event, or due to lack of opportunity (bullfighting is mainly done in Spain and Mexico). Many of these people will have some interest in understanding more about bullfighting or the appeal and spectacle of the event. Death in the Afternoon provides you with a thoughtful way to satisfy any curiosity you may have.Hemingway set out to write &quot;an introduction to the modern Spanish bullfight and attempt[ed] to explain that spectacle both emotionally and practically.&quot; I think he more than succeeded.As a child, my parents sometimes took me to Tiajuana in Baja California where bullfights were regularly held on the weekends. We all agreed that we did not approve of killing bulls for sport, and never attended one. But my curiosity was aroused by the sight of the enormous crowds that regularly attended. Until reading this book, I could not understand the appeal. Now I do. I know that bullfights are not for me, but I now know why some like them very much.Hemingway leads you gently into the subject as though you were chatting while seated at a comfortable table in an outdoor cafe on a pleasant afternoon sipping your favorite beverages. In fact, for part of the book, he invents an &quot;old lady&quot; whom he converses with for comic effect.He tells you about his own experiences throughout beginning with, &quot;At the first bullfight I ever went to I expected to be horrified and perhaps sickened by what I had been led to believe would happen to the horses.&quot; It turned out that this was not his reaction at all. He liked the bullfight, and saw 1,500 bulls killed before writing this book. He also reports that many people he took to fights often experienced different emotions than they expected. Women who disliked violence did not automatically dislike bullfights, and macho men did not necessarily like them.The central emotion that &quot;good&quot; bullfights create is of grace in the face of death which is inspired by &quot;the closeness with which the matador brings the bull past his body and the slowness with which he can execute the pass.&quot;In the period about which he writes, the 1920s into 1931, bullfighting was in a &quot;decadent&quot; age brought about by a fascination with coming ever closer to the bull's horn and doing more and more elaborate cape work. In addition to the death of many bulls, this also brought about horrible injuries and death for virtually every bullfighter mentioned. That brings special meaning to Hemingway's assertion that bullfighting &quot;is not a sport in the Anglo-Saxon sense . . . .&quot; &quot;Rather it is a tragedy, the death of the bull . . . .&quot; But you will also come to know the tragedy of Joselito, Manuel Granero, and Maera.Despite my objections to bullfighting, I was tremendously impressed by Hemingway's powers of observation. You will learn about so many miniscule aspects and details of bullfighting, that it will leave your head spinning. For example, a bull that erratically charges to one side or another has to be handled much differently in each pass than one who is like a mechanical bull and is very predictable. Bullfighters prefer the latter, but some of the best work is with the former if the bull is malleable. Does the bullfighter try to teach the bull, or simply survive the experience? The reaction of the bullfighter tells much about his character. The reaction of the fans tells much about their knowledge and character. You feel like you are looking at the world through many revolving kaleidescopes as images are considered in the context of other images, like an unending house of mirrors.The book says a lot about character -- the character of those involved in bullfighting and the fans. Although Hemingway admires the &quot;honor&quot; of those who face death bravely and act properly in the bull ring, he also points out that too much &quot;honor&quot; is dangerous. In essence, he makes an argument against the values of bullfighting even though he is an aficionado.He is honest with us, by also sharing his own failed experiences with trying to learn to fight the bulls.The book is greatly aided by many detailed and impressive photographs that illustrate the points in the book that would otherwise be lost on the reader who has not attended a bullfight. There is also a 61 page glossary of terms to help you handle all of the new concepts he throws at you.There are some incidental benefits for those who decide not to attend bullfights. Hemingway provides many detailed descriptions of the geography, weather, and characteristics of the people in different parts of Spain. I got several ideas for places I would like to visit on future trips as a result. At the end, he laments that he could not work in the rest of Spain into the book beginning with the Prado. I shared that lament, because a similar book on Spain by Hemingway would have been even more interesting and valuable to me. I can only imagine what his other wonderful descriptions would have been like.I suggest you take this book and outline it to see the process by which Hemingway takes you from being a neophyte to a quite well-grounded person about bullfighting. How could you do the same for a subject that you need to introduce many people to? If you learn from his story-telling skills, you will be well-rewarded for your experience."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Many years ago, I watched a debate on TV in Spain. The debate was on bullfighting. The opponents of bullfighting, who would like to see the spectacle outlawed, declared that &quot;No good intelectual approved of bulfighting&quot; &quot;What about Hemingway?&quot; asked one of the proponents.What about Hemingway. He has simply written the best book I've ever read on the event/show/tradition of bullfighting. He loved it dearly, and this love permeates every page on the book. His descriptions of the corridas, of the cities where the &quot;Fiestas&quot; are held, although quite dated by now, hold an everlasting charm, that illustrates the scenes, with an expert palette of colors.Are you going to Spain? Are you planning to see a &quot;corrida de toros&quot;? If you read this book, you will know what it is about, and you will be able to appreciate it. The only thing better than this, would be to have a seat next to an &quot;entendido&quot; who would explain the whole &quot;fiesta&quot; to you.I read this book in high school, and reread it now, 27 years later. It is still enthralling, and its charm has only gotten better over the years.Hemingway saw the bullfight as a stylized tragedy; his understanding of the bullfight, mixes with his understanding and love for Spain. At the end, he cannot escape the conclusion that Spain would not be Spain, withouth the bulls and the bullfighting. This even though only a minority of Spaniards go to bullfights, or are even remotely interested in the &quot;fiesta&quot;It's a pity there is no one now who could develop an updated version of this classic."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Death in the Afternoon marks Hemingway's first major experiment in style and genre. While it is about bullfighting, and a marvelous one at that, this book is equally (and perhaps more importantly) about the art of writing as well as the writer himself, or more specifically Hemingway. When viewed in this context Death in the Afternoon reaches a much more complex structure and one demanding closer attention."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Though at the end of the book Hemingway states that his book is in no way intended to be an all inclusive book on bullfighting, it is considered by many to be \\"the\\" best book ever written on the subject. A literary triumph for those interested and those opposed to bullfighting, filled with details of what goes on before, during, and after the fights both from the matadors' and spectators' point of views. If you've never been to a bullfight, this book will put you ring-side to the artistry that is bullfighting. (It is easy to see why this book is so well esteemed, Hemmingway's writing is an art all its own and this book is his fiercest ever.)Al fin del libro Hemingway dice que no lo debemos considerar el libro todo inclusivo de tauromaquia o corrida de toros, muchos lo consideran el libro definito en el tema. Un triunfo literario paro los interesados y los opuestos a las corridas, lleno de detalles de lo que susede antes, durante, y despues de las corridas en los ojos del matador y los espectadores. Si nunca ha ido a una corrida, este libro lo pondria pormedio del matador y el toro en el arte de la tauromaquia. (Es facil ver porque este libro es tan bien estimado, el estilo de Hemmingway es un arte enteramente suyo y este libro es su mas feroz.)"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am an aficionado of the corrida and, almost necessarily, loved this book. It is the best thing every written on the subject and, although I don't agree with Hemingway's every point, I still enjoy it. The book was written in 1930 and, even then, he decries a certain corruption in the spectacle. He maintains that the bulls have been bred down in size to make it easier for the matador to work and ultimately kill the bull. Maybe, although I haven't seen this tendency during my lifetime.He also decries the fact that the emphasis is less and less on the killing as opposed to pageantry and hot-dogging [read Mitchener's \\"Mexico\\"]. There is some truth in this but, even back in 1930, Madrid was becoming a tourist mecca and, to a certain extent, the matadors were and are playing to unsophisticated audiences. On the other hand, my experience in less touristy areas has been the opposite. The kill, although not the total point of the fight, is definitely the most important part. Pity the poor matador who has a perfect fight only to have his sword, at the \\"moment of truth\\", glance off a rib. He won't get two ears and a tail. He'll be lucky if he gets one ear.I think Hemingway should have more emphasized that the corrida is NOT a sport. It is a tragedy which appeals to the Spanish [and some non-Spanish]mind. It is not meant to be \\"fair\\" in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word. A brave beast rages courageously only to be bloodied, broken and killed. The matador, on his part, needs to be just as brave. If you don't think so, just try to face an enraged 1500 lb beast with a cape and a flimsy sword. To go to a bullfight hoping the matador will be knocked down and gored, would be like going to a ballet and hoping the prima ballerina fall on her face.It is a deliberate tragedy where sometimes the dead bull gets a bigger hand than does the matador. It appealed to Hemingway's fatalism. Most of his stories, if you think about it, mirrored the corrida. \\"All true stories end in death.\\" He said. If you read his tales most end with defeat and death. The Snows of Kilamanjaro, The Old Man and the Sea, The Short and Happy life of Francis MacComber, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls and many, many others. I wonder if he was thinking of the wounded bull when he loaded his shotgun that day...Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Being a bullfight aficionado for many years has thought me something: one never ends learning about the &quot;fiesta&quot;. So eaven if you are a great aficionado or if you are just courios, this work will teach you how to see the bullfights from another point of view. Hemingway first introduces you to understand what happens in the mind of those who take part in the world of bullfights, then takes you there, with found and tender descriptions of everything a newcomer to the bullfights should know and many things the old aficionados should remember allways. I belive it's the best literature available in english about the subject. It's eaven better than most serious books about bullfighting written by spaniards, mexican or latinamerican experts through out this century, and the Hemingway style is good as ever."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Ernest Hemingway brings a unique and interesting perspective to any subject which he writes on, Death in the Afternoon is no exception. Hemingway does not follow any set pattern in the way he examines bullfighting, but the first few chapters describe his early experiences with bullfighting and the mechanics of a bullfight. Later he analyzes different bullfighters' techniques and their own personal styles. Some fighters he likes much more than others, for various reasons. Throughout the book their are anecdotes about the author's own experience with bullfights as well as stories of many famous matadors' triumphs and tragedies in and out of the arena.Although bullfighting seems like an obscure and insignificant topic on which to write a book, Hemingway describes it vividly and with enthusiasm. He is very obviously in love with the world of the matador. A bullfight is a complicated affair involving many people. It is dangerous and that it what draws many of the spectators to the sport. Hemingway looks past most of the brutality and danger, he writes about the pageantry and culture that has evolved to make the bullfight what it is today. It is difficult to read about a subject that you have little or no interest in, it is far more difficult to write on a subject which most people have little or no interest in. The author avoids droning on about the minutia of bullfighting but still manages to teach the intricacies of it to the reader. He does this by adding first hand accounts of bullfighting and how it affects all aspects of a person's life who is involved with the sport. Hemingway also adds anecdotes about the towns and cities that host the fights. These stories help immensely in holding the reader's interest.Some people might be so disgusted with the idea of bullfighting that no matter how well it is written about, they will still hate it. But it is not as cruel and archaic as it seems at first glance. Bullfighting is a Spanish tradition and like many things it has become an art form. It is more of a play than a sport and unfortunately, it is a very dangerous and bloody production. But no matter what you think of the sport itself, no one can deny that any book more aptly depicts bullfighting than Death in the Afternoon."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I got this book for Christman two years ago. At that point in my life I was infatuated with everything Hemingway and assumed that this was a novel about bullfighting. Well, it's not. But, if you read it with an open mind, you just might want to see a bullfight for yourself. Good style, reminds me of Mark Twain's &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This is the only book I found written in English that describes the Bullfighting with great detail. I do not consider it to be a great novel but it is closer to be a &quot;text book&quot;. The art and technique of bullfighting is explained to you in a warm, friendly and casual way, just likes your grandfather or a close friend would."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway was a genius, who's produced timeless works of art, but that doesn't make him a nice person.He liked travelling to Africa with big guns in his suitcase to shoot at animals who never hurt him, he presented women as cold-blooded beaches, and loved watching Spanish gypsies playing around with 'harmless' bulls for a few minutes before killing them. Notice the word 'harmless': the reason why most matadors get gored is that they challenge fate and practically throw themselves in the horns in the name of breathtaking performance, not because bulls are dangerous in the ring; the whole game has been so carefully arranged that the bull stands no chance, it is absolutely helpless; the casino always wins; this is what I had to say about Hemingway's statements of 'honor' of the bullfight.I'm supposed to review the book, and not the ethics of bullmurders, but when Hemingway says --I'm sorry, but I don't have the book in front of me to cite-- that watching a man killing a bull is a deeply spiritual experience, I don't get what he's talking about.He doesn't disregard ethics. He acknowledges the validity of people who view bull-murdering as disgusting. To them, he has two things to say: First --quote not taken from the author, but implied by him, or so the reviewer understands the book-- \\"be open minded, see what a fine art this is, with so many small details, high technical skill, aesthetic considerations, and see the beauty of this splendid art\\". Second, --and this quote I remember quite accurately-- \\"ethical is whatever makes you feel good afterwards, while unethical is whatever makes you feel bad. Since bullfights leave you with a pleasant feeling, then they're ethical.\\" I'm not kidding: that's what he says. (... and Hitler says that turning Jews into soap is ethical.)Now let's try to make some more objective comments, about the book and not bullfighting. This book is like an ultra-exhaustive documentary of bullfights, trying to explain EVERY single detail and minutaea of this elaborate, more-than-meets-the-eye performance. Every aspect of it, from the breeding up to the killing of the bull, gets its own chapter, heavy on details. It gets really anal, ie boring sometimes, and combined with extensive details about the lives, careers, and specific performances of many matadors, makes for a pretty tiring reading. Don't take my word for it. Hemingway admits it, too, and finishes most chapters with random snippets to break the pattern of boring, technical information; and fails. Some chapters end with imaginary dialogues between him and an old lady who claims the book is boring, to which the author replies:\\"it's a technical book, these books aren't meant to be interesting.\\" In one chapter the old lady is bored to death, so Hemingway adds the short story \\"Natural history of the dead\\". The story is irrelelevant to the book, and to the corresponding chapter. He admits he just adds it to spice up a boring book. Other chapters finish with the author's meditations on various subjects such as authorship --from the 400pgs, no more than 3-4 pgs speak about writing-- and other topics, and these are interesting and the only reason why I don't give the book one star. Also there are a couple of interesting paragraphs with great descriptions, written with ingenuous prose, but nothing more.I already knew I hated bullmurdering but since Hemingway is one of my favorite authors, I decided to read it just for technical, prose-studying purposes. I found myself skimming a lot. Then, I found myself skimming much more. The good news is, the book made me hate bullmurdering even more, exposing the hypocrisy of the whole thing, speaking of 'honor' when there is clearly none, uplifting murdering of helpless animals into an intensely emotional, spiritual, even religious experience.(if I remember well, he does say it's almost religious.)I'd recommend this book only to die-hard aficionados of bullfighting and people who intend to seriously study Hemingway's writing style. Those with only a mild interest in fiestas, and those who aren't writers and see no reason in studying Hemingway's prose, would waste their time. If you read Hemingway for entertaining reasons only, stick to his novels: he didn't write this book for people like you."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"If you are looking for informative stuff on bullfighting then there you go: this book will do. Now, if you plan to read this book because you're into Hemingway and have no specific interest in bullfighting, then you may get bored. I personally have no interest in bullfighting and despite all the explanations and understanding I got from this book I still consider the corrida a thing that should not exist, simply because inflicting pain on beings who can feel it is plain wrong no matter how sophisticated you make it, no matter what Nobel prize winner praises it.The thing to know is that this book is not solely about bullfight. That's where those of you really interested in Hemingway will find their interest. There are a couple of things in this book that you'd not expect, such as some short stories and some dissertations on art and what it is to write. Hemingway compares bullfight to writing in some passages and the area of death in relation to people is dealt with to some extent.I would not recommend this book unless you want to know about bullfight. I read it because I HAD to, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I found this book fascinating.

His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better, since this was Hemingway. Instead, it kept getting worse."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I read this book for the literary circle at my high school, and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure, so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure, the author strays off the \\"topic\\" (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about \\"venereal diseases\\", which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting, or possibly Ernest Hemmingway, it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books, including \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", are definitely worth the read.

In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Bullfighting was born in Spain many centuries ago and spread to some major areas of its former empire like Mexico, that still exhibition this bloodsport today with much fanfare. The gaming spectacle of blood theatre playingout in the style of an ancient roman Colosseum arena with gladiators, but now elegant sportsmen fighting animals to the death, is brought out in modern times to its raw and brash honesty as an echoing from the past. In this post dark ages blood sport a tragedy plays out in the bullfight, metaphysically representing the first time in history a dismounted man came face to face with a blood drunk king of beasts at the top of the animal kingdom, one that had only furious jungle murder in its sights.When I first began reading this book, I found myself becoming stuck in the first chapter, reading and re-reading it, until I had to make a decision whether or not to continue with it or put it down, indeed I find this sport inhumane and yet tantalizing on many levels, primarily because Hemingway's writing style has a way of bringing you down to cold reality in touch with that lucid and unforgiving matter of fact universal cosmos that seems to manifest itself in us - you and me - as nothing more than dances of birth, blossoming, and death, all of it mortality repeated forever and ever in the context of an echoing and rhyming immortality.There is a distinctly Judeo-Christian paradigm to this triumph over uncertain danger by man in this sometimes contrived flamenco dance of death between the flamboyantly dressed killer and wild beast, reflected in its bravura and sometimes cowardice of individual men, but in the triumph as sword plunges into the bull's jugular vein, mankind ascends upward in his own evolution as a species. The death of the beast enables civilization to occur as the Judaism-Christian God intended man to have dominion over all animals as stated in Genesis and practiced philosophically by these this religious symbiosis. In a clear sense then, to fail in a bullfight is to fail God in a devout Christian society. When a Matador is gored in the arena, killed, fully disabled or minorly injured, the crowds often turn against him as if he were a cowardly heretic.A symbolic transformation occurs after the matador kills the bull, he becomes more than a man and less than a god, representing the turning point when mankind ascends to the highest rank over the untamed world, that is when he conquers -- without strength, but intellect and ballet elegance -- the king of aggressive big game beasts with its two big thickly solid and razer pointed horns, attached to a testosterone surging 1500 lbs tank of raging-rippling muscles on galloping hooves. With blood lusting dark eyes, snot spray and a thick neck that is physically stronger than an Olympic powerlifter, the beast now charging you at full speed with its head down for the undivided intention of cracking off its invincible horns in your chest and skull cavities, zigzagging them and breaking you up like a clay flower pot (H, 1932) packed with dark soil and blooming red flowers - then tossing your corps in the air like a swinging-spinning rag doll. This is how fast this choreographed drama can change on a dime as the stadium crowd goes berserk, jumping into the arena en mass, police out numbered, the bull is ripped apart savagely by rioting mobs, as it sadly falls to its humble knees. It is here we learn the truth as mankind descends, returning to the subhuman and uncivilized animal kingdom."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A lot of times people end up hating something because they cant understand it.

You don't even have to read the rest of the book or care about bullfighting."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway was young when he wrote this, about 30. However, he would have had to be a man of 70 who had devoted his entire life to bullfighting to have written this in the way he would have wanted us to believe.He had lots of help. The book is chockablock with bullfighting history, and Ernie would have us think he was there during most of it. Sure, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But he had others weigh in with information in this book, which is okay. But believe it.Now the bullfight:Three matadors per afternoon. Each matador faces two bulls. So, that makes six fights.There are three acts to a bullfight.1. After the bull charges into the ring, he faces the picadors, the guys on horseback with short-tipped lances. They are short-tipped because they are not for killing but for injuring and weakening the bull, softening him up, so to speak.In olden times, the horses were routinely gutted by the bulls, leaving them stumbling around, trailing their guts. Yuck. That was ugly, and they finally quit doing that. Now the horses wear padding. No more guts.2. After the picadors, the bulls must face the banderillas, which are shorter sticks, also with points, which are stuck in the bull's back in pairs by somebody on foot. This is a tricky operation, and it serves about the same purpose as the pics, to wear down the bull.The matador may place the banderillas, or may have underpaid helpers do it.Wearing down the bull is good for the matador because these bulls are nasty customers. They are not simply big domestic bulls. They are fairly wild animals, or they were in Hemingway's day and before. Today? Who knows?The female of the bullfighting bull hardly has a visible udder, which may go to explain in part the hellacious disposition of their husbands.3. Okay, so now the bull is getting a little winded and disappointed because the fight is not going his way. Let's kill him.The matador does this on foot with the cape in his left hand (usually) and the sword in the other. He misleads the bull with the cape, perhaps with some flourishes to make himself look good up in the stands, and while the bull zips by, he sticks the sword into his back, severing his spinal cord or aorta.The bull doesn't last much longer.This happens in an ideal world. What really happens can get messy, especially the last part. Sometimes the bull wins, not the matador.This will delight vegetarians, tree-huggers and others of their ilk.Hemingway can't punctuate worth a flip, and his sentence construction often leads much to be desired. He also slips into purple prose on occasion. To wit:Speaking of bullfighter Alfredo Corrochano (perhaps you know of him), Hemingway says this:He had \\"a rather Bourbonic face a little like that of Alfonso XIII as a child.\\"This is silly because it tells us nothing. Who knows what Alfonso XIII looked like as an adult, let alone as a child? Not you. Not me. Not anybody.This is a fine book if you want to learn about bullfighting. If you want good sentence construction and punctuation, go elsewhere. Almost half the book is given to photos and a glossary.All told, it serves the purpose. Now I have to go to Mexico City to see a bullfight in person.And don't forget: This is not a sport. It is a tragedy. For the bull.But sometimes for the bullfighter."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"At the time that Hemingway wrote this book the rather exotic art of bullfighting was fairly unknown to English audiences. Hemingway almost single-handedly drove many expatriate Americans and Europeans of the \`lost generation' to the corrida. Some of his novels and short stories also have the bullring as a backdrop. This book is an interesting combination of Hemingway's literary flair and a how to book on the art of bullfighting. The bullfight experience (watching, that is) became a mandatory exercise for later, mainly American, male writers and formed a rite of passage for manly writing. One thinks immediately of Norman Mailer but there were others.Having watched a bullfight in Mexico I find it hard to see the interest that Hemingway and the others had in the sport. I do not care for prizefighting either. I will admit to having spent many a fruitless hour watching the 'bullpen' of the beloved home town Red Sox at Fenway Park blow a lead that would make any bull see red. On its own terms, Hemingway surely had more than an amateur interest in describing the ritual of the fight and grading the performances of man and beast. That part, in essence, the literary part is what held my interest. If one suspends a certain disbelief about the obvious surface brutality of the event and rather delves into the \`man against nature' and \`dancing with death' aspects that is where you will find Hemingway. Ole"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"It is a good book to get some background information about what you will see when you enter the bullring. It isn't 100% interesting in that some parts of it are off the subject, but for the most part it is great because I promise that going into a bullfight with no advance knowledge is a bad idea. Also, remember that it was written in 1932 and is maybe not 100% up to &quot;the times&quot; in a way, but it shows Hemingway's style of writing which for the most part is an excellent style. I think that you should buy it because it has some helpful things in it about everything relating to bullfighting from where to sit, to what to what, to where to go, to how to tell if a bull is brave or cowardly, etc. Again, for the most part, it is a great classic novel about a great classic sport (but &quot;not in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word&quot; (from the book)). So if you are going to have something to do with a bullfight you should read this book."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I liked this book! Trying to defend &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; in these politically correct times is like trying to argue that Hitler was just a misunderstood guy with some unconventional ideas. Oh well, here goes. Let's start with the basics. The book is largely non-fiction. It deals with bullfighting. It is written by Hemingway. And it goes into considerable detail about actual bullfighters who by now must certainly be dead. What possible &quot;relevance&quot; can this book have today? The answer: &quot;plenty.&quot; What I like most about &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; is Hemingway's honest (and I think genuine) attempt to explain --not defend -- the appeal that bullfighting has to its followers. Hemingway nowhere claims to be unbiased. He enjoys bullfights and doesn't pretend otherwise. Nor does he apologize for its harsh realities. His honest assessment, for example, that padding the horses has far more to do with protecting Anglo-American sensibilities than the flanks of the horses -- and that the pads, therefore, are themselves dishonest -- is refreshing and too little seen among today's writers. So too are his frank admissions that the bull doesn't have a chance, that a bullfight is not a &quot;contest&quot; in the usual sense, and that it is really &quot;a drama carried out in three acts.&quot; What writer today--regardless of his views--dares speak with such honesty? Hemingway's honest comments regarding the different styles and abilities of actual bullfighters are something few, if any, of today's writers would attempt. (Admittedly, libel laws might have something to do with this.) The &quot;anti-esthetic&quot; and &quot;praying-mantis&quot; manner of Nicanor Villalta is contrasted with the &quot;grace&quot; of Cagancho. After ridiculing Villalta's cape work and praising Cagancho's, Hemingway points out Cagancho's cowardice and redeems Villalta with the observation that, &quot;Villalta kills though in a way no gypsy ever killed and it would be unfair to show how silly he looks with his feet apart and not show him leaning in after the sword.&quot; Who writes like that nowadays? For a work of non-fiction, &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; is a rich source of those thoughts and phrases that have a kind of universal truth to them beyond their literal meaning and that stay with you long after the book is finished. Some of my favorites: &quot;Ver llegar: to watch them come; the ability to watch the bull come as he charges with no thought except to calmly see what he is doing and make the moves necessary to the manouever you have in mind.&quot; (This one even found it's way into Gerry Spence's book, &quot;How to Argue and Win Everytime.&quot;) &quot;THE SEED BULL. At twenty-two years the horns are splintered; the eyes are slow and all the weight has gone forward and away from where eight hundred and twenty-two sons came from to the ring....&quot; (Is this the fate of most men, too?) &quot;And finally El Gallo in one of the seies of delicate formal compositions that the happier part of his life in the ring consisted of. The bull, as he should be, is dead. The man, as he should be, is alive and with a tendency to smile.&quot; I dont' know about you, but I like stuff like that. If you find yourself saying things like, &quot;I just don't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy...,&quot; -- and you are in fact someone who genuinely WANTS to understand -- do yourself a favor and give this book a chance. Just as Moby Dick is about more than a whale, this book is about more than just bullfighting."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"An epic tome on the art and grandeur of Spanish bullfighting from one of America's greatest aficionados, Ernest Hemingway, who explicates the craft and spiritual intensity of this ancient European ritual through terse, journalistic, prose and rigorous scholarship. Not surprisingly, Hemingway is not terribly perturbed by the grotesque barbarity of the violence of bullfighting; Hemingway was an enthusiast of hunting and had little to no moral qualms about killing animals (and sometimes people). Yet he is not totally insensitive, warning the reader that most spectators of bullfighting are normally disgusted by the killing of the horses more than anything else.For Hemingway, the bullfight is not meant to be understood as an equal battle between man and beast. Rather, it is a tragedy, and the tragedy is for the bull who ought to be killed. He writes, \\"The best of all fighting bulls have a quality, called nobility by the Spanish, which is the most extraordinary part of the whole business\\" (113), yet Hemingway does not provide any comment on the utter absurdity of the whole business. Hemingway was a writer obsessed with, and in search of true courage in the face of natural danger and fate, and he found it most explicitly in war and in bullfighting.However, some readers will be surprised to find that \`Death in the Afternoon,' is not simply about bullfighting. Hemingway also expounds quite at length about his views on art and the craft of writing. He says: \\"When writing a novel, a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature\\" (191). Unfortunately, Hem was never fully successful at creating a living woman, but every writer has a weakness. \\"A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl\\" (192).Also included in this altogether excellent volume is a collection of stunning photographs depicting various stages of the bullfight and various matadors of fame; there are also fascinating portraits of the running of the bulls in Pamplona (echoing those fabulous sequences in \`The Sun also Rises'). Additionally, Hemingway has provided the reader with a detailed glossary of important bullfighting terms for true aficionados. Originally published through Scribner in 1932."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Probably the best English language book on the subject. Although the book deals with bullfighting as it existed during the 20's and 30's in Spain, it's observations about the art are still valid today. A must read for anyone who wants to understand bullfighting or Hemingway's facination with the subject and Spain"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This book is a treatise on the appreciation of a bullfight; Hemingway's guide on how to become an aficionado. In addition to the excellent text, the book includes pictures, a glossary and commentary from those who have attended. One wonders how many bullfights over how many years were attended by Hemingway in compiling both a snapshot of the history of bullfighting at the time (1930s) and a full discussion of the intricacies of a bullfight that determine the quality of the performance.As someone who has never seen nor read about bullfights, the detail laid out within was both captivating and compelling. The book starts at the beginning laying out the places where bullfighting can be seen, the organization and tradition of bullfighting in Spain, the physical layout of the ring, the breeding of bulls, the training and evolution of matadors and ultimately the phases of the fight itself. While reading the passages I found myself both not believing what was actually being done to the bull and wondering why the toreros put themselves in the ring at all given the risk. This duality of both cruelty and bravery is the kernel of what makes bullfighting so compelling to not only the Spanish but the millions who attend each year. It makes this book a page-turner, despite the odd, and in my mind, useless intra-chapter dialogues between author and non-descript \\"old woman\\". Hemingway builds on this basic draw to the spectacle, evolving the sensibility of the aficionado to both the science and art of the bullfight and the dependence of greatness on the two primary protagonists. One cannot have a good bullfight with a mediocre bull, nor can one expect a great fight with an ill-trained and less courageous matador. Through the final stage of the fight, bull and matador connect on the nexus of death. The punishment preset on the bull before the introduction of the matador is not always effective and matadors suffer repeated horrific injuries from the bull and sometimes death. In nearly every case however, as so perfectly described by Hemingway, the 3-4 year old colossal fighting bull dies. A methodical ballet of spears and capes wears down the bull through three stages of the fight until he can be impaled through the shoulders with the sword of the matador ending his life in the ring that he was bred for. Death in the Afternoon provides a dramatic and thorough description of this tradition penned by a master hand."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"One thing that Hemingway clears up is that bullfighting is not a contest between man and beast. It is a tragedy; no matter if the bull succeeds in killing the matador, and all the picadors and bandierros for that matter, he will still be executed after the fight. This is pure art, and nothing more. I can't explain why to you, but Hemingway says that it is very Spanish, and to understand it you must understand the Spaniards.This is just a general overview of bullfighting. The book is very descriptive and very much more worth your time. You will find that there is something of the bullfight and the muleta in all of us.The three steps of the bullfight are clear and showcase the bull. (It is worth mentioning that these are not just any bulls: they are finely bred fighting bulls that are too agressive to be good for anything else.)One: the bull shows his strength and bravery in the killing of the horses in the first stage with the picador. The picador pierced the muscle on his shoulder, therefore showing the bravery of the bull if he continues through the pain to gore the horse. After this stage, the dead horses are covered and the bandierros enter the ring.Two: The bandierros use small spears with hooks on them so they stay in the bull's hide. They are 'set' in pairs in the large hump of agrivated muscle over the withers. These are used to raise the neck of the bull and therefore weakening it so the matador can do his work. In this stage the bull is confused: he cannot (if the man knows his work and is not unlucky) catch the man as he did in the last stage. His courage is useless.Three: The matador enters the arena (or barrera, I believe...it's been a while) to finish the bull. At this stage, the bull is tired and his head is beginning to droop. His shoulders are covered in blood but he stands there arrogant. The matador cannot rise over the horns of the bull to kill in his origional condition; therefore, he must tire him over the course of the three stages. The matador does his part with the muleta (cape) and then kills the bull by stabbing him with a sword to his heart. It is here, Hemingway will tell you, that the bull is either said to be killed or assasinated. If the matador is competent, his body will come over the top of the horn. If the bull lifts his head, the matador is gored. Thus, in a proper kill, the bull in the end had a chance to kill again. If the matador pulls back at the last second and just stabs the animal without the threat, he is said to \\"assasinate.\\"This is excellent. Your friends might look at you a little funny for reading about \\"killing bulls\\" and not understand that it is...well, an ART. This is just plain wonderful. Hemingway again does a terriffic job, showing more of his journalistic side than in For Whom the Bell Tolls.Excellent read, but not for everyone. Get it from the library and read the first few chapters. If you still feel sorry for the bulls after that, you're on your own."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I'm glad to see a reissue of this classic in hardcover.If you are interested in bullfighting, Hemingway or Spain you should find this book interesting, enjoyable reading.It is a playful introduction into bullfighting and at the same time a reminiscence of Spain and bullfighting.The book deals with the art of bullfighting as it existed in the twenties.That said, most of the passes, techniques, tricks, foibles he describes still exist in bullfighting as it is practiced today. And while not extremely deep on the technical side of the subject, this is the most readable of any book on the technical aspects of bullfighting I've come across. If you want to understand the basics of bullfighting, this would be an excellent place to start.Hemingway profiles a handful of matadors. They are all from impoverished backgrounds, basic peasant stock, that despite the fame and money they never can quite leave behind this past. It was a much more dangerous profession then, before the advent of antibiotics when death from a septic wound was a risk from even a minor goring.Hemingway is unrestrained in his love of Spain and this shines through the book."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"\\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is Ernest Hemingway's tribute to the bull fighting. Here Hemingway shares with the reader his insights gleaned from years of intense study of the art. This book covers the terms and actions of the fight along with the author's personal evaluations of what makes a bull fighter great and what makes a great bull fight. He also explains the inner soul of the matador and how it connects to the soul of Spain. Much of the content is devoted to his own observations and the stories of individual bull fighters.I have never seen a bull fight so I started reading with a fairly neutral curiosity. I was quickly drawn into the story. At time I had trouble following the individuals, equipment and the stages involved in the bull fight, but I still found the book to be enjoyable. At the end I felt that I had a much better understanding of the lure of the bull fight and what to watch for if I would ever see one. I had no background into the history of bull fighting or those enshrined in its pantheon. To reader interested in the history and art of the bull fight, this book would probably be an indispensable tome. To me it was a very enjoyable read. Hemingway has a way of telling a story that is entertaining, word after word. Even the seemingly endless narratives of the heroes of the rings held my attention due to the skillful writing employed throughout. I ended up with an openness to attend a bull fight, if the opportunity presents itself, and questions in my own mind about how the sport has evolved since the original writing in the 1930s. Whether you are a fan of the bull fight or merely enjoy a story skillfully told, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is a classic to be savored."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"For Ernest Hemingway, a fiesta wasn't a fiesta until someone got killed, preferably a 1,400-pound male bovine, horns dripping with horse blood, legs up in front of thousands of cheering Spaniards. That was the world of the bullfight, a world Hemingway discovered by accident while on a break from mingling with the Lost Generation in Paris, and made his own with the help of this book.First published in 1932, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" may be what separates Papa's truest fans from mere admirers like myself. Most people who value writing understand that Hemingway wrote very well, but many like me would go on to say we wish he spent less time on attitude and posturing and developed a surer sense of focus, in line with \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"In Our Time.\\" But for those who drink and fish and grow white beards in emulation of their hero, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is THE book precisely because it so messily captures Hemingway's self-image of the macho artist.\\"Death In The Afternoon\\" starts out with a rambling chapter that deals with American attitudes about bullfighting rather than the thing itself. It finishes with a self-indulgent one where he outlines all the things he left out as if giving a long-winded Oscar speech. In between is much to admire, for bullfighting aficionados and vegetarians alike, including some of the most arresting passages in American letters.\\"Someone with English blood has written: 'Life is real; life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal,'\\" Hemingway writes. \\"And where did they bury him? and what became of the reality and the earnestness?\\"Hemingway's theme, here and throughout the book, seems to be that death and suffering are the things of life, its essence and only ultimate truths. Only art lends them meaning. Of all art, Hemingway finds bullfighting the truest and most inspiring because of how close it is to the bone of the matter, to death, and how transitorily it is experienced. All art, even the most lasting, ultimately fades, but only in bullfighting is that impermanence accepted and understood.Hard words, hard philosophy. But Hemingway works hard too at entertaining the reader, often quite successfully. He tells of one matador's farewell performance where he dedicates the killing of his last bull before the fact to first one, than another, and then a third person, so caught up is he in the moment and his own eloquence. There is an ongoing discussion with an old lady frankly curious about the sex habits of both bull and bull-killer. He extols Faulkner, has at Huxley, and fesses up to how he must come off: \\"The fellow is no philosopher, no savant, an incompetent zoologist, he drinks too much and cannot punctuate readily...He is bull crazy.\\"The book comes with a generous number of photographs with Hemingway-written captions that are works of art in miniature. Under a photo of a dead matador surrounded by people, he notes: \\"Only two in the crowd are thinking about Granero. The others are all intent on how they will look in the photograph.\\"I didn't really buy Hemingway's take on some things, especially the issue of the horses. He opposes padding their undersides to protect them from bull horns as it violates the aesthetic of the performance. Then he writes of how the picadors riding the horse will use the horse's horning as a way of artificially tiring the bull to give the matador an easier time. Doesn't padding then produce a better bullfight?Hemingway also loses his train of thought, in ways that impair rather than enrich the reading experience. One moment he's talking about the handling of the muleta or the politics of the cuadrilla, the next he is talking about a pair of homosexuals or how langostinos are best enjoyed.It's really about a man discovering a country he loves, and in that sense, the Spanish backdrop is the best thing about \\"Death In The Afternoon.\\" It's a love letter with more than a touch of sadness; the Spain Hemingway knew was about to be lost, to civil war and Franco, for the rest of his lifetime. But nothing was forever to Hemingway. In the world of the bullring, he found the closest thing to perfection he could believe in. Believe it or not, you have to admire the result."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a big Hemingway fan, but had put off reading this one because of my lack of interest in bullfighting. However, this book amply confirms the idea that if the writer is good enough, he/she can make anything interesting. I have never seen a bullfight in my life, nor do I intend to, and yet I loved this book. The descriptions of the bullfighters' motions and the art of bullfighting is poetic in its simplicity. My one caveat: be ready to get a lot of bullfighting terminology thrown at you. Pay attention to the explanations early on or you won't know what he's talking about later."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"In Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway describes the sport/art of bullfighting. His knowledge of the bullfighting is extensive enough to show the writer's passion for his subject. He discusses many of the greater Matadores of his time (most of these figures are from the twenties and thirties), and explains what seperates one from another. He describes the Matadores in such a way as to show them as either dynamic, courageous figures, despicably cowardly men (who only fight in order to fulfill contracts), or as tragically deficient faliures. It is a pity that none of these people still fight, for Hemingway gives you such insight into their personalities and styles that it would be wonderful to actually see them in action. That is one major stregnth of this book, it connects the reader to the men in to ring. Hemingway's passion for this sport, as well as it's performers, is transfered to the reader. In that sense, it's a very personal book. Hemingway also goes into detail as to the structure of bullfighting. He discusses the roles played by the various figures (the Picadores, bandelleros, and the Matadore himself) within the arena. With great lucidity, he goes through the process of a bullfight: From selection of the bull to it's death at the hands of the Matadore (or the Matadore at the horns of the bull). Thorugh anecdotes, and frank discussion, Hemingway lays out the foundation of how a bullfight is properly performed (by every single member of the bullfighting team). He also points out the consequences, and disappointment, of a poorly performed match. Overall, this work is very enlightening in terms of the structure of bullfighting. The only negative aspect of this book is that Hemingway wrote it so long ago. Thus, his encyclopedic knowledge of the bullfighters is almost wasted (for none of them fight today). That's not too much of a negative though. In all, I would recomend this book for anyone who is interested in learning more about the structure of bullfighting, and also anyone who is interested in Hemingway (it gives you a certain amount of insight into his beliefs, and character)."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"As I die hard fan of Hemingway, I found this one rather mediocre compared with such greats as A Farewell To Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is not his finest work. Even still, it contains curiously interesting tidbits of information about the nature of the bullfight, though it seems needlessly lengthy at times. At least worth a look."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A disclaimer really needs to be made in regards to this book. It is not a work of fiction. It is not a traditional non-fiction book in that it cites a bunch of facts and figures from well-known sources. It is grusome in some regard. It will make you think. It may even make you cry.Now...I have seen just one bullfight in my life, and for some strange reason I had enjoyed it. I didn't understand it, but I got caught up in what was going on. I read this book because I am going to Spain and was thinking of possibly going to a bullfight and wanted to know more about it. This book has really done a lot for me - including to help change my mind!This is not a typical Hemingway book! The reader gets the feeling that Hemingway is sharing a table at a Spanish taverna, sipping wine and eating tapas, while sharing his thoughts and views on bullfighting. There are no sources. Hemingway is his own source. He outlines and describes the tragedy (as he calls it, for bullfighting is not a \\"sport\\" as Anglo-Saxon people understand the word) to those who have no understanding. At times, he does ramble. Just as some one who is truly sitting next to you talking to you would likely get off topic at times. It makes it more real. Much of the material is dated, but the book was written in 1931!However, the basic principles of bullfighting remain the same. It is a tragedy that has continued since Roman times, and with just a few changes over the centuries. Hemingway does a terrific job in helping readers from countries who do not have this tradition try to understand this play of life and death.If one is looking for a book to entertain and escape, this is not it! If one is looking to understand what bullfighting is, from some one who admired the play of tragedy, then this could be a very helpful read. But do expect this book to change you. For me, I once supported bullfighting wholeheartedly. After reading this, I find it disgraceful. Your mileage will vary. This book packs influence!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"The beauty in reading something by a writer such as Hemingway is that apart from the actual topic at hand, in this case bullfighting, there is much to be read between the lines about important items in the grander scheme - life, death, and everything in between. In The Green Hills of Africa, Hemingway talks about the writer's use of rhetoric, and his ability, or lack there of, to incorporate it into the fabric of whatever account he may be working on. He uses Melville's Moby Dick as an example of mastery of the technique, while he, in The Green Hills of Africa, is talking also of the grand pursuit of artistic success, it's relation to luck, and of course, how only through experience can one gain an edge and catch that at which he aims.So although one might never have the chance to see a bullfight - although he may never have an interest in seeing a bullfight or knowing of bullfights at all - there is a lot to be gained by reading this book. Like most great writers, Hemingway's principle focus is not that of what seems, at the outset, to be the topic of the book. He writes of humanity and honor in this book, using bullfights as a mere lens through which to view these things and their related counterparts. And he does it with the verdant love of the written word that has so much been a characteristic feature of his work.If you are a Hemingway fan, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Should have read the product description a little more closely. I did not realize that I was purchasing the book without its normal illustrations, and with numerous typos. The typos interrupted the flow of the text greatly - I would say there were probably three or four significant typos per page. Not just misspelled words, but words that had numbers or other characters in them. The stars I've listed above are for the story and the substance of the book, not for the quality of the particular copy that I bought.I thought the substance of the book itself was fascinating. I'm a little late into the Ernest Hemingway game having never really read him in high school. His writing style takes some getting used to. His knowledge of bullfighting, however, is astounding. I can understand why some people are so adamantly anti-bullfighting, and I do believe that in my lifetime bullfighting as it exists now will be outlawed. But Hemingway really does a good job of relating much more than the gruesome death of the bull, and takes you into the subleties and intracacies of what makes a bullfight interesting to watch.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in bullfighting. Its fairly involved, however, so if you're just passingly curious about the topic it may not be for you. It is fairly dense, and there are some portions of the book where he strays from the topic entirely, but the book as a whole is incredibly informational. I would recommend that you not buy the General Books OCR Reprint Edition."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a huge Hemingway fan, perhaps one might call me a Hemingway aficionado because I have been taking enjoyment in systematically reading everything the man wrote. The man's style is incomparable. He never gets feigns, gets fancy, or tries to show off. He just delivers results time and again.I see that the average rating of this book is four stars, and I think that this is a fair rating for the book. Since I have been reading the book and I am nearly finished, I thought that I would take the opportunity to chime in, and I will tell you why I think this is a four star book.1) If you are just reading Hemingway for the first time, this should not be the book that you choose unless you are personally interested in bullfighting. This is a non-fiction work and is not characteristic of Hemingway. So, if you read this as his first book, while you will get an idea of his writing style, you will not have a representative work of his. Instead, read some short stories or perhaps \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" also published as \\"Fiesta\\".2) Hemingway wrote this book when he was about 33 years old. As an young American who was fascinated with bullfighting and very knowledgeable of the subject, he decided to write a book for the English speaking world about bullfighting, and this book was the result. As a non-fiction writer myself, I learned a great deal from reading Hemingway's non-fiction style. One can also see at parts in this book Hemingway's treatment of death, his unwillingness to turn away from it, but his desire to courageously describe it in detail as a fact.3) There are certain beautiful passages and, on the whole, the book is very well written. That said, the book can seem repetative and perhaps not organized in the best possible way. Hemingway knows that he is indulging himself in writing this work, and he has fun with it. He introduces an old lady into the book as someone to bounce ideas off of and has an extensive dialogue with her. He includes a couple of semi-humorous and entertaining short stories. The talks about technique in writing.4) Of course, the \\"repetative\\" quality of the book must also be taken with a grain of salt. Writing a 300 page book on an event that usually only takes a few hours to complete will seem repetative to the non-specialist. Imagine, for example, reading a 300 page book on baseball. It might seem repetative, but the truth is that one must get into detail if one wants to treat one's subject fully.5) All-in-all, I would recommend the book to anyone 1) who had already read a lot of Hemingway because it is fascinating to hear him speaking so frankly, 2) Anyone interested in traveling to Spain or in seeing a bullfight, 3) Anyone who wants to improve their style at writing non-fiction, 4) anyone who likes non-fiction and who is looking for something to read in the summer time. The bullfights take place in the summer, and so this is good summer reading."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemmingway's typically aggressive approach to life and morality is applied to bullfighting in this manual of how man and beast can compete for the ultimate prize. The book must be a psycho-analyst's dream as Hemmingway disposes of all moral considerations on bullfighting within a few paragraphs but continuously makes parallels with WWI slaughters and references to the Spanish civil war. Is there any such thing as a fair fight? Is the bull really the hero or is the bull a beast to be &quot;corrected&quot;? It is a cleverly written book which is on the surface a treatise on a very basic and earthy subject but which requires a deeper consideration of its moral aspects. The book is without a formal conclusion but invites the reader to decide if bullfighting is for them or not - to question why and to apply that logic to larger questions. The details of various matadors are interesting and may be the author's tribute to an art but might just be Hemmingway blurring the challenge with detail, much as in real life.It is an interesting book, quite different to his novels but with the typical robust challenge from Hemmingway to rebut his point of view or just close the book!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Even Hemingway was wary of bullfighting when was first introduced to it by Gertrude Stein in the early part of the 20th century. He tells of his suspicion in the first pages of this book and invites the reader to join him in his exploration of this old Spanish tradition. I have enver been to a bullfight, but after reading Death in the afternoon, I am curious to see at least one now and feel that I will have a better than average understanding of what is happening in the ring. While it may be somewhat outdated, as the book describes many of the matadors that existed at the time of writing... there is enough real description of the ceremony and the outcome of many matches that it makes no difference.The theme is interesting and as with most hemingway books is found in a title with more than one meaning.A&quot; death will occur this afternoon, will it be man or animal?&quot;That is the question to be answered with each and every bullfight. That is the reason millions of people attend every year. That is the reason Hemingway became and aficianado of the sport. Read this book and fund out what bullfighting is really all about. No sugar coating here."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This work is poetic in the way all Hemingway is poetic--the simplicity of the prose understates the immense themes at work. His terse, athletic prose creates an air of energy around the bull-fight. The work is pathetic in the sense that the bull-fight is pathetic, eliciting emotion (pathos) and a severe kind of involvement in the moment for the reader. A wonderful read, but be warned that Hemingway's own aficion de corrida may seduce you as well. The nearly violent prose making the ritual of violence as grand and beautiful as possible."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A friend pressed me a while back to read Hemingway. I hadn't touched him since Freshman English--getting to be a VERY long time ago. I was most impressed by \\"The Undefeated.\\" It's a world class short story, but I knew I was missing parts of it. This is the explanation--enough about bull-fighting as Hemingway understood it and as it was practiced between the wars to let us who have not grown up in the culture understand it.For that reason, it's earned a place on my shelves.In other ways, it's outdated--reviews of the style of bullfighters dead 50 years or more--or self-indulgent. (\\"The Natural History of the Dead\\" is thrown in for reasons comprehensible only to Hemingway.) Be prepared to skim.But when you read Hemingway with a bull-fighting setting, have this book handy."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Death in the afternoon is a lucid account of the Spanish bullfight which is one of Ernest Hemmingways fine books that he released i would recommened this book for anyone looking for a cultural diverse book and to people who like looking at things that at first they dont have a clue about (like me and bullfighting). When i picked this book up all i knew about bullfighting was the blindingly obvious facts such as the matadors and how bulls are attracted to red alone etc... but you would be suprsised as to how detailed the sport (if you could call it that) is, and how brutal the consequances of bullfighting may be. I've only ever read this book by Ernest Hemmingway but was impressed by what it had to offer, Hemmingways passion for bullfighting is clear in this novel and the detail and focus on Spain involved is always prevelant so this is a book thats definatley worth the read an empathic book that should not really be missed."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"By the end of \\"Birth of an Age,\\" book two of the Christ Clone Trilogy, author James BeauSeigneur has you on the edge of your seat, expecting anything and anticipating what will happen next; you're primed for something big, something monumental, and you wonder if he can possibly deliver on the promise of the first two books and the expectation you have going into the third and final installment of the series. Well, sit back and hold on, because with \\"Acts of God,\\" BeauSeigneur certainly does deliver, and more. And, whereas the first two books evoked a sense of Asimov, Crichton and Melville, this one brings to mind Stephen King's epic novel, \\"The Stand,\\" as it clearly leads you to a conclusion that can be nothing less than the final showdown between the forces of Good and Evil.As it begins (and as BeauSeigneur did previously, the opening chapter is actually the final chapter of the second book), the prophets John and Cohen are dead, and the resurrected Christopher Goodman, now Secretary-General of the U.N., is poised to lead Humankind into the New Age, with promises of a long and healthy life with renewed youth and vigor for everyone, as well as world peace. And to help him spread the good news, there is his loyal press secretary, Decker Hawthorne, and his own prophet of the New Age, Robert Milner.For Christopher, everything seems to be going well; without the disruptive influences of John and Cohen, all of his aspirations are being realized, as people around the world are embracing him and the tenets of the New Age. But not everyone; there is still the Koum Damah Patar, the \\"KDP,\\" and the cliques of fundamentalist Christians who adamantly oppose him and seem bent on clinging to the past, no matter what the cost. Meanwhile, amid a series of world-wide, devastating plagues, Decker Hawthorne is confronted with circumstances that rattle his faith and for the first time cause him to question the very foundation of the mission he has undertaken in Christopher's name; and ultimately, it will force him to make the hardest decision of his life.Though a work of fiction, BeauSeigneur presents his story with such logic and acuity that is seems, not only believable, but very real. And he writes with a concise, universal voice that makes the material accessible to everyone; you don't have to be a theologian to appreciate the magnitude and the ramifications of the conflict that is played out here. It's a riveting, intense and suspenseful tale, but beyond all of that, there is an inherently moral message that comes through succinctly and quite effectively.It's been a long time since I was this excited about a novel (and by that I mean the trilogy); BeauSeigneur has done an extraordinary job of creating a story of such tremendous ethical and moral proportions, and presenting it in an exciting and objective way. In the final analysis, \\"Acts of God,\\" is an affecting novel that for some just may prove to be a veritable life-changing experience. It certainly was for me."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I have been interested in prophecy for more than 30 years. As such, I've read some very good and some very bad fiction and non-fiction treatments on the subject. One of the best non-fiction books I've read is FOOTSTEPS OF THE MESSIAH by Arnold Fruchtenbaum. Unquestionably the very best fiction treatment I've read is THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY.Because of my interest in the subject, and because I spend most of my day on the Internet, I spend a lot of time on various prophecy web sites. I read about TCCT on PhopheZine.com, which gave BeauSeigneur's books glowing reviews. Of course the best known books on the subject are the LEFT BEHIND books by LeHaye and Jenkins, but lately I've seen people talking about TCCT more and more places. Usually when people discuss an idea that originated with BeauSeigneur, they cite him or mention TCCT. But even when they don't, you can tell they've read TCCT because the ideas are so completely original."},{"Title":"Acts of God (Book Three of The Christ Clone Trilogy)","review":"I first heard of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY from a review by Charles Sheffield, the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning science fiction author. Sheffield raved about BeauSeigneur's trilogy, calling it &quot;an engrossing and ingenious story,&quot; and said that &quot;James BeauSeigneur brings to bear a fine mix of scientific, political, and religious knowledge to illuminate this powerful tale.&quot;It sounded great but it wasn't until two years later when I read the comments of Kerry Livgren (you know, the guy who wrote &quot;Dust in the Wind,&quot; &quot;Carry On Wayward Son,&quot; and a dozen other million-selling songs for the band Kansas) that I finally ordered the books. After reading the trilogy I have to completely agree with Kerry Livgren's opinion: &quot;Breathtaking.
