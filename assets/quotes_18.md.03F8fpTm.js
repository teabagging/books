The sections on the vitamins and minerals gets very text-book like. I think I expected a little more in this book about getting ready to help boost your rate of conception, like more on the whole timing and ovulation part of it all. While it did have some of this information, I was hoping for more. It was a good read, but really a great deal of the same info can be found in most pregnancy books that cover the \\"before\\". Overall, still good to read before you are ready to start trying, but takes a very cautious outlook."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"Very informative and easy to understand book. I like the fact that it has suggestions for men as well as women. I also like how it tells why certain things are recommended and it also shows different points of views. You can learn a lot from this book and make wise decisions that fit your lifestyle."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I'm only about halfway through the book right now but it is good so far. I think that it is great for 1st time moms who are concerned about being ready for pregnancy. I think that a lot of what it teaches is common sense type stuff, but it can be a good re-enforcer to get you in the right mindset while trying to conceive. I would recommend this book for couples planning to start a family, rather than unplanned pregnancies, but it could still be helpful. As I said, I'm only about halfway through, but the friend of mine that recommended the book said that she thought that the end of the book was a bit of a letdown. She hoped that there would be more to it."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book is ok. I didn't bookmark any pages for future reference until I was almost done with the book and these were for after the baby is born for nutrition information. I am almost finished reading The Mother of All Pregnancy Books and highly recommend it over this one. I have never been pregnant and my husband and I are trying for our first baby. This book just scared me (for lack of a better term) and left me feeling uninformed. I was also disappointed that it kept telling me to check with my physician before doing this or that, obviously I would, although I understand they feel a need for a disclaimer in this day in age of complete lack of common sense. Overall, I would still with the Mother of All Pregnancy books over this one."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I wasn't even expecting it to have lots of information that I didn't already know, having done a ton of research myself in my role as fertility counselor, but thought that it would be slightly helpful at least. It was not. It was instead incomplete and incorrect.Conclusions made are inconsistent - thing A is to be treated with caution because its safety for pregnant women is unproven, whereas thing B is considered safe because it has never been shown to cause problems. Where is the logic here? There is no difference between \\"never been shown to cause problems\\" and \\"safety unproven\\". And if there is a difference in the proven safety of these two things, it should be stated explicitly rather than left at these two vague comments.Some statements are just plain incorrect. For example, it is stated that ovulation is the day of the basal body temperature rise, when in fact the temperature rise usually occurs the day following ovulation. Also, intercourse on this day is stated to give the best chance of conception. This is incorrect whichever way you look at it - intercourse on the day of the temperature rise is usually too late (being the day after ovulation, the egg is often dead by then), and intercourse on the day of ovulation is still not the best timing (for those who are interested, intercourse the day before ovulation is best, although difficult to time). I have to wonder what other \\"facts\\" in this book are downright wrong.Finally, conclusions are drawn without sharing the information used to make them. It is claimed that a woman who has no immunity to rubella must get vaccinated, stating that the potential risks of the vaccine far outweigh the benefits. Nowhere is it mentioned that an adult woman receiving the rubella vaccine has much higher risk of serious medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and thrombocytopenia, and that according to the CDC the incidence of rubella in the US is extremely low. Whether or not the benefits of this vaccine outweigh the risks is something for women to decide for themselves, with all pertinent information.Now, I would expect a book written by two doctors to side more often with medical gospel than not, but I was very surprised by the lack of portrayal of the other side of the issues. Or more to the point, that some things were treated as complete non-issues: women are encouraged to run right out and get the flu and chicken pox shots, with no mention of their risks or efficacy.I should say that I did find the information on weight, diet, and exercise to be very thorough and mostly consistent with other reading I have done. Still, I simply cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I am usually too lazy to bother to type reviews. However, I HAD to write on on this book. If you are like me in that you want from a pre-pregnancy/pregnancy book:- thoroughness- inclusiveness- reliability- readibilitythen you will not be disppointed by this book. I bought this first, before I conceived, to make sure that I was doing all I could/ should to prepare my body for pregnancy. This book addressed the whole range of issues related to this, and in a very clear, readable (lots of graphics to explain things) yet extremely authoritative manner. The authors have their credentials and this comes through clearly.I have very high expectations of books, especially when they are on such an important topic as pregnancy. Up-to-date info. is mandatory--not optional--and this books has it.After I became pregnant, I bought many other pregnancy books, but kept coming back to this one. The others are better for describing what is going on month-by-month, etc., but NONE are better for general medical reference info. For example, this is the only book I have found that breaks down herbs into 3 categories (\\"Safe During Pregnancy\\", \\"Herbs That Warrant Caution\\" and \\"Herbs to Avoid\\") and clasifies every major herb you are likely to encounter (in teas, body creams, etc.). They also describe common concerns/ probelms in a very user-friendly yet authoritative manner, and told me all I needed to know about continuing to exercise safely throughout pregnancy. Plus the tone of the book is very positive, reassuring and upbeat.I can't say enough about this book. It is my pregnancy bible."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I've read and looked through a lot of &quot;pre-pregnancy&quot; books over the past few months but this one is not only the most helpful and up-to-date one I've come across, but also it is the LEAST panic-inducing. So many other books devote more than half the text to fertility problems, which only served to heighten my paranoia and fear about that very issue. This book took a very calm and rational approach to ALL topics that need to be covered during the pre-conception time, and I really appreciated that.I also really liked the tone of this book. It was friendly and informative yet confident and authoritative. I did not feel like there was lecturing going on (which is good as lecturing, let's be honest, can sometimes trigger a &quot;I don't care what you say, I'm gonna do such-and-such anyway!&quot; reaction), but rather like the authors were part of my &quot;preconception team,&quot; working WITH me and my husband towards achieving the goal of a healthy and happy pregnancy."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"There is so much great info in this book that I don't think anyone should even THINK about getting pregnant without reading it first. I initially purchased &quot;Before your Pregnancy&quot; and the Dr. Sussman book (Before you Conceive). After reviewing both of them, I decided on this one due to its pleasant and reader-friendly format. It covers all aspects from family history to even what kind of herbal teas to stay away from. Definately have a highlighter handy to mark important stuff! The Dr. Sussman book is also very good, but I found it dedicated way to many chapters on genetics, family illnesses, and disorders. &quot;Before your Pregnancy&quot; gives a great deal of info on these topics also, but not an overkill. So if your on a budget like I am and can't afford to buy every book out there, this is a great book to buy. After reading this book, I feel very prepared to get started trying. I also recommend purchasing &quot;Before...&quot; with the Mother of All pregnancy...they go really good together."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I am usually too lazy to bother to type reviews.

I read it cover to cover in about a day. Like other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of it is really basic. Don't smoke, don't do drugs, do lose weight if you are overweight. I did like the descriptions of vitamins and minerals, and the part where they make some healthy menus is pretty good as well, but it didn't tell me a lot I didn't know. I think it was pretty good, but nothing fabulous that I would tell someone they HAVE to read."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone thinking about having a baby. There aren't very many preconception books to make you aware of what you need to know long before you get pregnant. &quot;Before Your Pregnancy&quot; is comprehensive, detailed, and easy to read. It includes scenarios of real people in real-life situations. One reviewer mentioned that it doesn't give you a thorough conception &quot;how-to&quot; guide, and she's basically right, but really, there are lots of conception guides. This book really fills the need for women and couples who want to plan a future child as carefully and conscientiously as possible, people who &quot;want to have their ducks in a row.&quot; I found the information on vitamins and on physical health particularly informative. If you think you might start trying to conceive in 3 months or 6 months or even a year, buy this book to help you get the best start!!"},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book was disappointing, it was more of a general nutrition/health book than a guide for preconception. Most of the recommendations were common sense, eat healthy, don't drink, try to be at your target weight, ect. I guess I was expecting advice I had not heard before (and this was the first book I read on the topic). However, the BMI chart was good, and there is some interesting information about vaccines."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I was disappointed in this book. While it does contain good info on basic health/nutrition practices, it did not provide anything that other pregnancy books don't have. (Unless you're interested in specific metrics of each and every vitamin, mineral, etc.) I guess I don't know what I was expecting (otherwise I wouldn't have needed to buy the book) but thought they'd provide more info than 'follow the food pyramid', 'exercise regularly', and 'don't drink, smoke, or do drugs'. If you want to micromanage your diet (vs just trying to eat healthy), haven't been exposed to diet, exercise info before, or are concerned/at risk for passing along hereditary diseases than this may be a good reference book for you. Otherwise, invest in a good pregnancy book like 'The Mother of all Pregnancy Books'. It devotes a small section to preconception and a lot of the rest of the info can also be applied. Another outstanding book to read is \\"The Prenatal Prescription'. This book provides a lot of scientific explanations of how all the nutrition/exercise you practice now affects a baby later. It's very easy to read and tells you why versus just 'do this'."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book really freaked me out. I learned a lot, but concluded from my readings that no one is fit to have a child and that everyone interested in conceiving should have been raised in a bubble. The book uses the theory that you are better safe then sorry, but all of the claims are not backed up scientifically. My recommendation is to read the book and not take it too seriously, then make a prenatal appointment with a gynecologist. The doctor will put your mind at ease."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"...not as helpful to future fathers as future mothers..."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I found this book to be extremely helpful in planning for pregnancy. It was nice to feel some guidance and not go blindly into pregnancy without preparation. Not only was the book informative, but also humorous, which is always a bonus. There were several parts I skipped over (STDs, preexisting medical conditions, etc.), but I was glad they were there for those who need them and that they were easy to navigate past. I especially liked the chapters on realistic meal planning (even though realistically I will usually add on a dessert), and easy and beneficial stretching exercises. Thanks for humoring our silly superstitions and not completely discrediting old wives tales, but then giving us the real scientific facts."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book was useless. It is a great idea to have a book about getting ready for conception however this book fails to live up to the task. I think my biggest complaint with this book is that the book is dull and really doesn't go into terffic detail about how life changes after a baby. Which is something you should think about before having a baby. It also lacks helpful and practical steps to take before getting pregnant. Topics such as determing gender and pregnacy after 35 aren't even mentioned. Instead the book focuses on diet and being fit. Save your money and sign up for The Conception Bulletin it is very detailed and helpful and it's email monthly."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"As someone planning on getting pregnant in the future this was a great tool.

Before Your Pregnancy was so thorough and helpful in answering our questions and educating us on things we didn't know to ask our doctor about. It gave us great peace of mind. We are now past the first trimester and still find ourselves referring to the book for the items that help both before and during pregnancy especially the nutrition, vitamin, and medication sections. It's very well organized to be able to find a the info you need when you have a question. I've also found that many relatives and girlfriends who are ready for kids have loved it as a gift. I'm sure this book has helped many moms have healthier pregnancies and babys."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This is a great book for those that are looking to starting to have children. It really goes in depth on the different ways both the woman and man can go about preparing their bodies.

Overall, I give it an A."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"This book is full of valuable facts for anyone planning to become a parent. This book is valuable if read 90 days or 2 days before conceiving. The advice is easy to follow. The book has advice that everyone already knows (ie. not to drink), but surrounds it with detailed information about why things are important and when idealy you would make the changes to your lifestyle. The book is so full of facts and details you can make decisions for yourself on what you think is best. The ideas expressed are what I would consider to be mainstream - they are not radical nor difficult ideas to implement. I consider myself a well educated person about pre-pregnancy health concerns (read other books and did research on the internet) and I learned lots from this book."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"If you're looking for detailed information on preconception health (e.g., the role of genetics in planning a healthy pregnancy, what herbal products are contraindicated during pregnancy, and so on), this is a very good book. But if you're looking for useful information on what you can do to increase your chances of conceiving quickly, you won't find it here. The authors only devote ten pages to the subject of &quot;how to get pregnant&quot;, offering a very watered down version of the conception/fertility information you will find in other books such as The Mother of All Pregnancy Books by Ann Douglas and Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler. So if you purchase a copy of this book, you'll also want to order copies of Douglas' and Weschler's books, too."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I love this book! Im actually reading it again for a 3rd time and I learn something new each time. Its the right amount of information and is written in terms everyone can read. They are great at going through each step of the preconception process from what to expect at the preconception visit to romancing the egg... and everything in between! (Exercising, what to eat, etc etc). It sounds pretty straight forward but I would recommend this book to anyone looking for that extra advice before getting pregnant.

It covers nutrician and specific vitamins and supplements, how much you need and what foods contain them, to using the food pyramid to make healthy changes in your diet. Also a good chapter on excercise before and during pregnancy which I found motivating. There were even a few specific excercises and illustrations to do to help strengthen muscles that will be challenged during pregnancy.Overall I would definitely recommend this book. If you're looking for something to help you understand your cycle and when your best chances of conceiving are, read Understanding your Fertility or Dr. Shettle's How To Choose the Sex of Your Baby (even if you don't want to choose the sex or dont' believe in it!).

I had a very difficult first pregnancy, and developed severe pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, and I had to have an emergency c-section at 24 weeks. My son Tyler was born weighing 11oz. and he lived for 5 days. I was racked with as much guilt as grief, I read my books over and over on how I could have done things differently. Turn out I have a gentic blood disorder, and I was able to have a healthy, beautiful baby girl, a year and a half later. I was highly advised that I not get pregnant again, and I agree.

Since I recognized some incorrect info, it left me wondering as to how much of the rest of the info was correct.Consequently, I went out and bought a different pre-pregnancy book. I will be returning this book to the store I bought it from. The main item I noticed, which may not be a big deal if you don't take this particular medication, was about Tagamet, Cimetidine, and Zantac. Tagamet's active ingredient IS Cimetidine (I use prescription Cimetidine when I have severe allergic reactions--I buy Tagamet when I run out!). The author's say that Zantac is Cimetidine. The book lists Cimetidine as a safe prescription medicine during pregnancy, but on the next pages lists Tagamet as an unsafe drug stating that it causes fetal testicular tumors. Unfortunately, many readers wouldn't be aware of the problem, because the authors have listed that Zantac is Cimetidine and to use Zantac instead of Tagamet! Very confusing....and not accurate. So, I wonder what else is incorrect as well."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"My husband and I bought this book a few months ago when we were getting ready to start trying to conceive, and we found it very informative without being too dry. It not only tells you what to do to start preparing (mentally and physically), but it tells you why. A really thorough look at vitamins and nutrition was my favorite part, along with a nice set of exercises that I should be doing more often now that we've conceived (!).

There aren't many books out there for those who want to make sure they are on the right track to pregnancy. I highly recommend this to people who like to make to do lists and are extremely organized. Those type of people will really like this book because it helps you to be organized and answer questions when you aren't sure.It is very easy to read from beginning to end but also easy to flip pages to find the answer that you are looking for.

The authors do a good job of summarizing a lot of key medical data on this topic. I only have two minor quibbles with the book: there's a lot of &quot;filler&quot; (topics that aren't really related to preconception health, but that seem to have been thrown in to make the book a bit meatier) and sometimes the book isn't organized as well as it might have been. That wouldn't stop me from recommending the book to others, however, which is why I've given it four stars."},{"Title":"Before Your Pregnancy: A 90 Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception","review":"I spent 3 hours in the bookstore looking at different conception and pregnancy books. I found a lot of real good books but found that I would have to buy about 4 or 5 books to get all the information I got from this book.

A good role model for little girls!"},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"&quot;Je suis Me ELOISE&quot;Think of this book as a combination French lesson and tour guide to Paris and Versailles, conducted by the inimitable Eloise. You've never had such fun! This book will be appealing to all of those who loved Eloise when they were chronologically young and are still young at heart. The book is a worthy sequel to the original Eloise by patterning the story as much as possible after the first book. Whether you have been to Paris or not, you will be delighted!A cablegram comes from Eloise's mother, and Eloise practically knocks the Plaza to its knees to get it. Then Nanny has to hold it far away to read the message. Eloise's mother wants them to come to Paris to get roses in their cheeks. Eloise telephones everyone at the Plaza to let them know she is going. There are many things to do including shopping, passports, vaccinations, and packing. Pretty soon they are on their way with 37 pieces of luggage. &quot;Everyone knew we were going, but no one cried.&quot;Eloise, Nanny, Weenie (the pug), and Skipperdee (the turtle) fly by Sabena to Belgium (because it's the only airline that lets turtles fly with the people). From there, they take a helicopter to Paris. They are met there by Koki, the chauffeur of mother's lawyer. He takes them to the Relais Bisson, which is the only place Eloise stays in Paris. It is near the Seine so they can get the salty smell from the air. Mme. and M. Dupuis greet them.. . . But the Realais Bisson is not the Plaza. There is no elevator. The room is small. Eloise knows that she has to get outside to have a good time. And she sure does. But at night, she manages some of her usual fun by visiting all the rooms . . . just to make a few adjustments.Among her many exciting outside events are having a dress designed for her by M. Dior, dinner at Maxim's (&quot;My mother knows Maxim&quot; . . . and yes, she does charge the meal there.), and visits to every possible monument and public place. Along the way, she finds a novel use for French bread that I'll bet you never have tried. The scenes in Paris and Versailles are beautifully drawn by Hilary Knight in the original Eloise style. You'll love them.The book could easily double as a French language lesson. Eloise explains all kinds of french nouns and adjectives that are useful to travelers in a way that makes them easy to remember.&quot;Oh I absolutely miss the Plaza&quot; and then it's time to go back. This time she has 114 pieces of luggage. &quot;J'aime beaucoup le Plaza&quot; is her first comment upon returning.I think a hidden blessing of this book is that it will kindle an irresistible urge to visit Paris. If you read the book to your children when they are young, you will probably have an easier time recruiting them as traveling companions for a wonderful family vacation in France.If you already know French, you will also enjoy little jokes that are included in that language. If you do not know French, you'll still enjoy the book very much.After you have finished enjoying this wonderful book, I suggest that you think about how you can take a trip that will cause you to change your usual life style . . . so that you learn new ways of thinking about life, as well as seeing new sights.Vive la France! Vive Eloise!"},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"I read Eloise (at the Plaza) and Eloise in Paris - all 'very much' Kay. I loved that woman - a very good friend of my mom's.

I've bumper into her in Rome, Paris, London, New York, LA and was terribly saddened by her death (even though she was painfully painfully thin her whole life).

What's really fun are those long made up words such as &quot;zuk zuk zhwocky zuk zuk nnnn&quot; for their Plaza telephone. With the &quot;charming&quot; six year old as the star, this book is about how a rich girl spends time in Paris with Nanny, Skipperdee (Turtle), Weenie (dog), and Koki (chauffeur). It's very creative; all of Kay Thompson's books are. I read the first Eloise book to a bunch of friends in my college dorm, and I only got past four or five pages because they were all saying, &quot;C'mon, Hilary!!! That's enough!&quot; I also went through this phase a year or so ago where I sent E-Mails saying: &quot;The Bell Captain Knows Who I am!&quot; which left most of my friends perplexed. I remember the response of one friend: &quot;That's really great, but who's the Bell Captain?&quot; It's quite odd because books can create all sorts of situations for people. The funny words or phrases can start jokes as well. One of my friends and I thought it was weird that Eloise said that paper cups were good for talking to Mars, and we sometimes say on the phone to eachother, &quot;have you talked to Mars yet?&quot;From the viewpoint of a Beatnik, Eloise In Paris and all the rest of the books about her are some of the beatest kids books I've seen!"},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"Kay Thompson based the character of Eloise on her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli (which means that the mother who sends the cablegram telling them to go to Paris is Judy Garland, probably off on a film set somewhere).I loved, loved, loved this book as a child.

I was completely captivated by Hilary Knight's illustrations (he also did the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books, by the way).

Dior, and she eats so much she gains \\"rawther\\" a lot of weight. In the end, Eloise misses the Plaza and is happy about her return home to New York. In a nice touch, in the doorway above the famous old hotel Eloise and Nanny call home, a big banner hangs, and it reads, \\"Welcome Back Eloise!\\" Eloise has gone full circle and we feel we've taken every galloping step along the way with her.

It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"As an American boy growing up in rural France, there wasn't much for us kids to do, so we farmed a lot, played with the local jeunesse, and caught up on reading our American books a fathiful family friend made sure we had plenty of. This woman, a sort of \\"good fairy\\" to a foreign-based US family, made sure that we each had our own copy of Eloise in Paris, and I have often wondered why my parents cut off contact with our benefactor shortly afterwards. One by one all copies of this book were confiscated, though when I saw what was happening, I hid mine in a hollow hole in a large fig tree, where it sat until nature eventually made away with it.In the meantime we gathered around at twilight and once again drank in the old story of Eloise, accompanied by her turtle and dog, and Nanny, go to meet Koki in Paris. Koki is the chauffeur of the avocat employed by Eloise and her mother. I always liked Koki, a scamp of a chauffeur with no fixed morals and a taste for cowboy movies. We kids determined that somehow we would get to glamorous Paris like Eloise, and see the Renault Delphines whizzing like tops around the Place da la Concorde, but somehow we never did.However, Eloise made us feel like we had been there. She has a lust for life that still, after all these years, communicates itself to the reader. Will kids like these books today? I don't know. Eloise's attention to the high points of French cooking is \\"rawther\\" exaggerated for a little girl; it is like an issue of GOURMET magazine in a six year old's body, and look what happened to GOURMET magazine. Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end, but they did."},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"Eliose in Paris, what a kick. But the dark side of this book is that this poor rich child is neglected by her mother and her father is never mentioned. Is he merely a dead beat dad or dead? Eliose doesn't seem to care. Perhaps her acting out with inappropriate behaviour is merely a way of expressing her anger at the neglect by her parents? Her drawing on her walls a deep cry for help?Nah! Of course that's all 90's psycho-babble. This book was written in the 50's when no one thought twice about giving the care of children to hired help. Eliose of course rebels and seeks attention and even us involved parents see these antics. A quick trip to Paris will solve all your problems. There is nothing like fishing in the river, visiting museums or a picnic in the park to make one's cares go away.My kids loved it."},{"Title":"Eloise in Paris.","review":"Do you want to teach your child to be a brat?

Much to my dismay, the \\"Eloise\\" book used the phrase, \\"Oh my Lord!\\" several times, beginning right on the very first page. Now, we're not zealots in my family, but we do have a healthy respect for God and teach our kids to respect Him, and this book just did not fit in with those values. I just think there's something really odd about a \\"children's book\\" that finds it necessary to say \\"Oh my Lord!\\" over and over -- just seems to be a general indicator that the book is a bit too worldly and disrespectful for my six-year old, sorry! It was offensive. If you want a fun and informative book about Paris suitable for any child, regardless of their beliefs, \\"This is Paris\\", by Miroslav Sasek is a wonderful choice.

The Elector of Saxony asked his opinion on Maarten Luther. He couldn't give a clearcut answer.Erasmus went a long way: 'I am against the truth if it causes dissension'.But he was too honest. He grasped the fact that the compulsory selling of indulgences by the Pope was an unforgivable extortion.In a good hundred pages Zweig tells the ultimate tragedy of Erasmus's life: on the one hand, his belief in civilisation and the power of reason; on the other hand, a world full of dissensions and war.Stefan Zweig writes in an enthusiastic style, full of dramas and contrasts.A simple but masterful psychological and historical analysis."},{"Title":"Erasmus of Rotterdam: Stefan Zweig ; translated by Eden and Cedar Paul (Compass books C13)","review":"Zweig writes an intellectual biography of Erasmus. He does not focus on tracing the everyday life, or the personal encounters of Erasmus. Instead he is interested in Erasmus' overall view of life and civilization, his historical role and contribution. He shows how Erasmus was the first true European with a vision which transcended national boundaries and focused on a world living in peace. He portrays Erasmus as a balanced, cautious person who fought all his life for, and maintained his intellectual independence and freedom. He writes of how for Erasmus the one great source of happiness was his Work. Erasmus was the champion of Learning, and had according to Zweig a tremendously broad book- knowledge. Erasmus loved books and gave his life to studying them and writing them. Erasmus wanted Reform of the Church but a reform which would be done without violence. He above all was an opponent of Fanaticism,and in his masterpiece 'In Praise of Folly' Fanaticism is the number one enemy. Zweig tells of how Erasmus came to be the overwhelming intellectual figure of his age. He writes with beauty and skill about the tremendous excitement of the Age of Exploration, the Renaissance which Erasmus played an important part in. He too tells the story of the conflict between Luther and Erasmus, how the violent, emotional passionate Luther led to the split in Western Christendom , and how the rational, balanced Erasmus was no counter to him. This work is not only the portrait of a man but the portrait of a Civilization through vital phases of its development. It is written beautifully by Zweig. Of course the great tragic element here is that Zweig who espoused Erasmus- like values of tolerance, moderation, reason wrote this just as his own world was being swept up in the fanaticism and hatred which would be Nazi Germany.Zweig movingly describes Erasmus in old age, disappointed and rejected, a foreshadowing of his own tragic exile and death."},{"Title":"Erasmus of Rotterdam: Stefan Zweig ; translated by Eden and Cedar Paul (Compass books C13)","review":"The first section exploring the apposite viewpoints of Luther and Erasmus is enlightening regarding the basis of early liberal thought"},{"Title":"The Guide to Owning a Jack Russell Terrier (The Guide to Owning Series)","review":"I have been reseaching Jack Russell Terriers through many different sources.

Airplanes continuously roared overhead and her chickens were so scared they wouldn't lay the eggs her family desperately needed. The planes rained down supplies, like flour, clothing, coal and candy. One day, Mercedes mother read a story in the newspaper of the American pilot, Lt. Gail Halvorson who parachuted candy to the children of Berlin. He earned the nickname The Chocolate Pilot and people from all over America donated handkerchiefs for parachutes and candy for the children of Berlin. Mercedes decides to write him a letter.Lt. Halvorson and the people of America who donated supplies to the Berlin Airlift brought hope to the people of Berlin. Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot is a beautiful work of art and a testament to the kindness and civility of people after World War II. President Truman said on that fateful day on June 24th, 1948 \\"There is no discussion. We stay in Berlin. Period.\\" The Berlin Airlift lasted from June 26, 1948 to September 30, 1949.I never knew this piece of history until I read this story and I am so glad I did. Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot was very moving and inspirational. It is a true story about the kindness of others that we all hope will be extended to us in our time of need. You need to buy some candy, read this book together with your family and enjoy this sweet and delicious story. Children's books are not just for kids."},{"Title":"Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot","review":"I found this book by happenstance. If I had not been in the process of automating the books in our school library (I'm the librarian), I would never have \\"found\\" this book. The Dewey Decimal people have it catalogued under \\"Berlin (Germany)--History--Blockade, 1948-1949--Juvenile Literature\\" or 943.1550874. So that is where a previous librarian placed it. Makes sense. And now I know where it is. That's backstory.\\"Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot: A True Story about the Berlin Airlift and the Candy That Dropped from the Sky,\\" written by Margot Theis Raven and illustrated by Gijsbert van Frankenbuyzen, is a wondrous story of not just hope, but hope with joy. According to Raven, Stalin intended to starve (to death) over two million West Berliners by blockading their access to food and supplies. He intended to add West Berlin to his quadrant of Germany (so divided after WWII).The Allies (United States, England, France) still had open air corridors into West Berlin. These they utilized to initiate a \\"sky bridge\\" to drop supplies into the city. From June 26, 1948 until September 30, 1949, British and American forces flew more than 277,000 missions, day and night without stop. Or as President Harry Truman said, \\"There is no discussion. We stay in Berlin. Period!\\" (All information is taken from the introduction.)Two pages with two words: BERLIN 1948 set against a landscape of bombed out buildings need no other words. This is a desperate time. This is a desperate place. Then the book takes us to a very specific, very personal place: Young Mercedes is haranguing her four chickens to lay eggs or they will end up, according to her mother, as dinner. Mercedes and her mother live in a heavily mortared, yet still inhabitable building.After seeing little children's deep desire for sweets one day near the flight field fence, one pilot, Lt. Gail Halvorsen, started tying up candies at the end of a little parachute made out of a hankerchief and dropping them out of the sky. He would waggle his tail wings to let children know which aircraft would drop the chocolate candies and gums.One little girl, our Mercedes, did not catch any candies the day her mother took her to the field. She wrote and asked him to make a drop over her house with white chickens in the yard. What does a seven-year-old child know about flight patterns? Instead, he mailed a packet to her.Ret. Col. Havorsen and Mercedes are still friends and meet occasionally.There is much more to the story of the chocolate drop and the follow-up. This is a wonderful resource to read to students studying Germany, war-time related stories, international friendships, or whatever connection you see here. I marvel at the artwork that matches the story and wonder how Gijsbert conceived his ideas to fit a broad story. My only objection, and I really am reluctant to mention it, is that Mercedes is drawn too big for seven years old. But, oh, the facial expressions!I repeat: This is a wondrous book!"},{"Title":"Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot","review":"I use it for intermediate grades, to teach many aspects of literature.

For fifteen months British and American forces flew more than two hundred thousand missions delivering flour, wheat, potatoes, meat, cereal, powdered milk and fresh milk, coal, and kerosene to the citizens of West Berlin. The cause of this was communist leader Josef Stalin who wanted to take control of West Berlin. In his attempt to gain hold of the region, he blockaded every possible route for supplies and even cut off heat and electricity. With limited neutral air space and the desire to prevent another war; Britain and America did the one thing they knew they could to help the citizens: provide them aid.With just enough background information to set the stage; vivid images and lively, heart-felt text; and an epilogue to continue the saga; Mercedes and the Chocolate Pilot offers a story steeped in history but simple enough to delight even the youngest reader. Mercedes, a seven-year old girl living in West Berlin, listens to her mother reading stories from the newspaper about the \`Chocolate Pilot': Lt. Gail Halvorsen. Halvorsen, an American pilot who encountered children eagerly begging for gum at the airport where he flew missions, reached out to the children of West Berlin. Not caring if he got caught, he made candy-filled handkerchiefs into parachutes and rained them down on the children at the airfield. Mercedes, lacking the freedom to play and eat what she pleases during this terrible time, hungers for some chocolate. The candy parachutes are symbols of hope and freedom. In this story you will find out how Mercedes contacts Lt. Halvorsen and the result of her plea for some candy. You will also learn how one man changed the face of the Berlin Airlift through his compassion and attitude toward the children of Berlin. If the compelling story isn't enough, the beautiful images created by Gijsbert van Frankenhuyzen will engage you in this adventure.Margot Theis Raven is an award winning author and speaker who has written for various fields including television, radio, children's books, newspapers and magazines.

That doesn't mean you should listen to me, but simply that I care about this.There is a clear attempt by Bell and others to cash in on Kahn's popularity by adding texts to the end which are close to useless vis-a-vis an attempt to comprehend the lecture. Kahn's use of so many idiosyncratic phrases compells anyone compiling his work to explain, as best he or she can, what those mean. This is sadly lacking. If I knew what \\"white light, black shadow\\" meant to Kahn, I'd be better prepared to engage the text. One could claim Barthe's intentional fallacy, but, I think that's a bad excuse.Additionally, the introduction doesn't give an adequate summary of the political/social climate surrounding the talks, ie. Vietnam, King's death, etc., which I think plays a part in understanding the phrase \\"white light, black shadow\\" as well as others.That said, the lectures are really stunning, and, suprizingly accesible after a few reads. An overall continuity is harder to come by, but within a page or so range, there is a strong logic to his thinking. I don't know if this lecture is reproduced anywhere else, if you can't find \\"white light, black shadow\\", it would be worth the purchase. The question and answer is also interesting, but less so. Again, Bell should go hug someone, he clearly needs it."},{"Title":"Louis Kahn: Conversations with Students (Architecture at Rice)","review":"I found this book in the library and decided to get one for myself.

He developed a strong graphic sense over his years as a long-time political and educational cartoonist (full disclosure: I have known Bentley for many years, and saw early versions of many of the narratives that ended up in the Chester the Crab series). This makes his work visually stimulating for readers of all ages.This series started as an educational tool aligned with Virginia's content-focused \\"Standards of Learning\\". The current educational environment promotes a focus on real content; a school that wants its students to learn plenty of real content could do no better than to connect with this author/artist's work. Each page is a stand-alone piece of history that addresses a clear content objective, and each book tells a handful of stories that put years of history in context. The color is great, the layout engaging, and the subtle references add layers of information and humor.One note: even though this is a series for students, Bentley is unafraid to address sensitive issues and unwilling to gloss over the unpleasant aspects of history. \\"Heroic figures\\" are not larger-than-life, and their flaws are not airbrushed away.

L. Mencken's arrival on the literary scene in the opening years of the 20th century. He wrote millions of words, and has been the subject of many biographies. Despite all the ink spilled by and about him, the fragmentary nature of his autobiographical works still strikes one as a tragedy. He began keeping a diary from the mid-Thirties, when he was over fifty, and his career-ending stroke cut this autobiography off just before he started writing about his glory years of the Twenties.It's a pity, certainly, but editor Jonathan Yardley has done a splendid job editing the manuscript down to this book. Yardley succeeded in accomplishing his goal, to &quot;let Mencken be Mencken&quot; and to keep himself in the background. One approvingly contrasts this style of editing with David Cairns well-researched but fussily-footnoted _Memoirs of Hector Berlioz_.So, we have Mencken's own account of the beginnings of his career, and his encounters with publishers, editors, poets, writers, and other notables of the 1910s. The only person who gets treated as an equal is his partner at _The Smart Set_ magazine, George Jean Nathan. Most everyone else has their weaknesses and strengths--if they have any strengths in his eyes--baldly and succinctly described. We meet the then up-and-coming Theodore Dreiser, Edgar Lee Masters, and Ezra Pound, to mention a few. Mencken gives us some flash-forwards every now and then--we see Pound as a raving brownshirt in the Thirties, demanding to be published in Mencken's magazine. Mencken prints the text of the withering reply he sent back.Mencken's tone can be off-putting for a neutral reader. He frequently comes across as suaver-than-thou, unconned and unconnable. But most likely only people who already love Mencken will read this anyway, so they will enjoy themselves nonetheless. And he is very funny in some vignettes. Read the one where he and Nathan pretend to be interested in a tramp poet's tour of Greenwich Village.There are two paragraphs early on in the book which may serve as the thesis statement for his whole life and career. In them, he describes how he was never attracted to religion or its secular imitations, nor ever considered himself a tool of the plutocracy. And indeed, a review of his output does show that he fell into his distinctively cynical style very early in his career, and never seemed to find cause to depart from it. In this biography he relates his activities and his reasons for them with very few emotional asides. Like a speakeasy gin-and-tonic, this is astringent stuff--but it hits the spot."},{"Title":"MY LIFE AS AUTHOR & EDITOR","review":"Would Mencken have finished this account had he not been cajoled into covering the 1948 political conventions? Maybe his stroke, which occurred before he started recording his American Mercury years, would have happened at the same time regardless, but his convention work that year seemed to exacerbate his ill health, and could have hastened the apoplexy that prevented him from writing (and reading) for the rest of his life. Furthermore, he could have used those weeks to advance the narrative at least through the Coolidge era, and maybe to its end.As it is, we're left with Mencken's only incomplete book. The title would be accurate if \\"Half Of\\" preceded it: many topics and people are traced to date, but, aside from a short first chapter, all of them are introduced during his Smart Set years, which ended in 1923. Also, Mencken's work as an author uses far less ink than his work as an editor.This is Mencken's most gossipy memoir, and at times his dirt-dishing is irritating; several digressions discuss Broadway and Hollywood types. However, this liability is often an asset. I'd not heard of Lilith Benda until reading Mencken's passage about her; now, I want to read what she wrote. The memories of other authors, books, publishers and magazines are kept alive. Various peripheral characters add color to the story.While many of the authors Mencken discussed receive a paragraph or so, he gave Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sinclair Lewis their own miniature biographies. When they met, Lewis was drunk and obnoxiously proclaiming his latest book, \\"Main Street\\", but Mencken afterwards confided to his Smart Set co-editor George Nathan that he couldn't imagine such a lush writing anything worthwhile. He changed his mind after reading the \\"Main Street\\" proofs the next morning on his return trip to Baltimore; he reported that he immediately and enthusiastically wired to Nathan, \\"That idiot has written a masterpiece.\\"Some examples of Mencken's outlook are here, including, \\"I never had any belief in religion, and even as a youth I never went through the Socialist green sickness that was then almost universal. I was against Bryan the moment I heard of him, and my interest in Roosevelt I was always born of delight in the Mountebank, not of belief in the prophet. As I have recorded in \\"Newspaper Days\\", my first adventures as a reporter convinced me that the uplift in all its branches was only buncombe. I was not, of course, a partisan of the economic royalists who then ran the Republic - on the contrary, I believed that most of them were thieves and that all of them were frauds - but it seemed to me that, at their worst, they were appreciably better than the Chaldeans and soothsayers who proposed to drive them out of power, if only because they were at least more or less competent at their nefarious business. Competence, indeed, was my chief admiration, then as now, and next to competence I put what is called being a good soldier - that is, not whining. For the rest, I inclined toward my father's Chinese doctrine that the first of positive duties was to keep one's engagements.\\" Such digressions, while out of place, are always welcome. Also out of place are his home remodeling and his Baltimore Evening Sun accounts (the first third of Chapter XI should instead be in \\"Thirty-Five Years of Newspaper Work\\"), though the evolution of newspaper articles into magazine pieces and book chapters belongs.While he occasionally reviewed antiquarian works, Mencken stressed, \\"My chief concern was always with the literature that was in being, to wit, the unrolling literature of a far from civilized, and even not altogether literate democracy.\\" His ideas \\"were, in the main, scientific rather than moral or aesthetic: I was in favor of the true long before I was in favor of either the good or the beautiful.\\"When Mencken and Nathan became Smart Set co-editors in 1914, they agreed that both would have to approve a manuscript before it would be published. Most of their work was accomplished outside of the office; Mencken usually read manuscripts at his Baltimore home or on the train between there and New York City.Mencken wrote about the other pulps (Parisienne, Saucy Stories, and Black Mask) he and Nathan initiated. He also provided the background to a decisive victory over the prudish Comstocks.The book discusses some of Mencken's unpublished materials that are sadly lost to posterity. These include many letters he wrote, an article on World War I during its early months for Atlantic Monthly, and material he'd accumulated for a planned history of the corruption behind WWI.Mencken's efforts at self-promotion were unique. He often baited his detractors into spreading his name; he once made a brochure of a favorable Christian Register editorial about him to answer those who called him an atheist.The dates are sometimes wrong, and Mencken occasionally repeated himself. In one contradiction, Mencken noted that the sister of Woodrow Wilson's wife contacted him \\"So late as July 15, 1936\\", but on the next page, he stated, \\"I heard no more from her after 1930.\\"Still, this is Mencken as only Mencken thought and wrote, and is worth reading for that alone. It's one of those books that you don't want to end, especially where it did."},{"Title":"Money Harmony: Resolving Money Conflicts in Your Life and Relationships","review":"Psychotherapist Olivia Mellan has seen the relationship problems that money conflicts can cause.

You really don't feel overwhelm by a mountain of definitions. The author always favor simplicity and concreteness instead of abstractions and generality. This is really a book that I should have read before taking a class on Schemes. For exemple in the context of Riemann surfaces an \\"very ample divisor\\" is simply a linear system without fixed base point that gives rise to an holomorphic embedding. This definition (at least for me) is much much more satisfactory and illuminating than the definition of a very ample sheaf that you can find in Hartshorne (even though his definition is much more general).There is a very nice chapter on meromorphic differentials which explains how those object can be used to define line integral on any riemann surface. Topics like divisors, Riemann-Roch and curves are treated with a lot of depth. There are not a lot of pictures but having pictures supported by an unclear text is quite useless. Here the writing is so clear (not to say flawless) that on the first reading you really get the idea of what's going on.There are very few mistakes in this book which is another reason why I like it. I'm really pissed off by those mathematiciansthat are rushing to publish their books crowded by mistakes.But don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against mathematicians that are writing books (this is a learning experience) but don't feel force to publish them unless they are very polished and \\"innovative\\".Finally the last chapters treat of Abel's theorem ( which tells us exactly when a divisor is principal), Sheaves, Cech cohomologies and line bundles. Again the exposition is very wellmotivated with a good supply of interesting exemples.This is the best book that I read on subject and honestly if professor Miranda is writing another book related to my field of research you can be sure that I will have it my collection.Hugo Chapdelaine,McGill"},{"Title":"Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces (Graduate Studies in Mathematics, Vol 5)","review":"This book gives a very readable account of Riemann Surfaces-- a good course in Complex Analysis is all that's required as a prereq. The proofs are very clear, the material is presented beautifully, and (most of) the exercises are fairly straight forward and supplement the book very well. The notion of divisors, proof of the Riemann Roch theorem and Abel's theorem are explained very nicely. It serves as the perfect transition into more advanced books in algebraic geometry and on complex manifolds."},{"Title":"Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces (Graduate Studies in Mathematics, Vol 5)","review":"I am teaching the course this semester from this book and really enjoying it. The book was obviously written with the insight obtained from teaching the course several times and revising and perfecting the notes. A bonus for the teacher is that Rick has preserved the organization of a course in the book. That is, each section is roughly what you can cover in one lecture, so you can pace your 40 lecture course to try to cover 40 sections. And if you cannot lecture as fast as Rick writes, no worries, his explanations are so clear you can honestly assign the rest as reading.I am also getting a lesson in pedagogy from the book. I am in the habit of proving everything in detail at the greatest possible depth, which helps me maybe, but leaves many students behind. Also I usually never cover a lot of material because everything takes me too long to treat. But Rick has intelligently chosen to cover everything at a uniform depth. if some proof is too complicated to explain fully he assumes it. But nothing is lost since he includes instead a detailed explanation of a simple and very illustrative example, which as everyone knows but me, is more instructive than an abstract general argument.Even so, his explicit arguments and explanations are so clear they illuminate even those topics which he omits. Today for example, we covered his section on covering spaces, and enlarging them to branched covering spaces, such as non constant holomorphic functions give. Rick's discussion was so clear, I was led to expand it slightly to prove the existence of a Riemann surface for a general irreducible plane curve. His own treatment never proves this, choosing instead to give many beautiful and very helpful examples of how to fill in singularities of plane curves by smooth points. But his explanation of the relation between branched and unbranched coverings was so clear I saw it clearly myself and could not resist.Time and again he makes clear how one obtains a better picture of what is going on from several well treated examples than one abstract argument. Of course he also has many very excellent abstract proofs too. This book is written for a well prepared upper level undergraduate audience, and for that reason it is super useful for graduate students and even old professors like me.Let me observe for beginners that thesE ideas were introduced by RIemann in the analytic context and only later translated into algebraic language. There is a reason no one thought of these ideas algebraically before Riemann. The concepts are inherently analytic and topological. Hence it is almost impossible to understand how their algebraic versions were thought of unless you learn the analytic versions first. Hence people starting from Walker or Hartshorne, or even Shafarevich are handicapped by trying to understand the motivation for algebraic concepts which were introduced to mimic analytic ones that are not mentioned. How are you going to appreciate the genus of a curve if you think it is the smallest possible integer g such that for every divisor D of degree d on the curve, we have l(D) is greater than or equal to 1-g + deg(D), where l(D) is the vector dimension of the space of rational functions f with divisor greater than or equal to -D? This is the kind of unilluminating definition given in purely algebraic treatments of the subject. Riemann explains it as the number of handles in a surface which is topologically equivalent to a sphere with a finite number of handles. I.e. for a sphere it is zero, and for a doughnut it is one, etc...One remark of a personal nature. On page 19 of the first edition there was a problem F to show a certain space curve is a non singular complete intersection, whereas in fact it was highly singular. I assigned it since I like problems where the instructions are wrong and the student has to find the right answer himself. (They are easier to grade, since they are wrong unless the student finds the mistake.) I wondered if Rick felt the same and had actually intended this error to be present. Apparently not, since the second edition had a corrected version of the problem. So I was fooled, my students were working a corrected problem and I was expecting them to have to deal with the flawed one.The proof of the Riemann Roch theorem given here is that of Weil, as made clear by Serre, not the original one of Riemann, so in my course we will discuss both and contrast them when the time comes. After giving the analytic treatment of the whole subject, Rick gives a gentle introduction to the algebraic way of treating the same ideas, highly useful to new student I would expect. i only regret i will not have time to cover the entire book. This is the place to start if you really want to understand this subject from the original analytic viewpoint, and also see how it transitions into todays version. This book is written from the perspective I myself recommend and would have used in a book of my own, but it is written by someone with a greater pedagogical gift and greater grasp of the subject than I or most people have. He also took a lot of time and care with it. This is a real find, as this is not otherwise an easy subject to learn. Rick has made a big contribution to the accessibility to this fundamentally important topic."},{"Title":"Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces (Graduate Studies in Mathematics, Vol 5)","review":"This book is great for self-study. It is easy to follow, a perfect amount of examples, and the proofs arent weighed down by unnecessary examples. The author is also surprisingly funny. It is a very good non-trivial introduction. I would definitely recommend it to someone who doesn't have much experience in algebraic topology."},{"Title":"Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces (Graduate Studies in Mathematics, Vol 5)","review":"I went to graduate school in mathematics more than 30 years ago and my present job is not related to mathematical research. Recently I have started reading mathematics books at the level similar to some of my old graduate courses just for pure enjoyment of learning. Then I realized that I did not take any course on Riemann surfaces. So I looked at parts of Fulton's introductory text book on algebraic topology (Chapter on Riemann-Roch Therorem) and then to Miranda's book on Riemann surfaces. All I wanted to know is what Riemann-Roch Theorem looks like or how the proof looks like. (I was not hoping to master the subject at the level of passing a qualifying exams on the subject.)For now, I have only looked at Miranda's book up to Chapter VI Theorem 3.11 (Riemann Roch Theorem II). What I did may be called a very crude glancing rather than a careful reading. But even with these limitations on my part, I would like to recommend this book to advanced undergraduate or graduate students who want to have an introduction to Riemann surfaces. From pedagogiacal view point, the author writes very carefully, kindly, and friendly to the reader. The pace is unhurried and I like the style.For example, after giving the definition of the space of memomorphic function with poles bounded by D, L(D) using mathematical expressions, he writes the following sentence:\\"Hence the conditions imposed on a meromorphic function f to get into a space L(D) are one of two types: either poles are being allowed (to specified order and no worse) or zeros are being requried (to at least some specified oder) at discrete set of points of X.\\"To a non-smart reader (or not so alert person) like me, it was a pleasure and a great help to read such friendly explanation righ after a formal definition. May be many smart readers do not require these extra comments, but in my case, they helped me a lot. So I really thank the author for giving these nice guiding posts here and there. This book seems to be full of these helpful comments. Another such example is in Chapter III Section 4, on the covering spaces and fundamental group. He writes \\"There is a lot to check here, but the bottom line is that ...\\" and without necessarily giving all proofs, give a concise summary of topology facts needed.I realize I am not touching upon the later parts of the book which is supposed to have wonderful content for more advanced topics. I hope to be able to reach there someday.If I may say one final slightly critical thing about this wonderful book-this book does not contain figures. I wish they had at least a few to help us visualize, though it can be argued that it may not worth the space and the average reader will not suffer much from the lack of them."},{"Title":"What a Wonderful World with CDROM","review":"Anne Murray went ahead and made a book that symbolizes her album, and her home town of Nova Scotia and put it together in this facinating and breathtaking book."},{"Title":"French: Start Speaking Today!

Perhaps the company wanted to show off their speaker, the famous Monsieur Charles Berlitz. But what M. Berlitz says on these tapes is just the same old \\"bonjour\\" and \\"merci\\" that you can get anywhere else. It contains a lot of phrases that could help in specific instances, but the Greek tape gave a clear idea of how the phrases could be adapted to many situations. These do not. I also think it would have been more helpful if there had been more than one speaker. The best language learning tapes have both a male and a female speaker. Here we're stuck with M. Berlitz. These tapes are also much briefer. The Greek tapes averaged 22 minutes per side. These tapes average less than 15 minutes per side. This edition of Language 30 French has been discontinued, as it is obsolete. (It speaks of currency in francs, rather than Euros and I would imagine that M. Berlitz is long dead.)

No matter how much of a seasoned reader you are, these three novellas make you look at the very act of reading in a completely new light.Perhaps the most incredible feat accomplished here is how the thematic material echoes throughout each page and between novellas. Everything from detective conventions to names to literary authors to images weave and flow throughout these works changing and gaining in import each time like a Bachian theme and variations.Even when things don't seem to go as smoothly, the results are thought-provoking. For instance, I was a bit put off by the end of \\"City of Glass.\\" However, this feeling of dissatisfaction in light of such a metafictional text made me question myself - why was I dissatisfied? I discovered that I expect some sort of minimal optimism at the conclusion of texts - even if it's a tragedy, at least it should in its negation show something life-affirming. This is eventually accomplished even for the end of \\"Glass\\" once one views it in context of the whole trilogy, but even if it hadn't been, forcing me to confront my own expectations has been invaluable!These are works in which every word has been carefully judged yet nothing seems ponderous or overstated. The language is simple, direct and incredibly clear and concise. One comes across a book like this rarely - do yourself a favor and devour it!"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This is unquestionably the most surreal and intricately written novel I have ever read. First off, the prose is constructed, not written. It reads as if each word was carefully fit into each sentence, making sure that it was the perfect word to use for that particular place in the novel. Then there is the symbolism and numerous hidden themes, which have a dizzying type of effect as you uncover them. This is the type of book that you want to re-read as soon as you finish out of fear that you may have missed something important. The way the three stories unfold around each other is proof of uncommon literary genius. These three novellas are chuck full of unnerving suspense with the best part being that not all the questioned are answered in the end. Much like David Lynch, Auster understands the importance of preserving a mystery's integrity. Absolutely my favorite novel of all time. I recommend this trilogy to anyone interested in literature in any way. The purest form of talent I have had the pleasure of reading to date."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This is by far the most complex, bizzare, and intricatly written novel i have ever read.

The purest form of talent I have seen to date."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"What can I say? There is nothing quite like this trilogy out there in the world of modern literature. Auster hit his stride with these three novellas, which stand as a kind of examination of language and existentialism masked by a cloak of private eye genre fiction.If I had to rate the stories individually, I would say 'The Locked Room' is the weakest. Not that it is bad or worse than the others, it just seemed to serve more as an autobiography of the author, so after finishing the first two this one seemed a little less daring. The other two, 'City of Glass' and 'Ghosts', are equal in my view. A great price and edition for three innovative and intriguing stories."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This is a series of subtle interlocking novellas set in New York published over 85 and 86: City of Glass, \\"Ghosts\\" and \\"Locked Room with the first set in the period, the 2nd in the 40's and the last one in the 70's. They use mystery conventions of the gumshoe detective (think Humphrey Bogart) but in a subversive way as an existentialist reflection on writing, and story creation and communication but at the pace of a thriller; it more Kafka then Chandler with haunting imagery and surreal coincidences. But it also has deep emotional and psychological depths.To give you a flavour of the book, in the City of Glass the main Character is Daniel Quinn a writer who has abandoned writing except for mystery writing owing to the death of his wife and child. He is successful enough to only need to write one novel a year which he has just done and then he drifts. He is clearly depressed and only feels alive when he is the private eye of his novels. One night he receives a midnight phone call asking for a detective called Paul Auster( yes the real author is also a later character in the story) and after several rejections he decides to act as if were his private eye character. His clients are a child-man who is a survivor of a dreadful abuse by his father (he was deprived of language as part of an experiment in discovering the natural language of man before the fall of the Tower of Babel) and his wife a nurse who had married him so that he could leave the hospital. The father now elderly is being released from Mental hospital and they fear that the son will be killed and want protection.The story then takes many twists and turns and ends with the author as character being criticised by a final narrator who may be one of the characters from the other stories for what happens to Daniel Quinn during the course of the story.In the Locked Room all the characters are named after colours and it's a classical stake-out story but is it? Or is it a reflection on the lives of characters once that have been created and written about?The final story is of two friends who have drifted apart, one wanted to be a writer and is now a critic unable to create works of his own imagination. He discovers that his friend has disappeared leaving a wife and baby and a locked room of manuscripts. These turn out to be masterpieces of novels, plays, and poems far beyond his capability of writing. In preparing those for publishing he re-enters and re-evaluates his life long friendship and what it meant but at a cost as he faces a secret that tests him and his relationships to destruction.Paul Auster's draws on his own colourful work life in his struggle to become a writer so the stories have a grain of gritty realism. But they are interlinked by an interest in the impact of coincidences and lives lived in minimalist even ascetic ways against a background of a loss, failure and absent fathers and reflections on writing and storytelling. If you want a painless way into postmodernist metafiction then this is the book for you. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I think these three novellas have been termed \\"post-modern detective stories\\" by someone with a fancy literature degree and chances are that description isn't too far off. But I'll say now, if you're here looking for a Raymond Chandler type detective story, with sultry women and missing money and men who say very little beating up men who say even less . . . you are going to be terribly disappointed. Because what Auster does here is take the very shell of a mystery story and invert it and mess with it until you're not left with much of a mystery at all, until the mystery is secondary to what's actually going on. It's a neat slight of hand, the more you pay attention to the mystery at hand, the less you're going to notice the more important stuff going on in the background. Or the foreground, depending on where you're looking. As I mentioned already, it consists of three interlinked short novels, City of Glass, Ghosts and the Locked Room, all of which can be read on their own but when read in order certain elements crop up that relate them to each other and sort of inform the other works, so that by the end a consistent theme has developed. The biggest subject that the novels tackle is the question of identity and all of the main characters come to a point where they question who they are and start to devolve into someone else. In City of Ghosts, mystery writer Quinn pretends to be detective Paul Auster and goes about trying to solve one of his cases, taking things to the point where it's curious what he's even solving anymore and who is investigating what. In Ghosts, the main character is watching someone else, for reasons that he's unsure of, and at the same time it appears that his subject is watching him, leading to a neat bit of identity crisis at hand. And finally, in The Locked Room, a man's childhood friend disappears and the man finds himself immersing himself deeper and deeper into the life of his old friend, until he's not even sure what he's looking for anymore. These are not easy novels to read, Auster gives us enough information to work at it but not enough that he has to sit there and explain it all to us, at the end, the only judgemnet we can make is our own and maybe that's not totally accurate. There are threads dangling, lives cut off, people who aren't what they're supposed to be and aren't sure when the change happened, or what it really means. Auster delves into what makes us what we are, and who we think we are and how the quest can change us, like not looking into a mirror for too long and forgetting what you really look like. When you finally see your reflection, you're surprised, because you think it's someone else, after all this time. This is the kind of book that probably needs to be read and reread, in order to catch the interlocking themes, the tiny clues that carry over from one book to the other. But even from one reading I can tell it's a thick work, thought provoking and constantly evolving. I may not have gotten everything, but what I did get gave me a lot to think about. As I said earlier, there is a central mystery in each book, but that's just the window dressing, an excuse to get you to read. The real meat of the novel lies elsewhere, somewhere in the mind."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Firstly, prospective readers need to be clear that this can barely pass off as a piece of detective fiction; actually, it isn't one at all - it's a highbrow literary and philosophical adventure. The three novellas that comprise this book are journeys into the self - seemingly autobiographical, but, more biographical, about You, the reader, irrespective of who you are ((I've tested this hypotheses and empirical evidence seems to support it). And that, if you think about it, is a remarkable feat - how the author manages to talk to the hearts and minds of most readers.Here's where the book is like a detective fiction: in its whole - in the structure, in the thoughts, in the style. The author raises many different questions - about the characters, the stories, the self, and about literature as a whole - throughout the book, leaves a bunch of clues strewn across the pages, and I walked away with some answered questions, but a bunch of unanswered ones too. I'm fairly convinced, however, that the answers are in there, and that is enough to make me read this a second time.I'm not sure if a second reading will change my opinion, but as of now, I think this book is a great literary and intellectual adventure - actually, a great \\"trip\\"."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This book has the rare combination of qualities that qualify it as re-readable. There is enough fibre to it to allow digestion to occur over a long period of time, and each reading will reveal new perspectives.If at first you're confused and think you've stumbled onto some sort of high-art form of detective novels, you've basically got the right idea. Fortunately, Auster goes much deeper, weaving an intricate and complex thread throughout the stories of this trilogy. Though each can stand on the strength of its tale on its own, together they form a triptych which forces you as the reader to continually refer to each portion again and again."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"These three works, though predicated upon unconventional metaphysics, seemed very real to me. Auster uses a great deal of literary liscense with regards to the nature of reality. I think it is a creative feet that Auster gets away with conveying this sort of reality without making the reader feel detached. This may be one of the reasons he uses the conventional &quot;low art&quot; plot device of a detective story in his works.New York Trilogy is profound in complexity without losing its flow as a novel readable to people who do not have a PhD in Comparative Literature. It is complex and worthy of drawn-out analytic discertation yet remains a compelling story. I would recomend it to anyone remotely interested in masterful contemporary fiction, regardless of the intensity of that interest."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I did not get this book - it was perhaps meant to be some kind of philosophical exercise exploring the way meaning is created by turning the relationship of the author and the novel on its head, making the reader question the idea of fiction and the story form.It also attempted to explore the idea of identity and some other existential hogwash. There's probably some sense of the book writing the author (rather than the other way round), with some self-conscious cross-referencing of characters between the three stories and the appearance of Auster himself as a character for an added touch of novelty.There was also a film noir quality to the setting where a detective is tasked to search out a missing person and the hunter becomes the hunted in the process, with the detective losing his sense of self and purpose and questioning his own existence, but I got lost in the cleverness of the stories and it became virtually unreadable. But I plodded on because this is Auster and I enjoyed his 'Oracle Night', 'The Brooklyn Follies', and the superb 'Man in the Dark'."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I read this book and came away from it with mixed feelings. I might read it again to see if I can find anything, but as of an initial reading I did not connect with much of what was said. I appreciated the last story more than the first two. The first two wandered too much for my tastes. They were different, but I couldn't gather much else from it (though the descriptions of nyc as well as its history was compelling). The author has a good way of writing that is simple and to the point, however the plot lines of the first two did not gain my interest (it is only that the writing itself is good that I would consider reading this again). The last story seemed to have much more contemplation as well as depth to the protagonist, therefore it stuck to my mind in a more significant way (and it is the story that receives most of my praise). Read the last story; it was engaging and original."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I do not see this work the way Auster constructed it. To me it is not a 'trilogy' even though there are overlapping themes, and incidents. I see it as a collection of separate pieces. The first and the third are first-rate works of fiction . They are novels which are searches for self. They are -Multiple- identity -mysteries which illustrate Auster's way of seeing life and the world, as unending chance and surprise.Perhaps the best summary of the Auster credo comes somewhere in the middle of 'The Locked Room' The narrator- best friend of Fanshawe meditates as follows.\\" We all want to be told stories and we listen to them in the same way we did when we were young. We imagine the real story inside the words, and to do this we substitute ourselves for the person in the story, pretending that we can understand him because we understand ourselves. This is a deception.We exist for ourselves, perhaps, and at times we even have a glimmer of who we are, but in the end we can never be sure, and as our lives go on, we become more and more opaque to ourselves, more and more aware of our own incoherence. No one can cross the boundary into another-for the simple reason that no one can gain access to himself.\\"Auster is a supreme storyteller. In these works there are stories within stories of incredible power and beauty. In the first book there is a small story of a mother in the Shoah carrying a baby for whom she at last has the satisfaction of attaining and giving milk. The baby has been dead for days. In the concluding work of the Trilogy Auster tells the story of Lorenzo da Ponte whose life he describes as five or six distinct lives, illustrating a principle of Auster's fiction i.e. we can never know for certain where the story of the life is going to next.I may not agree with Auster's philosophy of life but find him one of the supreme storytellers writing today . I pick up his work and I want to read and read and read."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"We read this book in our book club, and it received less than stellar response from the other readers, but I have always found Auster a rather idiosyncratic &quot;taste&quot; just the same. The initial story, my favorite of the three in the trilogy, is &quot;City of Glass,&quot; is a portrayal of an aimless character, who finds himself drawn into a mystery, for which there is little to gain and an obtuse and not particularly linear structure. The &quot;noir&quot; story structure is used throughout, and though there is certainly mystery of a sort as to how the smaller clues will lead our hero to piece things together, and arrive at the stories conclusion, there is a meditation on language and how ideas are conveyed that is really at the root of the events of the story."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"the moment that i escaped into this novel i was drug around by the tangled words and tantilizing tales... auster writes in a way that not many others can, he lets it flow out from his heart stright into yor eyes. it is wonderful, and inspiring. this tale is even more twisted than other work i have read by auster, he drives a lot of his work by the oddity of coincidences. at one moment in time i wanted it all to connect, and as if he had dreamt that this moment would come into exsistence, and he prepared for it. he tricked you into believeing that it all would tie together, then tricked you into thinking that it didn't. and not until the end did you figure out the reality of it all, and the character seemed to be just as confused and scared as you.the characters knew the reality of love, they knew how it felt to hurt, they knew all of it.. they experienced the pain that we all know too well... and they experienced while exposed in front of your viewing eyes.this one kept me captivated from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I have read and greatly enjoyed four Paul Auster novels before these:THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS(2002),ORACLE NIGHT(2004),THE BROOKLYN FOLLIES(2005), andMAN IN THE DARK(2008). But they are all recent work. Had I started with the three novellas collected here as THE NEW YORK TRILOGY (1985-86), the first fiction published under Auster's own name, I think I would have been intrigued, a bit baffled, and certainly respectful, but probably not eagerly waiting for his next book as I am now. In the trilogy, Auster uses the device of the pulp-fiction detective story as a means of exploring deeper issues about identity and the Faustian bargains inherent in writing fiction. The approach works best, I think, where there is a balance between the popular medium and the serious message; the new Penguin Classics Deluxe edition with wonderful faux-distressed covers and title pages by Art Spiegelman plays so perfectly into the pulp genre that the fun carries the reader quite far into some of the more abstract passages -- far, but not all the way.All the later Auster novels that I have read involve a central character, usually but not always a writer, who engages in some kind of search for meaning, involving himself in stories of one kind and another: dreams, memories, fantasies, or movie scenarios. A story-writer finding clarity by means of other stories -- no wonder Auster's work is often referred to as metafiction. But no cause for alarm; Auster is such a fabulous storyteller that even his slightest diversion becomes a delight. If his framing characters are sympathetic, as they mostly are in his later work, and their situation is believable, Auster's novels work perfectly on several levels simultaneously. But in the first two books at least in TRILOGY, he seems more interested in writing a novel of ideas, rather than giving those ideas a human handle.All three books take place in New York, but only the first, CITY OF GLASS, is in any real sense tied to its setting. The protagonist here is another writer, Daniel Quinn, but he does not stick to that name. He has begun to think of himself as William Wilson, the pseudonym under which he writes detective stories, and when he receives a series of late night phone calls asking his help as head of the Paul Auster Detective Agency, he impersonates the unknown Auster. He sets off on a long surveillance of a madman who spends his days wandering the streets of the Upper West Side. Receiving little help from the real Paul Auster (whom he contacts later at his real address and meets his real wife and child), Quinn/Wilson must continue his search alone, finding a kind of spiritual nirvana even as his material existence deteriorates. It is a novel of interesting ideas, though carried by an unreal plot.The middle novella, GHOSTS, is the most abstract and the least enjoyable. Again, it involves a private detective. This is Blue, engaged by a mysterious Mr. White to watch an equally mysterious man called Black, who lives in a Brooklyn apartment opposite the one that White has rented for Blue. Black appears to be some kind of writer, and most of the book consists of Blue watching Black write, while himself keeping notes on what he imagines Black might be writing. Of the three, this relates most clearly to the nature of fiction, but so artificial a concept can barely sustain even the 60 pages of its length.However I really enjoyed the third novella, THE LOCKED ROOM, because its container story comes closest to being able to stand on its own. The central character, presumably Auster himself, finds himself appointed the literary executor of his childhood friend, Fanshawe, who has disappeared. He publishes Fanshawe's work, falls in love with his wife, and adopts his son, in a sequence of short chapters that sweeps the reader up in its romance. But the process makes him begin to doubt his own abilities and even his own identity as a person, leading him further and further from where he started. Although his situation is somewhat melodramatic, his feelings, whether as a man or artist, are all too real.Many times I was reminded of a childhood favorite, G. K. Chesterton's detective fantasy nightmareTHE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY. If you enjoyed that, you will like the TRILOGY, and vice-versa. Otherwise, I would advise readers new to Auster to start with THE BOOK OF ILLUSIONS or ORACLE NIGHT."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book once I saw the incredible comments about it: \\"brilliant\\", \\"amazing\\", \\"a dazzling achievement\\", \\"a new departure for the American novel\\". But what a waste of money... Not only was the book dull and obvious, but it was also pretentious. Do not expect to find anything similar to a mistery novel or even a detective story. It's about a writer (yes, so original) who clearly doesn't know what to do with his life. So, he decides that pretending to be a detective is a good way of spending his time."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Not the usual novel or detective story, The characters exist in a different dimension than those in other books and you keep trying to pull back the curtain to see them but just as you do, you spot them leaving by the back door.A true mystery I think. Exhiliarating and cuts through the muck of the modern world, while putting that muck front and center.I read the City of Glass first and then found out it was the first of a trilogy. Get all three. Read them in order. Now I have to go back and start over.I want to read all his other books, but afraid of being disappointed. No one could do this again?I should say I don't usually like \\"experimental\\" novels with no plot. There is a very compelling story here. I want to know how he did it."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Hi I'm a german highschool studend. In class we were supposed to read &quot;the city of glass&quot;. Today we all write a review on it.Honestly it is not to much of a story for me. The fact I liked, was the fall of the protagonist. After all it is just an everyday story about the facts of life. I feel people deerve to be what they are, not more not less. And that's what happens. After getting a job the detectiv gets lost in his task. Eventually he loses almost evrything he ownes but what he always thought he would be. Altough one could be of the opinion that everything in our lifes is pales and therefor chance does not exist the reader is only confronted with chance. In the end you feel that you really should not do anyhing, just because chance can probably do better than you."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"One can't deny the extreme originality of Paul Auster's stories. In each of them, he ostensibly challenges the blurred definition of reality and the boundary between that and what the mind tells us. The irrational quality that permeates &quot;City of Glass&quot; defies all comprehension. I found this story the toughest to get through. Not by its complexity but by the monotony that eventually sets in the second half and by the ambiguous ending. Quinn is by far one the most mind-boggling and ridiculous characters in contemporary fiction. Likewise, the characters in &quot;Ghosts&quot; are incredulous but it is redeemed by the interesting premise of the watcher being watched and how the tables are eventually turned. The most accessible is the final tale &quot;The Locked Room&quot;. The writer is constantly haunted by the memory of his best friend whose life he has inadvertantly taken over and is finally driven to discover the truth in a painful journey into the friend's past. Besides the depth of characterisation, it also cleverly incorporates the themes in the other stories (both expressed and implied)."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Somewhere along the way Paul Auster was decreed a &quot;literary author,&quot; so if you dare to say he's boring, pretentious, and not really all that good with words, you are simply one of the great unwashed who don't get it. The first two novels in this book book are flat our lousy, no two ways about it (I lost the book after the I slogged through the second novel and didn't much miss it. The concluding story looked better than the other two but that ain't saying much). Auster's characters are wan bloodless abstractions. You can have abstractions in your stories and still write engaging stuff, look at Kafka, but make us feel for your abstractions; that's the secret. Auster doesn't come close to managing this feat. Auster writes &quot;literature&quot; for philosophy students who never got literature or maybe &quot;philosophy&quot; for English students who never understood philosophy. At any rate it's boring and self important drivel, worse when you get down to it Mr. Auster's great insights are really rather insipid. They're the kinds of things fifteen year olds happen on and feel really, really deep and special for thinking of, for a year or two anyway. James Ellroy and Dashiell Hammett have written much better books, but unfortunately they're crime authors so we can't take them seriously now can we? But Mr. Auster, talentless though he may be, is a literary author, deigning to write crime albeit in an oh so clever postmodern way so we can't not him serioulsly at risk of looking dumb. If you read to actually enjoy a book pick up Ellroy or Hammett, but if you want to impress the grad student crowd at parties then go for Auster. But you'll always wonder just how many of them actually like him, and how many are just saying they do are because they're too afraid of looking stupid to say differently."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"One of the other reviewers used a great phrase to describe Paul Auster: \\"He is obviously very pleased with himself.\\" I really wanted to like this book. Two friends had recommended Auster to me and this was the first book of his that I picked up. However, when I started reading and found out that \\"Paul Auster\\" was a character in the first story, warning sirens went off. Occasionally, a writer can pull off the whole insert-yourself-into-your-story thing. This is not one of those times. The story read like a like a pretentious effort by a first year MFA student who really wanted to tell a \\"deep\\" story that had \\"meaning.\\" Aside from some interesting passages (mild spoiler) about religious history in the new world, I found the story to be rather boring and the effort at some deeper meaning to be banal and transparent."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"If you like a conundrum with no clear answers, you might like this book.

The love of writing, the problem of authorship and last but not the least the love of a woman. In the three novels the narrator shifts in character. First he is Quinn working under the alias of his fictional character Work who presumes the identity of Paul Auster the detective who in turn .. I think you get my drift. What do all theese characters have in common? They are all trying to describe the world in words. They all fale it seems.

I can not explain why either. Gradually, I just lost interest. Perhaps it was because of the style of the author. Possibly, the text is too perfect. By that I mean that it lacks passion, energy and --- elan -- or something. Again, I can not put my finger on it.

The first two installments are a bit nebulous and abstract, but the third (The Locked Room) ties everything together and really packs a punch.

Once I started taking notes, I realized that I was in the same position as the main character &quot;Quinn&quot;-- and after taking notes up till page 89, I felt a sense of vertigo--like there would be no definitive answer to all of these entangled riddles--though Auster invites us in to the maze--and makes it seem solvable--and then you find yourself falling through a vortex of words and images. You think there must be a clear picture of it all... but is there? Or is Auster just playing with your mind (all in good fun) ? Anyway, this is such an awesome work of literature to demonstrate the power of language to impact the mind.

Auster is a master in displaying his characters as live people, simply by giving them the thoughts, fears, and hopes everyone can understand. Additionally, he skilfully invents the most absurd events, but makes them plausible with a few words. Auster's style is fictional, fantastic, and descriptive in one. I've read all of his books, but this one is his masterpiece. It's the right book for everyone who feels and thinks the &quot;New York way&quot;."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Narratives spiralling out of track, characters involved in self-narratives that separate and congeal with the ostensible plot. An sneaking suspicion of dread behind you. Involving, teasing, playful and evil. Wonderful."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Paul Auster tells us the story about what it feels choosing to be alone. His paragraphs write to the soul of who knows what it feels to be alienated. He doesn't blame that feeling on anyone else, that alienation comes from within ourselves. If you understand this feeling, you understand each of the books. This is not a detective story, as he painfully tells us in the first installment over and over again, this is an exploration of solitude. Not a noble solitude, although noble it might be in the end. But rather the solitude of being who you are, with the only choices being those choices made by your character. The watcher is always the watched, not by someone else, (although that is illluded to) but by the self. As fiction, that's pretty damn powerful."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"There's a very weird moment near the beginning of The Locked Room, the last book in this short trilogy. The narrator takes the manuscript of a missing friend's fiction to a literary editor he knows and calls back a few days later to see what the editor thinks. The editor says that while the book is perfectly okay (typical bet-hedging), there's something mysterious about it that he can't put his finger on, that he can't get the book out of his mind, and so on. Which is exactly what the perplexed reader has been telling him or herself for the previous 200 pages. They tell me that these books use the model of detective fiction - apart from the middle book, you could have fooled me. The diction is like no thriller ever written; Auster's style is utterly clean, clear and neutral, almost as if English isn't his first language, yet when you gaze into the pool of his style it shows you nothing but the reflection of your own face. This book is so clever that it should be boring and sterile, but it's not; it's filled with panic, dread and the terror of loneliness. (Beautifully pointed up when, in the first book, the hero Quinn meets Paul Auster and his beautiful wife and son; Auster has said that he wrote City of Glass as a sort of inverted autobiography of what his life would have been like if he hadn't met his current wife.) Auster's more recent work occasionally lapses into an irritatingly faux-naif style (he's one of the only serious writers I can think of who'll use a sentence like &quot;Nothing would ever be the same again&quot; without irony) but he's still got the same storytelling magic he first exercised in the New York Trilogy. A friend of mine calls him Paul Austere. I quite like the sound of that."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Auster is a word detective -- clever, sometimes too clever -- but he's at his most witty and inventive in this early trilogy. This is the set of books that turned me on to Auster, and led me to Book of Illusions, Oracle Night and In the Country of Last Things. Challenging reading in a highly entertaining manner. His writings reinforce my belief in the power of words, and bring to mind -- for various reasons -- writers such as Nabakov, Fowles and Jack O'Connell. A genuine original. The fact that I can't recall the specifics of this trilogy hardly matters. What I remember is the feeling of reading something new, or rather something old written in a new way. Hearing Auster's name always brings to mind the term &quot;linguistics,&quot; which to me is the shortest yet most descriptive term for characterizing both Auster the writer and his collective body of work."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"A detective story only superficially. A thoughtful, interesting mental puzzle, not for the timid or casual reader. If it borrows from the traditional detective genre it is from Chandler or Thompson, a search by a lost soul among lost souls, with little hope or intention of being found. Auster provides the clue to where to begin to understand his book - look to Cervantes' Don Quixote. New York Trilogy is fundamentally a writer writing about writing, the creative process, losing one's self in order to create another, separate self. Auster's twist is that the journey back &quot;home&quot; to one's self, to an original identity (if such a thing does indeed even exist at the end of the process) is uncertain. Conrad pioneered the psychoanalytical approach to literature, the supreme struggle within one's own mind; cowardice and bravery, truth and fiction, overpowering the external, physical actions. Auster takes this approach to the extreme. Everything that has meaning exists in the psychological. What exists in the physical is at best a reflection of the mind's perceptions, an illusory substrate for the creative process (quantum physicists could relate to this - the physical has meaning only in relation to the observer, directly effected by the process of observation). It is also a terrifying confession to admit to a loss of one's own identity, to intentionally lose one's self in order to accomplish a specific end (the creation of a work of literature). To be, for an indefinite period, without a name, a home, a life to call your own. In the end it is, as Auster simply states, a question in response to a question. The answer is left for the reader to decide, it must come from the reader's own mind, if the reader is up to the challenge"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Paul Auster burst onto the literary scene in the mid-eighties with The New York Trilogy, a series of experimental detective novels (or should I say detective-style novels as only one features an actual detective). In the first installment, City of Glass, a wrong number draws a hermetic novelist into mentally disturbed man's conflict with his religious fanatic father. In the next, Ghosts, a private eye named Blue is hired by a man called White to spy on the isolated Black. In the final episode, The Locked Room, a literary critic searches for a childhood friend who has disappeared, leaving behind a wife and child and a wealth of extraordinary, unpublished fiction. After each tale's somewhat cryptic ending, the truths behind the shady events are still mostly obscure and so is the piece's general meaning. Both of which are especially disappointing given the amount of suspense Auster builds-up. The author is often accused of being clever for clever's sake and is easy to understand why. But if those are your concerns, you are missing what makes these books truly special: atmosphere. Mixing detective noir with postmodern surrealism, Auster paints eerie netherlands that make the reader readily accept the most bizarre circumstances in his fiction. Everything the New York Trilogy lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in style."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"The New York Trilogy is composed of three seemingly unconnected texts, all of which involve writing, notebooks, detective cases, and New York City. In City of Glass, Quinn, a detective-story novelist, becomes a detective himself and is wrapped up in a bizarre case about language. In Ghosts, Blue is a private eye hired by Black to monitor and report on White. For a year he watches White, and Blue's own life dissolves in the process. In The Locked Room, the narrator's childhood friend Fanshawe disappears, leaving behind a family and a closet of manuscripts. As the narrator sorts thought the manuscripts for publication, he becomes increasingly obsessed with Fanshawe's life, disappearance, and death. As a trilogy, the stories are entirely unconnected save for the themes of language, writing, notebooks, and investigation that carry through them all. The end result is a slew of unsolved mysteries that, as Auster often does, tantalize and lead on the reader without providing satisfying conclusions. The ideas are interesting, the texts read quickly, but they are ultimately unsatisfying, the questions are never answered, and they promise more than they ever deliver.City of Glass was originally published alone and has an unfinished ending. The rest of The New York Trilogy offers no answers, but rather opens up new questions and rehashes familiar ideas in a series of unconnected-but-similar plots. The ideas are fascinating: Auster studies the uses of language, words, and writing, he dabbles a bit in identity and one's life's work and purpose, and he wraps all of his theories in mysteries and detective stories. The texts read quickly and keep you on your toes, looking for clues, interested in the plot progression.However, the book isn't nearly as interesting when reread, and that says something about the mysteries themselves: unlike a good detective novel, the plots in Auster's texts never reach their conclusion. There are a plethora of clues and ideas, but ultimately the clues lead nowhere: there is no conclusion. As a result, the end of each text is frustrating, no matter how successful the body of it was, and rereads are tainted from the beginning with the knowledge that the text will never resolve itself.If you are willing to explore Auster's ideas and deal with unsatisfactory conclusions, then I recommend this series. Up until the end, each installment is interesting, a little grotesque, unique, even ingenious. However, if you're looking for a solid plot then I advise you to pass over the series and instead find a writer who not only builds up but also delivers. Auster fails to do that--a purposeful choice, no doubt, but frustrating nonetheless."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"\\"The New York Trilogy\\" isn't a novel. As the name would imply, it's a trilogy of novella length short stories, each revolving around a similar theme. While externally, each is pinned to a common geography - namely the city of New York - internally, they tackle the more complicated issue of self-identity and self-worth.The building blocks Auster uses to create these stories hinges on the concept of creating a setting where the protagonist is pulled into a mystery and forced to take the role of detective:In \\"City of Glass,\\" our narrator is an author who gets a call from someone looking for a detective, and he decides to play along. The unfolding mystery turns the city itself into an antagonist, while carrying our hero into an ever-devolving exploration of self.In \\"Ghosts,\\" our narrator isn't playing at being a detective, but is in fact an actual detective. He is, however, cajoled into performing an investigation similar to City of Glass, which takes him out of the traditional realm of detective work, and sets him up to essentially spy on his own reality.Finally, \\"The Locked Room\\" sees a return to the author as protagonist, as he begins a literary (and eventually physical) search for his one-time childhood friend. With a few nods to the first story, Auster attempts to tie the trio together in a fairly loose bundle.As with many post-modern stories, \\"The New York Trilogy\\" is grounded in the psyches of its protagonists and to a certain extent its author. It would probably be impractical, if not impossible, to discuss these stories in terms of plot, as the action that moves them isn't what's happening in the ebb and flow of each story's structure, but what each character is forced to face mentally.If there's any shortcoming to Auster's writing, it's in the way he attempts to immerses his readers in his character's search for self through a fairly transparent mechanism of repetition. This is most noticeable in \\"Ghosts,\\" where he essentially covers the same ground for twenty or thirty pages.Even so, Auster's writing is unbelievably dense and enjoyable to read, and his stories are uniquely reflective of our society and culture. For this reason, I can see \\"The New York Trilogy\\" slipping into the canon of college literature courses over the next couple of decades."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"How do you discuss a mystery that's not a mystery? More importantly, how do you WRITE three mysteries that aren't? And still manage to create involving, memorable, and deeply disturbing novels? I don't know how, but Paul Auster has figured out. In the space of three short novels, Auster has developed mysteries that are more concerned with ideas than plot, with the style of writing rather than the content. He has, in short, written THE NEW YORK TRILOGY.Describing the plots does no justice to the novels (they are, after all, practically plotless), but I will endeavor to summarize. CITY OF GLASS tracks Quinn, a frustrated novelist who agrees to accept a detective case, after being mistaken for the detective Paul Auster. GHOSTS follows the exploits of Blue, a detective hired by White to spy on Black, for reasons which remain obscure. THE LOCKED ROOM is centered on an author who has been charged with the task of tending to an old friend's vast literary output, after the friend has mysteriously vanished from civilization.As mentioned previously, these novels ARE mysteries, on their surfaces. (That's initially what drew me to their pages.) But Auster isn't concerned with the intricacies of the detective genre. He is far more fascinated with the image of the author, that person who creates people out of thin air and smoke. Auster delves into what the make-up of such a person may be, a person who's public character is defined by the artistic output, not by whom the author actually is. Who the author actually may be, or what the author's opinion is as to his or her own writings, is not important. It is a schizophrenic life, to be sure, and Auster knows it. Are we defined by our inner monologue, or do our actions govern our identities? Is who we purport to be as important as how we appear to be?CITY OF GLASS is an excellent example of Auster's musings on this theme. As Quinn slowly begins to develop his detective persona, he can feel his previous author persona begin to slip away. By his inadvertent creation of a new persona, he erases his past; but as he was only really defined by his novels, it is a far easier task than it first appeared. This culminates in an exploration of the inner workings of personal discovery that reminds me of nothing so much than Arthur C. Clarke's elliptical finale to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Is it environment, or public perception, or biology that determines what we turn out to be? Auster interweaves this theme into all three of his novels. The character of Stillman, in CITY OF GLASS, is so obsessed with this idea that he deprived his son of any form of contact, trying to discover the hidden, secret language of God. Fanshawe, in THE LOCKED ROOM, is determined that he distance himself from what he was perceived to be, unwilling to accept anyone's characterization of his psyche. Blue, in GHOSTS, discovers that what he fears the most is true, that his existence is his job; outside of that, nothing he thinks or feels has any effect.Mind you, none of this would raise the themes above the quality of a academic treatise without Auster's remarkable writing ability. While he may be loathe to be judged by his output, the fact remains that Auster can relate a story with the best of them. His characters, while purposefully vague, still manage to create an empathy with the reader. The quest for identity, that search for the ego, is a universally understandable topic. Auster achieves the feat of simultaneously having the characters understand themselves at the same time that the reader does. Any discussion of the past is irrelevant, it's the NOW that matters. The author in THE LOCKED ROOM gradually understands this in his quest for the missing friend Fanshawe. What he discovers about Fanshawe only serves to confuse. Perhaps he was better off with his own personal memories, rather than try to incorporate the recollections of others.Auster also realizes that one's opinions about a novel can differ from another's; it makes no difference. What is important is what YOU thought, not what others may tell you to think. The NEW YORK TRILOGY seems designed to provoke different responses, alternate beliefs as to what it all means. I personally haven't been privy to such a possibility as to the ultimate meaning of a thing since witnessing Peter Greenaway's remarkable film THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER. What does it all ultimately mean? Who knows? What's important is that it affected me, on a level I wasn't expecting. It is a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"\\"New York Trilogy\\" is intelligent, interesting, and inventive, albeit problematic in some ways. The trilogy contains three novellas that largely stand on their own, but also bear some relationship to each other. The novellas could be considered reinvented or perhaps dysfunctional detective stories of sorts. While each involves a mystery, they lack the action and denouement of traditional detective stories. Instead, the mystery behind each story is something of an intellectual conundrum that engages the reader with the act of authorship. Who and what is the writer? What are the writer's motives? What happens when the writer attempts to solve a mystery (as in \\"City of Glass\\")? What happens when the writer is the source of a mystery (as in \\"The Locked Room\\")? The novellas are largely metaphorical (the writer as a detective, the writer's brain as a locked room, the writer as more than one person) and are rewarding on a symbolic level. Unfortunately, Aster is a skilled enough detective writer to lead us down a non-existent path of genuine mystery. \\"The Locked Room\\" contains enough tension and ingredients to make us believe we are reading a real detective story. The largely intellectual conclusion comes as something of an anti-climax and almost makes me wonder if the story ran wild in Auster's head to the point where he could not think of a suitable way to finish it. Issues like this and the stiffness of the language bothered me to some degree but did not diminish my appreciation of Auster's work. This is certainly one of the more inventive books I've encountered and I enjoyed it tremendously. Whether or not it is Post-Modern or can be attributed any other academic trope is of course irrelevant."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I am writing my final thesis for my masters degree on Paul Austers New York Trilogy and I would love to hear from anyone interested in his work (The Locked Room is of special interest to me). At the time N.Y. Trilogy was published it had a great impact on me. Now almost 15 years later I can still read the book with great pleasure. One of Austers best books yet. Compares easily with &quot;Leaviathan&quot; and is without doubt a more thorougly thougt thought book than his latest work of fiction &quot;Timbuktu&quot;. I can recomend it to anyone who likes a kafkesque atmosphere in their reading."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This book is advertised as detectives stories, but they are not in the strictest sense of the word. These are stories about trying to find and maintain your identies, and not about finding murders or kidnappers.The first story &quot;City of Glass&quot; is about a writer, Quinn, who has lost his family and seems to be lost without a purpose. One day he recive a phone call for by mistake, the call is for a detective Paul Auster. Out of interest Quinn decides to say he is Paul Auster and takes the case. Quinn gets so involved in the case he loses everything else in his life. His only lifeline during this time is a red notebook that he makes notes about the case in. It is in this notebook that he tries to figure out who he is.The second story, &quot;Ghosts,&quot; is meant to be like an old dective story, a la Dashell Hammett. It has a very surreal quality about it none of the charcters have real names, they are named after colors. The story centers around Blue who is hired to watch Black. All Black does is sit in his apartment and write. Just like Quinn in the first story Blue loses his himself in the case and in Black. The question is who hired Blue and why?The third story, &quot;The Locked Room,&quot; is about a man who is never given a name, and his childhood friend Fanshawe. Fanshawe has disappeared leaving his wife, child, and his unpublished work. He leaves the task of deciding what to do with the unpublished work to his friend. As his friend goes about getting the work published he becomes closer to Fanshawe's wife and son. The friend and Fanshawe's wife finally marry. The friend's troubles begin when he is asked to write a book about Fanshawe's life. He becomes so absorbed in Fanshawe's life he almost loses himself in it. Can Fanshawe's friend save himself and his life before it becomes lost in Fanshawe's.Each character in each story struggles with who he is. Auster plays with his role as a writer in these stories. In the first story he puts himself in by name, and at the end of the last story he tries to explain why he wrote this collection of stories.Overall this is collection is well worth the read. It is full of imagery and well written. I highly recomend this book for anyone who is looking for a book that will make them think, but is a quick read."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"His writing is amazing, his characters are fascinating... the first story really held me, even though it felt at times like I was reading a school report on the history of language instead of a short story.

I didn't find the main character in the first book very believable, in that he seemed to be rationally driven, but at every step he made such stupid mistakes.I also found Auster rambles on and on for pages at times on topics that are only loosely connected with the storyline. This can often be done well, but he does it by telling rather than by showing, which I find to be one of the biggest differences between a good book and a bad one.I was quite surprised at the many positive things I've heard about this book. I suppose it just wasn't for me."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth.

Some passages are like reading Umberto Eco, but without his brilliance and more important without importance to me as the reader!I rate this book 2 stars; 1 for Auster's writing, which (without doubt) is good ,and 1 for his description of New York. I've never had the pleasure to visit the city, but in this book it comes alive.My conclusion will be: If you want mystery novels stick to Raymond Chandler, and if you want the rest stick to Umberto Eco ;-)"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"\\"He had always imagined that the key to good detective work was a close observation of details. The more accurate the scrutiny, the more successful the results. The implication was that human behavior could be understood, that beneath the infinite faade of gestures, tics, and silences, there was finally a coherence, an order, a source of motivation.\\"Paul Auster's \\"New York Trilogy,\\" consisting of the novellas \\"City of Glass,\\" \\"Ghosts,\\" and \\"The Locked Room,\\" is an intriguing blend of post-modern fiction, metaphysical philosophy, and detective novels. Through his reliance on the themes and structure of pulp/noir mysteries, Auster delves deeply into questions regarding identity, purpose, obsession, what is real, and examines the often tenuous grip that most people have on their sanity. His exploration is quite compelling and makes for a fascinating read, but it is unfortunate that the quality of the novellas is slightly uneven. The first, \\"City of Glass,\\" is far too impenetrable and abstruse to be much more than frustrating. While it is clear that its protagonist, Quinn, is desperate to shed his identity in order to escape from the painful loss that has left him paralyzed, it is unclear why he becomes so obsessed with the case that he takes on after doing so. \\"Ghosts\\" is a marked improvement, but it is only in the final novella, \\"The Locked Room,\\" that this trilogy really comes to life. \\"The Locked Room\\" is eloquent where its predecessors are vague, pointed when the others are intentionally blurry, and poignant rather than murky. Auster is certainly a great writer, and I will be interested to read more of his works, but \\"The New York Trilogy\\" requires a willingness to stick with it in order to get to its heart. But I recommend hanging in there, because that final novella is a true gem, and makes the ride worth your while.Here's the grade breakdown: \\"City of Glass\\": C+, \\"Ghosts\\": B, \\"The Locked Room\\": AAverage grade: B"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"\\"The New York Trilogy\\", a volume containing three separate novellas: \\"The City of Glass\\", \\"Ghosts\\" and \\" The Locked Room\\", is an intriguing example of the author's game with the readers and, perhaps, with himself. The motif common for all three stories in the mystery, the solution of which is pursued by the main character, and the place of action, New York City (I do not agree with one of the reviewers who said New York could be here any other urban environment as well; certainly it could not be any European city, NYC gives these stories the distinct character and for anyone who has walked the streets through which the characters wander, it is a setting unmistakable for any other; The City's atmosphere hangs over the characters like a cloud).\\"The City of Glass\\" features Quinn, a solitary man, living quietly after the death of his wife and son, and writing detective stories under a pseudonym. One night, Quinn receives a mysterious phone call from a man demanding the services of a private detective, Paul Auster... Although it is clearly a wrong number, Quinn decides to pretend to be Auster and take the challenge, changing his life forever.A complete change of life circumstances is also a fate of the protagonist of a second (and the shortest) novella \\"Ghosts\\". Blue, who is a professional private detective, receives a task from the disguised client, White, to watch Black. The trouble is, Black never does anything interesting except reading or writing, and bored Blue tries to find out, where the real secret of this investigation lies.In the last novella \\"The Locked Room\\", the main character is involved in the publication of the works of his missing childhood friend, Fanshawe. The books are a great success, he marries Fanshawe's wife and he assumes Fanshawe's identity, happily at the beginning...These novellas are not, as has been pointed out by many reviewers before me, typical mysteries, where clues lead to conclusions and the reader may amuse himself with finding a correct answer. They are, on one hand, explorations of the soul, of the unknown in us, and, on the other hand, and taken together, a postmodern riddle, with literary jokes, cultural clues. They can be read on various levels, which is what really makes them interesting. For somebody, who expects a mystery story from the beginning to the end this book would be a disappointment, However, it is rewarding for the reader interested in reading itself (sounds absurd, I know, but this may be the truth - books play an enormous role in all the novellas). The introduction of Auster, as a detective, but really a writer in the first story, as opposed to Quinn, the writer, who has to become the detective, is only one of the twists here. The exercise with giving the characters the name of the colors (after all, what, if not \\"real\\" names make the reader think of the book characters as real? And are the color names unreal? Such names are common enough...) - is another.By the way, has anyone been lured into drawing Quinn's walk on the street grid of Manhattan?"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This is one of the strangest books, actually three short novellas, that I've ever read. It's almost like a university-sponsored experiment in avante garde literature...no traditional beginning-middle-end structure, no formulaic plotline, no standard 'protagonist' and 'antagonist' characters, odd, stilted dialog, difficult to figure allegory, etc...all of the rules are broken here. It communicates on a bizarre, almost visceral level that is hard to describe, almost as if Auster creates a seperate reality that makes sense as you're reading it and later confuses the hell out of you when you stop and think about it. I couldn't really say that I &quot;enjoyed&quot; this book, honestly it kind of gave me 'the willies', but I keep a copy in my collection because it is just so odd, so amazingly unique and quite probably the work of a bona-fide genius.

With no expectations i began to read the story about Daniel Quinn while thinking that it certainly would be one of those boring books we are often to read in school. But my first impression was wrong. With every line i read the story got more and more interesting. Paul Auster achieves it to build up an exciting story in which Daniel Quinn, a detective story writer, recieves a phone call with whom the story turns into a curios way. The main protagonist has to protect a man whose psychotic father wants to kill him. Quinn loses track of the mystery so that he loses everything he has. Almost the whole story is based on chance and gets interesting by curving the story of Don Quiote or the history of the Paradies.

It was my first reading of an Auster work - and it was quite simply stunning. The first thing that impressed me was his prose style; it's easy to see that he also is a poet for some of the passges in this trilogy are simply products of an aesthetically dazzling mind! But Auster is more than a poet on prose, he is also - and I know it sounds like a clich&eacute;! - profound in his probings of the human condition; I'd say the central themes of these novels are man's ghostlike existence, the nature of the artist and illusion/reality.

This may not be THAT unusual, but it stirred something deep inside me. I turned to her to show her my book and she said &quot;it's fantastic isn't it?&quot; I was incredibly moved by this coincidence but proceeded to get off at my stop.On the next train I took, I clearly remember thinking what would happen next regarding 'New York Trilogy'.

Great author and books."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"These three short novels first present themselves as typical mysteries, perhaps in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, but it soon becomes apparent that they are not in any way traditional, and that, in fact, the mystery is not what is contained in the plot but what in the world the author is intending to impart to the confounded reader.The novels, essentially, all tell the same story, just with different protagonists and different scenarios: An investigator becomes so immersed in another person's life that he loses himself, becoming the other person in his mind.The first novel, City of Glass, tells the story of an author, a writer of mysteries under a pseudonym, who receives a mis-directed phone call to a detective (named Paul Auster) and then pretends to be that detective. He is hired to shadow a father just released from prison, convicted of imprisoning his son for years without human contact to allow him to develop his own language.The second novel, Ghosts, is more obviously metaphoric, with the detective Mr. Blue being hired by Mr. White to watch Mr. Black, for an undisclosed reason.In the third novel, The Locked Room, a failed fiction writer is drawn into the world of his childhood friend, who has disappeared. Receiving a note from the disappeared man, the protagonist becomes obsessed with finding him.These \\"detective\\" novels all become absurdist novels, with the protagonists performing inexplicable obsessive actions. All involve writing, often in a red notebook. All involve a loss of self. All involve, I think, a quest for meaning in life. But who knows?I will have to admit that this kind of book is not my favorite. I generally like a story that makes sense and has a minimum of pretentious flourishes. Those who appreciate affected postmodern literature will love it, undoubtedly. It is well done on a strictly intellectual level, but is too clever for its own good."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"In City of Glass, Paul Auster establishes a dialogue between the genre of the mystery novel and the mystery of life. One's exploring the counter-physical architecture of that magnificent imaginative space. A touchstone for critique is lodged in the first encounter between Quinn, an author turned detective, and Stillman, the man who is perhaps the mad, ex-scholar he is pursuing. In a metalinguistic interchange, Stillman asserts that words have a life of their own, meanings and sounds which reading pleasure is greatly enhanced by keeping a journal (preferably a red spiral notebook) for reflection and elaboration of the book's multifaceted themes. The experience for me was like entering Escher's painting, House of Stairs, and &quot;...[fly] off in so many little directions at once.&quot; The character further explains that the common view of words &quot;...as stones, as great immovable objects with no life, as monads that never change&quot; breaks down upon immediate inspection. That is, stones wear down, erode, turn into dust, scatter into the wind, compile into sedimentary rock...etc. And thus does the plot perambulate from the upper West Side of Manhattan to the motivation of a character, to the relationship between the author and his character, to the relationship between the author and the reader, back again into works of literature, particularly Don Quixote, now summoning the grand biblical image and orthography of the Tower of Babel, finally wending its way into the precincts of bodily desire and the comforts of home and family...making its way back toward that inexplicable of inexplicables, love. So choose your meditation: Does the author become detective descend into madness or ascend into divine embrace? Is there a difference between the two? Why does the book constantly turn a mirror upon the reader? Have we solved any mysteries at all? Do we really know, for example, that the author has not made Quinn a pseudonym for himself? Are not their thoughts a little too intimately interwoven? Where does Auster stand in relation to the author? To Don Quixote or Miguel Cervantes? To Mookie Wilson? to yourself? Whatever strand of DNA you try to decode, you should come to appreciate that while discussion of the text is open, &quot;[e]verything becomes essence; the center of the book shifts with each event that propels it forward.&quot; And so will grow your feeling of awe and wonder at being alive. The City of Glass is really a crystal ball where you can gaze upon a Universe that looks back upon itself."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"A professor of mine once said that she wasn't going to take the easy route and describe this book as a cross between Raymond Chandler and Albert Camus. Well, in not doing so, she did so anyway. The comparison stuck. And it works too. Imagine a detective story where you never find out who the killer is, and it doesn't matter! It's so good.Auster packs his books with weighty ideas, while leaving the prose dry and sparse. I think it works. Let the reader breathe a bit, and maybe they'll wrap their head around the story tight enough to get hooked in. It is at this point, of course that Auster reveals that there really is no story, and you've just contemplated the true meaning of human existence. Okay, not really. But at least he's got you thinking."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Although I haven't been thrilled with Auster's past few books, he remains one of my favorite authors and &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; is one of his best works. &quot;City of Glass&quot; is particularly excellent, blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction. &quot;Ghosts&quot; is weaker than the other components of the trilogy, but given the nature of the comparison, this doesn't diminish the overall power of the story. You definitely don't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Having read and immensely enjoyed Paul Auster's The Brooklyn Follies, and considering the almost uniformly positive reviews that The New York Trilogy gets from readers and critics alike, I guess I was bound to be disappointed. Auster just seems to try too hard here. The stories are surrealist, which I usually enjoy, but don't make any sense at all. You get to the end of each one and you think: \\"what was that all about?\\" (Yes, it is obviously possible that I just \\"don't get it,\\" but neither might you...) There are occasional cross-references among the three stories, and even those don't make any sense in the context of each individual narrative. In my opinion the third entry in the book is almost salvageable, but even that one will likely disappoint the reader given the non-ending sort of ending.

I had heard of him for years, but I always assumed that he was another New York Writer. In order words, stuffy and primarily writing for \\"intellectuals\\" and the Pulitzer Prize or the National Book Award. I could not have been more wrong. These three loosely connected short works contain some of the most gut-wrenching emotional writing that I have laid eyes on. It hit me almost as hard as John Steinbecks \\"East of Eden\\". Don't get me wrong, these books have nothing in common other than a willingness on the part of both authors to let dark things come to the surface and then not just explain them away. (Actually, there is a bit of self reference in Steinbeck's book as well, but it is merely a mention and not the intense existential experience that Auster's book is. Anyway, this is merely an aside.) Auster's Trilogy takes the form of detective stories, but this is only the most rudimentary framework for these incredibly powerful explorations into the nature of identity and the disappearance of one's self or the many selves that one man possesses. I'm not going to tell anything about the plot, but suffice it to say that this stuff is pretty dark. Don't be fooled by the cartoonish cover (done by Art Spiegelman of \\"Maus\\" fame), this is not a fun genre exercise. It is art."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"The stories are well written, easy to follow and maintain a consistent flow. Which is all very commendable because this is difficult to do. But the greatness stops there. The characters are likeable enough, but for some reason, I did not care about them. I can not explain why either. Gradually, I just lost interest. Perhaps it was because of the style of the author. Possibly, the text is too perfect. By that I mean that it lacks passion, energy and --- elan -- or something. Again, I can not put my finger on. Auster seems to be like a voyeuristic, transcendent being, detached from the world, watching things from above, simply recording events like a court reporter...... I really wanted to like this book. I just couldn't."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"The NY Trilogy was my introduction to Paul Auster, and I was hooked from the start. The Trilogy is great in it's very simple, concise style of writing, but all three stories are fulled with imagination and creativity. After reading the Trilogy, I began reading all of Auster's books one right after the other and I was able to really feel the strong impact his books have. He is not only a great story teller, but there is a certain underlying symbolic life in all of his works that is subtle at first glance. However, if you read deeper into his books you can see he weaves within his stories something very personal and intimate. I can't really describe it clearly, but you can feel it when you are reading any of his books (it's like what you see at first, may not be what you see when you look the second time).

I feel certain that no matter how many times I read it, I will find new delights and insights each time."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This was the first in Paul Auster's oeuvre that I tackled and immediately after, I proceeded to read every single word that has come out of Mr. Auster's hand that I could get my hands on. Absolutely thrilling. In a complex world of merging and loss of identity, Mr. Auster effectily melts and combines the reader's identity with his characters. There is a point in THE LOCKED ROOM, towards the end when everything coalesces and when I got to it, I became, at once, so enlighted, so frightened, so impressed, and so scared that I almost had to vomit. This collection is so absolutely brilliant that I am without words.

As a whole, it's fantastic. Reading each individual book, you'd never really figure out the connection between them all; which is almost a bonus in some ways. It leaves each one as a startling and enigmatic mark in your mind for days.However, the first two, especially City of Glass, are wonderful.The third and last, the Locked Room, leaves a little to be desired. As a &quot;tie up&quot; for the first two, I find that the story and conclusion (one in the same) leave something to be desired and, while it does bear the mark of Auster's type of ending... it didn't feel to me like it was the best possible ending."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"When I think about the 2 or 3 days in which I threw myself into this book, unable to pry myself from its grip (e.g. on the first evening I was persuaded to make a ham omelet), I'm reminded of a quote by William Faulkner - an epigraph in Modris Ekstein's book 'Walking since Daybreak:' &quot;There is no such thing as 'was' -only is.&quot; Faulkner's singling out of the semantic &quot;was&quot; is no doubt something Auster would appreciate; but on another level it is revealing of how stories can be powerful and enlightening not for what they tell but for what they carry around with them. For instance,'The New York Trilogy' is brimming with insightful readings of literary figures (Don Quixote), with renderings of well-known stories (by H. James), of legends and biographies - indeed, Whitman, Bahktin, Casper Hauser and Robert Mitchum all make an appearance. The point is that nothing can be told that hasn't in some way been told before; everything has a precedent; &quot;...you know the story already by heart,&quot; Black says to Blue, and in one way that is a prerequisite. The weight of the book, its texture, place, sound all resonate with a &quot;culture&quot; of books and sounds. And yet knowing the story already doesn't take away from its power or brilliance but just the opposite. -dg"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"What a great book! Don't you think the cover should have been a Red spiral three-ring notebook? It's amazing how Auster is able to use similar themes, character names and objects in all of the three stories without having them lose their individual significance and characteristic within each separate story. This is the first Paul Auster book I have read and if his other books are anything like this one I am excited about what I'm in store for. This is a great book to read while commuting on the LIRR or subway into Manhattan. Enjoy!Henry Dark"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Three things remained vivid in my mind after finishing this book. Firstly, we are all detectives trying to spy each other out all the time. Secondly, we are not really who we claim to be because we always keep some secret to ourselves. And lastly, we only truly find ourselves when we become nothing (the bums on the street). The paradox: the truth consists of brilliant insanity."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Spellbinding. Totally sucked me in. Auster is my new favorite, taking over top spot from Delillo.

In \\"Ghost\\" which was my favorite, Blue is living in a world with a mask,(one that the world could accept) and black is his tormented soul, struggling because he was in hiding. At some point Black decides to show himself, but he knows once revealed there is no going back. This story for me revolves around searching for truth, giving up everything in order to do so. Black begins to realize that writing is no longer serving a purpose, \\"This book offers him nothing, there is no story, no plot, no action nothing but a man sitting alone in a room writing a book.\\" Black is killed, does blue live on? He has lost touch with that part of himself, he has thrown it aside for loftier pursuits, at least that is what was implied. Why is this story called 'Ghost'? For me this implies that it is a haunting of sorts, someone who is not whole, who is tormented and who is trying to determine whether their perception of the world is real.Very interesting stories that leave you pondering through out, Highly recommended, but for me deserves another reading."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"First of all the cover painting was so impressive. i know that there are a variety of covers in the same new york trilogies but i like this one the best. the cover made me feel like reading a mystery light novels. of course the Auster's work is definately better than those ones.And also the delivery was fairly good. im currently living in an asia-pacific area so it is sometimes hard to get products from the states. but the amazon didn't disappoint me it took no more than two weeks to get the book in my hands and there was no scratch or any unpleasants regarding the book.Thanks for this wonderful reading experience."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Paul Auster's The New York Trilogy is a masterpiece that should be read by any and all lovers of mystery novels.

It is a ponder upon loneliness and its effect on three men in highly unlikely situations."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I first stumbled upon the NYT when I was in college, over 20 years ago. I found it in a secondhand bookshop and picked it up, never having heard of Paul Auster. The chance encounter is something right out of the novels themselves. I read the whole thing in a weekend and I've thought about it, off and on, ever since. Don't look for some revelatory solution: just read it to see what questions it asks."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I really love Paul Auster's Style which is mixing: absurdism, existentialism and the search for identity and personal meaning in life. In his unique style he does a great job in bringing those elements into stories about life in the modern world."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This is a breathtaking and surreal book. The most interesting aspect to Auster's work is that he frequently haunts a reader for years after he or she finishes one of his novels. These stories do not disappoint and will surely change how one sees writing and the world."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"If you're looking for detective stories, look elsewhere. Auster isn't interested in the classic noirish private eye tale as anything but a way into territory vastly more compelling. Though his three novellas ostensibly revolve around men hired or driven into the pursuit of others, they end up being more about the psychology of the pursuer than the pursued. Surveillance of the self and the collapse of what we assume is our own identity is the abiding theme here, and Auster gives it three fascinating spins with simple plots which quickly spiral to literary altitudes. But don't expect simple resolutions. There are no straightforward answers here. If these were simple issues, they wouldn't justify the exploration Auster gives them. I had the pleasure of reading this immediately prior to Auster's \\"The Art of Hunger\\" (1997), a collection of essays and interviews which reveals, among other things, how \\"The New York Trilogy\\" blends aspects of his autobiography, literary theories and abiding interests into a fascinating work of fiction. Read them together. Then read everything else he's written. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Paul Auster's &quot;New York Trilogy&quot; consists of three seemingly unconnected novellas which though complete in themselves should be read as integral parts of a total literary experience. Unlike a conventional mystery thriller which focuses on the &quot;who done what to whom&quot; aspect of the storyline, Auster turns the table on the reader by taking him on a journey of self discovery past a hall of mirrors which reflect and expose by stages the psyche of the pursuer, not the pursued. The effect is so spooky you want to scream in your head as you encounter the next slice of reality about yourself. Readers familiar with the music of rock star David Bowie will find the reading experience similar to that of listening to his 1977 album &quot;Low&quot;, a dark and creepy introspective piece of work. All three vignettes deal with questions of identity, reality and illusion, the meaning of words and language and explores the fine line between commitment and obsession. Both Quinn in &quot;City of Glass&quot; and the anonymous narrator in &quot;Ghosts&quot; are trapped in their own circumstances and forced to make human choices which lead to their mental breakdown. There is also a noir-like cinematic feel about the trilogy that just begs for this masterful piece of work to be brought to the screen. Auster has produced a highly original post-modern thriller that will mesmerise and enthrall readers for years to come. It is simply superb and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"\\"The New York Trilogy\\", by celebrated author Paul Auster, is made up of 3, somewhat interlinked, long stories which were originately published separately at various times around 1985-86.There is no doubt that Paul Auster is a terrific writer so I won't even get into that aspect of the book.Let's get down to what's really important by trying to pinpoint the subject matter, i.e., what \\"the new york trilogy\\" is really about: in a sense, it's a mystery, in the true sense of the word, because even in the end many questions (most, I dare say) are left unanswered, many stones unturned and many cues are simply left hanging in the air.The NYT has been described as metaphysical detective fiction and the description might in fact prove apt: each of the 3 stories follows the investigations of one man which always turn into an obsession, making the man completely lose touch with the reality. The NYT is thus much about mental processes, we see each of the 3 main chracters gradually become so absorbed by their quest that they lose all sense of proportion and stop thinking like the rest of us.It's also a novel about writing because writing, depicted as the greatest obsession of all, always plays a role in the stories.There is also a definite surreal element in most stories and, quite often, they reminded me of Dino Buzzati's short stories.The author is obviously very pleased with himself, playing with his own name (much like B.E. Ellis does in his recent \\"Lunar Park\\") and toying with the other character's names (which pop up in different stories, alluding to the possibility of a strong link between them all).Did I like the book? As much as it's clever and well-written, it leaves you with a sense of un-completeness, too much stuff remains only vaguely hinted at (I was never one to fall for open-endings. Plus, everything is open here, much more than necessary) and in the ends, the whole thing sound more like an elaborate intellectual game that engaging fiction. Thus, I give the novel 3 stars although this is in no way diminishes my appreciation of the author's talent."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Paul Auster's New York Trilogy is one of the finest books I've read in a long while; it's riveting. Auster is one of my favorite writers, and for those new to his writing The New York Trilogy is a good place to start.Essentially, these three novellas are detective stories with film-noir atmosphere, but the themes Auster tackles go beyond those of your standard spy novel. There are questions of identity, power dynamics, the relationship between the writer and his characters, the relationship between a detective and his suspects.Additionally, this is a wonderfully bookish book; references to Lewis Carroll, Cervantes, etc. abound. There are books within books within books; all the lines that separate reality from writing from fictional reality from fictional writing are blurred, turning the reader inside-out and upside-down as he or she reads.Most importantly, these novellas are highly engaging and evocative. Though Auster's writing has been described as cold and austere, these are compelling stories; it is easy succumb to the swift, gripping narrative.A truly lovely collection, very conceptual, breaks all the rules and wriggles its way out of any genre to which one might try to confine it."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Sometimes (and I don't think I'm alone here), I do judge a book by its cover. At least my interest was piqued when looking at the cover of Paul Auster's New York Trilogy, with its pulp mystery feel. Of course, glancing at a book cover really only gives you a superficial view of what's inside, and sure enough, the New York Trilogy - consisting of the novellas City of Glass, Ghosts and The Locked Room - is only superficially a set of mysteries. Instead, we are given intriguing quests involving the nature of identity and the meaning of our existence; it may sound a bit dull and high-brow, but these stories are actually quite entertaining and thought provoking.City of Glass follows Quinn, a mystery writer who receives a phone call meant for a private eye named Paul Auster. Quinn decides to take on Auster's identity and takes a case involving Peter Stillman, a man whose life is threatened by his father who is about to be released from an insane asylum. Stillman (the son) spent his childhood in complete isolation (hence his father's commitment), and now has trouble grasping who he really is. Quinn has a different sort of identity crisis; after the death of his wife and child, he has pretty much shed his own life and is running on auto-pilot; this void will be filled in unexpected ways when he impersonates Auster. What happens internally to Quinn is the main thrust of the story; the mystery plot is merely the device that drives these internal changes.Ghosts is the tale of Blue, a private investigator hired by White to spy on Black. Blue will take this job very seriously; his surveillance will consume his life as it goes on and on through months and years; Black, however, never seems to do anything significant and White is a figure of mystery, too, willing to pay but never offering any explanations for the job. This is a tale of interlocking identities, with Blue and Black becoming intimately linked.Finally, in The Locked Room, the narrator winds up taking over the life of Fanshawe, his childhood friend who has disappeared. He marries Fanshawe's estranged wife, adopts his child and lives off the income of Fanshawe's writing. This is all done with Fanshawe's implied (and later explicit) permission. For the narrator, however, this is a burden that will threaten to overwhelm him as he learns more and more about his old friend's life.If there is a failing in this book, it's that - despite claims to the contrary - there is nothing distinctly \\"New York\\" about this book. Although it is implied that the city itself would be a sort of character in this trilogy, that is not really the case; I feel these tales could take place in any urban environment with the change of a few place references. This, however, is a minor quibble. Overall, this is a good book, rating a high four stars. If you're looking for a mystery, go elsewhere; if you're looking for a thought-provoking character-driven tale (with a fair share of humor), this will be a good read."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Now that the academic and critic types have found Paul Auster, I guess he'll be lifted out of the general readership and stashed with the rest of the classics on some hoity-toity shelf. Once that &quot;postmodern&quot; labelling starts, it's goodbye accessibility, hello pretension.... Anyway: City of Glass is one of the best constructed stories I've ever read. There is an incredibly complex concentric circle of narrators: there's the author, then the narrator, then his pen name, then his detective character, then his pose as Paul Auster. Then there's the real Paul Auster he meets, not to be confused with the one who's writing the book. Kind of spooky.Also, an English woman once showed me more disturbing information about City of Glass. If you take a city map of New York and mark out the well-described twisting journey of the characters, a picture emerges. What does it mean? With so much description of the streets they travelled, it can't be accidental. I was actually spooked.Unfortunately, I think everything Auster's written since this trilogy has been sliding downhill in quality, and this opinion seems to be shared by friends all around."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"Unfortunately, Paul Auster's unique work, &quot;The New York Trilogy,&quot; is one of those books usually purchased because of word-of-mouth advertising than off-the-shelf interest. The problem with people telling you about this little collection is that you often build a preconceived notion about what to expect from the work, either good, bad, or strange. If a book ever existed that should be read without any prior knowledge of it whatsoever, The New York Trilogy is it.The book - really a collection of three novellas, originally published separately - follows the adventures of three different men on three different pulp-novel-style investigative cases. To give away more plot does the reader a disservice; after all, while one can describe a series of exhibits on a carnival's &quot;Freak Row,&quot; recreating the emotions involved in walking down that alley defies the conventions of language. Language, and its employ, surrounds many of the events in these books. Auster plays with the reader, offering a mystery as engaging as the ones his characters attempt to solve. He scattered the clues throughout the book, but the responsibility of creating meaning from them - and, by extension, from the book - lies solely with the reader.If that seems unfair of Auster to expect of a reader, and too intellectual and highbrow for people interested in a casual experience, &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; contains plenty more to recommend it. The mystery of meaning (provided the postmodernists and their odiously pretentious &quot;scholar&quot;-lapdogs haven't ruined such fun things for you) is an optional part of enjoying this work, and those looking for a great read should not be turned away. Vivid, haunting descriptions of The City (by all means, read this book in New York if you have the chance) mingle with stories that show an obvious awe and respect for film-noir and pulp detective stories. Hopelessness, sorrow, happiness, luck and chance, double-crossing, and redemption all combine to form three solid stories that tickle the mind. One gets the impression that Auster wrote this work almost as a tribute to the noir-pulp style, while attempting to offer the reader another mystery, should the reader desire such a challenge.The seeded subcontext in the book offers quite the literary experiment, and like all experiments it doesn't always work. It usually lies in the background, suggesting its presence, but occasionally comes forward and distracts - and detracts - from the main work itself. In addition, the content matter and strange circumstances might put off those with preconceived ideas (thus, my attempt to say much while revealing little). Auster's &quot;Trilogy&quot; certainly merits a read, although it may not immediately appeal to all sensibilities."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This work is actually a collection of three different stories called \\"City of Glass,\\" \\"Ghosts,\\" and \\"The Locked Room.\\" However, upon finishing the work, it becomes rather obvious why they are all collected into one volume.Let me say this from the outset: If you are a person who very much needs clear closure, this book is not for you. I don't want to get too much into the nuances of the work for fear of spoiling certain elements for a first time reader, but let's just say that this is as much an experimental exploration of theme as it is anything.There were times when I was quite certain that Auster had absolutely no idea what he was doing and where he was going with these stories, and there were other times when I thought I must have been reading the work of a certifiable genius. I believe that was exactly Auster's purpose after having finished reading The New York Trilogy.What else can I say? If you're a reader open to experimental craft, you will love this work; if you're a reader who needs a definite A to Z plot, I'd pass on this if I were you. Frustrated as this book sometimes made me, it was never boring, and it made me think harder than many books I've read of late. I believe I'm a better writer (and reader) for having experienced it.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"This trilogy of novels, or two novellas and a short story, as it should rightly be called, should be made essential reading for 1. Anyone travelling to New York in the near future, and 2. Anyone who would like to feel free of the realist grip that most literary fiction has been in, with some periods of upheaval, for far too long now. Auster makes the term 'post-modern' reader-friendly; after all, what is wrong with the author referring to himself as a fictitious character within his or her own work (even when he goes as far as introducing you to his home and meeting his wife)? This Auster does on various occasions in these loosely linked pseudo detective fictions, cramming in themes and obsessions such as the impulse to tell stories (within stories) and to get away from modern life, Hamsun-like, to go back to the roots of nature and language. But it's not done in any way that could be called pretentious. Auster is not interested in describing human features or writing two paragraphs (or six) on how a room looks; he is more interested in drawing parallels and trying to fix why something is where it is. Identity is his main concern, and within the parabola of his narrow range of reference points (Paris, the native American legacy, working on ships, New York, coincidences) he twists and turns with it as dexterously as Borges. Suffice to say that the three stories involve coincidence and searches passim. The initial story, City of Glass, about a writer who becomes a detective on an infuriating mission to find a man for a woman after a misdialled telephone call, appears again in the other stories both as himself and as a reflection of other characters engaged in looking for other mysterious characters. The point of the middle story, Ghosts, only becomes clear when you get to the end of the last, The Locked Room, by which time you have to go back and read the whole thing again (with pleasure). In the meantime you've been taken on the kind of existential, mythical journey that dignifies detective fiction well beyond its seeming limitations. It's fascinating to read how Auster has consistently used his real-life experiences (not all that exceptional on the face of it), to create such compulsive fiction, and you can get a lot of this from his autobiography, Hand To Mouth. It was inevitable that he would move into film-making one day, and his Lulu On The Bridge, has not disappointed (Smoke and Blue in The Face were worthy apprenticeships which he mainly scripted and had some directorial involvment in).Probably even better than NYT are Moon Palace and Leviathan."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"In Auster's seminal work he demonstrates his incredible understanding, his deep comprehension of both the City of New York and of human nature. The book is in three parts, and they are distinct. Yet each part is only a part of the inner nightmare that makes up the story of one who is hiding. The three together make a whole; completing the message of his thoughts.The book takes the form of a detective story. The first part/book is about a man hired as a private detective to watch a man. He is hired to watch this man because he is a threat to those who hired him. They live in fear that this man will come after them and kill them. He goes so far as to hide out in an alley for months, watching, waiting to see when the man will come. Yet he never does.The second part/book is a more abstract version of the first. Rather than use actual names for the characters, they are instead called by colors; Blue, Gray, Green, Violet, etc. As he moves through this story and the entire book, he shows his mastery of the knowledge of the City of New York in ways that most of us only contemplate. He shows the lives of beggars, strangers, non-existent personages; that yet do exist in form and touch and shadow, but never truly interact in a real and tangible way with anyone that they meet.In his third part/book, things start to fall into place. We find a man who is living in an almost dream state. He goes through life without really touching it; without really tasting it; without really feeling it. He goes on a search, a journey to find another. And when he does not find him, he tries to forget and go back to his life.But throughout, we see a man hiding. He hides from everything. He hides from people and things. He tries to rationalize this hiding in many ways. Yet, he is not totally able to do so. Not until he realizes, that he is hiding from himself. Only then does he understand that his quest was self made. Then he understands that one can disappear within oneself for as long as one wants; forever in fact. Because one can fear no one or no thing more than one can fear oneself. To lie to yourself is the ultimate lie, to hide from yourself is the ultimate disappearance. This message is what Auster so ably conveys in his \\"New York Trilogy.\\" And the City of New York is truly a magical and wondrous place to illustrate his point. It is in this City that those who hide from themselves are so plentiful and obvious. It is also in this City that those of true greatness come to fruition. Auster's book is recommended for all readers who have a great desire and sense of introspection; a desire to understand those things that they try to hide from, yet cannot. It will surely live on as one of his greatest works, and a superb example of modern fiction."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I read this book because I loved Paul Aster's Brooklyn Follies. This compilation of 3 short stories may have well been written by a completely different author. They are short detective stories that are slightly intertwined. I did not enjoy this book and do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I like to give you a little impression of my opinion about Paul Auster's book &quot;City of Glass&quot;. We were supposed to read it in the 13.form as a part of our main topic &quot;detective stories&quot;.It took us some time but it was more interesting than the other books we read in this year(Macbeth, Of Mice and Men). When you have read this book you get a closer look into the world's different identities and those of its citizen.In Paul Auster's clever piece of work &quot;City of Glass&quot; fiction and reality is mixed up. The theme of chance is like in other works of Auster seen as the main topic of the story. Daniel Quinn, normally an author, who lost his family, is mixed up with Paul Auster and so starts to become a detective. During the story it is not obvious which identity the protagonist uses and who he will be next. The order of actions is unpredictable.Paul Auster created a novel which is extraordinary and which will be kept in mind by every one who read it.I would everybody give the advice to read this book because of its postmodernist style which suits very well to our time."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"The book tries to be too smart while it isn't. It wants to become a sophisticated literature game but it fails. I liked other Auster's books (Music of Chance,Vertigo, The Book of Illusions) but you just can't love that book because you understand it only partly and you can't like the characters."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"When I was an English grad-student in the 90's, there was a certain kind of guy I observed who loved language passionately, a word-geek, you know? Pale, fastidious, carrying his fountain pen or carafe of espresso with him everywhere he went, along with his worn copy of \\"Ulysses,\\" he either went the Ph.D. route or decided to write, in which case he went from MFA workshop to writing fellowship, bouncing from place to place every year or so, aspiring to semi-permanence as an instructor somewhere. Sensitive, intelligent, aware of his lack of machismo, he relied on words as a weapon, and as his 20's turned to 30's, his troubles increased, for now he was the impoverished writer/student type, while the extroverted, less-idealistic types had the wives and homes and you get the picture. For the aspiring male writer, in my opinion, the subconscious sense of suspended adulthood and marginalized masculinity could sometimes be acute; pushing 40 in an elite fellowship, where he was paid a stipend to finish his novel, the one he'd started in his 20's about a boy saddened by his parents' divorce, say, he was in a dangerous place: rootless, essentially without life experience and family responsibilities, without knowledge of work or craft beyond academia, coddled yet deprived by its protective culture, his work ironically de-potentated by its paternalism.Very often, this type of guy showed certain preferences in his work: his stories might have \\"tough\\" male types, like those from noir films, expressions of his desire to be active in the world and streetwise and tough; very often his stories would begin with a male character who'd lost his wife and child, conveniently making the character sympathetic, by giving him a back story, an explanation for his current state of almost autistic insularity, while also protecting the writer from having to write about such things. The writer now had to compensate for many weaknesses in his work due to his lack of life experience, compounded perhaps by his innate introversion, love of words, sensitivities, etc., and so, in lieu of real human interaction, his main character might spend a lot of time smoking cigarettes, visiting \\"blowsy tarts\\" or doing something shocking (!) like sitting on the toilette. (Oh, I'm sure Auster spawned \\"Fight Club\\" at the very least.) A story could be written in such a way that if, for example, the setting was New York, someone who'd never been there and was only referencing a map, could do it. Then he'd display his one true strength in a bit of aggressive word-play, going philosophical with puns and ideas about language and its limits. Professors of creative writing, jaded in appetite, likewise insulated, seemed to especially approve of violence or sexual perversion to spice-up those intellectual interludes.Any of this ring a bell? Auster's work here jogged my memory of this smart yet developmentally-delayed male type, so aware of his sensitivity that he resorts to images of violent masculinity and portrayals of women as mommies. Mommy, the desire to return to infancy. The death instinct. All of which is not to say that his work is not compulsively readable here; it is a test-case for the effectiveness of suspense as a device within plot, carrying the reader along against her will. But I feel cheated, and I don't like to be so tightly controlled by a writer's agenda. I prefer a messier aesthetic, an excess of consciousness and life, as one gets in Proust or Shakespeare, spilling over the edges, as one gets in much good non-fiction, the letters of Van Gogh, for example. The coolest thing about these novellas, I think, is how Auster came up with an analogy to describe the writer's paradox, the writer's problem, in his angry deconstruction of the mystery genre--how someone temperamentally a writer, who craves solitude necessary to write, who believes that real life is the internal life of thoughts and emotions, can somehow perform the alchemy necessary to create fiction with its demands for action in the physical world, for plot, for drama. That's what I love best about this schizoid, paranoid, hermetic, manipulative, redundant and disingenuous trilogy. But I still want more life------!"},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"What I like about Paul Auster is just that I think plot is not really play an important part in his book (am I right?) ....Most of his works is Just about a confuse guy wondering around in search of something. A cliche theme even for a postmodern work. But Auster is a fun author to read.My fav. page is 7.And a nice choice of number indeed to start it all."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"We were suposed to read &quot;City of Glass&quot; out of Auster's NEW YORK TRILOGY in our English advanced class. I believe the mystery of chance and the multiple personalities of the protagonist are crucial for Austers first detective story. The well chosen setting fits perfectly into the plot. Auster writes about an isolated , lonely writer at the mid-thirty, who has pleasant success in writing detective stories. Just by accident the protagonist gets the opportunity to solve an obscure case as an pseudo-detetective. It is easy to follow the plot, but somehow the reader happens to mix up the charachters. But you will never be bored while reading it, even though there are parts of the story wiht not much suspense."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"When you read a book and whatever you are reading doesn't say anything is a waist of time, half of this book is written that way, maybe the stories are good, but when you read and read and nothing happen or explain things that you already know (Like all the names of the streets in NY city) I said that the grass is to green, why? Because everybody knows that the grass is green, you don't have to read it in a book, reading these kind of \\"grass\\" makes the story boring and you don't want to know what will happen in the real story of the book, this is a really waste of time, paper and money for this book."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I was very excited during the first fifty or so pages of \\"City of Glass\\", but at around the midpoint all of the interesting ideas that had been introduced ceased to develop further. In fact, nothing else really happened at all and I never got any answers or conclusion. I feel that it was not so much a story as a practical joke on the reader. Perhaps real literature isn't necessarily supposed to satisfy. Well I'm satisfied with \\"City of Glass\\" anyway. At least I know who I won't be reading any more of."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I havn't read the book yet but I did receive it in the amount of time stated and in good condition."},{"Title":"The New York Trilogy","review":"I just finished the first book of this series and enjoyed it. I wanted to get the other two, and thought the Kindle edition would be a nice way. $9.99 for it? A NEW paperback is 89 cents more. And I can give it to my mom/girlfriend/co-worker endless times...Amazon, you need to fix this stupid pricing model.---------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED:Gosh, now that Penguin has gone batty, the $9.99 was a deal, hunh? I would have reviewed the book initially, but it took me a long time to track down a used paper copy.For as much as I enjoyed City of Glass, the other two stories were a repetition of the same theme... I quickly grew tired of the \\"color\\" gimmick of Ghosts, and the story offered little else. The final story about Fanshawe might have been interesting, but it wasn't... it dragged on. And since the \\"point\\" of the story is the same as the first two stories, you're slogging through the writing to reach a place you've already been.Each story trades on the tension that is created by your anticipation of what is going to happen... And then nothing does. It's brilliant once, but reading the entire trilogy is like going to a magic show where the magician does the same trick over and over again for two hours. It ceases to be entertaining.I enjoyed the stories enough to read another Paul Auster at some point in the future... But since I do my reading on a Kindle and Penguin has decided they hate Kindle users, it will be only if I happen to stumble across one in a used book store. If I read a book I love, I usually read everything the author has... This was not a book I loved. This was a book that maybe kinda was good. I don't feel any need to run out and get 2 more books by Auster. There were things I liked about it, but the overall experience of reading this book is draining and dreary.If I had it to do all over again, I would have skipped this entirely and gone with the Graphic Novel version of City of Glass."},{"Title":"The family at Caldicott Place","review":"This is an excellent children's book set in England in the 1960s.

This book does a good job of getting you into the minds of the writers from the past but little for the writer himself. I had a hard time distinguishing then the journal ended and his dialog began. What the book lacked for me was the writers own narrative, it was like taking a journey back in time with strangers."},{"Title":"The Adjustable Area Man-To-Man Press","review":"First let me say a little about the author. I own five books by Burral Paye. I also own over 60 videos and 30 books on coaching basketball. Coach Paye pays attention to detail like no other. Things which you and I may take for granted are included in every book of Paye's I have read. With this let me say a little about the book listed. As usual Coach Paye is very thorough. The system is based on a sound philosophy. Any coach using this system needs to have it in place at lower levels of his program. Without this it would be difficult to teach the whole system. Though many parts of this sytem can be implemented in a single season. Coach Paye also addresses this in his book. If you are a pressing coach and have a good feeder program this book will be a valuable resource."},{"Title":"The Adjustable Area Man-To-Man Press","review":"I have read a couple of hundred books on coaching basketball and don't want to count the number of tapes and DVD's I have purchased and watched. There is no doubt that Burrall Paye is a great coach who pays attention to every detail in what goes on in his program, with his teams, and his system of play.The pressing defense described in this book is an excellent one because it allows so much flexibility. It can be a very safe press that is designed to bend but not break and allows the opponent to make mistakes. It can be very aggressive and force action. It can also be a great way to control the tempo of the game.Coach Paye does an excellent job of not only detailing all of the rules, options, and possibilities of this press, but how to teach the big picture concepts and the individual skills required to run it.The only drawback with the press is the complex nature of it. That has more to do with the book getting a rating of 4-stars and not five than the actual writing, clarity of the text and diagrams used to present the concepts.This is a press that, I think, has to be introduced in its simplest form in middle school and then the additional layers added each year as the players move up in the program.Still, all-in-all, a good book and a good system. It is worth buying and reading if only to get ideas for your own defensive system.Kevin Sivils - author of Game Strategy and Tactics for BasketballGame Strategies and Tactics for Basketball: Bench Coaching for Success"},{"Title":"Mosby's Essential Sciences for Therapeutic Massage: Anatomy, Physiology, Biomechanics and Pathology","review":"This book came in a very timely manner and was in very good condition.

Disillusioned to discover that traditional medical doctors offered only the vaguest assurances that her breast cancer would probably not recur, Johnson felt inspired to seek out healers who consider all aspects of an individual (not just the physical) when they heal. Beginning with tips Johnson received from the Native Americans she'd interviewed for her previous book, Johnson discovered a wonderfully diverse group of healers working with shamanic soul retrieval, alchemy, intuition, yoga, Kahuna, Australian Aboriginal, chiropractic, water, musical, and psychic surgery methods.THE BRAZILIAN HEALER WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE is so fascinating and well-written that I found it impossible to set down, as Johnson devoted a chapter to each of sixteen gifted healers. Here are healers who can see inside peoples' physical and energy bodies with ease -- at times performing miraculous healings. Photos are shown of most of the healers, including one woman healer who comes out of her healing trances to find gold-like metal flakes on her body, an Aboriginal man who works with \\"love, light, crystals, and energy,\\" and men who remove cancerous lumps and cataracts from their patients -- often with nothing more than a kitchen knife.Johnson's open-minded skepticism is refreshing; even as she feels certain she's gone \\"down the rabbit hole,\\" she retains her journalistic common sense and composure to ask these healers how they heal. The healers Sandy Johnson visited include: Sandra Ingerman, Katie Engelhart, Howard Wills, Vianna Stibal, Virginia Ellen, Milton Trager, Gary Brownlee, Auntie Margaret, Warren Barigian, Gerry Bostock, Dr. Ruth Ziemba, Peter Maxwel, Rubens Faria, and John of God.Whether you are considering enlisting aid from a holistic healer, or are just curious to read stories that prove truth is stranger than fiction -- THE BRAZILIAN HEALER WITH THE KITCHEN KNIFE will satisfy and delight. I give this book my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Brazilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife: And Other Stories of Mystics, Shamans, and Miracle Makers","review":"I just about gulped down Sandy Johnson's latest book, &quot;The Brasilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife&quot;. I couldn't put it down once I'd opened the covers. Clearly the author made an amazing internal and external journey in order to write the book. She gives the reader a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look into the world of healing and healers. Any skeptic who reads the book may well question his/her belief system, yet the writer was even handed in covering the subject."},{"Title":"The Brazilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife: And Other Stories of Mystics, Shamans, and Miracle Makers","review":"Sandy begins with a skeptical view of spiritual healing, not unlike many of us who view this practice with suspicion. Her journey leads her from the city to the jungle, seeking to understand the meaning of \`healing' and the methods of these mysterious healers.She does not try to convince us that we need to change our beliefs, nor does she instruct us on how to go about a search of our own. This is a task performed by hundreds of other books on the subject written for the already convinced. Rather, Sandy gently takes our hand and introduces us to the wonders she experiences.I feel like I know these people now; both the healers and the healed. I've seen their love, their mystery, and their character. After reading the book I feel differently about healing. Even if I should opt to use the \`men in white coats' should I need them, it will be with a new understanding of the roles of the men, the medicines, and my spirit in the healing process.This is an excellent book.

I just wanted to keep running through it. The narrative simply zips forward at a headlong pace. The writing is crisp, clear, to the point, and never wanders into unrelated territory. More important, these healers and mystics seemed real to me, for the first time. This book may change your mind about this sort of healing process."},{"Title":"The Brazilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife: And Other Stories of Mystics, Shamans, and Miracle Makers","review":"Johnson has accumulated a number of fascinating stories regarding healers whose patients are actually healed. Their modalities are pretty far out, but who is to say that God must be stereotyped? I enjoyed all of the stories and having once been a program director for a holistic health center, I can attest that there is plausibility in all of these stories. Over the years and from my experiences and research, a healer is only a conduit. The patient actually heals him/her self. It is written: \\"It is done unto you as you believe.\\" If the modality of healing is accepted by the patient, then the patient is healed. If the sickness re-occurs, then doubt and fear was allowed to come in. It is not the healer who failed, it is the lack of acceptance. The traditional medical modalities are rife with physicians who tell a patient they have only so many months, years to live and this is in effect, condemning the patient to death if the patient accepts the verdict. Medical schools have no idea about true healings. Pharmaceuticals are not the answer.

It is engaging, interesting reading. But it is a bit thin, which is frustrating. It would be a better book if she had gone into more depth about each healer. Nevertheless, I am glad she has written what she has. The more information about extraordinary people like these, the better."},{"Title":"The Brazilian Healer with the Kitchen Knife: And Other Stories of Mystics, Shamans, and Miracle Makers","review":"While this book is an easy and entertaining read, there is no substance to it.

Alcala's language is clear, evocative and, at times, heart-wrenching as she tells this story of diaspora, lost family connections and personal discovery. One of the most moving chapters (titled, &quot;The Girl in the Closet&quot;) is Alcala at her best as she captures the almost overwhelming fears of a woman beaten down by the sexual transgressions of her employer: &quot;If I just stay here, I will be fine. Before I shut the door, I got a box of crackers from the kitchen, so I will be fine.&quot; This is a powerful novel."},{"Title":"The Flower in the Skull: A Novel","review":"In Flower in the Skull we see three generations of women trying to adapt to their sorroundings and at the same time make sense of their past.

The author has obviously gone to great lengths to make this story true to that era.Bright, bold and independent, Lady St Claire finds herself embroiled not only in a hunt for a dangerous madman, but becoming enmeshed in a deepening affection for the reluctant prostitute she rescues. Together they become a formidable team risking their lives to stop a man bent on murder.What starts out as an inquiry in retrieving some errant love letters soon takes Lina into Whitechapel at the start of the \\"Jack the Ripper\\" murders. Rescuing Rhiannon and assuring her safety at her home, Lina's determination soon uncovers a disturbing link to the murders. She and Rhiannon join forces with Sherringford Pike an investigative detective and begin a journey into the dark side of love and infatuation.Having long been a Sherlock Holmes fan, I found this a welcome addition to that tradition. The characters are finely fleshed out and their interactions witty and enjoyable. A refreshing read with women both passionate and intelligent, and a plot filled with twists and turns that keep you turning the page."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"This enjoyable effort involves a titled lesbian detective, a prostitute with a heart of gold and Jack the Ripper. It also includes sly references that any Holmesian will relish - \\"Dr. Ormond Sacker\\" and \\"Sherrinford\\" Pike are central to the plot (Conan Doyle considered both as names for his characters before wisely deciding on Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes).While I found that the main characters developed feelings for each other far too quickly for believability, I thought that otherwise they were fully dimensional characters with interesting, if slightly convenient, backstories (the noblewoman with the unconsummated marriage, the educated prostitute forced into her profession by her father's suicide). I also appreciated the author's great attention to historical detail - anyone familiar with 19th century literature will find much to enjoy here.The story's climax is particularly well-written and exciting. However, the author relies on an unfortunate plot device to bring the tale to its climax - one of the protagonists does something so thoughtless and out of character that it actually is jarring.Despite its minor flaws, I recommend Black By Gaslight. I cared about the characters, the plot moved briskly, the atmosphere was spot-on, and the ending was satisfying."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"I read some of the author's online stories before buying this book and are far from being disappointed about my purchase.Nene Adams created two very interesting characters who lived in a time when society was shaped through strict rules and women didn't get the credit they deserved because they were 'just' women.The author's description of this time and of the society is very well drafted. I understand that she has done a lot of research about the background and the language of this time.And on top of it, the plot concerning the mystery is adding another view of the unsolved 'Jack the Ripper' riddle and is brilliant as well.In fact, this is a story which triggers the reader's interest about the time of this age as much that I bought a map of the old London to be able to see where the two heroines moved around.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which has it all: it's a history, mystery and love story. And the second book in this series already sits on my nightstand to be enjoyed as well."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"Black by Gaslight is one of those books where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The two protagonists, Lina and Rhiannon, are excellently drawn. Both of them, interestingly enough, possess deep flaws that cause them to act against their best interests; as is typical for the Holmes-and-Watson genre dynamic, consulting detective Lina has both the more extraordinary qualities and the deeper flaws and weaknesses, while Rhiannon is the more centered and grounded personality. The Jack-the-Ripper mystery is interesting, particularly in its spin-off details that lead the heroines into the case (I also appreciate the author's note at the beginning stating flatly that Ms. Adams was not going to delve into the field of Ripperology to provide a new theory on the real-life case--something that would have been an intense distraction in a first book in a series). The romance side of things is also well-maintained, with emotional and sexual tension between the heroines running high through their alternate points of view early on, then developing into an open relationship which presents them with different emotional issues. Unlike a previous reviewer, I find Rhiannon's actions provoking the end completely in character and growing naturally out of the relationship issues between herself and Lina, but what annoyed me about it was that the point was never addressed between the two characters when all was said and done.Where the novel does run into trouble is not in the main story but around the fringes. A subplot concerning the interference of the Political Powers that Be in the case serves little purpose other than to give the heroines a chance to overemote and provide an excuse for why, at the end, the identity of the Ripper is not publicly revealed--it eats pages and is distracting and annoying. The major supporting characters, Sherrinford Pike and Dr. Ormond Sacker (the names are Conan Doyle's \\"first draft\\" versions of Holmes and Watson) are just plain irritating. They have sufficiently independent personalities, especially Pike, to clearly not be direct analogues of Holmes and Watson (Pike's antic sense of humor sets him far apart from the icily logical Holmes, among many other things), and yet Ms. Adams does give them both just enough of their literary forbears to make them into a distraction. When the story includes both a solid suspense tale and an involving romance, it does not need to include what amounts to a private game of Spot-The-Holmesian-Reference between author and reader. Things would be better served to simply let Pike be Pike; he's at his best when he and Lina are scoring points off one another in their part-friend, part-mentor/pupil, part-rival relationship. Still, when most of the complaints one can direct against a book are focused on the fringe areas, it is definitely a good sign; Lina and Rhiannon's adventures provide better gaslit suspense than most of the latter-day Holmes pastiches combined with better romance than much of what I've read in the lesbian subgenre."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"Not realizing that Gaslight was a series by Nene Adams, I purchased Curse of the Jade Dragon. After reading a few pages, I decided to put it down and order the first in the series, Black by Gaslight. What a wonderful thriller. Ms. Adams continuously teases her audience with the perpetual cliffhanger after most chapters making it almost impossible to put the novel down. While the doldrums of \\"she loves me, she loves me not\\" was tedious at best, the story itself was nail-biting; my heart was literally pounding throughout the stunning conclusion. Finally, because the Gaslight series takes place in the late 1880s, there is no danger of modern technologies interfering with the narrative from first novel through fourth. Well read."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"The year is 1888, the place is Whitechapel, London. Set during the reign of terror caused by Jack the Ripper murdering prostitutes.

Lina is a \\"modern\\" woman, wealthy enough to live life on her terms in a world were women are meant to be wives and mothers and little else. Saving Rhiannon from Jack sends them on an adventure that leads to danger and discovery across several continents (across 4 novels). Holmes & Watson appear (in a way...) in the novels as secondary characters as friends, confidantes and teachers. I found them (Black by Gaslight, Madonna of the Sorrows, The Witch's Kiss, and The Jade Dragon) to be well written and hard to put down. Mystery, romance, intrigue...all seamlessly woven into the backdrop of Victorian England. This first novel will leave you wanting more - fortunately, there are 3 more after that. Unfortunately, there are only 3 more after that. They each stand alone but do build on the previous novels so start with Black by Gaslight."},{"Title":"Black by Gaslight","review":"The only down side to reading this book is that there are not nearly enough titles available by this extraordinarily talented writer."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"I have a number of chronic, treatment-resistant conditions that had brought me to the brink of complete disability and despair. I started listening to these CDs and, within a few short months, my health had taken a decided turn for the better. Like nothing else, they have helped me tap into and mobilize my body's ability to heal itself.I consider these CDs so essential to my health and well-being that I rarely go a day without listening to at least one of them. I credit my ability to cope with the ups and downs of the illnesses with which I struggle almost entirely to these CDs. And I love them! I never tire of hearing them. What a small price to pay for something I know I'll be benefitting from for many, many years."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"Whether you're an experienced meditator or a mere beginner, these CDs deliver what they promise - very deep meditative states, just by listening. And they get progressively deeper as you go from CD 1 to CD 5.Based on brainwave entrainment technology that has been around in one form or another for almost half a century (W. Gray Walter's light entrainment experiments in the 50s, William S. Burroughs and Byron Gysin's Dreammachine in the 60's, Robert Monroe's Binaural Beat tapes in the 70's) it has the reputuation of also being considered high tech at the same time. This technology has been around longer than the personal computer! I would simply call it mainstream - ready to come out into the light.Dane Spotts has treated this set of 5 CDs like a software product - they come in a bright, colorful box, like something you'd see on the shelf in a computer store. And why not? It IS software - for the mind.If you are a long time meditator, doing different things from time to time helps to keep you from getting stuck in your meditation practice - keeps it lively and interesting.There are other brainwave entrainment products out there - check 'em all out. But I think you'll agree with me that this set is top of the line with regards to quality and performance."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"I have done a lot of research on stress reduction programs going back to the early 70's. I have taken the Silva program, meditation training and purchased numerous CD and Tape programs over the years. Based on that experience I can say that the Ultra Meditation program delivers what it promises. Within minutes of starting the first CD you will find yourself totally relaxed and at peace. As you move through the set you will find yourself going into deeper meditative states and will find that you are calmer and more focused during the rest of your day. I would give this series a big thumbs up."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"I bought these CDs after they were recommended by a business associate. I had heard about the benefits of experiencing extended altered states and the early development of binaural beat technologies, but I was not prepared for the amazing results that I achieved with the Ultra Meditation series. The set is a multi-level progressive program which requires you to spend at least thirty days on one CD before progressing to the next higher level. Beneficial effects that I felt after the first week of use included increased energy levels (I required less sleep per night to feel fully rested - which with my busy schedule is a great help to me.) And the big one: REDUCED STRESS. Many &quot;problems&quot; that I used to dwell on or needlessly worry about (I have been called a worry wort) were suddenly washed away. Then there are intangibles about the experience that must be witnessed to believe. I have often seen spectacular light shows, with my eyes closed, during the meditation process, while the sounds feel like they are moving throughout my head, bringing my entire body, every muscle to deep state of relaxation. It is the single most relaxing experience I have ever felt. I never hesitate to recommend this product to business partners, friends and family."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"New Age drivel? I think not. Meditation is as old as mankind, and an essential practice for anyone seeking to reduce stress in today's modern world. I have had these CD's for a few years now, and they have been an excellent resource for combating stress and tension. I was very impressed by the quality of the audio recordings, and find the CD's to be quite relaxing. The CD's help me to organize my thoughts, solve perplexing challenges, and clear my mind of distractions. I would definitely recommend these CD's to anyone interested in stress reduction.My only caveat? You have to commit to listening to the CD's on a regular basis. They only work if you actually invest the time to listen to them on a regular basis. You have to actually work at it - But the work is fun, enjoyable, and relaxing, and doesn't require much effort on your part other than setting aside some quiet time every day to meditate. Good stuff."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"I was introduced to this CD set by a friend in my one of my yogic groups who played the CD's for us during some of our group meditations.

None of these are guided meditations. CD #1 has a sound frequency that can get you into a very deep meditative state. There is a lot of backround sound like water and bells but just focus on the hummmm. Concentrate on your 3rd eye forehead center (ajna for yoga experts) and lie on your back. See my review o the book \\"Methods of Psychic Development\\". Use the 2 together for peaceful deep states of consciousness. I have tried the other 4 CDs and I don't get as good results with them as with CD #1. CD #1 can get you into the Theta brain wave resonance which is where you want to be for brain refreshment and positive psychic experiences. I feel it's worth the money. If you don't try to concentrate a little on your ajna center you might miss the benefit."},{"Title":"Ultra Meditation: 5-Level Transcendence System - (5 cd set + user guide)","review":"and I bought a lot.

Fortunately I had borrowed them. I could not get beyond level one, which is replete with New Age drivel and gobbledygook that shows that the author has no concept of how the human mind or emotional system function. The more I listened, the more irritating it became. I would have been enraged had I wasted good money on this product. It's an exercise in New Age stupidity."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"This book probably will not appeal to the ardently politically correct. They would recoil at the concept of not only a novel with Adolf Hitler as the central character, but also the fact that this book is very funny indeed.I laughed out loud a number of times reading this novel. Bainbridge's humour is devastatingly ironic. The novel follows a twenty three year old Adolf Hitler as he blunders his way through a stay in Liverpool in 1912 with his brother Alois and his Irish wife Bridget. Because of the humour, the reader can at times find themselves with a degree of sympathy for the rather hapless and paranoid Adolf. Whenever that happens, however, Bainbridge hits you again with a subtle turn of irony that lets you feel justifiable contempt for him. In short, this Hitler is a loser -- a future powerful figure cut down to size. Without wanting to give anything away, Bainbridge also explains why Hitler had that odd moustache -- &quot;He [Adolf] resolved to grow a moustache. Never again would he be mistaken for a woman.&quot; Very funny, believe me!This is a wonderful read that will certainly be appreciated by those with an interest in history and a sense of humour about it all."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"William Patrick Hitler was born in Liverpool where he lived with his Parents. One indeed was Alois Hitler the half brother of Adolph. With this book Ms. Beryl Bainbridge stepped into what could have been controversial ground. Historically based fiction is a familiar foundation for her work, and this one is excellent.In, \\"Young Adolph\\", the Author imagines a trip he might have taken to visit his brother in Liverpool when he was 23 years of age. To the extent there is humor in the work it is at the expense of her subject who on his best day does not rise above pathetic, and when drunk becomes a raging lunatic. If this sounds familiar it should, as the Hitler of History was so painfully ordinary it is almost beyond belief he did not die on the street during one of his homeless periods.The Author brings about several events that are not earth shattering until you place them in the context of the Evil that was to be Hitler. Some are relatively minor as when we learn how his ridiculous hairstyle came about. However Ms. Bainbridge also hypothesizes where some of the events and practices that later would shake the world and resonate to today, may have started.The book is as interesting as many Historical Works I have read about this genocidal maniac, and in some ways it carries with it more impact than scholarly studies of the creature. When portrayed as he has been presented here, the horror he becomes and unleashes on a good portion of the world, is either amazing or terrifying and probably both. An evil genius would be an understandable character, however such an unlikely character that History elevated to one of the great mass murderers of the 20th Century is as far from genius as language allows. And this is what Ms. Bainbridge illustrates so well in this work."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"A grim, bizarre little novel with no sympathetic characters. Adolf bears scant resemblance to his real-world namesake. Except for certain cute allusions to the future F&uuml;hrer -- we learn where the brown shirts, the weird hairstyle, and the toothbrush moustache come from, for example -- Adolf might as well be a completely fictional young sap. The plot is haphazard. For some reason a bleak, Dickensian underworld figures prominently without significantly altering or influencing Adolf other than requiring him to do a lot of fleeing.Bainbridge's gift for depicting menace and squalor are put to much better use in her novel Watson's Apology."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"I have very serious doubts that basic fact of this book is historical, but as a fiction this book is very good"},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"Pre-World War I Adolph Hitler is a total incompetant. Young Adolph comes to Liverpool to live with his brother Alois &amp; his Irish wife. He is to helps his brother in his new business. But he cannot do anything right. He is depressed &amp; paranoid. A total loser. It is a funny book, fiction yet chilling because we all know what really happened."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"One of the benefits of writing fiction is that it can be stocked with characters which derive their existence solely from the author's imagination. Writing about real people on the other hand should impose certain restrictions upon the author. The biographical approach may well require preparation and research, to arrive at as close an approximation as possible. Alternatively, a historical figure may feature in a novel, as for example, Charles de Gaulle in \\"The Day Of The Jackal\\".Adolf Hitler has featured ad nauseam in both categories, but this book is a hybrid. It's based on the premise that in 1912 he came to stay in Toxteth, Liverpool, with his half-brother Alois. This claim has been the subject of thorough investigation, and exposed as untrue, but if Miss Bainbridge knows this she ain't letting on (and if she don't, she should). Instead, she's produced a fictional concoction about a real person, masquerading as fact. This conceit might be justified if the result cast new light upon Hitler's character and motivation, but sadly that is not the case (indeed, how could it be?). I was left feeling that both her writing, and my reading of it, had been a sterile exercise."},{"Title":"Young Adolf: Complete & Unabridged (Soundings)","review":"This was a strange little story set in Liverpool, England before the outbreak of the Great War when young Adolf was 23 years old. It is based on the little-known \\"fact\\" that Hitler visited his half brother in England from November 1912 to April 1913. The book was definitely imaginative but too fictitious to be taken seriously. Don't expect to learn much about the young Hitler from this book."},{"Title":"The Mystery of Love and Marriage","review":"A fascinating look at relationships that draws from Martin Buber's concepts of I and Thou.

It is although an anthology of feminist science fiction stories.If you aren't interested at all in the Tiptree award and how it was established, or likewise with WisCon and convention stuff like that, you will probably want to be interested in the stories to get it.However, there is a range of non-fiction writing here from the anecdotal and amusing to the very dry academic, including a long reminiscence by Judith Merril, and a letter exchange between an Australian academic and Lois McMaster Bujold about her books.It is basically completely focused on the USA, barring a little about some early UK female fans, despite being edited by Australians, so if you are looking for a 'more inclusive' look at the subject, you will likely be disapointed with that aspect.The cover is pretty cool, if you think Eternity in Marvel comics, but in a bodysuit, not a cape and a long haired woman you will get the idea.The stories here are reasonable - a 3.36 average, but the obviously are not the whole point of the exercise.Certainly a book that is worth a look for those with more than a casual interest in SF, and obviously worth it for those with an interest in feminist SF.Women Of Other Worlds : The Small Black Box of Morality - Eleanor ArnasonWomen Of Other Worlds : And She Was the Word - Tess WilliamsWomen Of Other Worlds : And Salome Danced - Kelley EskridgeWomen Of Other Worlds : The Kidnapping of Baroness 5 - Katherine MacLeanWomen Of Other Worlds : Home by the Sea - Elisabeth VonarburgWomen Of Other Worlds : A Habit of Waste - Nalo HopkinsonWomen Of Other Worlds : Excerpt from The Freedom Maze - Delia ShermanWomen Of Other Worlds : Hush My Mouth - Suzette Haden ElginWomen Of Other Worlds : The Universe of Things - Gwyneth JonesWomen Of Other Worlds : The Marianas Islands - Karen Joy FowlerWomen Of Other Worlds : Dvorzjak Symphony - Candas Jane DorseyEat the ethics.3.5 out of 5Dictionary diversion proves overly patriotic.3.5 out of 5Actor authentic in any role you like.4 out of 5Tech witch pig project purloining recovery.3.5 out of 5Working with artificial limitations.3 out of 5Thanksgiving slingshot surprise.4 out of 5Southern sendback sojourn.3 out of 5Southern New Africa's silent Babel problem.Alienated mechanic.3 out of 5Submarine secret.3 out of 5Inside occupation.3 out of 5"},{"Title":"Writing to Survive: The Private Notebooks of Conrad Richter","review":"In the late 1980s,while attending the University of New Mexico, I found myself in Harvena Richter's creative writing class. This book, written by her and based on her father's private notebooks, was our text. And what a text! Containing insights into how a writer's mind works, where to look for inspiration and how tough it can be be to write for a living, WRITING TO SURVIVE is where I turn when I have a creative block of any kind. It has shown me how to look at the simple and true and use them as a stepping stone to overcome whatever creative roadblock is in my path. It contains notes on writing, journal entries detailing times of despair when words would not flow...along with the joy of triumph over a sale or kind word. Conrad Richter truly wrote to survive. Times were hard and often the food on the table depended on the sale of a story. It is a insider's look at what makes a writer write and a wonderful tribute to one of the most underrated American authors...one who deserves to be rediscovered."},{"Title":"Writing to Survive: The Private Notebooks of Conrad Richter","review":"SWEAT EQUITY HERE - BUT NO ADVICE FOR NEW WRITERS:I respectfully disagree with the first reviewer on her opinion that this book can help a writer write fiction. I think her encounter with the writer's daughter colored her perspective. This book isn't a course in how to write fiction. It is a collection of notebooks and diary entries documenting how hard Conrad Richter worked to get the effects and the results he did for his writing. What this book does is document this particular writer's struggles, pursuits, ideas, practices, choices -- for the particular (Western) stories he wanted to write or which best suited his ideals. This book is so idiosyncratically rooted in Conrad Richter's personality, sweat, and effort, it best serves the Ph.D. dissertation-seeking student who wants to write about Conrad Richter in order to obtain a degree or someone who wants to write a critical analysis of his short stories.I came to this particular book with the very specific hope that Conrad Richter might instill in me the tools and techniques of writing fiction through his published notebooks, but I was more than halfway through the \\"story\\" of his depressing years as a struggling writer when I realized the book, at best, is helpful to the new writer if and only if that writer wanted to write stories exactly like Conrad Richter's stories, stories about the old figures from the Old West, and if and only if the writer's values and ideals about the glories of the Old West aligned with Conrad Richter's as well.I love that his loving daughter put together this collection of notebooks. When you read these notebooks, you almost can feel the sweat dropping from Conrad Richter's forehead as he tries to write the best he can and help his family survive by his writing. Sometimes I found what I was uncovering actually depressing. I also discovered that now Conrad Richter is only a somewhat dated regionalist writer whose stories have a nostalgic point of view. I do admire his novel, \\"The Light In the Forest,\\" and it alone of all his works seems to transcend the regionalism and nostalgia I write of here.This is a great collection of a writer's notebooks but it's better suited to the academic researcher than the budding writing seeking a mentor."},{"Title":"Bumps Are What You Climb on","review":"His books have been in my collection of favorites for years.

But Terence Lapin goes well beyond the expected to present us with a comprehensive look at the longest serving service rifle in the world. Lapin relies on primary sources for his information, dispelling folklore and myth often repeated in other publications.

With this book I was able to figure out what many of the stamps, receiver markings, stock cartouches, and other markings on my rifles indicated. This book does a great job of helping the collector to understand the differences between models, the differences between versions within the same model, and provides many illustrations to help identify all of the parts found on the Mosin Nagant rifles from around the world.Lapin does a good job of focusing on the details of the rifles in question, including all sorts of info related to stocks, receivers, sights, barrels, barrel bands, triggers, etc., etc. I don't believe there's a single part on the Mosin-Nagant rifle that isn't explained in great detail.Much of the book specifically describes Russian/Soviet and Finnish Mosin Nagants, although there are plenty of descriptions covering Mosin Nagant rifles from other East European nations, China, and others.As with any book of this type there are a few errors, such as insisting that the Finns used some sort of potassium permangenate stain on their stocks -- most experts, many in Finland, disagree with that and Lapin has yet (as far as I know) to produce any documentation that spells that out.

This design saw action in almost every major conflict of the twentieth century, from WWI, the Russian Civil War, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, and even Grenada! The longevity and production numbers of this rifle are testament to the design's robustness and simplicity.This book details the history, development, and production numbers for each type of Mosin-Nagant rifle. There were numerous variations, and many countries copied the ingenious Russian design and made their own rifles. The Finns, in particular, made a great deal of improvements to the rifle and made, in the opinion of many, the best overall Mosin-Nagants anywhere. This book details all of the various variations, improvements, accessories, design changes, and other things unique to each type. There is also a large glossary including much of the markings typically found on Mosin-Nagant rifles, and a serious collector should not be without this as a manual."},{"Title":"The Mosin-Nagant Rifle, 5th Edition (For collectors only)","review":"Like the AK's of today's world, the Mosin-Nagant rifle of an earlier day was the standard military rifle of about half the world. It was adopted in 1891 by the Russians and served with them throughout World War I and World War II as their standard infantry rifle. It books a bit funny to American eyes when compared to the '98 Mauser or the 03 Springfield, but it was a well designed, reliable, reasonably accurate rifle. It did what the Red Army wanted it to do.Mr. Lapin is an expert on the rifle. He has painstakenly gathered information about the rifle from every imaginable source and now has produced this third revised and expanded edition that provided invaluable information to collectors. He basically describes the differences in essentially all of the variations in the rifle regardless of where or when it was produced.As such, this is the definitive book on the rifle (in English, I don't know about books in Russia.

I think all new collectors should have this book as a guide and even long time collectors will find the book helpful. The author covers a lot of ground in this book so it is hard to be overly detailed but too be honest a definitive work on the Mosin Nagant would run into thousands of pages. I am glad to have been able to assist the author in the past and hope to do more in the future. A+"},{"Title":"The Mosin-Nagant Rifle, 5th Edition (For collectors only)","review":"Long version :This rifle is perfect for collectors of Mosin Nagants as well as people that own one or two examples of this line of rifles. Every marking is explained, every bit of history behind these rifles can be gleaned from this book. For example, would you be able to tell from the markings that your Remington M91 was captured by the Germans in WW1, transferred to the Austrians and then sold to Finland? Do you really not know much about Mosins and want to know what those funky letters mean and what the significance of an arrow in a star is? The rifle smothered in cosmoline you picked up for $50 at a gun show could be worth much, much more to a knowledgable collector.This book also covers disassembly of the rifle for cleaning and repair, it also contains vital safety information for any Mosin owner. This book is very comprehensive and no part, not even the buttplate screws, are over-looked, with detailed measurements and statistics for every piece of the Mosin rifle.Short version : if you own a Mosin, buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Mosin-Nagant Rifle, 5th Edition (For collectors only)","review":"This is the kind of detail you need if you want to track down where & when that 70 year old rifle you're holding in your hands has travelled.

I was always interested in World War I and World War II and was impressed that the Mosin-Nagant soldiered on through both major conflicts (starting with the Russo-Japanese War, actually) with some interesting detours.One of the most fascinating of those detours is represented by Finnish variations of the Mosin-Nagant. Lapin does an excellent job with major Finnish types, also. You might want to supplement it with Doug Bowser's RIFLES OF THE WHITE DEATH: A COLLECTOR'S AND SHOOTER'S GUIDE TO FINNISH MILITARY RIFLES 1918-1944.D.N. Bolotin's SOVIET SMALL-ARMS AND AMMUNITION is also a useful companion to Lapin's book. Lapin, however, is the starting point and the standard by which the others are measured.I gave Lapin's book five stars because of its value as a reference. It will be especially valuable to new collectors and shooters. Supplies of Mosin Nagant rifles are plentiful and prices are almost at give away levels if you shop around a little.Although the supplies of Finnish Mosin-Nagants has dried up, there are lots of Soviet rifles available. Some of those old Red Army 91-30s were probably at Stalingrad and other legendary battles.

This book gives helpful insight to finding and gathering the Attention of others. It is not a 'cure all', but will give valuable insight and get you to thinking down a good path."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"Abundance of information leads to scarcity of attention, the management of which is now the single most important determinant of business success - welcome to Attention Economy. After decades of focus on distribution and ubiquity of access to our modern information superhighways, a new focus is beginning to emerge: filters, agents, and personalization. \\"Attention Economy\\" is a great conversation starter, and a book that will force you to re-think many implicit assumptions - what is attention, how do we harness it, how do you get it, how do you keep it? Definitely a thought provoking read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"There are several key themes in this book, but of course the prevailing idea is that of our \\"attention\\" based economy and the challenges of getting clear messages through the overload of information. With more and more information available everyday, the pressing matter for businesses and organizations is the ability to attract and keep your attention.The book is written in the multi-visual short burst style of a magazine, as opposed to a more in depth prose. Some reviewers have commented negatively on this, and while I would agree it renders the material a bit lighter than it could be, it also uses the context of the subject matter ironically well in presenting the information in a way it can be absorbed quickly and in disconnected settings.The highlights for me included the section on the different types of attention; captive, voluntary, aversive, and so on, describing each type and giving examples of how to alter and adopt your message to reach through the pitfalls of each style. The sections on customer stickiness are well traveled but fitting to this subject dialog.Also discussed were several elements of organizational structure, design, leadership and how these foster or hinder the kind of attention the business needs from its people to get the desired results. Anyone faced with the challenge of trying to gain buy in for a cross group, or cross cultural, implementation of an organizational process knows the value of the message and the ability to gain the attention and focus of the recipients is the key to the success or failure of the change.I would have liked to see more in depth study and examples on best practices and methodologies used to overcome the information saturation present in most businesses. The ability to create and deliver clarity and purpose, and stay on message long enough to gain the change needed is a key leadership component that is often overlooked. The author's examples of Jack Welch were right on, as he is likely one of the best ever at getting messages, and most importantly attention, through a large and diverse organization.Overall, the book is a great overview of an important subject for businesses now and in the future where this becomes even more difficult, it is always interesting and readable, and therefore worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"I've spent years unsuccessfully trying to manage time better to be a more effective leader.

I also find the AttentionScape measurement tool on their website incredibly helpful for managing my own attention."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"The authors of this book see every business engine fueled by attention, defined as the focused mental engagement on a particular item of information. As the authors point out, during the industrial revolution, manpower drove the economy; in the information age, knowledge was power, in this business era, attention is the rare resource that powers companies. Companies need to recognize the value of attention, and lean how to direct it and manage it. The authors understand the broad spectrum of attention and have grouped them into \\"six units of attention currency.\\" The six units are paired into opposites: Aversive-Attractive, Captive-Voluntary, Back-of-mind-Front-of-mind."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"They could have written a repport with the material.

Attention is the currency of the information age. Think about it."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"Have you ever wondered why good companies loose their way, or people tune out of meetings, fail to get the message, or heed a call to action? Could your company or customers be described by a metaphor such as &quot;rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?&quot; If so then, you have an attention problem.Attention is a scarce commodity that is often misunderstood and mismanaged. Davenport and Beck bring a unique perspective on the topic that crosses many dimensions of strategic and tactical business. Attention issues exist within the marketplace, company, business unit, product, team, and individual. The book breaks this issue down and answers the following fundamental questions about attention:What is attention and how is it different from time management, prioritization and other ideas?What are the different types of attention, how do you recognize them? How do you act when you or your team is dominated by a particular type?How do you measure attention?How do you manage it?These questions are all incredibly topical in the world of information overload, emails, voicemails, conference calls and meetings. Given all of the data/information/knowledge raining down on people today it is little wonder that attention is becoming a serious topic.Consider this as the single biggest reason to read this book &quot;One reason that consumer products executives have been able to move into other industries is that they understand how to capture consumer attention&quot; p.93. Attention should be a hallmark of any good executive as clearly those who are able to command attention have a significant advantage in creating wealth for their companies and themselves.The book goes beyond describing the problem to providing tools such as Attentionscape, and techniques to help managers understand where the attention issues lie and how to address them. These tools give the book a practical basis that is of real value to the reader.Read this book if you are:-An executive responsible for charting your company's strategy and its implementation- A change agent/leader looking to get their message across and deliver results- A manager responsible for a team of people and the need to produce results- A customer facing professional who has to address customer sales, service, and relationship needs- A marketing executive who needs to understand how to get an inside edge on the competition and gain greater insight about current and potential customersDavenport and Beck present the topic in an informative and open style making the topic of attention something tangible and actionable. This is not a self help book, pop psychology, or personal management guide. Rather it is a serious treatment of a subject, attention that is often overlooked and under appreciated in business, customer relationships, leadership, and management.If you choose to ignore this book, then good luck in gaining the interest, understanding, and cooperation of others that we all need to be successful."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"If only I could buy some time... Surely you must have felt this way. However, this book would convince you that you should have rather said: if I could buy some more attention... Overall, I found the book to be quite thought provoking. Here's why:As the name of the book suggests we deal here with economy, and the study of economy essentially is about the management of scarce resources. In the more traditional economic perspective this scarce resource is money. However, the authors define an economy where the scarcity is attention. They explicitly disconnect attention management from time management.The concept they introduce seem quite intuitive -- we have experienced it in marketing activities for a long-long time. Chapter 6 deals with lessons from the attention industries: advertising, movies, television, and publishing.Thinking about anything we produce (in my world it would be computer software) as something that must compete for the scarce resource of attention surely opens up interesting avenues of thought. From a software perspective we need to develop soiftware that helps us manage our attention. At least 3 of the chapters deals with \\"stuff that should make information technology people think\\". Chapter 5 introduces attention technologies from 3 perspectives: attention-getting, attention-structuring and attention-protecting. Chapter 7 deals with e-commerce and attention, while Chapter 11 deals with Managing Information, Knowledge and Attention. It has the very apt chapter title \\"You've got (lots and lots of) mail\\".Overall I found the book to be written in a very readable fashion. I first loaned it from somebodies desk which I was visiting and managed to read it in 3 evenings end-to-end. I found the thoughts in it ever so stimulating that I just had to buy a copy which I did.If you like your thoughts to be provoked by looking at stuff in a new or different way, then this book will not let you down."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"The book reads like a magazine with a lot of anecdotes, which is a direct credit to its authors who are trying to make a textbook readable and capture the attention of mgmt audience with the baby face on its cover. Perhaps this has given the impression that it's not a serious book. But it is.As we get deluged with more information each day, each piece of information is fighting for our attention. An example would be the recent reverse trend by companies to have precise \\"smartbomb\\" placement of ads targeted at specific audience rather than pay-per-click ads in websites. The attention on Attention Management would increase in the next decade ahead. Already, organisations are talking about employee engagement instead of staff satisfaction to measure productivity and workplace morale.Good read for management, marketeers, KM, OD and comms practitioners.

This will be of interest to business managers as well as knowledge works and web site designer. From a business managers perspective it highlights a growing trend that the attention of employees in under attack. It raises the challenge for crisp clear and meaningful communication. It also challenges managers to not overload the communication channels with unrelated, unfocused and disconnected communication. Once again Jack Welch is used as an example of a simple message (i.e.,number one or number two) delivered over multiple channels with enough repetition to get on the workers attention channel.The authors provide an extremely useful tool named AttentionScape that measures where attention is being directed. It could be used to find were management, employee, customer and supplier attention is being focused. The book provides several examples of companies using (or ignoring to their determent) the AttentionScape information. The ideas the AttentionScape tool bring to fore make it worth the price of the book!As a knowledge worker the book highlights the importance of realizing attention is a key resource in completing any task and as such it should be protected and leveraged to get important task complete. As with management it also indicates the need for clear communication. The book Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity might be a good way to explore practical techniques for focusing and managing attention."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"Everyone knows how important attention is, but few business thinkers have had the courage or follow-through and take on the topic in a management-focused way before. I expected the book to focus more on advertising and Hollywood. Thankfully it didn't. The book's freshness and originality lies in the fact that it shows the relationship between attention and business to be far more extensive than just found in those &quot;attention industries.&quot; On that note, the chapters on leadership and organizational structure were particularly fresh.Davenport has a knack for forecasting where business is going; he was a pioneer in the Reengineering and Knowledge Management trends. In predicting and setting the direction of both of these, he had a keen sense for the &quot;human side&quot; of things. This is the case here as well: in AE he starts with that uniquely human activity-attention-and shows how it can be managed for success in the business world."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"I've worked nearly 20 years strategy consulting and management education and in that time I've read countless business books. Most present ideas and trends that are here today, gone tomorrow. This has been the case even more in the past five years with all the e-commerce focused books. Sadly, the books that actually present core ideas that will last for decades are usually written in a boring or academic style.&quot;The Attention Economy&quot; is a page-turner, but more importantly, it presents a fundamental (and until now, overlooked) business topic--attention management--in a smart way. While CEO's might not be worrying whether they'll be 'disintermediated' in twenty years, they sure will be worrying about how to manage their attention.My hope is that this book won't start a trend, but rather a paradigm shift in how manager's perceive and attend to the core tasks--leadership, strategy formulation, information management, planning--of their professional lives."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"This is a fine book! It is clear and creative writing on a novel concept and promising area - The Attention Economy.On page 20 the book defines attention as a \\"focused mental engagement on a particular item of information. Items come into our awareness, we attend to a particular item, and then we decide whether to act\\" (original italics). From this definition it follows that The Attention Economy is a system for managing the attention asset. And why manage attention? Because attention is an economic (scarce) resource. Like Joan Robinson is believed to have put it, \\"Scarce resources command a positive price.\\" In this case the price of attention is attention, or as the authors suggest: to get attention one has to give attention. In other words, scarcity compels (rational) choices, and on the margin of decisions choices have opportunity costs as well as benefits. To say that attention is a \\"focused mental engagement\\" is to say that producing attention requires lowering the opportunity cost of producing attention by specializing on the basis of a comparative advantage. Standard economics.The book argues that the study of attention is important because business success depends on attention and attention management, just as it does other resources. While the options theory of asset pricing seems to apply to the attention asset as well, a key difference is that the attention asset is a perishable intangible. Information designed to get attention often perishes into gluts that may lead to \\"organizational attention deficit disorder\\" and on to bankruptcy, suggesting a need for attention management.Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are nuggets of gold both analytically and in terms of descriptive content. Chapter 3 deals with the measurement of attention - pay attention to pages 40-47. Chapter 4, on \\"the psychobiology of attention\\", outlines general hierarchical schemes for understanding human needs relevant to giving, getting, growing, and keeping the attention resource. Chapter 5 is particularly about how a business can get people (its employees, customers, and competitors) to pay attention to its attention. Among many examples: It can use attention technologies such as customizing solutions; it can avoid shoving its attention onto others; and it can use its people to keep the attention it already gets.The sixth chapter of the book gives examples of industries where one would find the attention resource in practical uses. These include: advertising, movies, TV, and publishing. A defining characteristic of attention in these industries is \\"stickiness\\", i.e., paying and keeping attention (see p. 115ff).The next five chapters stress e-commerce, leadership, strategies, changes of organizational structure, and information and knowledge management, all in the attention economy. The last chapter looks to the future, especially to the challenges and prospects the attention economy presents.This is a good book, and the first five chapters are especially good. Some of the last chapters sound more like the revolutions we heard so much about during the dotcom era. The revolutionaries then told us to completely forget the \\"old economy\\", and singularly embrace the \\"new economy\\". Such predictions turned out to be hoity-toity, mainly because revolutions rarely succeed; they are generally too destructive even for their own good. Many revolutions have failed because, whereas people dislike the effects of change, they hate the disruptions of revolutions. Having said all that, I would still recommend The Attention Economy as fine work and good reading.Amavilah, AuthorModeling Determinants of Income in Embedded EconomiesISBN: 1600210465"},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"This book is a delightfully interesting combination of academic and general audience writing that makes it quite readable and holds your attention page after page.

An abundance of footnotes will give you more resources to pursue to expand your learning even further.I turned down more pages than usual in this volume. I marked all sorts of things to share with others and to go back to. I even wrote notes on some of the pages, which I don't usually do when reading a book like this.

Items come into our awareness, we attend to a particular item, and then we decide whether to act.\\" There's more, but I don't want to spoil this delicious read for you. You'll gain valuable insight into the role of attention in all aspects of our lives, how the ability to manage our attention is all-powerful . . . and how we struggle with our own personal challenge of managing the tremendous volume of information and other stimulants that bombard our senses. Part of the attention process is filtering and sorting, which is difficult for some people and can be overwhelming. There is so much in this book that I have no hesitation in giving it very high marks. Have your highlighter ready!The one negative-if it even is a negative-is the quotes and illustrative comments that appear in smaller type at the bottom of many of the pages.

In the Information Economy we all suffer from overload and the need to multitask through the day. Tom Davenport and John Beck makes the case that in the future we will need to \`attention manage' as a metric. They ask whether \`we are the first society with ADD' (attention deficit disorder), and they list symptoms of organizational ADD.As mentioned in the editorial review the Attention Economy is littered with anecdotal pull-outs and &quot;overheard&quot; comments; as well as random factoids such as that the Sunday edition of the New York Times contains more written factual information than was available to reader in the 15th century. Though these factoids are intriguing they can be distracting as they are not always connected to the main body of material. But in some ways they exemplify the attention problem as you are often drawn to reading them.The main body of the book is devoted to looking at tactics for companies to achieve and manage attention both on an internal basis and with their customers and partners. Softer issues such as personal time management are looked at in the context of the wider picture and have implications for both people and organizations. I found the book however to be missing a \`model' or framework that companies could really use. Aside from having an in-depth awareness of the issue, I am unsure what I would do/have done differently after reading it.The book is well written and engaging, and the authors present an excellent perspective on this most-precious resource."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"Professor Thomas H. Davenport is well known for his superb summaries of best practices in knowledge management. In The Attention Economy, he and co-author, Professor John C. Beck, outline the work that others are doing in measuring how attention is gained, and provide a prototype measurement device for attention. The book modestly advances our knowledge of this subject. The book's weakness is that it misdefines the key issue, which should be &quot;What Should We Be Paying Attention to in Business?&quot;The authors feel that the most pressing problem today is &quot;not enough attention to meet the information demands of business and society.&quot; They argue that everything except human attention is plentiful and cheap. They think of attention as &quot;human bandwidth.&quot; As a result, they suggest that like all scarce resources, attention is a &quot;currency.&quot; In support of these observations, the authors note that 71 percent of white collar workers feel &quot;info stress.&quot; They also argue that companies have &quot;organizational ADD.&quot;The most interesting part of the book is the proposed measurement model. There are three continuums involved: one is from aversive to attractive, a second is from captive to voluntary, and a third is from front-of-mind to back-of-mind. The authors provide some examples of how to use this as a measurement tool, and prescribe some potential solutions for what they find in the examples. I thought that the weakness of this approach is that without experimental experience and testing, one will probably be wrong in prescribing from a new measurement tool. In that sense, the writing here exceeds the scope of the research the authors have done. However, I am glad they are sharing their prototype.Of existing research, you will get a quick look at psychobiology, the impact of technology on solving or making the problem worse, lessons from advertising, Web issues (especially e-mail, which they mention incessantly), leadership effects, strategy effects, and organizational structure as it affects attention.Basically, their argument is that less is more in most situations. Their goal is to create a world where technology enhances attention, you have control over sending and receiving information, you can escape information, and institutions (like companies and schools) make information more relevant for you. In so doing, they would like to see information providers focus on quality, not quantity.&quot;In the end, the greatest prize for being able to capture attention will be the freedom to avoid it.&quot;Being familiar with the literature in this area, I found only the measurement model to be new. If you have read widely, you can focus on just that part of the book.My own sense is that measuring attention is less important than measuring what people use information for. Are they working on the right things, with the right people and tools, and in the best possible way? I also suspect that attention does need to be somewhat open. You do not know what you do not know, nor do I. Openness is clearly valuable to creativity and innovation. Hopefully, it will remain so.I was also struck that not enough attention was paid to giving people more tools for handling information that would already work. But this is a theoretical book, rather than a practical one. If you want to know more about how to turn information into influence, I suggest you read Robert Cialdini's classic, Influence.Basically, this subject is only of interest because voice mail and e-mail are being overused. That source of stress is fairly unimportant though, because little of importance comes from either source. They just happen to waste time. Good manners and more consideration would solve most of those problems. For most companies, a little attention to suggesting what should be done in both areas would solve much of the stress described here.I think we do need to do more work on helping people to appreciate their perceptual weaknesses. Like many management books, this one focuses more on &quot;doing things to people&quot; rather than helping people do things for themselves better. I hope that future work in this area will be more practical for the individual.My experience has been is that if people have good information, almost everyone decides and acts in the same way. The poorest sources of such information are regular financial reports in companies. As a result, Professor Kaplan's work with the Balanced Scorecard, as described lately in The Strategy-Focused Organization, is a area to focus on if you are concerned about organizational ADD.The relatively new book, Simplicity, by Bill Jensen is also a good source of ideas for how to overcome many of these issues.After you think about this issue, I suggest that you focus your organization on what are the three things you need to do better than anyone else. Then be sure that everyone understands what information needs to be addressed. Give them lots of freedom to wallow in the information anyway they like. A regimented approach will help with execution, but limit your choices.Expand your mind's control over what you focus on, to avoid the bad habits that stall progress!"},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"I rank this book as easily one of the top 25 books on information fundamentals, and quite possibly in the top 10. While there are other books on attention qua economic good, this one focuses on us, the attention providers, and not on the media or entertainment or other attention thieves.The book is well-presented and what some might see as showmanship I consider to be good editing and publishing. The book starts strong, focusing on &quot;attention deficit&quot; in both individuals and organizations, and the consequences of failing to pay attention to the right things at the right time--corporate CEOs and their business intelligence professionals, as well as government leaders and their national intelligence professionals, can learn a great deal from this book.Especially useful to me, and a major reason why I rank this book so highly, was its distinction between:1) Global Coverage for AWARENESS2) Surge local focus for ATTENTION3) Domestic political focus for ACTIONAt a national level, I found myself thinking that this book could be the first step in an evaluation of how we spend our time--and how we compensate ourselves for spending our time. Of course others have observed that we spend too much time in front of the television or eating fast food or whatever, but I found this book extremely helpful in thinking about the economics of personal and organizational information management. Applying this book's lessons, for example, might cause any manager to forbid Internet access because of the very high negative return on investment--searches should be done by specialists who can be relied to avoid personal browsing on company time. The author's specifically note that the Western culture is less well equipped to manage &quot;attention&quot; than other cultures.Also helpful to me were the book's focus on the fact that client attention and teamwork *compete* with innovation, and that some form of time management guidance is needed that permits employees to focus on just one of these as a primary duty.The author's identification of relevance, community, engagement, and convenience as the four key factors in attracting and holding attention from individuals--and the lengthy discussion in the book on each of these--is very worthwhile. So also is their specification of four &quot;attention tracks&quot; that each individual must manage: focusing one's own attention; attracting the right kind of attention to oneself; directing the attention of those under one's oversight; and maintaining the attention of one's customers and clients (and one could add, one's family).This book is a vital contribution to correcting our long-standing overemphasis on collecting information (or ignoring information) without regard to what we do with it in human terms. For me, the key sentence in this entire book, one that government and corporate managers would do well to &quot;pay attention to&quot; was, on page 216: &quot;Increasingly, managerial success will rely on the ability to ignore or at least filter the vast stream of information that hits the desk, ears, and eyeballs. The ability to prioritize information, to focus and reflect on it, and to exclude extraneous data will be at least as important as acquiring it.&quot; Their book is *not* a variation on the many confused knowledge management treatises (making the most of what you already know). It goes well beyond the current state of the art and outlines new ideas that could and should have a fundamental impact on how we spend our time, what information services we buy, and how we use information technology."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"This is a fascinating subject: ADD in the business world. Almost everyone continues to experience information overload. Some who have studied this phenomenon invoke metaphors such as &quot;blizzards&quot; of data. Meanwhile, information providers struggle to get through &quot;blizzards&quot; to reach those who are most important to them. How to attract their attention? Then, how to capture that attention with what has been described as &quot;stickiness&quot;? After conducting an extensive research project, Davenport and Beck conclude that attention is &quot;the new currency of business.&quot; Perhaps Wolf agrees, having written a brilliant book about &quot;the entertainment economy&quot;; perhaps Pine and Gilmore also agree, having written a book about &quot;the experience economy.&quot;At the beginning of most of his plays, Shakespeare uses various devices to attract an audience's attention so that its members could then be entertained. (The play Hamlet begins with a question &quot;Who's there?&quot; The audience settles down, curious to learn the answer.) In today's marketplace, merchants such as Starbucks and Williams-Sonoma do everything possible (and appropriate) to attract attention by appealing to several of the senses. (The fragrant aroma of Starbucks' gourmet coffee can be experienced by many of those in the bookstore nearby.) Especially now with so many people online, there is what so many have observed as &quot;too much information&quot; or at least &quot;not enough time&quot; to absorb and digest the information available.Davenport and Beck organize their material within 12 chapters which range from &quot;A New Perspective on Business (Welcome to the Attention Economy)&quot; to &quot;From Myopia to Utopia (The Future of the Attention Economy).&quot; They explain why understanding and managing attention is now the single most important determinant of business success. They examine with rigor and eloquence three different types of &quot;attention technologies&quot;: attention-getting, attention-structuring, and attention-protecting. They explain why companies will no longer be proud of how extensive their knowledge portals are, but rather of how targeted an information environment they create. (Davenport and Beck fully understand that &quot;targets&quot; are constantly moving; also, that the prioritization of &quot;targets&quot; is an on-going process to accommodate change.) Throughout the book, they also insert dozens of &quot;Principles.&quot; Here are three examples:&quot;Types Principle: Six basic units of currency are exchanged in an attention market, each emphasizing a specific target of focused mental engagement.&quot;NOTE: These &quot;basic units&quot; are Captive and Voluntary, Aversive and Attractive, and finally, Front-of-Mind and Back-of-Mind. They are discussed in detail in Chapter 2, one of the book's most thought-provoking chapters.&quot;Tap or Bottle Principle: The most important function of attention isn't taking information in, but screening it out.&quot;&quot;Action! Principle: Hollywood studio executives understand their audience before they make a play for their attention, and they manipulate setting, segmentation, and culture to hold onto it.&quot;The authors suggest that the trend of more information competing for less attention cannot go on forever. &quot;Ultimately, people will begin to withdraw from the stress of an attention-devouring world, and information providers will begin to focus on quality, not quantity.&quot; Each delivery day, I immediately toss (unopened) all unwanted items in the U.S. mail; I systematically delete (unread) all unwanted e-mail messages, and politely but quickly end all telephone solicitations. Everyone I know responds the same way in these situations. Davenport and Beck conclude their brilliant book noting &quot;In the end, the greatest prize for being able to capture attention will be the freedom to avoid it.&quot; Many (most?) information providers will continue to waste truly valuable &quot;currency&quot; unless and until they become insolvent or until they finally understand the basic principles of &quot;the attention economy.&quot; Davenport and Beck wrote the book for them but also for other information providers who can increase even more the ROI on the same &quot;new currency.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"I found this book disappointing. Attention (and lack thereof) is on a lot of peoples' minds these days. The book highlights the distinction between time and attention. It also does a reasonable job of describing the increasing prevalence of attention deficit among individuals and organizations.I suspect however that anyone reading the book is already well aware of the problem and is looking for solutions. The book offers few that are particularly new or useful. The book itself looks new. It has a 'weby' feel in that chunks of text and 'factoids' are scattered around the pages. No doubt this was intended to be attention-getting but in book format I found it distracting.Given the ever-increasing demand for our attention, it seems more important than ever to get to the point quickly and avoid tangents. This book violates that principle by squandering the readers' attention on ideas that are old (e.g.: Maslow's Hierarchy), of questionable relevance to this topic (e.g.: mergers and acquisitions) or dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere (e.g.: how to structure documents to maximize attention)"},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"This book contained a lot of preliminary material describing attention and providing one measurement technique developed at the author's workplace, Accenture. From that point on, all problems were dealt with using this one technique.

Think Hollywood - or look at the advertising industry or the &quot;stars&quot; of the business world - the most successful are the ones that get all the attention. The flip side of this attention coin as presented in &quot;The Attention Economy&quot; is the success that comes from managing your own attention effectively - something very few people recognize, let alone know how to control. The book takes on the problems that hinder productivity (both personal and business) by viewing them through a new lens: &quot;Understanding and managing attention,&quot; the authors claim, &quot;is now the single most important determinant of business success.&quot; A heady claim, but one that Davenport and Beck support with compelling insights - starting with an explanation of how our minds instinctively create their own attention hierarchies (yes, sex is near the top, but so is catastrophe, self-esteem, and jockeying for power among colleagues.), and then focusing the &quot;attention lens&quot; on topics like leadership, strategy, and organizational structure. Despite its serious business bent (both Davenport and Beck are seasoned professionals, and, the book is published by Harvard Business School Press, after all) the book has a hip, refreshing tone and manages to straddle the line between enlightening the business professional and entertaining the human within. That's what I liked about the book the most - instead of approaching professionals as slightly sentient processors of information, the authors are concerned with the limited natural resource that powers individuals and organizations - their attention - and help us maximize its potential."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"The book sets out in a bad direction, and never really recovers. There's some interesting survey material for those who are completely unfamiliar with the issues, but also many random unsubstantiated claims, much that's illogical or contradictory, and a ream of chapters later in the book with what seems to me to be vague management advice.The initial bad direction comes in the form of a broken definition of attention: the authors claim attention is a narrowing of perception (sensory input), followed by an action decision. The latter part of this is completely bogus from a psychological perspective, and only there to support the marketing/advertising-oriented slant of the book. Yes, attention does involve a focus on a subset of sensory input, but no decision making needs to be attached. Think of watching a movie: it has your full attention; you're blocking out surrounding stimuli to some extent. But when the movie is effective, you're along for the ride, not making decisions. Furthermore, the authors *claim* that attention-management is different from time-management, but are very sloppy in distinguishing between attention, time, mind share, effort, persuasion, and a variety of other measures. It's maddening.An example of the contradictory nature of the authors' advice is that they both advise managers to be creative in seeking their employees' attention (including multimedia messages, clowning in meetings, and other nonsense) AND advise that companies deploy &quot;attention guards&quot; to keep employees focused. Well, which is it? Distractions or focus? The sheer enthusiasm with which the authors endorse the arms race for attention (more and more baroque packaging of messages (ads) to get your attention) is disturbing.The graphic design of the book makes a point and is amusing at first, but when you're trying to stick to the flow of the main text, the sidebars and tangential blurbs become very distracting. They becgome more distracting as the amount of real information in the main text decreases in later chapters.I read this as a bookclub book to discuss it with a few (high-tech focused) friends, and we unanimously hated the book. I recommend taking a good look at it before spending your money."},{"Title":"The Attention Economy: Understanding the New Currency of Business","review":"This book practices what it preaches! It's written in a light and occasionally funny style, has a really interesting and colorful format, and a very attention-getting cover. I found it to have lots of easy-to-use tips on how to get and keep attention. And the web site for the book - www.attentionbook.com - lets you measure and analyze how your own attention is allocated. It's an entirely new way of looking at business, and I can't stop thinking about attention now!"},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"Patricia Highsmith has her own chilling interpretation of the suspense thriller genre. You wonder not so much about what will happen or how it will happen or who will do it. Rather, the question is: how much worse can things get for the relatively innocent main character, Robert Forrester, who, as the novel goes on, is falsely suspected of a growing number of deaths.Forrester invites suspicion by prowling around the house of a young woman. Depressed by the failure of his marraige, he has moved to a small Pennsylvannia town and is leading a solitary and bleak life. Looking through the windows of Jenny's house, he is comforted by watching the attractive young woman attend to domestic details: cooking, hanging curtains, talking to her boyfriend over dinner.Highsmith presents Forrester's prowling as understandable; slightly wrong, and risky, yet certainly not harmful. Mostly one feels sympathy for Forrester, a character drawn in anguished shades of gray. He is a decent man, with no drive or hope, seeking a little illicit happiness.As the novel progresses, his relationship to Jenny takes a surprising turn of events. Highsmith's mastery lies in the pedestrian inevitability with which she introduces abnormal and even shocking twists of the plot. Because we are lulled into Highsmith's own distinctive world of the darkness of ordinary lives, our anxiety for Forrester is gradually heightened without our even being aware of it. By the time the plot gets around to the events which categorize the novel as a mystery, we are deeply engaged in the psychologies of Forrester and Jenny, as well as several other characters.The suspense thus springs from their own interior struggles, rather than the machinations of a conventional murder plot. Predictably, therefore, there are no easy solutions in the end, no complex train of events to be tied up in one simple explanation.The adding up of the actions of people who are no more conscious of why they do what they do than any regular person, has, in this novel, an utterly gripping and painfully believable tragic outcome."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This book is one of the few books I've ever read, especially in mystery, that gave me a serious case of the creeps. It's not just suspenseful, it's scary. The book has aged, but not dated; if anything I found Highsmith's characters even more disturbing in light of how social mores and psychological knowledge has advanced. But what's ultimately scary about it is that what happens to our hero, Robert Forester, is something that could very easy happen to anyone in the wrong place at the wrong time. Read it, it's brilliant."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This is the first Patricia Highsmith novel I've read, and all things considered I probably should have started with one of her more popular titles. I did enjoy the book, but thought the action fizzled out a bit about halfway through. It started really well. I liked Robert, I liked the cosy domestic idyll Jenny represented for him, but I got disappointed when they actually got to know each other, and found that the reality of their relationship paled beside his fantasy.I found Nikkie somewhat unbelievable - could someone so theatrically cruel really exist and would someone like Robert ever be blind enough to marry her? Hopefully not. I also thought Greg's transformation from clean-cut, stable, all-American nice guy to a gun-wielding, porn-viewing maniac a little too radical. If Highsmith was trying to invert our assumptions about Robert and Greg and make a point about appearance and reality she should probably have done so with a little more subtlety.I expected the plot to take a completely different arc to what it did - did anyone else latch on to the comment Jenny made towards the beginning of the book about how accusing a man falsely of rape was the worst crime a woman could commit? I thought that this was an indicator of how the story would proceed, and felt a little cheated when it turned out to have no bearing on the plot at all.Having said all that, Highsmith did a wonderful job of creating an atmosphere of tension and nervous expectation, as my completely eroded cuticles will testify. It's a book that has an almost physiological effect on you - you actually experience what the characters feel, rather than using your imagination to try and simulate the experience. The ending is particularly good in this regard as it gives no closure, but instead allows the sense of despair and horror to continue after the book has been closed. This makes it a rather uncomfortable read I suppose, as most people can do without palpitations, a dry throat, and a sense of mounting panic. It takes an incredibly talented writer to make you want to go through such a disquieting experience again, but I certainly do. I will definitely read another Patricia Highsmith novel, and will hopefully find it even better than this one."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"If you are old enough to remember the early 1960s, this novel will remind you what a grim era it really was in America, when everyone was expected to act according to fairly strict social codes, where conformity was king and where anyone seen as different was distrusted by other people in the town, especially in a small town.At the heart of this very unsettling novel is the premise that, once people viewed you outside of the bounds of everyday \\"normal\\" behavior, you were rejected, guilty until proven innocent, and the worst was assumed of you until your own belief in your own sanity or interpretation of reality could be questioned.This is a book about a couple of emotionally damaged main characters who find each other but whom societal circumstances destroy one way or another. It is vividly if bleakly drawn, and Ms. Highsmith really goes to extremes to show us how these innocent individuals, somewhat \\"fringe elements\\" in society because of bad experiences they've had in previous years, are so marginalized by a conforming, unsympathetic microcosm of American society that the integrity of their lives becomes slowly dissolved by harder, meaner people who get all the benefit of the doubt by neighbors, law enforcement officers, co-workers, etc.It's a depressing book, but excellently written. Ms. Highsmith seems to know just what she wants to do, and she does it relentlessly and suspensefully. I would agree with other reviewers here that the behavior and actions of two of the characters, Nickie and Greg, seem eventually so extreme that it's kind of impossible to accept them as believable characters. But in truth this seems a kind of \\"fable of the 60s\\" which places two vulnerable, well-meaning but somewhat damaged people at the center of a maelstrom of injustice and misunderstanding, and seems to want to make us uncomfortable with the society we lived in back then. Along the way are occasional \\"decent\\" and well-meaning people, but they never prevail and throughout it seems that good people are subject to a kind of entropy beyond their control.Fortunately it's no longer the 1960s and America doesn't seem as essentially small-minded, unjust and unfair as so many of the characters in this irritating small town seem to be. There seems to be a real sociological agenda afoot here from the author, a strong attempt to criticize the small-mindedness of Americans circa early 1960s. It's a period piece in that regard, because thank God we don't live in that society any more (not that our current society doesn't have its own problems). I'm sure Ms. Highsmith thought that the gentler characters (like friend Jack Nielsen) were being shown sympathetically, but the lens of time makes everyone look a little bleak, so accurately are they drawn within the moral grimness of the immediate post-McCarthy era in America. This is like an early John Updike novel morphed into a nightmare.To summarize, it's impossible not to sound contradictory: this is a very difficult novel to get through - it will irritate and depress you. But it's also extremely well-executed and haunting. It's more than the sum of its parts, and it lingers with you, making you look at your own neighbors and your own vulnerability to misunderstanding or injustice in a wary and uncomfortable way."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"The first couple of novels by Patricia Highsmith that I read were the Ripley-series and after finishing those I was very impressed with her work. Then I decided I also have to read the rest of what she has written and finally let that marvellous Tom Ripley-character go... so the Cry Of The Owl was my next book and I must say that it is not AS brilliant as what I've read before but it was still pretty good. I was never really surprised or shocked by what the characters in this book did and there was not a great plot but thinking about the story line and the characters I must say it is an interesting book. The main character, Robert Forester, is not a twisted minded serial killer or anything but is in fact a very nice man. It is others in the story that are responsible for the killing/death, but everybody suspects Robert of killing. What this book shows is how people think that are prejudiced and how easy it is for them after only reading stories in the paper and listening to gossip to have an opinion about someone they do not even know. Like I said there is not a brilliant plot in the story but it is quite interesting. I'd say: if you like Patricia Highsmith: don't miss this one! And as far as my Patricia Highsmith reading goes: Bring on the next book!"},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"People often, and mistakenly (in my opinion), view most works from Patricia Highsmith as 'crime novels'. The Cry of the Owl is probably no exception since it contains the requisite murders, false accusations, etc. Judged as a crime novel The Cry of the Owl is only so-so. That is, it's not a page-tuner.However Ms. Highsmith's true genius was her ability to closely examine the psychological aspects of a criminal, victims, and related parties. In The Cry of the Owl we see how the general public can jump to conclusions when a stranger is accused of murder. While all is revealed at the end, Ms. Highsmith also lets the reader make his/her own judgement ... and so we might either fall into the &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; trap or maintain a balanced, impartial view. And she does this all in an economical, easy-to-read style that is readily accessible to most everyone.No, The Cry of the Owl does not rank on par with her great works such as Strangers on a Train. But the growing numbers of Patricia Highsmith should put this novel on their 'must read' list."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"Patricia Highsmith is the queen of the psychological thriller. I love her writing in general and her characterizations in particular. From sociopathic con-artist Tom Ripley (in the five books in her Ripley series) to the thoroughly unforgettable Bruno and Guy duo in Strangers on a Train her characters display an ambiguity that is both unnerving to read about but also make it difficult to tear your eyes away from the page.Sometimes quirky, sometimes devious, often displaying passive-aggressive behavior, and more often than not just down-rights nuts her characters display an ambiguity that hooks the reader and never lets go. The recently re-released The Cry of the Owl features Robert Forester, 30ish, recently divorced from the shrewish Nickie, guilt ridden and morally compromised by self-inflicted circumstances as he attempts to extricate him-self from a series of bad, and potentially deadly, situations.Most of Highsmith's novels provide the reader with troubled moody individuals, vivid atmospheric imagery and a degree of cynicism that one can easily assume reflects the author's personal expression of own emotional commentary on the state of mankind.If you're looking for a great discussion book for your next Book Club meeting may I recommend The Cry of the Owl or any of the aforementioned Ripley books. Highsmith's novels always provide plenty of fodder for discussion into good and evil, suppressed feelings, the psychological motivation of her characters as well as metaphoric references (why do so many of the characters in her novels have facial imperfections - moles in particular- and what do they represent)? Well, you get the idea. 4 1/2 stars"},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"The story roughly divides into three parts: the first, which is the best, about the relationship between Robert and Jenny; the second, about the suspicion that Robert killed Greg, Jenny's fiance; and the third, about Robert's pursuit by Greg and Nickie, Robert's ex-wife. The book starts off a bit implausibly, when Jenny invites Robert, who she knows is her Peeping Tom, inside her home. But at least the first part has some intrigue because Robert is ambiguous in his motives and trustworthiness. By contrast, any suspense the story's second part has relies on the reader's willingness to believe that the police in the story's locale are dolts compared to the Keystone Cops. The third part is totally over the top in implausibility, with Greg, now a murderer out on bail, joining forces with Nickie to do in Robert. It's typical Highsmith, with lots of drinking and threats of violence, sometimes realized. The book is somewhat more suspenseful, surprisingly, than Strangers on a Train, and it has a startling description of a suicide from the victim's point of view, but it is still unimpressive as a whole. For the diehard Highsmith fans only, I'd say. Highsmith should have stuck to short stories."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"Jack is married to Betty, and Robert Forrester is their friend. Robert is a voyeur. He believes he doesn't look like a psychopath. He dreams of Brother Death. Subsequently he gets to know his subject. This is all I'll say about the plot since Patricia Highsmith is the master of twisted plots. Setting, atmosphere, serpentine leads are also the tools used by Highsmith to create the suspense and unease inherent in her fiction. Robert, among other things, has impostor syndrome.Fictions of Patricia Highsmith are fascinating for their grasp of schizoid trends. In the economy of expression the novels seem French in the manner of Georges Simenon. The Highsmith oeuvre is a rich trove for movie scripts. There is more here than just a RIPLEY movie. Missed connections, misunderstandings, creators of psychological terrors and manipulations are present everywhere in the work, creating anxiety, dread, apprehension.The nervous sensibility resembles that of and captured memorably by Edgar Allan Poe. Poe and Highsmith were thorough-going intellectuals. It is possible in their personal existences in the world they were, characteristically, misunderstood. They were people caught up in their own obsessions and found literary forms to embody them."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This is the kind of story you can read about everyday in the papers, or hear about on 20/20 type of shows, only here it is novelized and done so well. I don't find it surprising, once we've gotten to know all the characters, that Jenny would invite Robert into her house. And I liked Robert, because he's a good guy, with good intentions and without the need to explain himself to everybody, but it's his goodness that allows for all the grief in the book. My biggest problem with the book was that the characters guess at what the others are doing, and lo and behold that's what they are up to. Otherwise, it's a great book. Throw together a bunch of characters with scheming minds, mixed in with characters who just want to lead their lives, and that's the kind of story this is. Only the second book I've read from her, but I can guarantee I'll be making my way through all of them, including the Ripley series."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"I guess I just don't get it. &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot; shows promise early in the story as Robert, a nice but confused young man becomes involved (implausibly!) with Jenny,a nice young woman any guy would like to meet and date.

I know this is fiction but Ms. Highsmith writes as though she has lived her life in an ivory tower. People like this-except for good old Jenny- just don't exist. Read the book and email me that you believe Nickie! To give the author her due, there is a definite sense of gloom right from the start and the characters, especially Greg and the cop, Lippenholz, add to the depressed aura of foreboding.

What surprised me as I was reading was that the story seemed familiar, as if I had read it before. Turns out I had seen a movie based on the book a while back. I highly recommend this and all her books for literary suspense with a twist."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"I first watched the movie made from this book. After watching it, I had to read the book. I found the story to be engrossing. One bad incident for Robert leads to another, and then another.

A great read."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"It is a very well written novel in which a newspaper story is very well described with all the details. I liked the hero Robert very much, because he is a kind, warm-hearted person. He doesn't need to show everybody how he is and what he can do. But his kindness is the actually reason for all this grief and tragedy in this book. Jenny, a nice girl who believes that her life tragically marred, is also a very good character. The main subject in this novel is death, which is always mentioned in the course of the story. Quite a remarkable thing is the fact that the persons always guess what the other characters do or even think. The owl is the most important symbol in this novel, although it is mentioned very little. But it is a very important, because in the whole story it plays quite an important part. I liked this novel by Patricia Highsmith very much."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"I love Highsmith's books, but this one is really bad. This is the 8th book I have read by her and I was amazed by all the absurd and unlikely situations in it.This is a rough list all of the absurd and unlikely situations. Take into account that there are a lot of spoilers on it.before I start, I know some reviewers state that Jenny inviting a prowler into her house is absurd, but we later understand that Jenny is insane, so believing this was not a problem for me. However:1. Robert's attitude towards Jenny. He says he doesn't like her, but, except for very few times, he acts as if he does.2. Nickie helping out Greg. Nickie is insane as well, but we are never given an explanation as to why she hates Robert so much, and, again for unknown reasons, she is even willing to help Greg (a stranger she barely knows)so Robert gets into trouble with the law.3. Dr. Knott taking care of Robert the way he does is also very unlikely. Sure, his wife died and he has little to do in town, but he practically adopts Robert just because of a wound on his arm.4. Greg shooting Dr. Knott and attempting to kill Robert, but being bailed out of jail, which gives him another chance to try to kill Robert one more time.5. Mr. Kolbe asking Robert to give Greg his gun back after Greg tries to kill Robert in Robert's own house. Greg convinces Mr. Kolbe that he's not Greg, but, for some unknown and unlikely reason, Mr. Kolbe orders Robert, by poiting a rifle at him, to give Greg his gun back and lets him escape.The book is filled with unexpected twists and it is well written (characters are well developed) and a page turner (although only to find more absurd behavior page after page), but I admit that I was never surprised by them because I had previously watched the 2010 movie adaptation. To be honest, the director did a great job at adapting this book into a movie, because he removed all these absurd situations and made it more realistic.This book reminded me a lot of Highsmith's \\"A Suspension of Mercy\\". It has a different plot, but similar twists and it is a lot more convincing and realistic."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This is stunningly good. It starts off almost sweetly, but ends so chillingly that a reader asks, \\"What just happened?\\" I could not put this one down."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"I love Patricia Highsmith's writing in general. And while I will admit I like some of her works better that others, this one rates pretty high on my list.I find it especially compelling the way she refuses to take sides, forcing the reader to decide for themselves who the \\"good guys\\" are and the \\"bad guys\\" are. Her characters don't always get what they deserve. Their lives aren't neat. \\"Villians\\" (like the sociopathic Nickie) often thrive, while \\"good\\" people like Robert sometimes can't seem to win."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"Only the equally dull and equally intolerable THIS SWEET SICKNESS, of novels published in Highsmith's lifetime, is weaker. Robert Forester, protagonist, is more symbol than human being, as is sad Jenny and crazy Greg, each seemingly trapped, with a host of other non-entities, in Langley, PA. The book is written in prose flatter than Twiggy (remember her?). The work also a not-too-subtle condemnation of small town parochialism--towns of the hinterland that will protect their own, even murderers, but do-in strangers, like Forester, in a Los Angeles minute...The novel becomes almost funny, or rather, pathetic. To think that Forester (he \\"forests'\\" death) would care what happens to evil Nickie, his ex, or to Greg, his would-be murderer, strains verisimilitude. The whole bolus a bosh and a bore; rediculous...Why Highsmith biographer Joan Schenkar (THE TALENTED MISS HIGHSMITH) rates the novel one of her favorites is beyond understanding of this reviewer."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This book was a huge disappointment.It sounded like it would be a great story but it turned out to be one of the worst books i have ever read.Implausible,unbelievable characters who do unbelievable things,none of it made any sense.And the ending,wow!just when you think it can't get any worse.How anyone can like this rubbish i don't know, but it was a waste of paper and a waste of my time.If you like books to make sense then don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"The cry of the owl","review":"This book isn't really a crime novel, it is more mysterious than that. In &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot; you can see how society can jump to conclusions when a stranger is accused of prowling and murder. Robert Forrester gets accused of murder even tough he hasn't killed the other guy, whose girlfriend was the reason for fighting with Robert. Afterwards he can't lead the same life as before, everything has changed. Forrester is just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and for that he almost has to go to jail. The characters are well chosen, every reader will like Forrester even tough he's a prowler, and normally prowlers are not accepted in our society. But Patricia Highsmith describes him in such an compelling way that you just can't help sympathizing yourself with him in this story. The plot is tight, there are several surprising events, such as the suicide of Jenny.

Parrinder's discussion of West African concepts of the supernatural, like belief in shape-shifting, are intriquing. Equally interesting are his expositions of West African psychological thinking, like dream interpretation.Parrinder's description of West African ideas of reincarnation is one of many thought-provoking observations. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the unenlightened suffer the misfortune of rebirth to this world. In West Africa, people who prove themselves worthy elders enjoy veneration by family who survive them, as well as the prospect of eventual return to the realm of the living. The spirits of the unworthy or the rootless haunt the West African landscape.Also, several children may bear the name of an ancestor whom they are all considered to reincarnate. In West Africa, various aspects of a single person's character and personality are reincarnated. Thus, a single individual may be reincarnated in several people. Parrinder also explains that some West Africans believe that each person has multiple souls, presenting a further intriguing twist on African concepts of the self.Another good study of the peoples of this region would be another book by Parrinder, West African Religion."},{"Title":"A faith for all seasons: Liberal religion and the crises of life : study and discussion guide","review":"A liberal religous understanding of the pain and suffering in life which mirrors a Unitiarian Universalist philosophy.

Another important characteristic is that the book is packed with quotes and most of them are very adequate for what is being discussed at that moment. A lot of research went into the bio.Juan van den Eynde, quite a few times during his narration, takes sides against Napoleon, passing judgement too often. It is my opinion that a good biographer lays out fact and opinion, so that it is the reader who eventually passes judgement on the subject, and forms his own opinion. There are passages where you feel Eynde really hates Napoleon's guts.In summary, the book is good and worth the time it takes to go through the 188 pages, but as a an introduction to Napoleon and his times. Naturaly, the author does not provide detail about any of the important account in Napoleons life...."},{"Title":"Harrison High","review":"Harrison High (1959) was written by John Farris at the precocious age of 23. It sold over a million copies, spawned four sequels and, in 1960, was made into a movie. It is a sprawling piece of JD ('juvenile delinquency') fiction that charts the course of an entire year at any Anytown, American high school.Harrison High is a highly-regarded school in a traditionally upper-class neighborhood. Recent population shifts and general social malaise have conspired to make things a little edgier as of late - the school is no longer solely packed with college-bound jocks, but now has a seedy working-class, jeans-clad underbelly. The school still prides it self in its football team (GO LIONS!), wealthy donors (a whirlpool in the locker room!) and talented faculty.The book has a handful of protagonists, each with their own unique perspective on Harrison High. The supposed hero (as played by Dick Clark in the film) is Neil Hendry, a new teacher/coach with a jaded attitude stemming from a war wound and a previous teaching job in a crappy location (across town). His love interest is the new Spanish teacher, Joanne Dietrich, who matches Hendry's defeatism with a gloriously unfounded optimism.The kids far outshine the teachers. Although all the characters are hormonally-imbalanced, painfully egotistical and often catastrophically stupid, at least the teenagers are supposed to be that way. They are represented by Trent (football star and future pharmacist), Ricky (hot blond who went to Sunday school), Buddy (quarterback from the wrong side of the tracks, trying to make good for his single mom), Anne (curvy drama student who wants to make it in Hollywood) and Griff (seedy jd with the sensual lips). The five form an awkward love pentagon - a clumsy sexual salad of self-absorption, naivete and badly-expressed horniness.Farris points out - correctly - that the stakes are high for these kids. For the girls, self-sufficiency isn't an option - the best they can dream of is marriage and children - probably with someone they've met in high school. For the boys, the only ticket to college comes from sports - and from there, the inevitably military service. In the world of Harrison High, it is only the \\"bad\\" kids - Anne and Griff - who dream of living adulthood away from their home town. And, to Farris' credit, he strives especially hard to make those two the most empathetic characters of the lot.Oddly, Harrison High also excels as sports fiction. Football, as noted above, is a high stakes game, and on the field, is played with the bloody intensity of Viking warfare. The lengthy chapter detailing the rivalry game against cross-town Riverside is particularly good - with the class and race overtones adding even more into the mix.Harrison High is, even viewed in the best possible light, a completely superficial exploration of teenage motivations and behavior. Despite that - or because of it - it is an entertaining read that made me wish my tube journey was longer in the morning. Like a teenagers it features, the book takes itself too seriously, but can still be fun to hang out with"},{"Title":"Proceedings of two highway vehicle emission inventory workshops","review":"Inga Clendinnen has written a definitive guide to the Aztecs that attempts to view this somewhat enigmatic peoples in a manner that doesn't attempt to classify the ritualistic society that emerged from the Mexica Empire, but rather understand the roles of each social strata within the microcosm. There is an inevitable tendency to look at the religious perspective, focusing acutely on the human sacrifice and also on the Spanish conquest but the author shifts away (whilst having an opinion on the role of the victim) from these well-trodden paths to discussing the greater mores and individual experiences of the society.There is an extremely interesting chapter discussing the roles of wives, in particular the ascribing of fertility and maternal aspects and the circumscribing of any 'political' role. This, in turn, leads to a further discussion on the role of the mother and the 'growing' eidetism that permeates cultural perception.The text concludes with a brief chapter on the final destruction of Tenochitlan rounding off a work that brilliantly analyses Aztec ceremony and the individual's place within this society at the end of an Empire."},{"Title":"Proceedings of two highway vehicle emission inventory workshops","review":"There is really no other book quite like this on the subject. To get into it, you should have already read a book about everyday Aztec life (Soustelle or Bray for example), and have a basic knowledge of the Aztec gods, who Montezuma II was, and about the Spanish conquest. If you now know the basic facts, Clendinnen's book will make the ancient city of Mexico come to life. She doesn't explain so much what the Aztecs did and said, but why. Human sacrifice, ceremonial cannibalism, a macabre pantheon- these alien aesthetics are given a human face. We begin to see the local young warrior carrying the same small-time glamor around his neighborhood as a high school quarterback. Refreshingly, as much ink is spilled over women and children as men. Certain insights of hers are unforgettable (e.g., unlike British boarding schools, Aztecs had no use for the gentlemanly loser, winning was all.) Her writing is above a high school level, but is generally clear and direct. If you know who Tezcatlipoca and Malinche are, you will love this book. If not, come back to it when you do, to take it to the next level."},{"Title":"Proceedings of two highway vehicle emission inventory workshops","review":"A lot of books are available about Precolumbian civilizations, especially mesoamerican; Aztecs and Mayas are the most learned of all. BUT, we read always the same informations for a long time. Inga CLENDINNEN gives us &quot;An Interpretation&quot; : what kind of civilization has rizen on the plateau of Mexico-Tenochtitlan ? How to explain Aztecs's power in a region where so many people had developped cities and values such as Olmecs (in TEOTIHUACAN) or Toltecs (in TULA) ? We discover first the City and its meaning. Then, we enter the mentality of the peoples who entertain LIFE by their Death (the Victims), their Work (Warriors, Priests, Merchant) or their personal place in the society (Males, Wives, Mothers). Third, we enter the Sacred and we begin to understand how the Rituals may consolidate the society with the Fear of others... before being the plea of a revolt of vassal populations. AZTECS were strong by their military organization but weak by their believes : an entire world fearing the sun could not been able to born another day, organizing war to provide their temples with victims to their Gods, such a world had to find its limits. When the Spaniards came with their &quot;magic&quot;... Aztecs resist, but only two years. The Death of the Empire is to find in its structures self. The same, with other contexts, explains the fall of the Ancient Indian Worlds, facing the Spaniards, the French or the Englishmen. Understanding how to be strong meant to become weak, for Native Americans old civilizations, may permit the Renaissance of New Indian worlds; but here, I go beyond the Interpretation of the Author.

This story centers on Lady Syrah, the eldest daughter of the Ninth House, who has made repeated requests of the king to protect her and her brother from the evil machinations of their cousin, who has used the debilitating illness of her father as an excuse to move in and take over their castle and domain. After the cousin makes attempts to force himself on Syrah, using a forged betrothal document her addled father doesn't remember signing, she escapes along with her brother, father and a couple of loyal family retainers. Dropping out of sight, they concocted a ruse that made it look as though the family had perished at sea.Determined to regain the family estate for the young brother Eben, whom she felt responsible for, the two siblings devised an elaborate and wholly amusing plan to kidnap Jibril, the crown prince of Dominion and ransom him back to the king whom Syrah believed had forsaken her. The plan was to raise enough funds to hire a mercenary to oust her evil cousin from their home and regain it for her brother. The fact that Jibril had been the love of Syrah's young life (charmingly described in the prologue) ever since she met him at the age of 13, her treatment of him as her prisoner was a total joy as they matched wits against one another in both games of chess and love!*** In reading SHE WHO LAUGHS LAST, the debut novel for Jennie Klassel, it was certainly easy to see why she was the winner in the National Contest sponsored by Romantic Times Bookclub and publishing. She created dynamite characterizations from the lead protagonists right down to the lowliest of guards and maids who were so totally endearing that it would be hard to say just who you liked the best - and believe me there were an enormous amount of secondary characters here to choose from as well as the two totally delightful leads. I have to admit that the 14-year-old brother Eben with his tall tales, usually centering around dromedaries, was so funny I often found myself chuckling out loud. Lady Syrah was a totally divine lead who was fashioned brilliantly with intelligence, a lovely sensual aura, and a charming sense of humor. The entire ensemble of supporting characters, a beautiful plot, and vivid sensual emotions, made this a fun read and a book that I can highly recommend. --- Marilyn, for www.romancedesigns.com ---"},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"Desperate times call for desperate measures. In a public tavern, nineteen years old Lady Syrah Dhion of the Ninth House is acting the harlot with the Crown Prince of the Dominion Jibril of the First House. His wine is drugged and Syrah and her fourteen-year-old brother Eben take Jibril prisoner. The Dhions hope to restore the wealth and splendor of their house ruined by their feeble father and destroyed by their odious cousin.Syrah treats Jibril less like a royal and more like a pain until he kisses her. Soon Syrah finds her heart imprisoned by her captive. She frees Jibril, but he refuses to go because the future he wants now is to be her prisoner and she his forever once he dispatches her nasty relative.This medieval romantic romp is a fun tale that lightens up the usual intense sub-genre with plenty of humor caused by the gender war between the lead couple in which both sides surrender. The amusing story line works because of the sexual battle between Syrah and Jibril. The secondary characters augment the ribaldry that goes the gamut from slapstick to double entendres proving that Jennie Klassel has a large funny bone, but the audience has the first, middle and last laughs at the antics of the cast.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"Loved this book!!! Haven't read a good Fairy Tale romance like this in awhile. The plot was original and very inventive, taking place in some kindom in the 14th century. Lets just say it is not your standard plot. I Liked the hero, Prince Jibril, very much, but I liked the heroine... alot!! Lady Syrah was clever, smart & very resourcefull. No whining maiden here. She knew what she had to do and did it, much to the dismay of Prince Jibril and the men after her. She would show them that she was not an inferior female in any way. But in a good way. The Prince & his men sure didn't know what Lady Syrah was plotting to do next! And I as the reader didn't either!. In that respect I thought that the author Jennie Klassel was superb. Ms. Klassel did not give much away and so the story was not predictible at all. Just the kind of stories I enjoy. An added bonus was that it made me laugh. It was very funny! I chuckled throughout the Whole book!! The secondary characters were great! Lady Syrah's brother Eben was quite a stitch, weaving tales galore to throw everyone off course.I would definitely recommend this book!! By the way, Jennie Klassel was voted New Historical Voice contest winner. This novel was well written, fast paced & humorous. I definitely look forward to her next novel.

When a fever leaves their father witless, Syrah and Eben of the 9th House, find their home invaded by their awful cousin Gyp. Gyp produces a forged bethrothal and attempts to force himself on Syrah. Syrah sends three missives to the king of the Dominion and when he fails to help them she stages the drowning of Eben, several servants and herself until she can form a plan to retake their house. That plan ends up being to kidnap Crown Prince Jibril whom Syrah has always secretly loved for enough gold to hire a mercenary to rid them of Gyp. Syrah, Eben and their very imaginitave and dramatic maid manage to actually kidnap Jibril by drugging his wine and then sneaking him out in a coffin with the dreaded plague markings on it. Using their wits they manage to elude capture and hide him away on the Island of Lost Souls. When Jibril finally comes around he realizes that a small group of amateurs (two women and a young boy) have kidnapped him and his pride is wounded. He knows he is in no danger and is intrigued by the lady who leads the pack. Although they all wear hoods he is intrigued by her and after his release when he realizes who is captor was, he decides he will track her down and marry her. The only problem is his father decides to use Syrah and her brother Eben to bait the evil Gyp into showing his hand. When it appears as though Jibril has betrayed her, Syrah's heart is broken. When she realizes she is being used as bait, Syrah decides to have the last laugh and save the day her own way.the characters in this book are so funny I couldn't stop laughing. Eben's outrageously imaginative stories get them out of more than one bind and Syrah's maid Mayenne's wild fantasies of ravishment and torture are hilarious. I loved this book."},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"This book is delightful, funny, and could have served as the explaination for Women's Lib. I am 75 years old and read several authors; like Lora Leigh, Susan Phillips, J. D. Robb, Sherrilyn Kenyon, J. R. Ward, Linda Howard, Judith McNaught, and you get the drift. I laughed, snickered, nickered through my nose like a horse and tried to breath at the same time (something you really don't want do do), and generally just enjoyed the \\"fairy tale\\". While this is considered a historical novel, I could not figure out the location or the time in which this story is set. Just read and ENJOY."},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"This is really funny and a real surprise. Lady Syrah kidnaps the crown prince in order to raise money to hire a mercenary to get her home and her family's honor back. The secondary characters are great, her brother with his tall tales and a hysterical maid. The hero has a great sense of humor.This is very lighthearted and fun! It reminds me of Amanda Quicks Mystique.This is Ms. Klassel's first book and I hope there are more coming soon."},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"This is an awesome book filled with romance, adventure and intrigue. I couldn't put it down. Eban and Syrah are amazing characters and Jibril is incredibly sexy and down to earth. I can't wait for Klassel's next book. Keep them coming Dorchester!!!"},{"Title":"She Who Laughs Last","review":"I liked the pseudo-historical world the author built. I initially found the characters and the plot engaging. That said, I really had a problem with some of the heavy-handed attempts at humor. There were humorous moments in the story, certainly, but there were quite a few others that just fell flat. The author would have the characters laughing and rolling around on the ground, but the humor just wasn't there. It felt forced. And the bits where the characters were saying things like &quot;Har, har, har&quot; and &quot;Hee, hee, hee&quot; were plain dumb.Worse, though, was the fact that the author spent the whole book building up the heroine as a tactical genius just this side of Alexander the Great -- and making sure that the other characters acknowledged it -- only to have the hero and his allies do everything BUT enlist her help for the last half of the book. Yes, she's a woman, but that excuse fell flat as soon as they told her dim-bulb maid what was going on but still didn't tell the heroine. It just didn't make sense that they would go to such pains to keep her in the dark. It did nothing to increase her safety, nor did it make their plans more likely to succeed. In fact, by deliberately excluding her -- and, since she's this genius, of COURSE she's gonna figure it out -- they made her much likely to go off on her own and do something they totally won't expect. I know that we needed to have a bit more tension between the hero and heroine at that point, but to artificially preserve it in this way ruins the story.I wanted to like this book, and some of the characters were quite interesting. But its flaws REALLY annoyed me."},{"Title":"Honey Is Sweeter Than Blood","review":"5.5\\" x 8.5\\" hardcover, limited numbered edition of 250 copies signed by Thomas. 154 pages.Back in 1983, horror literature underwent a radical facelift; Stephen King saw the future of the genre, and his name was Clive Barker. In contrast to King's blue-collar, sometimes even pedestrian, mass-market writing, Barker was a breath of fresh air: erotic, innovative, astonishing, original. The same descriptors apply to Jeffrey Thomas.Thomas' world is populated with sexual predators and fumbling lovers, with normal men who find perverse pleasure in limbless women and naive puppets who enact one of the greatest love stories ever told, with gripping reality and light-hearted fantasy.Whether you travel through the looking glass to a place where a monstrous version of you is equally bored by his day job or to a future where young girls lust after \\"grandbabes\\" ('mature' older stars), the eight stories herein are sure to bring a wicked smile to your face and quickened pace to your heart. From one extreme to the next, Thomas carefully holds your hand as you make the transitions. And you are, as they say, in good hands.Forget waiting for Barker's next short story collection; Thomas offers you a new book of Blood that is more than capable of filling the void."},{"Title":"Honey Is Sweeter Than Blood","review":"I finished the book several days ago, while traveling. Comprised of several short stories - each its own - I assume the author has taken great care to walk me through a progression of tales.Go ahead - read them in order - like following a rainbow to an anticipated pot of gold, but it's not really a rainbow - and the \\"treat\\" you get at the end is not a pot of gold. This isn't the type of book you recommend casually to your friends. I'm not sure if it's even the type of book (based on the cover art alone) that I wouldn't be at least semi embarrassed to have to explain if someone went scrolling through my kindle bookshelf and saw, but it's there... and I read it, and even re-read some of the stories after I finished it the first time. Would you like it? And if you did, who would you tell?The underlying masochistic despair, longing, frustration, loneliness and sadness of the characters. Masked - roughly - with the sadistic thrill of blatant sex and deviance. Maybe they are one in the same. You'll be disgusted and excited, embarrassed and curious, and while at times you'll think \\"I shouldn't be reading this\\", you'll want to finish the book to see what dark silky sheet you get to peek under as you keep reading."},{"Title":"From Bach to Verse","review":"I enthusiastically second Judith Thomas's opinion about how good this book is, and Heifitz's goofily inspired lyrics fit the rhythm perfectly, and hilariously, in each case. I'm thrilled to find copies in the marketplace here, since friends borrowed and kept both of mine many years ago (grrr), and for some unfathomable reason it's no longer in print, and I can't remember all of these gems. A wonderful gift for musicians, music students (a fun way for them to practice sight-singing), and classical music fans. (I gave about a dozen as gifts when it first came out, and in each case the recipient would spend the next half hour minimum nodding his/her head, singing quietly, giggling manically, and going to the next piece, while fending off with elbows all the people who wanted to look at the book too. Each time.) Check out the irreverently bombastic \\"Take out the Trash\\" lyrics to Beetohoven's 5th symphony, or the recipe for Plato's favorite sandwich to a famous Brahms symphony's theme. Or the bizarrely rhythmic lyrics to the \\"Golliwog's Cakewalk.\\""},{"Title":"From Bach to Verse","review":"For those who enjoy silly turns of corner in humor, coupled with main themes of music, you will enjoy this compilation immensely. Not always obvious, we learn during a Beethoven Concerto theme, &quot;Don't play chess with your daugh - ter...she knows more than you taught.....her.&quot; The great Sigmund Freud is not safe in this collection either..paired with the chorale theme from Beethoven's 9th, &quot;Sigmund Freude never hoid a concert due to chronic slouch, All his ritzy, somewhat schitzy patients tied him to his couch.&quot; You get the idea. A delicous gift for people who get the giggles over zaney stuff."},{"Title":"From Bach to Verse","review":"I have given this book to my friends and they all have a lot of fun with it.

We are no different, today, and are only barraged with more things to kill our time (internet, 24/7 news, social media, etc.). This book will retrain and refocus your mind on your REAL priorities via the successes of others who have gone before us - and help you eliminate the unimportant waste that sabotages success, momentum, traction, skill development, confidence, LIVING WITH A PURPOSE, and thus, happiness.

It should be noted that this is not a book in the classic sense but rather a compilation of essays and chapters from individual texts written at different periods in history, by different authors and with different specialties and backgrounds.Something very stranged happened to me while reading this book. While reading the chapter written by Benjamin Franklin I began to feel that Mr. Franklin was actually sitting in the room across from me and speaking directly to me. It was pretty weird. His chapter to me is the best in the book.Although I am a firm believer in education I am equally firm in my belief that our educational system (overall) does more harm than good. A sentiment echoed by one of the books contributors. But contained within the pages of this text are all the knowledge you REALLY need to succeed in this world regardless of race, gender, religion, economic background or intelligence.Although not well read overall I have read a considerable number of self-help books. This one is the most comprehensive in scope and offers the most understandable and practical approaches towards achievement that can be applied to any area of life.A must read for anyone truly desiring success. To me the amazing thing about the world today is that we have access to the knowledge of the ages yet so few of us avail ourselves of that knowledge. So many of the answers are there yet so few will invest the meager effort to acquire them. For a few dollars and a few hours you can have it all if you are only willing to take it."},{"Title":"Og Mandino's University of Success","review":"In November of 1996, I was &quot;hearing&quot; a inner voice within me that, looking back now, was calling me to put away aimlessnes, mediocrity and an &quot;average&quot; existence, and to become a person of purpose and an achiever. I began answering that voice by purchasing this book.Three years later, I can look back, satisfied that many negative attributes and influences I used to carry with me have been extirpated from my being. While I am nowhere near my final destination of the road to achievment, I'm simply a lot better than I was before.There are an unlimited number of tools available for those who seek personal and professional development. Few, however, can match the works of Og Mandingo. But, rather than take my word for it, that is a discovery best made by yourself."},{"Title":"Og Mandino's University of Success","review":"This book is like nothing else I have ever read. It is so practically simple in its presentation, so logical, and so applicable to life that there is no way everyone reading it won't be &quot;wow-ed&quot; by it at every single chapter. Read it as Mandino recommends: at night before going to bed. Your subconscious mind will absorb the information and suddenly everything becomes clear to you. It's unbelievable. Read it and give it to everyone you know and love. It's an absolutely awesome book, and every chapter is applicable and stands alone, but read it in the sequence it's presented at bedtime. You'll be glad you did. You will not ever think again that anything is impossible. READ IT !!!!"},{"Title":"Og Mandino's University of Success","review":"I first read this book in 1984.

It contains a complete course on how to succeed, taught by 50 renowed experts in their fields. This book will advance you lesson by lesson to the world of exceptional achievement. Life is just a game but one cannot participate in this mysterious act of living with any hope of satisfaction unless one understands a few simple rules. This book provides those simple rules that will encourage fortune to smile upon you and bestow upon you a more generous portion of fame, money, power, position and freedom. In history, as in life, \\"only success counts\\". If possible, read each chapter prior to bed time. Marvellous things happen when you put your subconscious mind to work. There is a danger that you will read this book as just another entertainment. To avoid this, have a pen on your hand. When you read a line or a paragraph that is meaningful to you, underline it. You might also wish to draw a star next to certain powerful suggestions or methods that catch your fancy, or an exclamation mark or a question mark if you don't agree with them. This book consists of 50 chapters and it is impossible to delineate them all in this review. Instead, I will highlight 5 of the more salient aspects of the book. They are: (1). Personal success must exist inside if it is to exist at all. It cannot be composed of outward signs of appearance , but only by intangible personal values stemming from a mature philosophy; (2). In this country of ours everyone has the opportunity to make more of himself, in his own environment, with his own skill, with his own energy, and with his own friends; (3). By paying more wages than the average Henry Ford received more service and better service than the average. Through the inauguration of that minimum wage policy he attained the best labor in the market and placed a \\"premium\\" upon the privilege of working in his plant; (4). Will Rogers blessed the \\"directional compass\\" in life as follows: Know what you are doing. Love what you are doing. Believe in what you are doing and (5). Most \\"good luck\\" may be explained by industry and judgement, \\"bad luck\\" by a lack of these qualities. Fortune can be wooed and won by hard work.

While there are several worthwhile chapters [lessons] in this book, the greater number either read as repetitious drivel or are not particularly well written--a particularly frustrating detail when one is tired after a long day and wants to go to sleep. I've nearly finished reading this, and have noticed that some of the later chapters would've made more sense to me if they'd preceded earlier chapters. So, to give the potential reader a more realistic set of expectations, I'd entitle this book &quot;The Community College of Success&quot;."},{"Title":"Dining by Fireflies - Unexpected Pleasures of the New South","review":"It is fun to see all-out entertaining in this book. They make sample invitations and themes, even signed with very southern names. I realize this isn't indicative of the entire south, but it's fun to see plans for a &quot;Thursday lunch&quot; and a &quot;supper club&quot;, a few themes which would be way out of character for my circle. It is a wonderful fantasy, though. The recipes are easy and very good with nice photographs. This is a book that is as much fun to read as it is functional. The pears en croute alone are a good enough reason to buy the book. It is set into various themes and occasions which I find helpful, however the only one they left out was a baby or bridal shower! It's a great book. If you liked this book, I'd suggest &quot;Specialties of the House&quot; from the Biltmore Estate."},{"Title":"Dining by Fireflies - Unexpected Pleasures of the New South","review":"This is great book because it is organized by menus which are centered around themes (and not just holiday themes).

Loved it. Feeling guilty for not writing a review on a book that had such a positive impression on me so here goes :)It is a spiritual journey into Awakening to who we are. Not who our mind/ego thinks we are. We were taught those things by others and our own experiences. I wonder: \\"What if we didn't have those influences? Who would we think we are then?\\""},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"\\"Sudden Awakening\\" is one of those rare gems that succeeds in taking an idea many seem to think must be very complex, and clearly presenting it with easily understood language and ideas. Not only does Jaxon-Bear offer insights for the individual, he also offers all of humanity the glimpse of a possible future that is free from suffering. And he does so, without sending his readers on a confusing journey through 800 pages of convoluted prose.I had the good fortune to read this book shortly before attending a weekend retreat and Satsang with Jaxon-Bear, and I found him to be a profoundly insightful and compassionate Teacher, both in person and in writing. \\"Sudden Awakening\\" offers readers an invitation to self-examine, ask difficult (and not always pleasant) questions, and find the silence and love that is already within us, underneath this trance called \\"the ego.\\" Unlike some spiritual teachers, Jaxon-Bear does not talk about \\"killing\\" the ego. Instead, he points out that it has been a very real and possibly essential survival strategy for us-- up to *this* point-- but that now it is no longer serving us. And it is our \\"ego fixation\\" that has lead to a sense of \\"duality,\\" that is, the idea that we are somehow \\"separate\\"-- from God, from others, even from life itself.In this book, Jaxon-Bear uses simple (and at times funny) teaching stories to lead the reader on a journey from the invitation to embrace freedom; to understanding the nature of \\"reality;\\" to understanding the nature of mind, ego and ego-development; to finally understanding Who We Really Are, so we can awaken and be the silence and love that has always been right here.Final thoughts: Highly recommended (9.5 out of a possible 10 bookmarks). This is one of the best teachings on Non-Duality I have read, and is an easy-- and potentially life-changing-- read for the spiritual seeker who is ready to \\"find\\" and wake up from the trance."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"I found myself deeply engaged reading this book... and smiling a lot.Eli's expression is fresh, deeply insightful, but very easy and enjoyable to read. I experienced a wonderful balance between a ruthless pointing to my own experience of what is un-examined and unconscious - and a lightness of being... a confirmation and support to realize that what I truly want and love, is what I already am, right now.To those readers who are just hearing the liberating words of truth (spoken by one who is realizing it) for the first time, this book offers a powerful and clear initiation and invitation to awaken. To those fortunate enough to have already received that redemptive instant of Grace, this book offers deep support for staying true to what Grace has revealed. It is an offering of love and wisdom from a deeply realized Teacher.One of the liberating insights that I have received from this book (that is still reverberating) is to view the function of the \\"ego\\" from the point of view of the DNA, with its programmed imperative to survive and replicate. I really got how what is called \\"ego\\", which is the experience of being a separate something, is just an advanced program for survival! I can see that at one stage in the evolution of our species it was effective and likely necessary, but now it is outdated and ironically the greatest threat to the human DNA's survival.As a result of trying on this perspective, something unexpected happened. It uncovered a sense of shame that I had felt during all the years (or lifetimes) when I experienced deep suffering by imagining myself to be separate from God, my own heart and all of life. Understanding the impersonal and functional role of the \\"ego\\" allowed this hidden shame to surface and discharge into an experience of compassion for this human ordeal of life experienced as a separate self.Eli is clearly an Ally and Friend to those who are called to realize the truth that lies beneath the appearance, and to be in service to that. I hope his book finds a wide audience and that it serves to stop the reader's mind, allowing attention to fall into direct experience and reveal the lasting peace that is already present."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"For anyone who sincerely wants to have the truth laid out clearly, and concisely, leaving no traps of the mind unexposed, and who wants to receive a transmission of silence that your heart will recognize from every page - this book will be deeply satisfying. Eli Jaxon-Bear is able to transmit the truth in person and by the written word. Reading this book is being with your own self, not in any kind of New Age dream of enlightenment that just pleases the ego with a spiritual story, but in a real, tangible way that can give you the taste of what is actually possible for humanity, here and now. It is a very timely book, because when we look around and see that so many people are fed up with the results of business as usual, this book offers a real alternative, a radical shift of consciousness, that is so needed.I am very grateful that this book was written, and that it's so freely available."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"After reading Joko Beck's Everyday Zen, and being thoroughly disappointed, having been left standing on the platform as the train swished by, resigned to a life of \\"hard work and practice\\" - according to Beck - I picked up Sudden Awakening and found hope again; that one can actually *get on* the \\"Freedom Train\\", as he calls it, and realize \\"Cosmic Beingness.\\" Sudden Awakening is a breath of fresh air. Is light, humerous, with simple stories and metahpors to help create the space of understanding. On a few occasions I found the languaging a bit confusing, and a few times I questioned the \\"awakeness\\" of the author himself as he seems to suggest on the one hand that it is our \\"Cosmic Beingness\\" that is \\"waking up\\" (as other authors have also suggested) and on the other says that \\"we\\" wake up - does he mean the \\"ego\\" wakes up? Others say this is not the case. Also one other glitch is he seems to suggest that \\"Conscious Silence\\" is a \\"power of mind\\" after having said that the mind is a trance, part of Maya. Conscious Silence is *beyond* mind, is Isness itself.All in all it is a good read, although others, like Awakening to the Dream by Leo Hartong, are better."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"You have to be at a certain place on your spiritual path to appreciate this book. When I read it, I felt like Eli Jaxon-Bear was speaking directly to me. Anyone on a spiritual path would benefit from this book. I would recommend buying it so that you will at least have it when the time is right. You will know when that is. Sudden Awakening is a valuable tool for those who have worked through and understand about the illusion of our existance here and are ready for the next step. Unity. It clarifies what enlightenment is and the misconceptions of how you get there. This book is the next step in getting to know who you really are."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"Eli Jaxon-Bear offers readers a fascinating and easy to understand guide to awakening to what is already present within all of us. He discusses the ego, how the stories we use to define our lives limit us and the necessity of surrendering control of factors in our lives that we feel serve to protect us but ultimately limit us from finding our true selves."},{"Title":"Sudden Awakening: Into Direct Realization","review":"After reading this book, I can finally relax in my life. If you are someone who likes to go deep, and root around for answers this book might help. Even though it's pretty short book, it's not an easy read. I found that I had to re-read 90% of the pages in order to let it sink in.

It is easy to use, for the order and presentation of each of the articles is very clear, and it gives a great amount of information on usage and style. Le Bon Usage helps the learners discover new features of the language and it offers the professionals (such as Translators or Teachers) very useful tips as to the usage of words, expressions, and verbs that are specific to the French language, making its contents clear through a great variety of examples. Just like in his other books, M. Grevisse does a thorough and excellent research of the French language to offer us readers one of the best works on usage of French ever written."},{"Title":"Le Bon Usage: Grammaire Francaise (French and English Edition)","review":"This is the end-all and be-all of French grammar. It is expensive, but you will use if for the rest of your life (or as long as you keep up your interest in French). Indispensable for anyone who teaches French - even bizarre grammar questions arise in conversational classes, and this is the one book that will give you the complete answer where other grammars simply leave much to be desired. This reference is not really suitable for beginning students, and might be challenging for intermediate students. But if you are an intermediate student, you owe it to yourself to at least look through it. Even if you can only afford an older edition, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Le Bon Usage: Grammaire Francaise (French and English Edition)","review":"Being a fairly advanced French speaker who hopes to continue his studies of the language throughout college, I bought this volume as a means of ensuring that I understood the tougher grammatical aspects of French. Needless to say, at 1760 pages, Le Bon Usage is daunting; however, with such monstrous size comes an absolute thoroughness on the subject which is, at present, unmatched. I must confess that rarely do I ever open up this book due to the availability of information on the Internet -- available within seconds -- though it obviously helps to produce some sort of finality on any topic."},{"Title":"Le Bon Usage: Grammaire Francaise (French and English Edition)","review":"I have gotten excellent help with editing in French by using this encyclopedic reference work.

Special publication)","review":"This is a classic work in Hawaiian literature. Written approx in 1840, the author bridges an ancient,pagan, pre-Cook Hawaiian world; and a new world of foreigners, private property, diseases, Christianity, and a struggle to maintain a Hawaiian identity.Malo describes many aspects of ancient Hawaiian life and culture, including tools and technology, land tenure, religious practices, politics, agriculture, medicine, games and amusements, marriage and family life, etc. This text is still considered a primary source for knowledge of Hawaiian culture in the era before Captain Cook sailed into Kealakekua Bay.Malo never quite mastered the English language, so Hawaiian Antiquities was written in Hawaiian. It is one of the few books in the canon of texts written in Hawaiian. It is especially valuable to linguists to have been written by a native speaker, and is essential to the modern study of Hawaiian grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.Of particular interest are the many &quot;mele&quot; (songs) quoted. Malo believed, as many people still do, that the &quot;mele&quot; was the highest Hawaiian art form, integrating music, poetry, and hula, often in a religious context.Malo himself seems a somewhat dispeptic sort. A Christian minister in the rigid mold of the Protestant missionaries, he disdained many of the customs and practices he describes. He occasionally disparages the primitive technology and culture of his people. Yet for all his prejudice, Malo's tone is usually dispassionate and objective.He gets a few facts wrong. (Hawaiian surfboards may have been long, but they were never 30-40 feet long.) Modern cultural anthropologists must surely cringe at his omissions and technique. And modern Hawaiian language teachers are still sorting out his spelling and grammatical errors (hey, do you speak perfect English?)But nobody disagrees that we are very lucky to have this book."},{"Title":"Hawaiian antiquities (Moolelo Hawaii) (Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. Special publication)","review":"David Malo, a Hawaiian, was born around 1793, died in 1853. He left behind his record of Hawaiian life, translated by N. Emerson in 1898. Malo became a Christian minister, and this influenced his interpretation and presentation of this material. Emerson wrote, in his introduction to this volume, \\"Though nurtured in the superstitious faith and cult of old Hawaii, and though a man of tenacious opinions, when the light reached him [I assume this was a \\"religious light\\"], the old errors were dissipated with the darkness, as clouds are dissolved by the rising sun, and his [Malo's] whole intellectual and moral nature felt the stimulus and burst forth with a new growth\\" (p. xiii). This hints at both Malo's biases, as well as the biases of Emerson. So we use this volume as a hint at ancient Hawaii, not as the definitive reference on old Hawaii.Here are some examples:There was a chapter on making stone axes. Malo states \\"Now come new kinds of axes from the lands of the white man. But iron had reached Hawaii before the arrival of the foreigner, a jetsam iron which the chiefs declared sacred to the gods [I assume this was iron pieces connected to wood washing up on beaches from shipwrecks]... Iron is plentiful now, and so are all kinds of iron tools, including the kitchen ax, the hatchet, the adz, broad-ax, chisel, etc. These are the new tools which have been imported. The stone-ax ('koi-pohaku') is laid aside\\" (p. 51-52). This hints at the substitution of one technology for another, and the loss of the first.\\"It was the policy of the government to place the chiefs who were destined to rule, while they were still young, with wise persons, that they might be instructed by skilled teachers in the principles of government, be taught the art of war, and be made to acquire personal skill and bravery\\" (p. 53). This may have been an idealized goal, but I doubt this occurred as a manner of policy.\\"The feathers of birds were the most valued possessions of the ancient Hawaiians\\" (p. 76)... \\"The carved whale tooth, or 'niho-palaoa', was a decoration worn by high chiefs who alone were allowed to possess this ornament. They were not common in the ancient times, and it is only since the reign of Kamehameha I that they have become somewhat more numerous\\" (p. 77). I assume this was due to whale teeth trading from the visiting ships.\\"Salt was one of the necessaries and was a condiment used with fish and meat, also as a relish with fresh food\\" (p. 123).\\"Water, which was one of the essentials of a meal, to keep one from choking or being burned with hot food...\\" (p. 123).\\"Sharks' teeth were the means employed in Hawaii nei for cutting the hair. The instrument was called 'niho-ako-lauoho'. The shark's tooth was firmly bound to a stick, then the hair was bent over the tooth and cut through with a sawing motion. If this method caused too much pain another resource was to use fire\\" (p. 123).\\"A ship was like a section of the earth quietly moving through the water. On account of their great size, when the first ships arrived here, people flocked from remote districts to view them. Great were the benefits derived from these novel craft, the like which had never been seen before. ...Many blessings have come to this race through these new sea-going craft. It was by them the word of God was conveyed to these shores, which is a blessing greater than any sought for by the ancients\\" (p. 132).In his preface, David Malo wrote: \\"I do not suppose the following history to be free from mistakes, in that the material for it has come from oral traditions; consequently it is marred by errors of human judgment and does not approach the accuracy of the word of God.\\"I agree, but this has to be one of best, and most complete, remaining first-person recollections of old Hawaii. For those interested, this is an essential reference."},{"Title":"Hawaiian antiquities (Moolelo Hawaii) (Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. Special publication)","review":"You need to read the book.

Buddy Carter is a gifted writer, possessed with the talents of both his very gifted parents. I knew Billy and Sybil since the mid sixties, and Buddy has captured the essence of both. His mother is also worthy of a book, her experiences with Billy would be an ideal subject for a future Faulkner. Congratulations, Buddy, on an outstanding job. I could not put it down.

With such a large family, they agree that it would be easier for everyone if they flew the Rolls Royce over too as it could accomodate all of them on their excursions. When they finally arrive at the small, shabby hotel, the owner, Madame Dupont, wrongly assumes that anyone who could afford to drive such a magnificent car, has to be a Mi'lord and treats Pop as such. The usual mix ups with food, drink and language occur and when the owner discovers, by means of their passports, that Ma and Pop aren't legally married, it's put down to the eccentricities of the English aristocracy.

The first time I ever heard of Set Free was when I was up in Berkeley, Ca. at an outreach they did in 1990. I was stoned and seen a young girl who I tried to flirt with. The next thing I knew, this girl,Desiree, started telling me about Jesus. I listened and got her phone number, and a few weeks later I called her from my moms house in Santa Ana, Ca. For the next few months I went to church with her. The first Sunday I went, I responded to the altar call Pastor Phil gave. I got involved. I went with them on a couple of outreaches. But then I couldn't stay with my mom anymore. Instead of going into the ranch or the homes, like I could of done. I went back to the streets, back to the drugs, and eventually, back to jail.While in jail, I wrote to Pastor Phil, and also called a few times (collect). While in jail, besides my mom and Uncle, Pastor Phil is the Only one who wrote to me. When I got out, I went to the Ranch and then to the Homes. This was in 1991. After a couble of months in the homes, I heard some of the allegations that were be spread arround about Set Free. I used that for an excuse and left. The real truth though, I did want to work at it anymore, and I was itching for the old friends who all forgot about me while I was in jail.Well in 1994 I got radically saved in Alabama. Me and My wife have been living for the Lord since then. Now we live in Michigan with our to boys. Currently I am working on Set Free University lessons through correspondence. One last thing I want to say, as is seen in this book, when I turned my back on Set Free, they still loved me. When I was running from Jesus, it seemed everywhere I would go, somebody with a Set Free T-Shirt on would tell me that Jesus loved me and gave his life for me.

It is a gut-wrenching story of vicious hate and intent to destroy another man's ministry, credibility, and reputation. This story (SAD but TRUE) has the makings of a suspense-filled box-office movie.

These firms typically scout for a few skill sets. One is general brainpower, as hard as that is to measure. Another is the more difficult math in finance, derivatives pricing. This book covers both in a quick and easy format to let you see where you stand. Moreover, if you can master the material in the book then you will be ready for the majority of an entry-level interview.The derivatives questions cover \\"plain vanilla\\" options pricing and some basic understanding of the principles behind the formulas. Most firms want to see that you know the terms in the Black-Scholes equation and how options prices depend on things.The earlier part of the book I find even more impressive. It's a nearly comprehensive list of the brain-teasers you get in this process. That's where the employer is trying to measure general brainpower. Of course, a brain-teaser you haven't seen before will give you pause and maybe elude you in the stress of an interview. But after reading this book the answers could be at the ready. The set of brain-teasers through history is actually very small. That is after distilling all the variations on them such as whether you are weighing coins or cannonballs and such. And that set of puzzles, questions designed to test basic reasoning and logic, without depending on formal math, is well covered in this book. In fact, in many interviews I have only encountered one single brain-teaser that is not in this book (and it's not a very good one either).Finally Mr. Crack inserts notes on the culture of banks which might scare or excite the prospective employee. This book is both good orientation and preparation for starting a career in finance.It is still relevant and helpful ten years later. That said, there is one area this book totally misses (because of what's happened in the past ten years). That is programming questions. Especially in the past couple of years most interviews will look for some software development skill on top of the general brainpower and command of financial derivatives. Tests on C++ or OOP are common these days. For that material you have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Heard on the street: Quantitative questions from Wall Street job interviews","review":"I bought this book for fun. I like brain teasers and since this includes finance problems it is fun and keeps me sharp. For interview preparation it is good, since it doesn't only include quantitative questions but also includes economics and logic and general interview questions.

Only in the case of securitization jobs would an i-banker be expected to know much of these questions. Many of the questions relate purely to derivatives, which an i-banker who will be spending the next 5 years valuing companies on spreadsheets will not be expected to know at the level of the questioning.

Then buy this book, and make it all yourself.This book has great projects, the designs are easy to follow, and the descriptions take you through the build step by step.Aside from general home mainenance -- installing a new doorknob, putting up a wall shelf, etc. -- I had never actually built anything until getting this book. In three separate weekends in January I was able to make an Adirondack chair and ottoman, and a arts &amp; crafts looking outdoor endtable to go with it. Plus, by making just those three things, I've already recouped my costs for the tools I needed to buy to build them.This book has been great for me (a woodworking BEGINNER), and has inspired me to build and learn more about making furniture.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is either interested in getting into woodworking, or just wants some good, easy plans for outdoor furniture."},{"Title":"Building for the lawn and garden","review":"This is a terrific book for weekend projects-my husband and I built the glider swing in a weekend and it was very easy. We do have lots of previous woodworking experience but could tell that someone with less or no experience would be able to follow the instructions. Since we do have some experience there were a few things we noticed-check your shopping list against your cut list and see what the cheapest way of buying your wood will be. We found that we didn't need a few of the boards we bought (but if you plan on building more of the projects, this is not really a problem!). Also, look at the picture of the finished project and check it against your hardware list. We found that we were missing 4 spring loaded snap rings (the book calls for 4-you will need 8). All things considered, the book is great and has projects that anyone can build! If you were to buy many of these items they would cost you three to four times as much as it does to build them."},{"Title":"Building for the lawn and garden","review":"I really love this book. It shows you step by step with easy to follow instructions how to build each project. However, when I built the rectangular picnic table I found that the measurements given in the book for the legs were wrong. The book says to cut the legs 29&quot;. Unless you are Asian and plan and sitting on the ground or floor to eat, these are way to short. I found that 39&quot; was too tall. So I think the correct measurement should be around 35&quot;. Anyway, check the measurements for feasibility before you cut your lumber.Good book overall."},{"Title":"Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn","review":"I'm only 79 pages into this book and there are too many errors making this a very difficult read because everything must be checked and verified (it takes away from the pleasure of having faith in the author and just being able to read and enjoy).Error 1: p. 10 - Quote attributed to White Bull (Cheyenne) is really Young Two MoonError 2: p. 10 - Quote attributed to Red Horse is really She Walks with Her ShawlError 3: p. 36 - soldiers were paid $13/month, not a dayError 4: p. 37 - Lt. James Sturgis graduated West Point on June 16, 1875, not May 1867Error 5: The author consistently refers to Phillip Henry Sheridan as Phillip N. SheridanError 6: Although Shoshones participated in the Battle of the Rosebud, Washakie was not one of themIt's not too good when you lose faith in the author, especially when it pertains to relaying accurate information.And these are the errors I caught, there might be others.January 1, 2006There are numerous errors throughout this book, but I must add the following one to my earlier review:Kershaw relates the following story on page 178.[John] Stands In Timber sees Standing Bear get too close to the soldiers and killed. Wow!!! First of all, John Stands In Timber was a Cheyenne tribal historian and born eight years after the battle. Secondly, the warrior killed was named either Breech Cloth or Long Road. Standing Bear survived the battle and his narrative can be found in The Sixth Grandfather by DeMallie. I have to wonder if Kershaw actually read his source books or just skimmed through them looking for information. This book has potential but the author needs a lot of help in revising it and cleaning up all the errors. I'm available.06-26-06To H. Price:I read your critique of my review. However, you are in error, and so was J.W. Vaughn. Vaughn, and several other authors, assumed Washakie was in the battle based on some newspaper writer speaking of a Shoshone chief. Historians wrongly assumed it was Washakie. However, if you read John G. Bourke, On the Border with Crook (Bison Book edition, p. 334), he clearly states that Washakie didn't appear until July 11. The Rosebud battle occurred on June 17. So I stick by my statement -- Washakie was not in the Battle of the Rosebud. And if you insist that he was, find me a first-hand reference stating that he was."},{"Title":"Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn","review":"My compliments to Robert Kershaw for writing a short but comprehensive -- and well-reasoned -- study of one of the most controversial episodes in American military history: the Battle of the Little Big Horn. I don't know that Kershaw has pioneered any particularly startling new interpretations of the battle, but he has synthesized a solid account of the battle, enlivened by focusing his narrative at many points upon individual experiences, drawn from both white and Indian primary sources. I think it can be well appreciated by someone as yet unfamiliar with the intricacies of the Little Big Horn affair, yet it still offers food for thought for those of us who have spent years pondering those events."},{"Title":"Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn","review":"This is an excellent book that gives the reader an early history of events leading to the Little Big Horn. It was apparent that the Indians were no longer running when meeting a large American forces, but instead standing and fighting almost to the death. This was apparent in the Red Cloud Fettermen battle and later the Battle of The Rosebud where Crook was almost defeated by the same tribes that would, in only a few weeks, distroy Custer.Kershaw's maps, pictures and detailed drawing of the events are really good and present themselves in a way that causes one to think of the possible many errors Custer made on his way to the Little Big Horn.There are several editing errors in this book but none I believe takes a way from a work that presents Custer's many tactical errors in this battle. After all The Battle of The Little Big Horn did not take place in a vacumn. I have visited the battle site twice and read many books on the subject but Kershaw presents a new way at looking at this battle and his many idea's and explanations gives additional points at viewing this battle.Along with excellent detailed drawings, mays and a excellent use of tactical and logistical ideas makes this book a wonderful read, and an injoyable one. This works clearly belongs to nay serious student of the Little Big Horn and I believe will add new idead that are hard to dispute."},{"Title":"Red Sabbath: The Battle of Little Bighorn","review":"For \\"naiche\\" from Brooklyn who wants to edit this book, you are incorrect regarding at least one of your alleged error finds in this book.

There are so many mistakes that stick out you dont even have to be a student of the battle to spot them.

He identifies the lack of Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield(IPB), combat effectiveness of the Regiment and fatigue that ultimately leads to mission failure. He also skillfully identifies likely the first clear case of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the US Army which causes Major Reno to mentally breakdown during the battle. Without a doubt the best analysis of the Indian force structure, tactics and leadership to date.

I've never learned classical Greek.Whoa, devoted friends, before you storm off in disillusionment, be advised that there's worse to come...If I did undertake to learn Greek in my dotage, as I.F. Stone did, I wouldn't be aiming to read the Gospels or the Pauline Epistles. Nor the dialogues of Plato nor even the Ethics of Aristotle.What I'd really like to read in the original would be the Comedies of Aristophanes.Phanny, as I call him for short, was the funniest guy who ever lived, and this play \\"Frogs\\" is, according to my funny bone, the funniest of all.The title and the \\"brekek kek koax\\" refer to the chorus of frogs that Dionysius silences while crossing the lake at the entrance to Hades, on his self-appointed mission to retrieve the tragic playwright Euripides from the underworld. Meanwhile his servant, the mortal Xanthias, the prototype of Sancho Panza and every other whacky sidekick servant in literature, is sent running around the lake and meets his master near the palace of Pluto. Dionysius and Xanthias change clothes, back and forth in slapstick uproar, and then summon the 'ghosts' of Euripides and Aeschylus to engage in a contest for the right to the chair of honor next to Pluto's throne. Sophocles, however, declines to compete out of reverence for Aeschylus. The competition is hilarious and exposes both tragedians to more mockery than praise. A modern reader with no foreknowledge of Greek drama, I hasten to admit, will NOT get most of the jokes here, but then, hey, I almost never understand the humor in an Adam Sandler film.Frogs is more than snarky fun at the expense of the 'serious' dramatists. It's also a political satire of the dilemma the Athenians have gotten themselves into with their democratic indecisiveness. Specifically, the wisest course to take with that talented scoundrel Alcibiades, the tutee of Socrates, is dependent on the choice of Euripides versus Aeschylus as a 'teacher' of ethics through the public spectacle of drama. No writer has ever made a stronger case for the relevance and significance of 'literature' to society than Phanny, in this bizarre comedy.There are numerous translations of Frogs, some dedicated to textual accuracy and scholarship, some committed to wit and stage-worthiness. This version is of the former sort. It's a reading translation, with ample notes and clarifications, and that's what I'd recommend for a first encounter with Phanny. There's a slangy, anachronistic translation by R.H. Webb, included in the cheap Bantam edition of all eleven surviving plays, which is funnier but not as historically informative."},{"Title":"The Frogs","review":"On the one hand Aristophanes's comedy \\"The Frogs\\" is a farce, but it is of more interest because it presents the earliest known example of dramatic criticism. Presented in 405 B.C., the play tells of how Dionysus, the god of drama, had to go to Hades to fetch back Euripides, who died the previous year, because Athens no longer had any great tragic poets left. The first part of the comedy involves Dionysus, who has disguised himself as Heracles, and his slave Xanthias on their way to Hades and features several interesting songs by the chorus of blessed mystics and the chorus of frogs. However, the high point of the comedy is the contest between Euripides and Aeschylus.Each of the two great tragic poets denounces the other and quotes lines from their own works to prove their superiority. We discover that Euripides writes about vulgar themes, corrupts manners, debases music and has prosaic diction. In contrast, Aeschylus finds obscure titles and is guilty of turgid prose. In the end Dionysus finds that artistic standards of judgment are useless and turns to a political solution. This makes sense since the problem facing Athens is a political one: what to do about the tyrant Alcibiades. What is most interesting is the implicit belief that the tragic poets had a social responsibility towards the audiences of their dramas.\\"Frogs,\\" in addition to being one of the better comedies by Aristophanes, is also of interest because it contains the only fragments from several tragedies by Euripides and Aeschylus that have been long lost to us. As always, I urge that if you are studying Greek plays, whether the comedies of Aristophanes or the tragedies by those other more serious fellows, it is important to understand the particular structure of these plays and the various dramatic conventions of the Greek theater. This involves not only the distinction between episodes and stasimons (scenes and songs), but elements like the \\"agon\\" (a formal debate on the crucial issue of the play), and the \\"parabasis\\" (in which the Chorus partially abandons its dramatic role and addresses the audience directly)."},{"Title":"The Frogs","review":"As the only ancient Greek comedian whose work has survived, Aristophanes' importance is impossible to exaggerate. He has not only immensely influenced comedy - and drama and literature generally - but is also practically the only source giving any idea what Greek comedy was like, making his work of immense historical value. Of course, as with all comedy that is truly universal, one need not know or even think about any of this. He is more than entertaining in his own right - indeed, still screamingly funny. Reading him, we get a profound sense of just how little comedy has changed. It is not just that what was funny nearly 2,500 years ago is still funny; techniques are basically unchanged, subject matter only being ephemeral. Aristophanes was above all a satirist, which inevitably means that many of the things he mocked and parodied are no longer intelligible without notes. We can still appreciate these with help, but what truly makes him worth reading is that the spirit of the satire - what really matters in contrast to passing fodder - continues to shine through distinctly. Human folly has changed little - has probably only increased if anything. His general observations are thus still funny - and, to those who look below the surface, still damning. Perhaps more immediately, it is striking to see that humor many think of as distinctly modern - religious blasphemy, bathroom humor, sexual humor - was as common and at least as good this long ago. Aristophanes also delights in more \\"serious\\" humor like puns and other wordplay; simply put, whether one prefers high- or low-brow, he has something for all. Humor aside, his sheer creativity still impresses; his plots and characters show near-boundless imagination and would be a significant accomplishment in even the most ostensibly serious artist. All this makes him almost unbelievably accessible - in translation of course; his tragedian contemporaries take a certain mindset and considerable dedication to appreciate, all but excluding casual readers. However, anyone can read Aristophanes with enjoyment, which is not the least of his virtues.The Frogs may be Aristophanes' masterpiece. He satirized tragedians frequently, but this is notable in focusing almost entirely on them; indeed, Aeschylus and Euripides are characters. It ostensibly does little more than roast the latter in the former's favor and would be entertaining enough if it did nothing else; whether or not we agree, it is hard to deny some of the mocking points - and impossible not to laugh. However, there is far more to the play; it essentially delineates the two main ways that Athenians looked at the world as epitomized by these dramatists. The pros and cons of both are shown, but Aristophanes clearly favors the Aeschylean mode, poking relentless fun at the Euripidean. This had great sociopolitical significance for many reasons - not least because of looming war - but was also broadly philosophical, which is why it is still very much pertinent. But again, one need not worry that humor is lacking; the play is downright hilarious and has Aristophanes' funniest and most memorable songs. It is quite simply one of the best comedies ever."},{"Title":"The Frogs","review":"While &#34;The Frogs&#34; is full of satire, self-mockery, and lots of Greek humor, you wouldn't know it from this translation. I honestly think it's worth the $2-3 to purchase a modern translation (either online or check your local used bookstore), so that you can enjoy the play rather than wading through syrupy, old-fashioned language that saps the life out of the play."},{"Title":"The Frogs","review":"This is not one of Aristophanes' more accessible plays.

Despite how hopelessly episodic this piece tends to be, some of the scenes sill really do stand out. The bit where Dionysus talks with the corpse is pretty damn funny. The trial between the two playwrights at the end is a bit dull, even if you have read all of their stuff. Lysistrata is a lot more accessible with its themes of social protest and sexuality.

The action in the book is sparse, but there are a few tense moments where you worry just a bit for Buffy. Like the previous books, the focus of this book is mostly on Buffy, Xander, and Willow... with a little Giles thrown in the pot, but so far, in this book and the ones before it, Cordelia and Angel content has been lacking. The mood of this book is not quite as dark as _Halloween Rain_, but I found the book very well-written... but lacking in the &quot;teen-talk&quot; and &quot;Xanderisms&quot; the television series is known for.

Like the previous volumes this was a very well-done book. I don't know if the series has a better bible than others but so far all of the characters act just as they would be expected to on the show.At the end of Summer a carnival comes to Sunnydale. Shortly after that, coyotes are seen closer to town than usual. Buffy starts to get the wiggins about the carnival and finds some minor evidence that they are involved in something not normal. Eventually a plot involving werecoyotes and skinwalkers is revealed. Unfortunately for the townsfolk the plot involves the carnies seducing and slaughtering a number of Sunnydale's young folk. In the end Buffy triumphs and curses are lifted.While this volume is quite good it is not canonical. The events take place at a time that we now know Buffy was not in Sunnydale. This puts it in a class with many of the Star Trek books. So if you consider this an old episode you missed then it works out quite well. Unfortunately these books are a little hard to find because they are being marketed towards young adults (hah, my 78 year-old father is one of the show's biggest fans)."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"Although I enjoyed the book, the end was just to simple.

Most of us have been to a carnival at least once in our lives and have imagined what it is really like once all the people are gone and the lights go out. This book tells us the behind the scenes scoop of this particular carnival and the sudden appearance of a pack of coyotes that end up terrorizing Sunnydale. As always in all the Buffy books, Buffy and her friends come out on top but not before tangling one on one with a new breed of monster. Even though I am older than the expected audience for this book, I am a fan of the show and really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"Coyote Moon author John Vornholt does a good job of translating our favorite Sunnydale regulars from the little screen to the written form. The Pre-Oz Willow crush on Xander is explored as is the reocurring theme in the tv show of Buffy feeling alienated from the rest of teendom by her enormous responsibilities. In this highly entertaining novel, Buffy and the gang are on summer break from school. Our slayer is bored with a noticeable lack of action since there are few vampires to slay and school is out. A seedy carnival rolls into town promising the perfect culmination to the summer vacation. The gang gets more than they bargain for when a quest for greasy food, and a few cheap carnival thrills give way to a summer romance for both Xander and Willow (though not with each other to the latter's chagrin). When coyotes start acting in a bizarre way throughout Sunnydale, Buffy becomes suspicious and she is convinced that there is something evil behind this carnival. Yet, Buffy is alone in her quest to find the truth behind the coyotes because her friends are mesmorized by a pair of young carnival workers. The elements of Joss Whedon's creation are firmly in place here: Giles does research, Xander reacts as any teenage boy would when wooed by a mysterious member of the opposite sex, and the Slayer is as perky and as tough as portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar. This is a must read for any true fan of the Slayer."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" is the best television show ever aired. That's pretty much all there is to it. I love the series, I love the spin-offAngel - Complete Series Collector's Setand I love the official continuation we've been getting this year through the medium of comics. I've played the video games, I've bought the soundtracks, and I've met James Marster. But yet I had never read an entire Buffy novel. I did startQueen of the Slayers (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), but I had to put it down because of Holder's bad writing. But, with this book, I decided to give Buffy novels a second try.There were a few things I really liked. The plot is very focused, with every plot thread pulling us in towards the major story, which is a creative one. Skin-walkers were never touched on in the actual show, so it was interesting to see something different pop up here. As a writer, John Vornholt is talented, and he handles the story well. Even during the parts of this book I didn't love, I never felt the desire to put it down or to read something else.What I didn't like was some of the characterization. Buffy is pretty much in character, though she says a few things that would never come out of the character's mouth, and the term \\"wiggins\\" is used too often and also incorrectly. Xander is a caricature of himself and Willow's character is, for the most part, driven solely by her crush on Xander. Giles is the worst. In this book, Vornholt turned one of the most interesting BtVS characters into a stereotypical fuddy-duddy who cowers in the face of danger. Vornholt also misunderstands the fundamentals of the Slayer/Watcher relationship. There are many instances in this short book where Buffy either \\"puts Giles in his place\\" or tells him something along the lines of \\"I thought I told you to ____!\\" Giles accepts these orders as if he is simply her employee. Even though this book was published early in the series, there was absolutely nothing in the first season of the show to suggest Buffy was Giles' boss, because she just isn't. Another problem with this book was the timeline. While it isn't a big deal, as the book isn't part of the canon, it's annoying that there is no logical way to fit the events of this book into the series. On a stretch, it could take place right before Episode 2:02, but the book implies that Buffy spent the summer in Sunnydale after \\"Prophecy Girl.\\" Which she, as the fans know, did not.Characterization and timeline errors aside, \\"Coyote Moon\\" was good enough to convince me to give other Buffy books a try.5/10"},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"COYOTE MOONBY JOHN VORNHOLT (1998)RATING: 3/5 StakesSETTING: First Season (summer)CAST APPEARANCES: Buffy, Xander, Willow, Giles, CordeliaORIGINAL CHARACTERS: Rose, Lonnie, Hopscotch (werecoyotes); Dr. Henshaw (friendly doctor); Spurs Hardaway (villian)BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY\\"The seedy carnival looks like just the thing to give Buffy and her best buds, Xander and Willow, a break from staking bloodsuckers. Some greasy food, a few cheap thrills--what more could a Slayer ask for? But then Buffy senses something evil behind this carnival. Xander and Willow aren't so sure. They don't buy Buffy's notion that the carneys are somehow connected to the corposes turning up around Sunnydale. It doesn't help that her two best friends are each interested in someone at the carnival. Which puts the burden of proof on Buffy. Can she find out what's going on in time to save her friends? Or has the Slayer become the prey?\\"REVIEWCoyote Moon, the second original Buffy novel, is a solid if unspectacular story about the arrival of werecoyotes in Sunnydale (disguised as a carnival) and their attempt to resurrect their long-dead leader. Buffy spends most of the novel attempting to gain proof of the carneys' true nature (with Giles' help), while Xander and Willow are seduced by two of the carneys. Xander's terribly luck with the ladies holds out, as his new girlfriend Rose simply wants him and Willow to be the human sacrifices necessary to resurrect Spurs Hardaway, a Buffalo Bill Cody type of Western performer who died exactly a century ago and discovered the secrets of \\"skinwalking\\" from an unnamed plains Indian tribe, which allowed him and the other performers to become an animal by donning its skin. After being captured by the werecoyotes, Buffy manages to escape with the aid of Hopscotch, a renegade werecoyote who wants her to stop the resurrection because he was the one who secretly killed Spurs Hardaway to begin with. In her own inimitable style, Buffy manages to arrive at the resurrection just in time to drive a silver knife through Spur Hardaway's werebear form and save the day.The novel has some strong elements. Xander's teen lust for Rose is depicted well, as are the feelings of love and hurt that Willow feels everytime Xander fails to notice how much she loves him. Also well played is a scene where Buffy interrupts a Xander-and-Rose makeup session, prompting Xander to tell Buffy off. Other highpoints include Xander trying to grow a goatee (failing miserably) and some interesting use of Native skinwalker stories.Overall, Coyote Moon is a competent addition to the Buffy line and has the feel of a first season episode. It's by no means a page turner, but it also doesn't prompt groans of dismay like some other books in the series."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"I savored this book a little longer than the previous 2.

Buffy, Xander and Willow head out for some serious rest and relaxation only to discover things are not as they seem and now the corpses popping up around town bear the marks of coyotes not vampires. But while Buffy is suspicious, Xander is smitten with Rose, a seductive siren from the carnival midway, while Willow has caught the eye of Lonnie, the barker. Somehow, you just know all the pieces are going to come together and it will then be Slayer time.My complaint, such as it is, is that John Vornholt has made Buffy, Xander and Willow more like real teenagers than they appear on the show, which ends up being something of a tradeoff with the show's trademark humor. I know how ironic it is to judge his realism by the standard of a television fantasy. This is still an above average Buffy novel. It is also rather interesting to read this book and know that Willow is going to end up dating Oz down the road, since our favorite gal pal spends some serious timing kissing a carney guy who turns out to be a werecoyote."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"John Vornholt creates a haunted setting for this spooky story.

For both good and bad reasons. I liked it because it was-it was-it was- well, I guess I liked it because it had to do with Buffy. I didn't like it because the humor wasn't as it is in the show, and the authors didn't catch the relationships between the characters. I didn't really like the story line that much, and it was kind of well, boring at times. I would still recommend that you read it however."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"Pity pity, that's what I've to say about this one. It could have been so good with a subject about werecoyotes ans shapeshifters. Instead it falls to average. The author got the characters totally wrong, especially Willow. It's also full of contradictions and stupid mistakes and there's total lack of suspense. If you're a Buffy fan, like me, you can still enjoy it. But for all others, pass on this one. I really expected more from a guy who has written over a dozen of Star Trek books."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"It is the end of the summer. For everyone, except Willow, this means the boredom and hum drum of school. Lucky for them they can end the summer with excitement as a new carnival is in town. However, they find that this particular Carnival might just be a bit too much excitement for them. Right away Buffy notices that not only is the Carnival strange but so are the carny folk who run it. However, not able to put her finger on it she tends to focus more on the fact that two carny folk take special interest in Willow and Xander... leaving Buffy boyfriend & summer-romance-less. But Buffy finds she's able to keep her mind a bit busy when she finds coyotes roaming the streets attacking innocent dogs! This is very peculiar behavior for coyote indeed, at least according to Giles. So what is the connection between the Carnival and the Coyotes...?While this installment was not long, more towards the length of fanfiction, it was still a very fun read. It was nice to read something that was not part of the tv series, but something a bit different outside of it. One aspect that I found a bit disappointing was the amount of build up only to end as quickly as it did (literally within a few pages, if that). I do wish that the author spent more time on the ending, keeping the buildup, but if I had to choose I would have chosen a much longer ending than the build up. I also wish the author had included more of Giles in this installment. While he is present, and actually pretty vital to Buffy's success (as she always is successful), I would have loved to have read an deeper exploration into his role.While the overall novel was not deep or meaningful in many ways, it did show the human qualities that Buffy posses - which I think is easy for us to forget about as she is always doing super human action moves and saving the world A LOT. The human quality of jealousy and loneliness was very prominent in this installment. Buffy finds herself jealous of the attention that Xander and Willow receive from the carny folks. She also finds herself jealous that she cannot have fun just like every other normal teenager. This in turn ties directly into the fearful quality of loneliness. We all know Buffy has a pretty lonely life, despite the Scooby Gang's presence. She knows she can never have a normal life, let a lone a normal romantic relationship. Highlighting this aspect, I think, is what makes this show relateable to many people who feel the same qualities of jealousy and loneliness.Overall this was a fun fast paced novel with quite a bit of butt-kicking, by yours truly the Slayer, and quick wit, the staple of the ENTIRE Buffy series. I recommend this read for any and all Buffy fans."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"***Some Spoilers Ahead***4 stars.This is a very good Buffy novel. It's set during the summer of Season 1. Buffy never left Sunnydale to visit her father in this novel though.I really enjoyed the shifter aspect and I wish they did something with that on the show.The relationship between Xander & Buffy is strained, which is a nice continuation of what happened in the finale of season 1.There were a couple things here and there that I either didn't catch or it wasn't there for me to catch. Why the shifters wanted to raise Spurs from the dead, it didn't seem like working in his show was all that great for them? He would get the fame and glory while they got nothing or next to nothing. It wasn't clear whether or not Xander and Willow were under a spell, at times it did seem like they were, especially with Xander who was very single minded and obsessive about Rose, while at other times it seemed like a normal attraction. So I wish that had been cleared up a little more.Other than those things, this was a very enjoyable post season 1 book and it broke the pattern for me when it comes to Season 1 novels, a couple of the others I read I rated low."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"A carnival full of odd workers comes to Sunnydale, Buffy's friends are preoccupied dating a couple of these workers, and a pack of strange coyotes are running amok in the streets. Buffy suspects all of these events are related but has no proof. What's a slayer to do?Set in the summer between the first and second seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, COYOTE MOON is a short and concise story that conveys the spirit of the show without too many noticeable inaccuracies. The major anachronism was Buffy staying in Sunnydale for the summer, which didn't happen during this time. Since this was written before any of the major angst occurred in the series, this has a lighter feel that carries through to the end. The author manages to get the characters and dialogue right via few lines and passages. The only misstep I caught was Giles' wrong definition of a blue moon -- I don't believe that's something he wouldn't have known. Otherwise everyone (Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles) rings true to their early incarnations, though more as a basic outline of their characters than anything too substantial. At first the plot reminded me slightly of the episode \\"The Pack,\\" though this had to do with coyotes instead of hyenas, but once I got into it the story was completely different. The pace was brisk, and though the Big Bad's defeat was over in the blink of an eye, it was a solid read. I can easily see this fitting right in on screen and it's a good companion piece to read in between re-watching episodes."},{"Title":"Coyote Moon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Book 3)","review":"Set in season one of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" author John Vornholt brings two new elements to Sunnydale - a travelling carnival and a pack of strange coyotes. Buffy, Xander and Willow are excited about the presence of a carnival to finish off the summer and soon Xander and Willow are hooked up with two exotic carnies, Rose and Lonnie. Buffy however, is distracted by the presence of a pack of coyotes roaming through the streets of Sunnydale. Although Willow insists that this is a normal occurrence, Buffy isn't so sure, especially when she sees the coyotes hanging around the grave of an old Western cowboy entertainer named Spurs Hardaway.After some research, Buffy and Giles learn that Spurs claimed to be able to change into any animal after learning the Native American skills of \\"skinwalking\\", and after she finds some conclusive evidence, Buffy realises that the carnies are the pack of coyotes that plan to resurrect their old leader under the Coyote Moon. Finding some surprising aid from an elderly carnie named Hopscotch, Buffy rushes to find Xander and Willow and convince them of their dates' true identities. But now the werecoyotes are on to Buffy...\\"Coyote Moon\\" is a reasonably entertaining Buffy-book, nothing spectacular, but retaining a sense of coherency and interest - plus a few unforseen twists and a good use of the werecoyotes' powers (that is, they don't just have them for the sake of having them - they *use* them to add to the completion of the story). One thing of interest in particular stuck out for me which may or may not have been intentional - right before Buffy sees the coyotes for the first time, she feels a cramp in her stomach. This harks back to the \\"Buffy\\" movie, starring Kirsty Swanson, told that cramps in her lower abdomen foresaw the arrival of danger - to which she replied, \\"Great, my secret weapon is PMS.\\" This Slayer power was disregarded in the television series, but Vornholt's little comment suggest it was not completely forgotten.If you are a fan of the show, you'll know how terrible Buffy is at lying and undercover work, whether it was the hopelessly obvious trench-coat and sunglasses she wore in \\"I Robot, You Jane\\", or the babbling she did at the door of demon-Ken's Family Home in \\"Anne\\" before she just gave up and slugged her way in. Here, John Vornholt instigates this lack of talent wonderfully, as throughout the course of the story Buffy has to scrabble for excuses and alibis, leading her to pretend she's about to throw up, claim that Xander is her boyfriend, and insist that she's a witch at different points throughout the story.There is however some rather sloppy writing and characterisation in the story, which prevents it from being a must-read Buffy book. For example, Vornholt describes Buffy awakening at four in the morning to the sound of coyotes killed a small domesticated dog. She rushes out to comfort the weeping owner, and then is said to be \\"amazed that nobody else had come out to witness this dramatic scene.\\" Er, it's four in the morning, Buffy - they're all asleep! Later, at the climatic finish in the graveyard Willow watches the bear-skinned corpse of Spurs Hardaway break through his grave. On him the pelt ripples as he begins to morph into the body of a bear, but Willow thinks: \\"it must be static electricity.\\" For heaven's sake, she's just seen the carnies change into coyotes and the corpse rise from the ground - why is she *still* trying to find a rational explanation? Oy.This leads to my second complaint, and that's the characters of Willow and Xander. This is set in season one, and therefore it's assumed that the events that took place in \\"The Harvest\\", \\"Teacher's Pet\\" and \\"The Pack\\" have already occurred. Since these episodes also included dates luring them to the cemetery, a femme-fatale shapeshifter, and people getting possessed by the spirits of animals, Willow and Xander's behaviour throughout the book come across as thoroughly stupid. Are we really meant to believe that after all their experience they're going to go with two suspicious carnies to a graveyard in the middle of the night? No way.Last of all, the ending is rather anti-climactic and abrupt. Buffy kills the head-villain within one paragraph and with no trouble at all, and the final resolution of the situation makes no sense. Standing in the remains of the carnival, Buffy claims that with Spur's death the power of the skinwalkers is gone. How she knows this, or how this actually occurs is not explained, and is further complicated by the fact that she then turns to see a coyote (implied to be Hopscotch) on the crest of a hill. So...how come the curse wasn't broken for him? In both cases, we are severely short-changed when it comes to the ending.So despite great descriptions of a carnival, a reasonably interesting premise, and a funny sequence involving a heckling clown and a dunking pool, I'd give \\"Coyote Moon\\" two and a half stars. Read it if you're in a hurry or just want some extremely light holiday reading."},{"Title":"University of San Diego: Off the Record (College Prowler) (College Prowler: University of San Diego Off the Record)","review":"I wish there could have been a section about the Old Ox and Second Wind in Pacific Beach, but time has taken both of those wonderful places from us.

The back-cover write-up gets it right-- here is the indispensable peer of Vergil, Dante, Homer. These are poetic monuments, cathedrals of sound and sense that are bound to exhilarate anyone who gives them even passing attention: Milton's reverence, rage, and sensuality burn through each line. Never mind even Harold Bloom's protestations to the contrary-- the poetry of the English tradition revolves around a double star, and this is Shakespeare's giant twin in greatness."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost and Other Poems (Mentor Series)","review":"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruitOf that forbidden tree whose mortal tasteBrought death into the world and all our woe,With loss of Eden, till on greater ManRestore us and regain the blissful seatSing, Heavenly Muse...Not a lot people know that 'Paradise Lost' has as a much lesser known companion piece 'Paradise Regained'; of course, it was true during Milton's time as it is today that the more harrowing and juicy the story, the better it will likely be remembered and received.This is not to cast any aspersion on this great poem, however. It has been called, with some justification, the greatest English epic poem. The line above, the first lines of the first book of the poem, is typical of the style throughout the epic, in vocabulary and syntax, in allusiveness. The word order tends toward the Latinate, with the object coming first and the verb coming after.Milton follows many classical examples by personifying characters such as Death, Chaos, Mammon, and Sin. These characters interact with the more traditional Christian characters of Adam, Eve, Satan, various angels, and God. He takes as his basis the basic biblical text of the creation and fall of humanity (thus, 'Paradise Lost'), which has taken such hold in the English-speaking world that many images have attained in the popular mind an almost biblical truth to them (in much the same way that popular images of Hell owe much to Dante's Inferno). The text of Genesis was very much in vogue in the mid-1600s (much as it is today) and Paradise Lost attained an almost instant acclaim.John Milton was an English cleric, a protestant who nonetheless had a great affinity for catholic Italy, and this duality of interests shows in much of his creative writing as well as his religious tracts. Milton was nicknamed 'the divorcer' in his early career for writing a pamphlet that supported various civil liberties, including the right to obtain a civil divorce on the grounds of incompatibility, a very unpopular view for the day. Milton held a diplomatic post under the Commonwealth, and wrote defenses of the governments action, including the right of people to depose and dispose of a bad king.Paradise Lost has a certain oral-epic quality to it, and for good reason. Milton lost his eyesight in 1652, and thus had to dictate the poem to several different assistants. Though influenced heavily by the likes of Virgil, Homer, and Dante, he differentiated himself in style and substance by concentrating on more humanist elements.Say first -- for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,Nor the deep tract of Hell -- say first what causeMoved our grand Parents, in that happy state,Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall offFrom their Creator and transgress his will,For one restraint, lords of the world besides?Milton drops us from the beginning into the midst of the action, for the story is well known already, and proceeds during the course of the books (Milton's original had 10, but the traditional epic had 12 books, so some editions broke books VII and X into two books each) to both push the action forward and to give developing background -- how Satan came to be in Hell, after the war in heaven a description that includes perhaps the currently-most-famous line:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition though in hell:Better to reign in hell, that serve in heav'n.(Impress your friends by knowing that this comes from Book I, lines 261-263 of Paradise Lost, rather than a Star Trek episode!)The imagery of warfare and ambition in the angels, God's wisdom and power and wrath, the very human characterisations of Adam and Eve, and the development beyond Eden make a very compelling story, done with such grace of language that makes this a true classic for the ages. The magnificence of creation, the darkness and empty despair of hell, the manipulativeness of evil and the corruptible innocence of humanity all come through as classic themes. The final books of the epic recount a history of humanity, now sinful, as Paradise has been lost, a history in tune with typical Renaissance renderings, which also, in Milton's religious convictions, will lead to the eventual destruction of this world and a new creation.A great work that takes some effort to comprehend, but yields great rewards for those who stay the course.This collection includes Samson Agonistes, one of the best Greek-style tragedies done in English, based on the biblical character of Samson. It also includes the poem Lycidas, a pastoral poem written specifically for the death of Edward King, a Cambridge student who died by drowning, but which includes a greater sense of universal longing and lost hope.Edward le Comte has provided a worthwhile introduction to the poems and a brief biography of Milton."},{"Title":"Paradise Lost and Other Poems (Mentor Series)","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my new son-in-law who collects classic literary works that would look great on the book shelf!

This is by far the best paperback edition of Paradise Lost. I personally did not find the notes intrusive and the Introduction by Edward M. Cifelli is by far the best introduction I've ever read in the classics books. Most of the introductions these days are horrors of the editor's pet peeves and personal beliefs: the Femnist View; the Marxist View; the Freudian View, etc. ad nauseam. Some of the ideas are really howlers...The intro to Cranford in the Oxford University Press comes to mind. Everything except the artist's view...

I suppose this could be beneficial for those who have never read Milton before and are doing so for a class, but if you are like me, one who has read and enjoyed paradise lost previously and are looking to add a copy to your personal library, then you may be annoyed by the annotations. Every single page has the authors two cents added about nearly every metaphor and, on some pages, it seems he attempts to explain the entire page. I found myself unable to fully enjoy the actual poem due to the annoyance the annotations were causing me.

It depicted a time, and place, and culture, that was completely different to my own. As a young person, the book moved me to interpret life, and indeed the world, in a new light. From that point on in my educational career, I embraced the idea of reading for &quot;pleasure&quot;, an undertaking that has literally changed my life. Thank you Mr. Southall. Now I plan on giving Ash Road as a birthday gift to my sixth grade daughter, who is constantly bothering me to stay up &quot;just a little longer&quot;, .......to read."},{"Title":"ASH ROAD ( Ivan Southall Library )","review":"In the hot early summer of January 1962 there was a terrible bushfire (wild fire) in the hilly, forested outer eastern suburbs and bushy hamlets of Melbourne (Australia). People died, many houses were burned to the ground, and large forest and bush areas became charred lunar landscapes.Ivan Southall lived in the area, but survived the fire. Later it became the subject of \\"Ash Road\\"!During World War II, Southall had been a brave air-force pilot (flying giant four-engined Sunderland flying boats, from England, protecting convoys and hunting U-boats in the Atlantic: he sank a U-boat!). He had published adult books about his own war-time experiences, as well as a biography of \\"Bluey\\" Truscott, an ace Australian fighter pilot, and the Australian naval officers who worked to defuse unexploded enormous German mines and bombs.Southall later also written many children's novels about \\"Simon Black\\", a square-jawed heroic pilot (a version of W.E. Johns' fictional British air hero \\"Biggles\\": Americans might see \\"Simon Black\\" as in the same hero mold as, perhaps, Indiana Jones!), one of them (\\"Simon Black in Coastal Command\\") based on Southall's own war-time experiences, but the others being post-war adventures that even included travelling to Antarctica, the Moon and Venus - science fiction for eager boys.All of this changed around 1960 when Southall wrote \\"Hills End\\", a deliberately realistic thriller-adventure about realistic young teenagers struggling to deal with a sudden flood, at a time when their parents are away from the family farm. This shift to writing FOR children, ABOUT real or realistic children, facing REAL dangers, became Southall's new territory - one for which we repeatedly won major literary awards.In fact Ivan Southall was one of Australia's greatest children's writers during the last half of the Twentieth century.\\"Ash Road\\" was his second realistic adventure. It is about a remote rural community facing the extreme threat of a bush fire (wild fire), and the young teenager who accidentally started the fire.This is a gripping story, indeed, not just because of the exciting events, but because of the way Southall probes the inner feelings and feels of real characters. He is a master of psychological analysis of emotions, and human interactions, conveyed within thrilling action-based stories.Does it help to suggest that the quality of Southall's writing, here, and in all his other books (with the exception of the more far-fetched \\"Simon Black\\" science fiction), anticipates, and rivals writers such as Robert Cormier (USA) and Robert Westall (UK)?Very highly recommended!John Gough - jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Act Like Nothing's Wrong: The Montage Art of Winston Smith","review":"Smith, named after the fictional character from Orwell's 1984, has produced collage and montage artwork for the past 20 years, utilizing stolen and &quot;borrowed&quot; photographs from innumerable sources.

His work is definitely not for the faint of heart, though I would recommend to anyone flipping through here"},{"Title":"Act Like Nothing's Wrong: The Montage Art of Winston Smith","review":"Winston has captured the corruption of every-day life in collage art. He has a genius mind that takes what we try and say and puts it in the bluntest image."},{"Title":"Act Like Nothing's Wrong: The Montage Art of Winston Smith","review":"&quot;Montage art is like instant surrealism. If Dr. Frankenstein had worked with paper instead of body parts, he'd have been a collage artist. I use a scalpel, but instead of stitches I use glue.&quot; ---Winston Smith, page 22 in &quot;Act Like Nothing's Wrong.&quot;Odds are you have seen Winston Smith's collage art. If you never perused the insane Winston Smith creations on Dead Kennedys' album covers (not to mention the infamous Dead Kennedys' DK logo), you have probably ran across his sweetly twisted magazine art collages somewhere in the media. Chances are you may have seen an image like &quot;Force Fed War&quot; (Mom nursing baby with a fighter aircraft instead of a bottle) or the various Reagan-Ridiculing collages. And there's a good chance you associate these collages with Jello Biafra and The Dead Kennedys, but have never actually heard the name of the creator, Winston Smith.My case exactly. The Dead Kennedys collage art that stayed cemented in my mind was &quot;The Money Tree&quot; (page 26 in this collection), a collage of exuberant aging suburbanites, dressed in their weekend leisure slacks, harvesting dollar bills from a tree in their backyard. I always found that image simultaneously drop-dead funny and creepy, like a weird scene from a nightmare you had as a child. Eager to find that image again, I did the various web searches to find out what inspired mind came up with these freaky slices of life, and came across these books by Winston Smith.I expected this book to be a funny collection of pop-art. This book goes way beyond my expectations. Not only are there scores of hysterical collages lambasting the seedy nature behind the nuclear family's jubilant appearance, but you have written commentary by Smith, who delivers a keen and serious attack on modern American society. The combination of his visual wit and his heartfelt criticism of the government (he focuses on our government, but does not let other monolithic empires like China and the former USSR off the hook) drive this work home. This makes for an unlikely but effective mix of wit and condemnation.It's really strange. I usually can't stand the artistic coffee-house malcontents who drone on and on about the tragedies of consumerism, sell-outs, and suburbia. I find the majority of those I have met to be self-serving critics who will cry over societal ironies, but only to come off as cool and bohemian.Winston Smith is one major exception to the rule. As I read his commentaries, he probably would take me to task for writing off the angry neo-artists. He would probably also take me to task for being shallow enough to enjoy the fruits of popular TV &amp; media. So.... what is it I find different about Mr. Smith? As I read his quotes, I envision a guy who can find gloom and pathos in modern America, and then tell its story by cutting &amp; pasting magazine illustrations with childlike enthusiasm. Maybe I'm misreading Winston Smith, but I see this energetic workhorse who sees the empire crumbling into oblivion and instead of sobbing over it, he's going to play his fiddle louder, harder, and with sheer reckless abandon.I love this book. And so should you!

This is very useful information for metrologists, people working in calibration and testing laboratories that are or want to be accreddited to ISO/IEC 17025, and people in any organization that is or wants to be registered to ISO 9001 and therefore should be using ISO 10012 a a guide for their measurement management system."},{"Title":"Traceable Temperatures","review":"Wow, this is an amazing book.

A set of exercises is included at the end of each chapter and complete solutions to all of them are found in the last chapter.The explanations of the principles of group theory are very well done, better than those found in most abstract algebra textbooks.

H. Lawrence is a book that must be read in a context. I read it in 1978 when I had the desire to know Lawrence better. The book aptly served its purpose. I developed a very high regard for Lawrence believing him to be \\"the greatest mind of the twentieth century\\" before the 1930s. It was as though someone who had known Lawrence closely was telling me about him.Later I read what T. S. Eliot had said of this book, calling it a work of \\"destructive criticism\\". I felt perplexed. Murry had brought me to love Lawrence and here he was being described as Lawrence's enemy. It was then that I began to look for the contexts that made Eliot come out with such an assessment of Murry's work. The result was my interest in the T. S. Eliot-Middleton Murry Debate. Murry was one of those rare literary figures that had immersed himself in the works of Lawrence, Keats, Blake, Swift, Shakespeare and others. He was the powerful editor that Eliot had wanted to approach for his own promotion. Eliot worked under Murry as an assistant editor of The Atheneum. In order to be a certain kind of writer, Eliot had to demolish Lawrence and those who had affinities with Lawrence. His first step in this direction seems to have been his review of Murry's Son of Woman, which cut to size what Murry had said of Lawrence. He was not the one to support Lawrence and one way of opposing him was to demolish his adulators. The result was that Son of Woman began to be read in a different light. I still believe that if one wants to get a clearer glimpse of what Lawrence meant to people living around him one should read Son of Woman."},{"Title":"All That Sunlight: Poems","review":"The seller was quick to complete the transaction.

This book presents a neat repertoire for black to face anti-sicilian openings. Now Dorian Rogozenko, an active figure at chessbase online site, tries to present a more comprehensive anti-sicilian repertoire for sicilian players. There are some weak and strong points about this book. First, unlike &quot;Meeting with 1.e4&quot; which only discusses anti-sicilian with move order of 1...c5 2...Nc6, Rogozenko covers the needs of 1...c5 2...d6 or 1...c5 2...e6 players. Najdorf players can rejoice to see the discussion about the annoying 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bb5+ line and other relevant lines.Overall, there are five main topics covered in this book: Grand Prix attack, Closed Sicilian, Sicilian c3, 3.Bb5(+) lines and Misc lines. Based on how dangerous an anti-sicilian line is, the proportion of topics seems very balanced. The discussion is presented in &quot;tree-variation format&quot; which is better than &quot;games-format&quot; for an opening repertoire book. Solid mainlines are Rogozenko's choice in this book, for example he recommends 3 ..g6 against Sicilian Rossolimo. We will see later that Rogezenko's approach is a double edged sword.It is fascinating to see that the book covers 1.e4 c5 2.d3/b3/g3/etc lines or 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4, it gives the impression that sicilian beginners will benefit a lot from here. But unfortunately this is not 100% true for a reason. The lines recommended in this book are the main lines of the variations and thus very heavy in theory. Another weak point is the analysis, quite often the recommended lines end with minimal annotations like &quot;Black has equal chances&quot;, while the final positions demand more explanations for beginner or intermediate players. Even veteran sicilian players will need to spend a lot of time to evaluate these positions. To his credit, He tries to turn left or right in the middle of the mainlines, for example in the closed sicilian he prefers to play 9...b6 than the popular 9...Nd4. Whether these deviation lines are fresh enough, I will let you to judge them.In conclusion, if you are a strong player and plays sicilian, get this excellent book. If you are an intermediate/beginner player, you may get learn something, however it will be frustrating to play the recommended line and does not how to proceed from the final position due to the lack of explanations. I recommend beginner/intermediate players to buy &quot;Meeting 1e4&quot; by Alexander Raetsky instead.This book deserves four stars if you are a strong player."},{"Title":"Anti-Sicilians - A Guide for Black","review":"Rogozenko gives online lectures all the time. He understands how most club-level players think better than most GMs. But this book is not a simple, low-level book full of tips. Rogo is a grandmaster that has worked hard on the Sicilian throughout his career. He shares his insights along with a lot of computer assisted analysis to make sure it holds up. Again, this is not simply theory. It is a recommended repertoire for black whenever white avoids the open sicilian.This book often gives you multiple lines against the most common anti-sicilian systems. You can play solid and safe or risk more for winning chances.If you play the Sicilian you know that many, many white players avoid the open Sicilian so they don't need to learn the white side of the Najdorf and Dragon and scheveningen, etc. Few books have addressed all anti-sicilians from the black point-of-view and those that have are years and years out-of-date with comtemporary opening theory.This is simply a must-have for all serious chess students that want to play the Sicilian in tournaments. You simply HAVE to know a line against the Smith-Morra, Bb5 lines, c3 Sicilian, etc.You cannot just study the Najdorf or the Dragon and not really know what to do when white plays something other than Nf3, d4, and Nxd4.Unless you are below 1200 or above 2550 than this book is perfect. Its is an up-to-date manual written from a current tournament GM (i.e. these ideas WILL be played against him).Buy it if you play the Sicilian (the most popular defense against e4)."},{"Title":"Anti-Sicilians - A Guide for Black","review":"Anti-Sicilians for Black by GM Dorian Rogozenko is exactly what the title claims;a Black repertoire vs anything but open Sicilians. Specifically,the chapter headings are:Early Deviations (2.c4,2.b4,2.b3,2.d3,2.g3,2.d4),Grand Prix Attack,Closed Sicilian,Alapin,\\"Misc Lines after 2.Nf3\\",3.Bb5(+),and 2.Nf3,d6 3.d4,cxd4,4.Qxd4.I very much admire this book for both the completness and explanations provided by GM Rogozenko. As pointed out in the Intro,Rogozenko is himself a lifelong Sicilian player,and I think it shows. Rogozenko's consistent attitude,carefully threatened in the Introduction and referred to throughout, is to present solid,objectively equal lines for Black.By good luck for me,this is just the approach that appeals. But of course,it won't be to everyone's taste.Foe example, regarding attempts to play the Morra gambit,Rogozenko \\"merely\\" recommends 2...Nf6 and transpose to the Alapin. A very pragmatic approach,given that to prepare for the Morra would be a lot of work for a very rare opening,plus the fact that the 2...Nf6 Alapin is completely acceptable for Black. But others might wish for a more combative attitude.Rogozenko provides both a solid (early ...e6) and a more contentious approach to the Alapin,but in general the lines are main line with an eye to simplification and solidity.A big plus to the book,in my opinion, is that Rogozenko is very careful to delineate recommendations according to one's Open Sicilian preference (2...e6 vs 2...d6 vs 2...Nc6). Thus all Sicilian players are provided with a repertoire that is easy to find.And in my opinion the book is suitable for a very wide range of levels,as Rogozenko recommends mostly GM main lines, but consistently inserts refutations of plausible mistakes that lesser players are liable to make.Rogozenko's style is what one might call fatherly and encouraging, and the prose is informative and not filler. For an opening book, there is very little of the mysterious \\"and Black is clearly better\\" etc. that irritates a club player like myself. Altho without complete games (customary for a Gambit book), Rogozenko ably lays out the plans for the remainder at the end of the variations. Exceptionally clearly,in my opinion.In summary,I truly believe one could successfully prepare vs Anti-Silians with this single volume,and enjoy doing so. I congratulate GM Rogozenko on his contribution and look forward to future efforts."},{"Title":"Anti-Sicilians - A Guide for Black","review":"This book follows the traditional theory-then-games but still it doesnt go into n+5 depth in variations so although its a very complete guide it doesnt dwell into too complicated lines. As a general way of dealing with the antis the author recommends a kingside fianchettoe and pretty much goes along these lines so if you're a fond one of the dragon like lines this book is going to fit into your repertoire perfectly.Hope you enjoy it as much as I do"},{"Title":"Anti-Sicilians - A Guide for Black","review":"I think its clear by now that if you are a serious chess player, then gambit books are the books for you. I've had nothing but laughs at everymans.To the book review:This book is excellent for its theoretical content. The variations are all relevant, and detailed. Basically he went through all the anti sicilian lines in NCO and tries to improve for black, or gives better details.Too bad the other review said this book is not for beginners, well it is. The reason is because the analysis is dead on and gives you the best lines. Dont expect to play the sicilian without memorizing, that is if you want to play it with success."},{"Title":"Anti-Sicilians - A Guide for Black","review":"I have bought this book.

It's a compilation of the best of the E.C. (an Entertaining Comic) horror comics, such as Tales from the Crypt, the Vault of Horror, and the Haunt of Fear. The stories and artwork are bloody and visceral, with a definite sense of morals and retribution.

I have read many World War II books and even Histories of the war and although this book did give some good insight into the movements of the German Army, it was just too detailed."},{"Title":"Courage,","review":"The title, Courage, is the theme of the talk that Mr. Barrie, creator of the Peter Pan character and stories, gave to the graduating class at St. Andrews. The words were first given in 1922 but would be largely appropriate for almost any graduate at any time, even today. Part of the address deals with war because of WWI involving the Scottish people.Another interesting segment was read from a letter written by Admiral Byrd from a tent he knew he and his explorer party would die in, already having frozen feet, no fuel, and no food.Barrie's own words can describe the written speech. \\"They are the roses in December; you remember someone said that God gave us memory so that we might have roses in December.\\" Barrie's talk of growing up, moving on into the world, and achieving through the use of courage is good, like \\"roses in December.\\"Just don't expect Tinkerbell, or Wendy, Peter, Neverland, pirates or any of the characters we associate with J. M. Barrie's name. He did include a line for a student...\\"the lad what will never be old.\\" And he says near the end, \\"This is my first and last public appearance, and I never could or would have made it except to a gathering of Scottish students. I have not been as dull as I could have wished to be; but looking at your glowing faces cheerfulness and hope would keep breaking through.\\""},{"Title":"Blessed By an Angel","review":"This book has beautiful illustrations but they are nothing next to the stories it is filled with.

To understand Hitler one must understand what came before, especially the legacy that Napoleon left upon the European continent. While a straight comparison/contrast of the two leaders is a core theme in this analysis, Desmond Seward transcends that, attacking the interrelational cause-and-effect relationship between the two conquerors. The enormous complexity of these two personalities, of which numerous, exhaustive studies have been made, preclude Seward from exploring each too deeply in one text. His exploration, as with most works of this nature, raises more questions than it solves, but he, quite thoroughly, includes direct references to his sources and admirably provides the reader directions for further study. While his comparison could use more focus on the thematic analysis rather than simply event-related parallels, it was well composed and quite interesting with solidly founded conclusions."},{"Title":"Napoleon and Hitler : A Comparative Biography","review":"Well written and organized through extensive research, Seward provides the first scholarly comparison between Hitler and Napoleon. Each section of similarity is extensively described and well researched. A worthy companion to Alan Bullock's Hitler and Stalin which illustrates the comparison between Hitler and Stalin, though not as in-depth or detailed."},{"Title":"Napoleon and Hitler : A Comparative Biography","review":"Desmond Seward manages to present a research based history book that is readable. Historical figures are often compared, and it's easy to find similarities, but Seward makes a credible presentation. Of particular interest was that Hitler studied Napoleon's campaigns and seemed to give them status as a military education. We are all taught that history will repeat itself if we don't learn from it. In this case, history repeated itself because one man did learn from it."},{"Title":"Popover (Have a Nice Life #3)","review":"Zola wants to get back her boyfriend Evan, and get even with Claudia for steeling him from her.

Things are perfect she even has a great guy, Miles, she can move on to. But who thought breaking up with the one who drives you the most insane would be so complicated.THis book tells the continuing saga of four girls trying to change their future by altering the present. But every timt they try something their fairy godmother, Clearence Tearence (nicknamed Lenny), tells them they're just moving closer to their dommed fates. Just like the last two books in the series this book was a humorous telling about friendship, finding yourself, and changeing your fate. If you like the series read this one! The next upcomming book is called Score."},{"Title":"Popover (Have a Nice Life #3)","review":"Popover is just as great as her last two.

I think the best thing about the book is you can realate to certain qualities the girls have. I wouldn't say you should tell you teacher or anything the content b/c it does involve sex once or twice and cursing. Basically to summarize whats happened is four girls one cool and sophisticated, one funny, one sort of a little young for her age, and another loyal girl on the wrong side. They get shown their future by a fairy godmother(he's a guy) and they need to make some changes. The first book sets you up and it looks like each book after that still focuses on the group but one person more than the other. This is about Zola and Evan. It's a great read but make sure you read the other books before it. *MollyDolly*"},{"Title":"Figures in a landscape.","review":"Fantastic doom-laden nightmare pursuit novel.The set-up is very existential: 2 men are pursued by a mysterious black helicopter over a rough, inhospitable country. We never learn the reasons for any of this or even where it is taking place. Everything about the story is as stripped to the basics as the title suggests. The men are never given much more than the briefest of backgrounds and the chase is all there is. This makes for a strangely involving and compelling book.Unforgettable."},{"Title":"Figures in a landscape.","review":"This amazing book is so much more than a genre thriller, although it does thrill. When I first picked it up (many years ago now) I read it straight through from the first page to the last. It took a second reading to fully appreciate England's skill at character development. By the end, I cared deeply about both main characters and was delighted by the way they reversed roles. Last year I bought a hardcover at a very reasonable price.

Note that this is a work in progress, and this version was reviewed by hundreds of reviewers from 42 countries before making it into the content set forth in the book.The knowledge areas are: (1) Software Requirements, (2)Software Design, (3)Software Construction, (4)Software Testing, (5) Maintenance, (6) Software Configuration Management, (7) Software Engineering Management, (8) Software Engineering Process, (9) Software Engineering Tools and Metrics, and (10) Software Quality.If the KAs in the SWEBOK look similar to the CMM process areas this reflects consensus in the software engineering community regarding key processes and knowledge areas for the profession. There are differences between the SWEBOK and the CMM. Unlike the CMM, which is an assessment-based model that determines an organization's capabilities based on a maturity scale, the SWEBOK is an &quot;informed and reasonable characterization of the software engineering Body of Knowledge and as a baseline document&quot;. As such it is a framework for a software engineering organization that maps closely to what is set forth in not only the CMM, but SPICE and Bootstrap, and is an ideal career guide for software engineering professionals. In addition to that function, this guide aligns nearly perfectly to the P-CMM (see People Capability Maturity Model by Bill Curtis , William E. Hefley and Sally A. Miller ISBN: 0201604450). Specific P-CMM process areas that this book supports include: Level 2 Training and Development; Level 3 Competency Development; Career Development and Competency-Based Practices; Level 4 Competency-Based Assets, Organizational Capability Management and Mentoring; and Level 5 Organizational Performance Alignment.This book should be one of the primary references for any motivated software engineering professional or mature organization."},{"Title":"A syllabus of Kentucky folk-songs, (Transylvania university studies in English.

The book contains written descriptions of numerous songs, plus lyrics, but no music (notes, chords, etc.) to go by, except for ABBACCA-type verse descriptions, or references to tunes common to 1923 but now long forgotten. This book's a great historical archive if the reader's already an accomplished folk musician who knows century-old tunes from memory, but difficult to appreciate for the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Memory Trap","review":"This was up there with Disclosure by Michael Chricton and a lot of John Grisham.

A must if you survived the technology boom.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"EDUCATION AND THE SOCIAL ORDER","review":"Reading this book was a strange and illuminating experience. On the one hand, strange, because so many of Russell's thought came to roost into my mind and seemed so natural and so clear to me that I felt I had been thinking them all my life. On the other hand, illuminating, because so many of Russell's ideas were so unfamiliar and odd, and yet when put all together it is as if someone is turning on the light for the first time. Russell strikes at the heart of all that cripples education and development of the whole person, by mercilessly pointing out that the existence of the debilitating agents and uncovering the way they undermine human growth and potential. He does not stop there, however. He also praises those unique aspects of education that make us stronger, thoughtful, more critical -- those aspects, as he says, may yet save our civilization. The book is slightly outdated in part, in that there is a whole, in-depth chapter on education in the USSR, but this is nonetheless interesting from a historical aspect. The crux of this book, however, is timeless, invaluable, and well the worth the read."},{"Title":"EDUCATION AND THE SOCIAL ORDER","review":"In this hard-hitting, superbly sarcastic/cynical, and still highly relevant text, B. Russell gives his outspoken view on \`free' education and its inveterate enemies, the State (government) and the Church (religion).Individualism v. CitizenshipThere is a huge cleavage between those who consider education primarily in relation to the individual psyche, and those who consider it in relation to the community.The cultivation of the individual mind is absolutely not the same thing as the production of a useful citizen. Nonetheless, it may be held that pupils will ultimately be better citizens if they are first aware of all their potentialities as individuals before they descend into compromises and practical acquiescences of the life of the polis. Education in citizenship is shortsighted, because it will stunt the individual in order to make him a convenient tool in the hands of the government.FreedomFreedom in education (= free speech) is the most difficult element to secure in the polis. State and Church are implacable enemies of both intelligence and real virtue. Moreover, any creed is harmful in education when exempt from intellectual, scientific scrutiny.Both institutions understand all too clearly that a world of real human beings would make short work of the existing social system, with its wars, its oppressions, its economic injustices, its horror of free inquiry and its superstitious moral code.Government (the State)All the governments of the world adopt elaborate methods of concealing truths which they consider undesirable. They inflict various forms of penalty upon those who spread knowledge which is thought bad for them. Governing elites are fundamental hypocrites (when the Transvaal was found to contain gold, the British invaded it. Lord Salisbury assured the nation that \`we seek no goldfields'!)Patriotism and Nationalism imply that the most important duty of young men is homicide. Also, the citizens who shout for the flag are, in general, unaware of the sinister forces that have led them to do so.Religion (the Church)Churches demand assent to propositions which no unbiased person can believe, and to a morality which is so cruel that it can only be accepted by those inhibited by dogma. One example: the Catholic Church holds that a priest can turn a piece of bread into the Body and the Blood of Christ by talking Latin to it.Religion is a conservative force and preserves much of what was bad in the past. It supported slavery and now capitalistic exploitation. It minimizes such evils as poverty and disease, on the ground that they belong only to this earthly life. Its sex education makes happiness in adult life impossible.Ultimately, Bertrand Russell ask the crucial question: Is a man to be condemned as immoral and subversive, because he wishes to substitute all those sinister elements in education by intelligence, sanity, kindliness and a sense of justice?Bertrand Russell's monumental free speech still towers mightily above the mass of corrupt propagandists and shamelessly biased observers of the actual political and economic scene (a screen for those sinister interests which B. Russell lambastes mercilessly in this text).A must read."},{"Title":"Myth, Ethos, and Actuality: Official Art in Fifth Century B.C. Athens (Wisconsin Studies in Classics)","review":"Castriota's book is a must for anyone interested in early Greek art."},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","review":"Having only recently been turned on to Brian Lumley, this is my first purchase and first read of Lumley; and all I can say is Wow! His writing phases from ethereal to direct impact, flowing with style and a flair for the creepy things that go squish in the night.Beginning with the best story of the collection, \\"Fruiting Bodies\\", Lumley takes us on a trip through a small, dying town that is slowly falling into the sea. But will the sea claim its victim before the Dry Rot does? Seemingly, a new and mutated type of dry rot, it is as hungry as the sea. Lumley does not deny the imagination in this tale, leaving you searching the nooks and crannies of your house for any...well...nasty accumulations.\\"The Man Who Photographed Beardsley\\" is a short but sweet sabbatical into a demented and twisted mind, which has managed to retain its sense of propriety.\\"The Man Who Felt Pain\\" is a tale told by the protagonist, of his twin brother and the bond they shared, through life and death. If one twin suffers, will not the other twin feel his pain...sooner or later?\\"The Viaduct\\" reminds me of Stephen King back when he still had tight and compelling stories with real-life characters you could relate to immediately. Children can be cruel, but just where is the line drawn when one doesn't understand the rules? This is an excellent story, in which I could actually feel the desperation and the slippery palms of true terror.\\"Recognition\\" is a ghostly tale of a haunted place, and a firm argument as to why some things are best left alone.\\"No Way Home\\" is a surreal nighttime journey through both familiar and unfamiliar territory, with a surprise ending that is unexpected...and worth the trip.\\"The Pit-Yakker\\" takes us back in time to a simpler life within a working-man's village, and a young man's dreams that turn to dust and disintegration in the wake of simple urges and the lack of intelligence to quench them. Questions of friendship and tolerance and personal limitations are addressed here, in a harsh and unforgiving atmosphere of betrayal and lust.\\"The Mirror of Nitocris\\" was one of the stories I found to be a bit boring, kind of strung out and lacking, even though it is only 10 pages long. It was just a bit of a yawn in all the rest of the excitement; a tale of an acquired artifact that comes into being in a chilling climax, only to be destroyed before it can leash its evil into the world.\\"Necros\\" is a very interesting tale of immortality, and the things one must do in order to assure that immortality is youthful and pleasant. But there is a twist to this at the end that will surprise you, and give you a peek into the horrific aspects of bowing to such a creature.\\"The Thin People\\" is a true masterpiece of the type of horror that will leave you forever guessing about ordinary things you see every day. I am counting the lamp posts on my street now, and have had a few disturbing dreams in regards to the science of \\"Folding\\". Excellent tale!\\"The Cypress Shell\\" and \\"The Deep Sea Conch\\" are intertwined stories, based on letters written from one person to another. The tales they tell of mysterious mollusks are frightening and disgusting, and well deserve their place here in this anthology. The creepiness Lumley portrays upon something as simple as shellfish is amazing, and you will never eat clams or muscles in the same uncaring fashion as you once did before this unnerving description of these innocent organisms.Lastly is \\"Born of the Winds\\", the longest story in the collection, and a novella in its own right. Although, it was my least favorite of all the set. A meteorologist recovering from an \\"incident\\" of chest discomfort visits his friend in Navissa, Manitoba. While recuperating from his complaint within the house of his friend, he meets the widow of Samuel Bridgeman, an anthropology professor who had died nearby some years ago. Our protagonist becomes interested in Bridgeman's written works, and eventually becomes involved in Mrs. Bridgeman's search for her son, Kirby. How deep is the Bridgeman's connection with the Air Elementals and the Wind Walkers, and where does Kirby fit in with these spirits? Not a bad story, just a little too wordy and..well...coy, for my tastes.Don't miss this fantastic collection of stories from Lumley, a true master of mysterious and weird stories that are well written and well told. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","review":"With this anthology, Brian Lumley proves that he is a true master in the horror genre. His short fiction is superior to Stephen King's. He is probably the best writer of short horror stories since H.P Lovecraft, by whom he is inspired. This book, along with &quot;The Second Wish&quot; and &quot;Dagon's Bell&quot;, his other anthologies, will turn you into a Lumley fan, even if you weren't impressed by the Necroscope series."},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","review":"Amongst the most notable horror writers that have picked up a pen and crafted, Brain Lumley the short story writer (not to be confused with Brain Lumley, the novel writer, whom I really can't speak on because of lack of general knowledge on him) has to be mentioned with awe. I'm not certain if his allure is in the way he crafts situational happenstance, with the pages of foreshadowing seamlessly meshing with the way he flawless enacts characterization, if its the way his peaks and valleys, his towns and villas, dance so vividly that my mind can walkabout and taste the air that even the shortest of tales seems to craft, or if its the ideas for his stories themselves. Its strange how he accomplishes that task, though, approaching horror and punctuating it with an aire of newness that banishes many of the classically shallow pits we've seen a million times before. Honestly, every time I read one of his shorts I find myself wondering exactly where his mind will allow him to approach even the most basic idea from.In this collection of short stories, I've found many and many a tale that merits and actually demands acclaim. Some, like Fruiting Bodies and The Thin People, teem with topics that are frightening in their flavors, wearing masks that I can't recall reading anywhere else. Others, like the Lovecraftian tales he forged, most notably Recognition, wear dread like familiar sweaters. Now, for a listing of the stories here and a synopsis of some that no doubt does them an injustice:Fruiting Bodies, one of my favorite pieces in this book, incorporates the disappearance of a town and the tales of a kindly old man into a tale of a mysterious fungi that seems quite extraordinary in its abilities. In fact, as it consumes more and more, it seems downright horrific in its reproach. I particularly liked this story because of the last statements, the punctuation mark on the horror if you will, that left the terrible tale open for the mind to digest. On top of that, the detail given to the setting is deliciously remarkable.The Viaduct, a tale containing a valuable lesson on the cost of tormenting others, on heights and the challenge they bring to the table, and on the wonderful world of falling. This tale wasn't one that I cared for simply because of its ending, a great piece of work in and of itself, but I also appreciated the detailing, quite explicit and painstakingly given. In it, I could feel the characters and taste the surroundings, something that always amazes me.Recognition, a Lovecraftian inspired piece, focuses on an entity that dwells within a home that someone wishes to be rid of, their efforts to understand the enemy, and the subsequent means (a medium, and exorcist, and someone to draw the beast for him) used to do so. This tale is particularly inspiring because it focuses upon the notion we hold most dear, that of understanding, and the high costs that connection can bring.The Thin People, another of the more remarkable pieces here, dwells within the domain of The Thin People and their thin homes, where lightbulbs seem to vanish from streetlights and sometimes the number of lampposts changes for the worse, and on the strange science of \\"folding things.\\" Again, this was interesting because it was, in a word, original.The Cyprus Shell, coupled with a piece Lumley states he wanted printed after it, The Deep-Sea Conch, are letters that go hand in hand detailing not one but two of the dwellers within the deep (not to be confused with Deep Ones). The first, a hypnotic piece with a mesmerizing snail, and the second, a prehistoric holdover dredged from the deep, flow well together and leave a wonderful taste in the mouth of the reader.Lastly, Born in the Winds, another Lovecraftian pieces on the wonderfully Arctic world of the WindWalker, is something that approaches a familiar topic but does so in a grand way.The stories I chose not to breakdown are The Man Who Felt Pain, The Man Who Photographed Beardsley, No Way Home, The Pit-Yakker, The Mirror of Nitocris, and Necros. This, in no way reflects upon them as stories because all are quite good, but more on the laziness of the reviewer himself and his need to keep some things nameless.All in all, the way this collection bounces from topic to topic, from beastly horror to loathsomely fungoid terror, is a sight to behold and well worth the read. I especially find it nice to fear something new for a change."},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","review":"Some of the short stories in this book really shine. The best (in my opinion) is &quot;The Viaduct&quot; which I have forced all my friends to read. We all agree it is outstanding. This is the best short story collection I own, and would recommend it to anybody."},{"Title":"FRUITING BODIES AND OTHER FUNGI - SIGNED","review":"Aside from having one of the coolest titles ever, this is one of the best collections of short stories in the vein of H.P. Lovecraft. Ah-ah-ah, but wait. This isn't to say that Mr. Lumley writes in a thick prose which could bore you to death while speaking of \\"indescribable horrors\\" - rather, Lumley takes every bit of that \\"I never really thought about how little man knows about anything\\" kind of chill that Lovecraft is famous for, and injects it into his own kinds of ideas and situations. There are also a few non-supernatural stories here, which show that a person doesn't need to transcend space and time in order to find true horror - again, we know SO little about anything, including what we're capable of.\\"Fruiting Bodies,\\" the titular opener, is one of the most singularly creepy stories you might ever read. I won't say much except that you'll never again walk into your basement without thinking about this story...and if it's musty and moldy, you probably will try to find any excuse you can to NOT go.\\"The Man Who Photographed Beardsly\\" is a quick first-person narrative, detailing...well, it's an artist talking, and he...hm, well, without ruining it, it's a quick narrative of \\"what happened.\\" This might be considered a little weak, but it's still good.\\"The Man Who Felt Pain\\" is a future-set tale of twin brothers, one of which has the ability to feel the pain of others from all around him...and suffers greatly from it. The other, who tells this tale, raises a good point from this: that \\"if we all felt everyone's pain, why, then there'd be no more wars or cruelties or hurtfulness of any sort...\\" More emotional than it is scary, but with chilling implications that will haunt you - along with certain images from the tale itself - for a long time afterward.\\"The Viaduct\\" is a straight-up thriller, with two boys who like to live life on the edge learning the ultimate lesson for themselves after making fun of a local reta--um, \\"special kid.\\" It's a seriously tense story, but sadly the supernatural is again missing here. Scary climax, however.\\"Recognition\\" - ahhh, Lovecraft delight. Strange happenings, eerie noises, monstrous implications, and a creepy finish. What more could you want from a second-generation Lovecraft writer?\\"No Way Home\\" is also Lovecraftian in its angle of things (eep, pun lurking in there...). If you get lost somewhere near where you think you are supposed to be, maybe...don't read this story if you stop to think or rest. And watch out for High House!\\"The Pit-Yakker\\" is not about some kind of monster that lives in a construction site and makes yakking sounds, unfortunately. I had that impression far too firmly in mind, especially after reading Mr. Lumley's intro to the story (\\"...sometimes I wonder what they'll find under all that pit filth.\\") Another no-supernature story, but, like \\"The Man Who Photographed Beardsley\\" and \\"The Viaduct,\\" it's still a good one.\\"The Mirror of Nitocris\\" - ah, back into Lovecraft mode. Narrated by Henri-Laurent de Marigny (later a faithful Watsonian sidekick to one of Mr. Lumley's series heroes, Titus Crow), it's a quick tale of a cursed mirror of an ancient Egyptian queen, ancient beings, and...well, read it for more details. There's one image from it which is pretty haunting, especially if you're alone in your room and dozing off while trying to stay awake.\\"Necros\\" - nope, not NecrosCOPE, just Necros. Englishman visiting Italy meets a beautiful woman and her companion, a creepy old man, and a romantic evil begins to form.

Great for reinactors and SCA, as well as anyone who loves simple, delicious natural food.

Being 13 I got a lot of negative comments about reading this book. I do not think I have read anything that had made me think so much in a long time. Sexing the Cherry is sort of a philosophy book only it is done in a story and it is not at all like reading a philosophy book. You do stop and just think about what you read.

The thing that is great about this book is that WInterson weaves these seemingly unrelated storylines and fairy tales and, sometimes, mere images and concepts together into this wildly imaginative and intellectually challenging souffle' of a book. I had never considered time like I do now. I had never even questioned so many of the basic ideas and concepts that I once held dear, until this book ripped them to pieces and said, &quot;All that stuff is just crap you have been taught to believe. Why not start figuring it out for yourself?&quot; And that is what I am trying to do. Thank God for Jeanette Winterson. She is jewel."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"I read this book for the first time shortly after it was published and returned to it this summer as I often return after a few years to books that engage me deeply. While I am prepared to acknowledge that Winterson has certain pretensions as a writer, she spins a whopping good yarn. This is a book for readers who are patient, adventurous and ready to give themselves up to a complex and entertaining tale."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"That's my one-line summary. But let me go at least a little beyond that for the sake of completeness. Big picture: there's really not really actually. This book felt like a disturbed sleep with a lot of dreams. Dreams are seldom coherent, jumping realms of space and time as they so wish. So does Winterson in this book. I recognize it's a conscious decision on her part, but I've never really been excited by a recounting of all the dreams of a night. Too weird, too tiresome. Plot: primarily the intertwined tales of a mother, son, and people who touch their lives in 17th century England, but also a minor parallel tale in modern London. Characters: interesting - no doubt about that. The Dog Woman, in particular, is fascinating. A woman who lives with scores of hounds, is large enough to need a twelve-blanket shawl, and heavy enough to throw an elephant on the other end of the scale into the sky could be nothing less. Prose: cryptic, engaging, and poetic at times. Winterson really can use language beautifully.So what doesn't work? Foremost, as I mentioned before, the book is just not tight. It strays all over the place, and even stretching one's mind to the ends of rationality and beyond, it's difficult to figure out what the purpose of it all is. While Winterson's imagination is quite enchanting at times (the stories of each of the twelve dancing princesses stands out in particular), most of the times it feels tedious. Her plays with magic realism don't hold their own at all, and feel rather amateurish when compared with those of the masters like Marquez. In hindsight, the book also feels a bit over-sexed, and not in the supremely sensual and uplifting way that Winterson's other work \\"Written on the Body\\" was.I'd recommend avoiding this book. It's not terrible, but there's so more and so much better of Winterson, and of everybody else, to read instead."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"This has got to be the most overrated book I have ever read. Thankfully it's only about 160 pages. The entire book I kept waiting for something to justify the lofty reviews and high praise.

I had a headache half way through and it never got any better. I have a hunch that people say they love this book because it's the PC thing to do simply because it is an author who writes about gender/sexual identitiy issues.

It was hard because I only read at night before bed, not every day, and so there were gaps between my times of reading. I always had to go back and read what I had read before to make sense of what I was reading. I don't like the way the book is put together, switching from one character to another and one time period to another constantly. However there were very beautiful passages that I enjoyed very much. I would never have chosen to read this book but I am glad I was forced to do so despite its difficulty."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"This one was chosen as a book club read. It was a strange book. Sometimes it seemed like the author was in a drug induced state when writing certain scenes, like the suspended dining room with alligators below. Some book club readers enjoyed this book, but for me it was just too out there. I didn't finish it and didn't actually get what the point of the story was as it kept leaping from one fantasy world (or mental state) to another without any links. There are lesbian references, like the different take on \\"The 12 Dancing Princesses\\" who get married and all leave their husbands for women or mermaids. Like I said, it jumps around all over the place! Not a book I would recommend. But hey, that being said, it's always good to read something different."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"As part of my continuing preparation for reviewing Winterson's new book, \\"Why be Normal When You Could Be Happy\\", I've just finished this one. SEXING THE CHERRY is firmly in the post-modernist camp, as is all of Winterson's work, and although this is not a camp in which I'm generally comfortable, I have trouble resisting Winterson's work, since its so beautifully written. SEXING THE CHERRY mixes history and myth, and includes a lot of narrative sidesteps and digressions. It plays with time and the power of story, and the motifs of orphan and monster/mother are here, as they were (although more realistically) in ORANGES ARE NOT THE ONLY FRUIT. In this novel, the narratives shift between seventeenth- and late-twentieth-century London and the world of fairy tale, which stands outside time.. The principal narrators Cherry are a seventeenth-century giantess called Dog-Woman and Jordan, her adopted son, whom she fished out of the river (here, too, we have similar religious overtones to ORANGES). Winterson explore questions of gender and sexual identity, as well as the power and limitations of story-telling. And as usual, she does it with sly wit and lovely prose."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Well, that was...different. I've read my fair share of books that utilize either farce or magic realism to get their point across, but never together, and never to this extent. \\"Sexing the Cherry\\" by Jeanne Winterson flits between subverted fairy-tales, metaphysical discourse, bawdy satire, and commentary on its 17th century historical context. It's astonishing how much is stuffed into such a slim volume, though perhaps in compensation of this, it demands a re-read just to grasp all the themes and ideas at work.An infant is found washed up on the banks of the Thames and is taken in by a hideous but kindly giantess known only as the Dog Woman. Calling her foundling Jordan (after the river), both mother and son recount their experiences in life through two alternating first-person narratives, each represented in the text by small pictures of a banana and a pineapple. The Dog Woman is practically a force of nature; a giantess who is a law unto herself, reaping bloody justice upon those that deserve it, pitting her size and strength against her oppressors.Meanwhile, Jordan is more of a dreamer, and eventually takes to the seas with naturalist John Tradescant in search of adventure and discovery - though this is not the only voyage he takes. We've all experienced that moment when we've gazed off into the distance and been told by an observer that \\"you're far away\\" or asked \\"where are you?\\" and here Jordan is convinced that these moments encompass a secret life that he's living - one that he wants to explore in search of the elusive Fortunata, a beautiful dancer with whom he has fallen in love.His journey (both internal and external) is one of marvels - a silver city that floats in the air, an entire town that dies of love, a house with no floors in which the furniture is suspended by chains, and eventually the twelve dancing princesses of the fairy-tale, each with their own story to tell. Their twelfth sister is the sought-for Fortunata, but is it she that Jordan is really in search of?Throughout \\"Sexing the Cherry\\" there is no clear narrative at work. The lovely poetic-prose is fragmented and flits from one situation to another seemingly at random; almost like a series of disparate vignettes. It was not until my second read that many (but not all) of the pieces fit more coherently together and Winterson's exploration of her themes became more apparent. The book explores a wide range of subjects: self-identity and awareness, the complexity of time and space, the difference between our inner and outer lives, gender politics, male and female sexuality, the nature of heroes - it seems a large puddle of themes, but most of it manages to link together quite nicely; though other aspects seem only tenuously relevant. My favorite part was undoubtedly the stories of the twelve dancing princesses, who \\"lived happily ever after, but not with their husbands\\", but I'm at a bit of a loss to understand what any of it has to do with the rest of the book. Perhaps I need a third read, or some other type of clarification.Especially noteworthy is the fact that though the book predominantly takes place in the 17th century, it can shift back and forward between the 20th century and an unfixed fairy-tale realm, sometimes centuries into the future where alternative versions of Jordan and the Dog Woman (in the form of Nicholas Jordan, still searching for answers, and an unnamed vigilante-activist who battles for the environment) experience echoes of their past selves and reconnect with their love for each other. This relationship between mother and son lies at the core of the book, and is perhaps the only dynamic that extorts the nurturing side of love instead of its ability to devour.This is also a very reference-heavy book in regards to its allusions to several historical and literary subjects. Quick trips to Wikipedia filled me in on some of the more central facets at work throughout the book, and suffice to say that if you have a passing knowledge of Charles the First, John Tradescant, Oliver Cromwell, Puritanism, Franois Rabelais, Gargantua, and of course, the original fairy-tale of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, you'll probably find it easier to grasp some of what comes to pass in \\"Sexing the Cherry.\\"Reminiscent (for me at least) of Angela Carter's \\"The Bloody Chamber\\" with a little of \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" thrown in for good measure, \\"Sexing the Cherry\\" is certainly a challenging read, and certainly not for the faint of heart considering it contains scenes of intense violence and rather squicky sexual situations (including bestiality and necrophilia).If you're hesitant, keep in mind that this is a very short book. It's less than 150 pages, so even if you find it baffling, it's not too much of an investment of your time, and you may just find yourself intrigued not just by what Winterson has to say, but how she says it. Every reader will take something different away from a book like this; for me it was appreciation of Winterson's skill at putting into words that feeling we all have - that there is so much more to a person than outward appearances. It sounds trite, but within the context of the book it is compelling. By tearing down our preconceptions of space and time, the internal lives of Jordan and the Dog Woman gain an imaginative force and infinite capacity that can achieve nothing less than the creation of new worlds. In Jordan's words (paraphrasing): \\"Two lives; the ideal outer life and the inner imaginative life where we keep our secrets...if the other life, the secret life, could be found and brought home, then a person might live in peace.\\""},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"I've never been more confused than when I was reading this book. It's short, which is definitely a good thing because you're going to have to read it several times.

If you loved this, you'll love I Was Amelia Earhart by Jane Mendelsohn. And vice versa."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"One of the first things that struck me about this book is how it was so similar to Virginia Woolf's 'Orlando'. Both books are based on the premise that time is flexible, rather than a linear progression, and both combine fantastical elements with historical fiction. They even both use the Thames as an allegory for main themes. Whether this similarity will put off other readers, I don't know, but I felt that it did not detract from the merit of 'Sexing the Cherry'.This is foremostly a grown-ups fairy tale - there are dancing princesses, a giant woman, magic, towns dying of love. Set (mainly) in England at the time of Cromwell, the tale is told in alternating sections by Dog-Woman (the giant woman) and Jordan. Dog Woman, who is a loner living with her many dogs, discovered Jordan as a child on the bank of the Thames. They have some amazing experiences, though this is what you would expect to happen to such an amazing woman. This is a grown-up's fairy tale in that there is a lot of sex and violence (this book is not for the squemish!) Winterson explores some very 'heavy' topics, such as the construction of identity and reality, and the realities of time. However, this doesn't read as a deep book - it is beautifully written in places, and could be enjoyed for the prose alone.There are modern day characters included in this story, and I didn't feel that this worked as well as the historical characters. However, this is a very good book. It is not particulary long, so even if you don't enjoy it, at least you haven't wasted your time wading through a thick tome! I would definately suggest that anyone interested gives it a go."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"It's been a few months since I read this book, but I want to comment on it and correct a few earlier comments made by others. The setting is neither medieval nor Elizabethan; it is the Cromwellian and Restoration periods of the mid-17th century in England, if indeed it is anywhere concrete at all. The story's hero, Jordan, weaves in and out of time and myth, encountering the wonders of the new world and the Twelve Dancing Princesses of the fairytale (each of whom have the opportunity to describe their failed marriages, some in surprisingly - suspiciously - modern ways). His foster-mother, The Dog Woman, is an astounding creation. Winterson manages to whimsically weave all these threads together; however, this book doesn't *quite* rate a 10. Most readers will be a bit bewildered by the time-travel near then end, and one certainly smells a Woolf in retrospect, but the trip is so much well-crafted and linguistically compelling fun that they shouldn't mind. One does not, after all, ask a magician how they do t"},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"&quot;Thinking about time is to acknowledge two contradictory certainties: that our outward lives are governed by the seasons and the clock; that our inward lives are governed by something much less regular -- an imaginative impulse cutting through the dictates of daily time, and leaving us free to ignore the boundaries of here and now and pass like lightning along the coil of our time, that is, the circle of the universe and whatever it does or does not contain.&quot; -Jane WintersonThis work is an exploration of fantasy and reality -- and of which may be which. Starting out at a certain point in time, veering backwards and forwards from that point, and all along the way, sampling little vignettes about the situation at that point and of how fantasies might come to bear. What a magical journey of discovery there is in this wonderfully written work. What sparkling characters there are inside, with multi-faceted dimensions to each one. What a thought-provoking odyssey this book is, and what a fresh way to present these travels.This author is exquisitely talented, and is eminently capable of producing wonderfully beautiful prose. Reading her words is a joy in and of itself. Her settings are bold, her characters are compelling, and she does not fill either her pages or her plots with minutia. This work is very much like an opera -- breathtakingly beautiful arias abound, strung together with plot-enhancing threads which glitter and glimmer. Take the journey, and savor it -- and think about the inherent themes and concepts. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Winterson has already stunned the readers with the blend of her power of imagination and lesbian narrative in the first book, Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit (winner of Whitebread Prize for the best first fiction). In Sexing the Cherry, she extends her talent and keeps giving the readers surprises. The beginning of the novel is set in the early seventeenth century with two major characters: Jordan, a young man in Renaissance England, and the Dog Woman, who is gigantic in size and adopts Jordan in the way Mosses is in Bible. With the author's fantasy, the closure of the novel brings the readers to the late twentieth century. Winterson uses less than two hundred pages of words to tell an amazing story which lasts for over three hundred years.The book is about different kinds of timeless loves including the passion between a woman and an adopted son, the hidden gay desire between Tradescant and Jordan, the elusive but beautiful heterosexual love between Jordan and Fortunata, and also the lesbianism found in the reconstruction of fairy tale of The Twelve Dancing Princesses. The novel is like a dream told with interruptions. The author alternates the narrative with two different points of views, which exposes the readers to the deeper thoughts of the characters while we are also shifting between different times and spaces. Sexing the Cherry is more ambitious more Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in representing lesbianism. The reconstruction of The Twelve Dancing Princesses offers a feminist perspective in reading the novel. The dancing princesses are empowered by the author during the process of reconstruction to choose their own fates and rewrite the their predetermined heterosexual endings. Men are no longer the final destination of women's romance. Women can either be independent or seek the same-sex for love. The frequent allusions and to characters in Greek mythologies, like Castor, Pollux and Sappho, strengthens the centrality of homosexuality in the narrative. Winterson, as a postmodern novelist, breaks down the narrative and fills the gaps with the power of intertextuality. She brings the ancient Greece lesbianism and gaiety back to her own story, which is set in the early seventeenth century, and the story itself expands and stretches towards modernity. Sexing the Cherry is, therefore, a book witnessing the evolution and developments of history of homosexuality that gives us a fictional account on how this 'alternative' passion lives through different times.Winterson is smart in presenting different points of view in her novel. in Sexing the Cherry, she uses the images of a banana and a pineapple to represent the voices of Dog Woman and Jordan respectively. The images help alert the readers that there will be a shift in narrative voice and they should prepare to read the passages from the perspective of that particular character. When the story reaches the contemporary setting, Winterson presents the voices of modern Jordan and Dog Woman with a split banana and pineapple. So the split signals the transformation of time, and her fictional imagination goes beyond the level of words. The split images also lead the readers to think whether there is connection between the deformed food with the deformed narrative or characters. Brevity and concision should be the right words to describe Winterson's writing style. She aims at presenting the deepest thoughts with the simplest words, which is why she is canonical author in contemporary British, or maybe World, literature. Different from any realist novels in the Victorian period whose authors tell as much as they can for fear that they may miss any uninteresting details, Winterson tells as less as she can. When she is not telling all what she wants to say ...the words leave space for the readers to think. Though it is demanding to read to Winterson's Sexing the Cherry, it is absolutely pleasurable as nothing is the truth in her book.Winterson is a bohemian going against convention in Sexing the Cherry. Apart from the heterosexual norm I have mentioned, she also challenges other conventions, like truth and lies, and also the idea of time and space. \\"Time has no meaning, and space and place have no meaning\\". This quote from the novel may self-explain why the story is not fixedly set at a time and why the author brings back Greek homosexual mythologies to her narrative with Britain as the setting. Winterson is also troubling what are truth and time. She denies all the institutionalized concepts in our minds. The narrator puts a list of lies in the novel, renouncing that, for example, \\"time is a straight line\\" and that \\"we can only be in one place at a time\\". These denials fit the style of the novel, which is a fantasy across different times and spaces. Winterson rejects all the preoccupied conventions and addresses them directly to the audiences. ... with her power of imagination and might of words on paper and give readers an incredible contemporary masterpiece.Jeanette Winterson is the queen of fantasy and imagination. She links the impossible together and makes them possible in her books. She rejects the right and makes them seem wrong that demands a second of consideration before taking them for granted. Sexing the Cherry is a must to read and should be listed as an important text in contemporary lesbian or fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"A decade after reading it, Sexing the Cherry remains one of my favorite books.

Set in the Middle Ages, the book swings back and forth between the son and the mother, aka The Dog Woman.The mother is routed in reality, which includes being practical and coping with being obese. She has no use for fantasy and emotion. The son lives in an incredible world of make believe. He makes fantastic voyages to imaginary lands. We are invited to experience both realities.The son is endlessly chasing after an amazing woman he has only glimpsed, but learns about finding all you need within yourself. The book shows that you can make journeys through time and space within your own mind. The book is feminist in nature, and celebrates strong, independent women. I highly recommend it for open minded readers!"},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"CHERRY was my first experience reading Winterson. Once I got used to her spare, comical style, I was pulled straight into her magical abyss, intoxicated by it. The novel is absolutely beautiful, reading like a dream of sorts, with colorful images and characters, clever dialogue (common in all of Winterson), and intensely questioning and philosophical ideas raised. You must buy and read this book--to get a feel for Winterson, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Jeanette Winterson is an amazing writer. She combines the fantastical with the mundane gracefully and magically. Her writing is eloquent, intelligent and thoughtful -- thought provoking as well as heart-wrenching.That said, her work isn't right for everyone. \\"Sexing the Cherry\\" was the first Winterson book I read and it's extraordinary. I loved it from the first page, and re-read it passionately at regular intervals. But, it is a novel about fantasy, love, lust and desire (as well as time, life, truth, and so on). She deals with the dramatic and the passionate; she bends genders, time and reality. Readers uncomfortable with candid and graphic writing may be unimpressed with Winterson and her style. I don't find her to be perverse, or a man-hater or anything in those arenas. I don't think she aims to set back feminism, or that she does so in her writing.\\"Sexing the Cherry\\" is an excellent text to start reading Winterson with. It's relatively short and explores all the \\"big\\" topics that are out there in classic Winterson style. I haven't read much like her, but I've been looking for it, and I'll continue to faithfully read her novels when I find them.If you love language, life, and love itself, you should love Winterson."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"A delightful little book filled with mirth, quirky images, and lively prose. With much of the action set in the 17th Century, the story revolves around the adventures of two main characters, the mysterious Dog-Woman and her adopted son Jordan. For readers familiar with Winterson's work, it will come as no surprise that gender politics dominate much of the intellectual landscape, especially the tenuous nature of romantic love. However, it is the lightness and warmth in the story that make it a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Perhaps Jeanette Winterson knew the weaknesses of this book when she gave it the suggestive title. There is not much redeeming value to this pretentious work. Winterson, notorious literary snob, seems to have patched this story together out of half-baked plotlines and unfinished anecdotes of empty spiritual bombast. Read &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot; instead."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"In October 2010, the book discussion group at the LGBT Center in NYC read \\"Sexing the Cherry,\\" which led to a diverse range of opinions.All agreed that there some beautiful passages and well-turned images and sentences. While most found the book a removed intellectual exercise with some clever flourishes, at least one participant found it an enjoyable flight of fancy. Many were frustrated by the lack of realism and only a few enjoyed the magical realism. The division was pretty clear: the women enjoyed the book more than the men (some of whom could not finish it).Personally, I found the ending moving - a clear explanation of much of the hallucinatory text - as the unnamed mercury-poisoned environmentalist dreams of her life as The Dog Woman with her partner Jordan throughout history. I could not, however, explain the fairy tales or clearly tie them to some of the themes in the novel. Some of the gender experimentation was interesting, but much of it seemed unclear.Because of the mixed reviews, I can only give it two stars, but for academics (who read \\"The Four Quartets\\" by T. S. Eliot, study mythology, and know 17th century religious history, and for women's studies courses) it should get three or four stars. \\"Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit\\" by Winterson is a much more approachable book for general book groups, and especially appropriate for GLBT book groups."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Sexing the Cherry is one of the most incredible texts I have ever been exposed to. From the outset, Winterson asks (or rather forces) the reader to suspend all their ideas about life and the nature of reality. Suddenly we are tightrope walking, visiting the world where &quot;love is an epidemic&quot;, or standing with Jordan as he eats his first pineapple. I was amazed by this novel and along with AVA by Carole Maso, it is the best thing I have read."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"If you are the type to read a book and simply accept that the message is the important thing then this book is a winner for you. If you are easily offended by arrogance, pretention and over emphasis of a key theme then leave it on the shelf. The dog-woman is unquestionably the most beautifully hideous creation I have read from a writer of this century, and the linear nature of time is expressed well to begin with. Jeanette Winterson seems to get carried away however, and in her arrogance looses much of the subtlety that flavours the book to begin with so well. Re-reading this, it is her stubborn heterophobia that rings in the ears over any beautiful sounds she may have been making. This is disappointing from an obviously talented woman."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"I like her as an author, but this was not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Reading this book was one of the least satisfying uses of time in my life.

I would suggest picking a much better book."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"this book was enjoyable for me.. the fairytale of the flying city could be a book on it's own for me. i found this book to go off on random rants which did not seem to fit with either character and to me, felt as though they were coming from the author alone. this novel seemed to be written only as a reason to try and make this theory alive some how, and i'm not sure if it was successful at it. at many points in the book i found the events to be unexpected and out of character. the dog woman is portrayed as a loving and caring maternal woman and then a violent incapable of love murderess which i found hard to wrap my mind around.this book to me is in no way feminist and those who believe it is need to re-evaluate their ideas of feminism entirely. feminism is not violence and murder and because someone is large in size does not make them large in broad ideals. the ideas of religion i found also to be limiting to the story because the woman had a very narrow spectrum related to sin and this bothered me in many ways.fantasy is not an excuse for writing unrealalisticly and not following character's personality traits. i found many of this book to be confusing and hard to get over to enjoy the rest of the story.i would suggest people read this book because it has many enjoyable elements and it did not take me very long or intrude on my thoughts enough for me to think about it when i wasn't reading it."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"This is a somewhat bizarre book but i enjoyed reading it through it's peverse nature it really says alot and there are alot of points whether they be artistic or in the imagination that really hit hard, it's a good book to read thats hard to put down it's just a shame that it's such a short book, i was excpecting a little more from this aswell after reading the colourful 'oranges are not the only fruit' beforehand but sexing the cherry has many strong points throughout and makes an inovative read so if you get the chance to read this then take it as it's clearly a well stipulated book."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"I have not read Winterson before so I will not generalise on her overall talent. Winterson's pretentions to philosophical and mystical profundity - her continual reference to the subjectivity of time and space, to our fluidity of self - were merely simplified rants on postmodern platitudes. Her ridiculous feminist ideology - ie, women are good, men are bad - is a backward step for feminism.

The fact that this woman is writing, publishing, and being appreciated in the modern age is gratifying, and in my opinion she can't write fast enough to keep me satisfied.

We couldn't read them without becoming pedantically irritated by the niggling feeling that they'd not quite evoked the right spirit of the time.This feels sufficiently 17th century for me.That aside, the swirling stories, sometimes as sharp and as real as the office around me, at other times feelng like dreams I can scarcely remember, never failed to engage me.At times I tried to grasp all of the ideas, images and threads of the story.

This medieval romp by acclaimed British author Jeanette Winterson pulls you into an Elizabethan world where the royal botanist first introduces the banana to England and a grotesque dog breeder living in the swamp that lurks around the Thames saves a moses-like baby. This unpredictable, Orlando-esque tale pulls you through the centuries to the modern day where the sex- and fruit- swapping characters reincarnate to save each other again.

Winterson masterfully molds words like rebar to form a breathtakingly powerful constuction of a story. Winterson wields, rather than uses language.The reader is envboleped in a world wherre words are tactile with weight, smell and taste. And, this, is perhaps the best way to describe her writing. Winterson sculpts, constructs images and scenes from wrods that have bnoth weight and movement--so that the end result is an arousal machine that seduces both mind and body.The reader walks away covered in phrases, images, and scenes. And long after the text has washed away, familiar sounds and smell will bring the reader back to Winterson's world."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"The absolute best I've ever read, and read again, and again.

Throw away the rest of your books, this one will last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"Sexing the Cherry has a fabulous title and compelling conceit. But the book's sparseness and \\"drop off\\" ending are a disappointment. As a feminist tract, the book is more disturbing in its descent into fantasy violence against the characters (read villains/hypocrites) perceived to be championing the status quo. Rape and physical intimidation have always been the weapons used by the empowered to maintain their domination. Witherspoon's celebrations of force are not an anti-thetical \\"turning of the tables\\" but just a reaffirmation of violence as a way to get one's point across. Please, we do not need a Dog Woman to kill for us but a wise woman to overcome these cycles of violence. The works of Rachael Pollack seem a more holistic and a far less pretentious emobidement of feminism \\"on the barricades.\\" As far as a fantastic novel of early modern England's mythic past, Wendy Walker's marvelous and challenging novel Secret Service is a much more satisfying literary experience."},{"Title":"Sexing the Cherry: A Novel","review":"This book is a wonderful mixture of fantasy, history, and philosophy.

Although the book at first may seem whimsical and even silly, when given a closer look a deeper subject matter can be found.

Most adults will be quite familiar with Longfellow's famous poem about the scrappy and resourceful early American patriots, and it achieves new resonance with Christopher Bing's beautiful and evocative illustrations. As well as I know the poem that immortalized \\"One, if by land, and two, if by sea\\" (the agreed-upon lantern signal from the North Church in Boston), it was a thrilling read. The book is a great tool for helping to explain Independence Day to our boys, and to show how our neighboring towns feature in our nation's story. The maps at the beginning(the British Plan for the Secret Expedition to Concord) and end(the route of Paul Revere's Ride and the Middlesex Alarm) are really interesting and we found ourselves flipping back and forth to compare them. There are also copious notes at the end which makes for good additional reading for an adult or older kid. This book is one that grows with a young reader, and we will be adding it to our home library so that the boys can revisit the heroics of Paul Revere and his fellow riders."},{"Title":"The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere","review":"I just got a new Kindle for Christmas, and this was my first purchase, as I am memorizing the poem.

Only to be sorely disappointed. Granted Amazon did tack on a warning note about this... but I missed the fine print. I would not recommend it for kids."},{"Title":"The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere","review":"As a middle school English/Social Studies teacher, I require my students to memorize The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere. I was interested in how Christopher Bing had interpreted this most famous poem by Longfellow. I must say that I was stunned by his artistic rendering of the different parts of the poem. Most unique of all was the three dimensional letter attached to the flyleaf which was written by Thomas Gage, the British commander. This letter, sent to Lt. Col. Smith, described how he (Gage) would march a force of men to Concord to seize any munitions the Americans might have stored there. And equally incredible is the three dimensional fold out deposition by Paul Revere which described the actions he took to warn the Americans the British were coming. This book was alive with surprises and &quot;hands on&quot; interactivity. When I tried this book out on my 110 students, they were amazed. Then something really amazing happened....history and a poem came alive, giving them a much fuller understanding of the events of April 18, 1775. The way the poem was layed out page by page even helped them memorize the poem quicker and more accurately. The maps, illustrations, and the miscellany concerning the historical ride lend so much to this famous poem that even the most jaded American historian/teacher could learn all over again why we Americans are who we are and why we do the patriotic things we do. This is a must have book for every red-blooded American! Thank you Christopher Bing for transforming American history."},{"Title":"The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere","review":"Christopher Bing, author of the 2001 Caldecott Honor book, Casey At The Bat, is back with his innovative and creative interpretation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's, The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere. His obvious love of history, meticulous research, and attention to detail transports the reader back to that long ago night. This is a very visual experience. Mr Bing's marvelously evocative illustrations give the appearance of old engravings in dark blues and subdued tones. And the text itself, looks as if it was printed on yellowed parchment, and torn from an old book or diary. Imaginations will soar as children examine historical objects, and re-creations of maps, military orders, and other documents, that appear officially sealed, and can be opened and read. This adds to the drama and excitement of the poem, and brings Longfellow's words to life. With additional end notes and historical information about the days leading up that fateful night, and beyond, and a short biography of Longfellow, Christopher Bing has authored a unique, interactive American experience. Perfect for youngsters 8 and older, The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere is a masterpiece to be treasured and savored each and every time it's read."},{"Title":"The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere","review":"I think this book is great!

It's a great book that I think you should read."},{"Title":"The Midnight Ride Of Paul Revere","review":"You know this book is special as soon as you touch it. You realize that the look of leather on the cover is just that, a look. You flip through the pages and find a scrapbook, complete with worn and mildewed pages, enhanced with token mementos that look so three-dimensional you must trace them with a tentative finger. A letter from Thomas Gage to Lieutenant Colonel Smith is tucked inside the front cover; the Deposition of Paul Revere is stuck in the back. We find a map of the British plan and a corresponding map of the Middlesex Alarm, including Revere's actual route. This is *not* just a casual recitation of the classic poem. The words proceed on faded sheets while Bing's illustrations hint at period woodcuts. No explanations are necessary within the text. Notes are saved for the end, and they reveal the minor inaccuracies in the Longfellow version (one of the biggest being that Paul Revere was captured outside of Lexington and that his companion Dr. Samuel Prescott was the one who made it all the way to Concord).

Years since I read Vonnegut and it is time to read more. The storyline takes you in and Kurt's writing style created the appropriate intimacy. A very nice read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Though this is not quite his best or most complex work, I enjoyed this novel for many reasons. First, it does lean heavily towards a Socialistic viewpoint. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The novel is a thinly veiled critique towards capitalism and a sadly poignant look at the future of the impoverished. One man makes it his life's goal to help out the unfortunates using his money and position. He is then considered mentally unsound by those who are in positions of power and authority.The book is well written in typical satirical Vonnegut style. The novel is not as compelling or deep as Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle, but it is an enjoyable, top notch work by itself. If one didn't have an entire body of Vonnegut works to compare this to, it would stand out as a very good novel by itself (hence my four star rating). Just compared to other Vonnegut novels it is slightly lacking."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Vonnegut's humanism and compassion for our frailties is as fresh and relevant now as it was decades ago when this sensitive, funny, and insightful book was written."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"God Bless you Mr. Vonnegut because only you could still be this good in what remains one of your lessor books.Ostensibly the story of 87 million dollar plus inheritance, this book tells the tale of a man and a family beset by the duties of wealth.On the one side we have Elliot Rosewater, the young heir who disdains personal use of the money to devote in service of others. Instead of a hair shirt, Elliot drinks constantly, wears dirty clothes and sleeps in the makeshift office of his own Rosewater foundation from which he disperses periodic grants of money to the needy.On the other side, we have Senator Rosewater, Elliot's father, who's fosuced more about on what the money can do for him. Senate, a place in society, a concern for producing priviledged and dominant decendents so he can better the value of the Rosewater name.We feely oddly uncomfortable to the extent we empathize with the Senator and chagrin at the son.And in the end we wonder at Elliot's actions. How do or don't they ultimately service his father's ends?Regardless of these issues, Vonnegut is always good reading but for first time Vonnegut readers I would probably suggest Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle in that order. Read him when he was being really really deep instead of just deep."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's book, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is about money, power, and greed. The main character, Elliot Rosewater has abandoned his amazing lifestyle in New York to try an experiment of the human soul. He is a drunk, fat, dirty, and rich. He has a lot to give to the world and spends his time doing nice things for people, yet these people are so pitiable, they don't deserve it. Not everyone is happy with Eliot's work. Lawyers try to find him insane and unable to use the family fortune. The books switches between the lives of people Eliot helps, the depressing lives of some of them, the lawyers attempt to find Eliot insane and some Rosewater family history. Vonnegut makes you question Eliot's insanity or his overly niceness to the very end. It also questions the class system in America. The book has its funny moments. Overall it was an alright book and I recommend it if you want a quick, humorous read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Vonnegut is one of those genius writers that you can't help but love. \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" was my first venture into the realm of Vonnegut, but I have to say that I think I enjoyed this tale much more. Perhaps because the topic is closer to my heart, or perhaps I was able to identify more closely with the characters, I found this novel to be both thought provoking and utterly hysterical.The short synopsis - The heir to a ridiculously large family fortune would rather spend his days helping the poor and destitute than attending the large social gatherings which his family feels he should prefer. Naturally this means that he is insane right? His family and one rather unscrupulous attorney seem to think so. They begin their plans on having him declared mentally incompetent, but he may have a trick or two up his sleeve.I often find that I have to be in the right mood to read through a Vonnegut book, for some reason this one gripped me and I was done with it in less than 2 hours. The characters were hysterical, slightly caricaturistic and over the top, but entirely identifiable and comparable to someone we all know. This entire tale is a treatise on capitalism, money, redistribution of wealth, and the question of selflessness vs insanity. If you like Vonnegut, then this is already on your list. If you haven't encountered Vonnegut, give this book a try for an amusing look at true satire."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"There are similarities between the theme of this book and Nick Hornby'sHow to Be Good. It's hard to tell if they come to different or similar conclusions. Hornby suggests that one person or even one family is not able to fix what needs fixing in the world singlehandedly and shouldn't try; one should instead try to keep oneself functional and have much more modest ambitions as regards altruism. In this book, Vonnegut uses satire and exaggeration to point out the \\"craziness\\" and yet the necessity of loving others unconditionally, even when there seems to be little to love about them, or when there are some very good reasons for withholding love, e.g. alcohol addiction or a criminal record. Both deal with the basic question of what attitude we should have toward people in need whose acquaintance doesn't seem to promise us any personal advantage.I originally chose this book because of a New York Times article - it was about deodorant use, and it cited this book as describing a country where odors, thought to be society's biggest problem, were finally eliminated by eliminating people's noses. I found it an interesting premise and kept reading and reading to find it, but it didn't turn up until almost the end of the book, as a half-page summary of one of the science fiction books the protagonist had read. Ah well, at least I found it, and I ended up reading a book I probably wouldn't have picked up or even known about otherwise.I give this book four stars first because it felt quite disconnected, jumping from one incident and set of thoughts of a certain character to another. There are paragraphs with profound insights that I enjoyed and agreed with, e.g. about the value and drawbacks of imperfect human life vs. boring ethereal perfection (disguised as a novel the protagonist was writing), or the part about language teaching on planets that had previously used only mental telepathy (from a book by a science fiction writer the protagonist likes), but these bits seemed to be thrown in simply because the author found them worthwhile and had no other handy place to put them. Maybe they were seeds of ideas that Vonnegut didn't have the time, motivation or adequate material to develop into whole books.Second, for a long time I was wondering where the story would go, and why what I was reading at any given moment was worth getting through. I suppose in the end it did all contribute to the final point Vonnegut wanted to make, but you have to wade through quite a bit of frivolousness to get there. The book is short, but the silliness prevented me from sticking with it too long in one sitting - I mostly had to take it one or two chapters at a time then put it down for a while.I think _Rosewater_ was worthwhile, though, and if you're a Vonnegut fan, and/or enjoy philosophical farce, you might like it too."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Although it's probably destined to wallow in the monolithic shadows of Slaughterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a superb novel and an easy gem (albeit a relatively minor one) in the Vonnegut canon. At heart, it's a sharp, satirical, and darkly funny portrait of American capitalism at its worst, and a genuinely engrossing tale of one man's attempt to change things for the better.The man in question is Eliot Rosewater, a drunken volunteer fire fighter and renegade philanthropist. He's also the privileged heir to a massive family fortune and the President of a charitable organization that was established by his family as a thinly veiled tax shelter. After an eventful stint in the Second World War, Eliot decides to use his vast wealth in order to help people. He moves to a desperately poor town named after his family, and makes it his mission to unconditionally love and support every human being that asks for his help. When his family learns that he's actually using a charitable organization's funds to carry out acts of charity, he's declared everything from irresponsible to insane. Soon, his wife is divorcing him, his father is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and a conniving lawyer is carrying out a devious plan to take a chunk of the Rosewater fortune for himself.In Vonnegut's hands, this disturbingly realistic premise becomes the ideal framing device for his own razor-sharp commentary on class, wealth, greed, politics, love, and the ever-elusive American Dream. The story is told with plenty of characteristic dark humor and sly sarcasm, balanced by a genuine affection for humanity and an oddly graceful ending.It's not his best novel- the story does drag in a few places, and there is a notable lack of focus- but its still an excellent work. Get this if you're a Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This is perhaps the most underrated piece of American fiction in the last 50 years. Much more complex than a traditional anti-affluence screed too often attributed to this work, it's drives right at the heart of what women and men are good for, whether we, all of us, are productive, are lovable. Also entertaining but read it for what it has to say about what to do with the 90% of us who are generally unproductive (both rich and poor!)."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Mark Twain, Orwell, Houellebecq, Vonnegut. Without a doubt some of the best social science out there was not produced in Ivy League schools but out of cranky typewriters in a basement (well, Vonnegut was in Cornell). From the first devastating sentence on (money and honey) this book is a direct indictment of inherited wealth and the so-called \\"free-enterprise\\" system. For Vonnegut innovation and creativity are not related to acummulation, but stealing is. Vonnegut shares with Thorstein Veblen (cited on the text) his admiration for people that really do productive things, and mixes it with the sadness of somebody who knows what is going to happen to those people in the \\"service economy\\". The end of the book seems abrupt, but is very sweet and rewarding (\\"yeah!\\" I screamed). By the way, please note that the baddest character in the book is not the rich and conservative senator but the lawyer trying to steal his way into riches. So true."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I just finished this book, and I absolutely loved it. This was the last Vonnegut novel I hadn't read, and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other novels.To that end, I wouldn't recommend it as a first Vonnegut read. It's almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in America.It's a great novel, no doubt, with a very satisfying ending. But if you've heard about Kurt Vonnegut and you just want to try it out, try \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" or \\"Mother Night.\\"You really can't go wrong with this amazing author, but \\"God Bless You Mr. Rosewater\\" might come off as a bit preachy if you don't know what you're getting into.That being said, it is still a great novel. So if you're a fan, read this book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Appropriate even today. The fault of they versus us, the rich control everything. Asks if some wealth should be taken from the rich and given to the poor. How did it work out with Russia?Great book! I went crazy with highlights for the first part of the book.Really made me think. Loved the book and it had a great ending. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater (Kurt Vonnegut Series)I decided to re-read some classics that I read years ago. I'm so glad I did. This classic by Kurt Vonnegut holds up really well. I found myself smiling and laughing out loud many times as I went through this fast paced page turner. However, it is not just the comedy in the book that grabs one. No it is the story itself and how relevant it is to what is going on today in the world of corporate greed, slimy politicians and the sad age of Supreme Court's false decision to make corporations \\"people\\" under Citizens United. If you haven't read it before, do so. And, if you have read it years ago, re-read it now."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"The plot of this book, such as it is, consists of the attempt of a young, unscrupulous attorney to wrest control of a large trust fund from a scrupled, but unconventional scion of a habitually unscrupulous family. Meanwhile, the scion attempts to live as authentically charitably as he can. As one might expect, the issue is the scion's sanity.Mr. Vonnegut's writing here is typically quick and darkly humorous. Untypically, though, the target of his disdain doesn't appear worthy of the attention. Vonnegut takes on the industry/universe surrounding old unearned money/power and more-or-less effectively savages every component - including the recipients of the charity. Few sacred cows, however, are slain in the attack. Indeed, the book strikes me as almost rote - delivering exactly the characters and interactions one would expect from a satire of the old-monied. As my \\"star rating\\" shows, I don't find this to be a bad book or uninteresting, but it's not the quality of most of Vonnegut's other work. If you're starting on your Vonnegut, save this one for later."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"For me this wasn't on the level of Breakfast of Champions, Sirens of Titan, Cat's Cradle, etc but it was still very enjoyable and thoroughly Vonnegut.It's a quick read, and worthy of an afternoon or two beneath a tree."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"God Bless you Mr. Rosewater is a challenge to fight for social justice and to support the humanist motto if \\"God da-n it, you've got to be kind.\\" In his classic opening sentence, Vonnegut says \\"A sum of money is a leading character in this tale about people, just as a sum of honey might properly be a leading character in a story about bees.\\" Vonnegut uses skittish plots and a variety of curious characters to lay out a picture of America that is becoming more stratified by money and access to power. As the main character, the ill-begotten fortune is given a birth (original accumulation by Noah Rosewater who sent a substitute to the civil war, allowing him to stay home and make millions in the war effort) and a death (Eliot's surprise decision at the end).Pisquontuit, Rhode Island and Rosewater County, Indiana are the principle settings for the book and both are everyday small towns comprised of wealth and poverty. Vonnegut describes the inhabitants of each as \\"The lives led there were nearly all paltry, lacking in subtlety, wisdom, wit or convention - were precisely as pointless and unhappy as lives led in Rosewater, Indiana.\\" The stratification of wealth is most poignantly illustrated in his depiction of Pisquontuit, where Fred Rosewater intermittently enters the drugstore that has the coffee shop for the rich, then the news store that has the coffee shop for the poor.Although America's rich have devised laws to propagate their wealth untouched through the generations, you can still gain access to the \\"money river\\" by becoming a \\"slurper.\\" Norman Mushari, young lawyer, learned in law school that, \\"just like a good airline pilot should always be looking for places to land, so should a lawyer always be looking for situations were large amounts of money were about to change hands.\\" Hence comes the plot line. Eliot Rosewater is the heir to the $87,472,033.61 Rosewater fortune. To make sure he gets his dibs, Mushari wants to prove that Eliot is insane thereby redirecting the money river to a distant cousin, Fred Rosewater, in Pisquontuit.Besides Elliot Rosewater and Fred Rosewater, the third important Rosewater is Senator Lister Ames Rosewater. Clearly, he personifies the idea proposed by the subtitle \\"pearls before swine.\\" Similar to Ebenezer Scrooge prior to his visits from Christmas ghosts, Senator Rosewater represents the attitude of the aristocratic rich that social programs and wealth reallocation initiatives are frivolous because we should not waste good things on people who will not appreciate them.In usual Vonnegut style, the reader is clearly and repeatedly presented the theme of the book in no uncertain terms. Early in the book, he writes \\"When the United States of America, which was meant to be a Utopia for all, was less than a century old, Noah Rosewater and a few men like him demonstrated a folly of the founding fathers in one respect: those sadly recent ancestors hadn't made it a law in the utopia that wealth of each citizen should be limited. This oversight was engendered by a weak-kneed sympathy for those who love expensive things, and by the feeling that the continent was so vast and valuable, and the population so thin and enterprising, that no thief, no matter how fast he stole, could more than mildly inconvenience anyone.\\"Again, later in the book, Kilgore Trout has this to say in reference to Eliot's apparent capricious financial support of his neighbors' needs: \\"Well... what you did in Rosewater County was far from insane. It was quite easily the most important social experiment of our time, for it dealt on a very small scale with the problem whose queasy horrors will eventually be made world-wide by the sophistication of machines. The problem is this: how to love people who have no use?\\""},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Eliot Rosewater is a fat and mediocre minded do-gooder. What makes him extraordinary is that he has the means, through the Rosewater foundation, to dole out money to anyone who requests a bit. In his home town of Rosewater, Indiana, where he has returned like the prodigal mad citizen, he ignores society, purchases an enormous fire alarm, bankrolls the fire company and personally answers 24 hour calls over two telephones- one for assistance and the other for fire emergencies. He has different composures, voices and rules for each. The cranks who phone him for money are old drunken, ugly spinsters, none too clean or honorable town 'handymen,' and his father, the famous Senator Rosewater; whom seeing his son, shrieks at God, for having handed him this vale of tears. Elliott drinks too much, cannot father an heir and has driven his otherwise loving wife to a arsonist's breakdown. She torched the Fire Company.Eliott has no grand plan of philanthropy, not even a cause, unless the volunteer firemen and their work count. He has a quasi Buddhist detachment from hatred as well as wealth and status. Plenty of people, especially the evil Norman Mushari, are out to filch his millions and crucify his reputation in the meantime.The book examines the Rosewater mutation whereby every couple of generations, a male is born with no aspiration. No desire to scratch and claw or otherwise greedily grasp power from others.Vonnegut's thematic puncturing of capitalism, European fatuousness and the nature of success and failure is showcased with the also unseemly nature of the non-wealthy and unsuccessful. Mushari goes face to face with the God of most of Vonnegut's cosmology- Kilgore Trout, science fiction writer. The book is part of the canon of this icon of an author and as such, I recommend it highly to one and all. The time when I first read it, was a time when I still found drunks a riot and even the smallest attack upon the status quo enormously satisfying. We are no longer that naive and yet the lessons and the funniness of just about everything can never be dated."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This book has all the makings of a classic Vonnegut text. However, it lacks depth, and the plot never really thickens. By the end of the novel, I was asking myself, &quot;Wait, how did we get to this point in the story?&quot; The overall idealism which is used to give character development to Rosewater takes away from the reality of the situation. The novel does have rewarding characteristics, but I do not think this should be the first book by Vonnegut that one reads."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"What a fantastic book! It is one of the only books that I&quot;ve read were I really wished it would not end. The content came across as light but imbued with deep thought.

I can't remember a character study that I've liked more."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Kilgore Trout's novel -- 2br02b -- boldly ask the question &quot;What the hell are people for?&quot; Vonnegut offers an answer in this book. His protaganist Eliot Rosewater, struggles for meaning in a world obsessed by money, greed and prestige. (Sound familiar?) Yet Eliot is able to hold his course. I strongly recommend this book to reluctant cynics and others looking for a witty, well written novel about the nature of human beings."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Others have described the plot of this book quite adequately; I'd just like to add my own personal thumbs-up! I've read only one other Vonnegut book so far -- Breakfast of Champions -- but I'm already a big fan! Vonnegut is brilliant at tweaking the establishment in a blatant yet subtle way. And I love his sense of place -- places he's spent time in: Indianapolis, rural Indiana, New England. This book was a joy to read, and I'm looking forward to reading more of his books!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This Kurt Vonnegut novel looks at Eliot Rosewater, a rich eccentric who decides to make the world (or at least his town) a better place. Rosewater is rich, drunk, blessed with a social conscience, and he sets out to help improve the lives of the lonely, the ignored, and the losers in the town of Rosewater, Indiana. For this philanthropy Rosewater is seen as insane or close to it. The story looks at both Mr. Rosewater and some of the people whose world he brightens. The book is a bit depressing at times, but contains a powerful message and quite a bit of critique at greed, hypocrisy and other human frailties. Some may note the similarity of two names (Rosewater, Roosevelt) who believed in helping people. This novel doesn't have quite the power of Vonnegut's top works like SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, but it's an entertaining read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I have only read a few Vonnegut books, and this is definately my favorite. It shows how greedy modern man is. Mr. Rosewater is ungreedy with his money, and because of this he is labeled insane and unfit to control his assets. A great book and I reccomend it to all Vonnegut fans."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I thought Vonnegut wrote a great story about how greed clouds your vision. It is a very original story, and I thought it was both funny and sad. I thought it was funny how when a man was not greedy with his wealth, and handed it out freely, the hero was lebeled insane and locked up. I recomend this book to any Vonnegut fan."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"A very heartening story about the life of somewhat regular people. That is, not extravagent. Although very eccentric, but that's what one expects from KV. The story is pretty strong, and very funny along the way. Not a good first-time read from Vonnegut."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I've been through most of the Vonnegut collection, and this is one of the better ones. The thing I love about Vonnegut, is he creates all these peripheral characters and Trout sci-fi plots that are such wonderful ideas in and of themselves. I wish he would explore them more fully. I especially would have liked to read more about Lila. Well, I guess it goes to show you good ideas are a dime a dozen."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I would have to say that this book is one of the best Vonnegut books ever. This book releases a message to all of its readers. It has a strong story line and the characters are not all that different from our friends and our family. This book honestly changed the way that I looked at life and I would recommend the book to anyone and everyone. Take a chance and read it. This book has all of the elements that you could ever want: Humor, Satire, Irony, Sadness, and resolution. Long live Mr. Rosewater!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I just finished reading this book for the first time since I was in college - and I am 43 now. It is much different than I remember it. Being a book about money and distribution of same, it is natural and right that I would see it much differently now, after being emeshed for years in the workaday capitalistic world, than when I was an idealistic college student. However, having said that, I wonder how much of the book REALLY is about money, and how much of it is really about pride, humanitarianism, and being a friend. Elliot Rosewater simply wants the world to be a better place. He does not really deceive himself into thinking that money itself is a cureall - he seems to understand that charity, in and of itself, is not the answer. Self respect and holding one's head up is. Is Elliot really crazy? Heck, yes! But just because he's crazy does not mean that all of his ideas and thoughts are insane. Like most of Vonnegut's books, this is a fable - you could pick it apart all day if you like on the facts and the contradictions - but that would not diminish it. It is a fine fable, and contains many truths. It's a good book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This book is truly a pearl. This work and &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot; are the two anchors of my Vonnegut collection. As I began to collect his books, I was like an avid junkie who couldn't wait to get her next wry-wit fix from Mr. Trout and company. I have gone through 2 copies of &quot;God Bless you Mr. Rosewater&quot; after being worn out from many re-readings but no matter how tattered &amp; torn, I still have them -- tape, notes in the margins and all! My collection, all in paperback, is one of my prized posessions that I hope to share with my child as my mother had done for me. You will enjoy this work and if it is your first experience with Vonnegut, what a treasure you have found!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Vonnegut gives us an excellent commentary on the dichotomy of social hierarchies, as well as making us laugh out loud. He conflicted the drunk with all the money and the runty lawyer who wants to swindle him out of it. We can see that there are factions within factions and utterly wealthy men who still have hearts in this fictional world adorned by the ideas of a very inventive Mr. Kilgore Trout. Volunteer firemen, fishermen and senators all in one little book. Classic Vonnegut."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I can understand why a lot of people might not like this book. It is a complete thrashing of the American system of Free Enterprise, so if you buy into social Darwinism (Republican?), you may find this book offensive. I am reading this book for the fifth time and I can tell you that it is the best book I've ever read. Rosewater is my favorite character Vonnegut has created. If you are open minded enough, this book could have quite an impact on the way you want to live your life. Due to our current political situation here in the US, there has never been a better time to read this book. Buy it and read it immediately. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"The strangely logical and materialistic style of Vonnegut, where mundane detail leads to astronomic conclusion. Half comic and half serious. A fun read.."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"\\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" is indeed, as many reviewers have said, Mr. Vonnegut's most blatantly socialistic book. However, it is also quite obviously his most Christian. The text's protagonist, Eliot Rosewater, is nothing short of a benign Jesus figure. Numerous biblical references throughout the text are used as corollaries to Eliot's life and the plethora of those references make Vonnegut's point pretty obvious for the reader.This text is less plot driven than many of Vonnegut's other works, but its themes and importance I think are far superior to many of his better written novels. The first 100 pages or so can be a little dull (not normal in a Vonnegut text) and the slow start is something his readers may not be used to. However, the text does build to what I think is a wonderfully written and executed conclusion.Two highlights of the book are Eliot's baptism \\"sermon\\" for two twin boys that he is asked to baptize. Eliot has no religious titles or significance, so he just speaks to his hope for the boy's futures, ending with a simple and profound statement, \\"God damn it, you've got to be kind.\\" Another excellent moment in the text is a biting letter written by an orphan named Selena who is serving as the maid in a rich household. The letter is written to the man who runs the orphanage that she came from, and it has the bite and sting that can only come through the eyes of a child. Vonnegut is at the top of his game in these sections.Further highlighting the idea of Eliot as a Christ figure Vonnegut has Eliot well aware that those he helps are ingrates at best, and almost all are undeserving of his generosity and love. It is a great strength of the text that \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" freely admits that the people who need the help the most are often the most undeserving, and the acknowledgement of that is a great strength of the book.The most blatant Christian references, and I think the most powerful parts of the text, start on page 264 when Vonnegut has his go to character (Kilgore Trout) explain what Eliot was attempting to do by helping anyone who asked, regardless of the circumstances. The 6 pages where Trout \\"explains\\" the \\"experiment\\" are worth the price of the book alone. They are stunningly simple and beautiful. I was trembling with joy as I read them. It is really nothing less than a secular Sermon on the Mount.I won't ruin the end of the book here, but Vonnegut completes the obvious Christ archetype with Eliot in a manner that is unexpected, true to the character of Eliot, and perfect. And then Vonnegut in that way of his stops writing, it is over, the end. The rest is up to you. Very few novels make me think about my obligations to others in this world, this book did. It has stuck with me, and will. And for that I say God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Some of his books are terrific. This one is an extended short story. The theme is clear and the characters are well drawn, as usual. This is a minor work from one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Like all Vonneguts, this is a pretty great book. It was not as good as \\"Cat's Cradle\\", but it was pretty close. If you finally want to know about the mysterious life of Eliot Rosewater who is one of the two people in the world to ever read Kilgor Trout, you have to read it."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Although not quite up to the level of Breakfast of Champions, which is among my favorite books of all time, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is still a breathtaking, amazing, humorous read. In fact, after I finished it I was inspired to grab another of Vonnegut's works, Welcome to the Monkey House.Kurt Vonnegut's unique ability is to look at different aspects of the world around us that we take for granted as being \\"normal,\\" & then point out the absurdity of it all. In this book, one among several ideas that he takes aim at which many take for granted in everyday life is class distinction, and the huge effect it can have upon one's life: to have won the genetic lottery of being born rich. But what makes the main character, Eliot Rosewater, really strange is that he chooses to personally use his vast, family fortune to help people from his small, hometown of Rosewater, Indiana that the modern world has largely rendered without hope, use, or purpose. He does not just throw money at these people's problems, although he is not above doing just that. Humorously, he runs a dingy foundation located above the town liquor store all by himself, with a hotline written by hand in every phone booth throughout the city. That way, in between drinking himself into oblivion, he personally deals with all of the rundown inhabitants' problems, big & small. He is essentially an eccentric saint: a fat, disheveled, drunk, Harvard graduate with all the money in the world, who just wants to help people.Thus, an ambitious lawyer sets out to steal the family wealth by proving Eliot's selfless actions to be insane. Vonnegut once again pokes fun at what society deems \\"normal\\" behavior and how many regard being motivated purely by self interest as being the only rational course of action. As usual, Vonnegut introduces a number of strange & memorable characters, while keeping the reader laughing throughout. Kurt Vonnegut's unique take on the world is truly timeless & never seems to grow out of date, despite the fact that the book was written in 1965. Take a peek into the world of Vonnegut and come away knowing a little more about reality."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I couldn't help being slightly disappointed with this one. I suppose one of your favorite authors will sometime let you down a little. It's still a good read, but considering he has so many other better books, this isn't essential Vonnegut, unless you are a big fan and want to read all his novels. It's true what everyone says about Vonnegut though, he is very addictive. Once you get into him you will want to read all of his work.That said, the book goes everywhere in all directions, one minute you are interested in what happens next, and then the book just goes off on something else and for a little too long. I enjoyed reading about Elliot's encounters and conversations with the people of Rosewater, but I wanted more. I enjoyed reading about Fred Rosewater, but it was almost too little, too late. And another big problem was that Vonnegut brings in a couple useless characters and talks about them and a past situation when we could be reading more Eliot or Fred. I know it's very Vonnegut and I understand the connections with the message, but it wasn't all a good thing with this one.I suppose Vonnegut said all that he wanted to say in this book, but I would have read more if it was there. It's a short, light read, and although it is preachy, it's still an honest and moral take on society and life, just don't expect it to be as good as, \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" or \\"Mother Night.\\""},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"\\"Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion.

Between Eliot's strange relationship with his French wife, his drunkenness, and his overwhelming generosity, one can't tell if Eliot is insane or the world around him is insane.Vonnegut captures with great skill Eliot's sarcastic ideas and extremely dark, but funny jokes. At one point Eliot reads about the bombing of Dresden and his reaction is an expected outcome to the story and representative of Vonnegut's personal confrontation with one of the most important incidents of his own life.As Vonnegut writes in: \\"A Man without a Country\\": \\"Humor is an almost physiological response to fear.\\", the scattered stories of Eliot's interactions with the world describe the world's craziness with a loud laughing fear. \\"God bless you Mr. Rosewater\\" is another fabulous book by a gifted writer."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Next to Breakfast of Champions, this is my favorite Vonnegut book. I found myself laughing, shaking my head at the absurdity of the book and how it correlates to the ideals we live with. It makes a bold statement, but does so in a subtle way. It lets the reader make connections and Vonnegut steers the reader with skill and precision."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Mr. Vonnegut has put forth a great piece of literature that binds together the worlds of poverty and gross wealth in a study on what makes human beings worthwhile or worthless and the make up of the architect of man.This novel is a collage of introspection and lessons. Using religious allegory, Vonnegut shows that human beings are only human-- whether poor or rich. His god figurine, when all sculpted by the end of the book, shows the reader a view on the creator of man: entropic on the surface, yet acutely set in his ways of good, even after the denouncment of him by his people. Take this view however you wish.Vonnegut's god is all of us: rich, poor, filthy, crazy... the list goes on. And Vonnegut raises the strange question: Was God crazy for producing mankind?This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening. Take my view however you wish."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This isn't one of Vonnegut's best, but like every other Vonnegut book I have read, it is extremely entertaining and fun to read.

But Norman Mushari, a nasty lawyer, is out to prove that Eliot is insane and the family foundation should be given to a distant cousin.This book was published in 1965 and was one of Vonnegut's first 5 books.

Rosewater is a little ditty, a nice try. The book has a lot of potential to be more than it is, but it is caught up in the very same trivial matters that it is satirizing. The loose plot is heavily focused on money as a good and equally evil thing, and it drifts from one character to the next without the amazing wit of Vonnegut's other novels.

God Bless You Mr. Rosewater focuses on the titular character of Mr. Eliot Rosewater, a wealthy son of a congressman, with a sizable pension and large estate he is set to inherit. Despite his extraordinary wealth he spends the majority of his time focusing on philanthropy, while imbibing large quantities of alcohol, and alienating his wife. The plot revolves around the machinations of a lawyer who is attempting to prove that Eliots behavior proves he is insane, and therefore not an appropriate executor of the Rosewater estate.The novel suffers from the introduction of a multitude of characters which ultimately play no part in the resolution of the story. Despite being two hundred pages it takes the book several chapters to really get going and it feels like Mr. Vonnegut reused many of his wisdoms in cobbling together God Bless You Mr. Rosewater. The message of the novel is as true as it is valuable, though similar conclusions are reached in many of Vonnegut's other works much more cohesively."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This book was in excellent condition and arrived in the time estimated.

Also I was listening to Georgia Lee by Tom Waits. Good combination. This one like most Vonnegut's has complex characters that all intertwine, I've always admired his screen play style novels that really feel like reading a long good movie. This is the 3rd Vonnegut where the last sentence made it for me, at least emotion wise. He always ties it back in and leaves the readie satisfied and wanting more. On to the next one!"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This is a great book as Vonnegut points out a lot of the flaws of our society in a comical way.

It is also the story of America, capitalism, and its sanity, or lack thereof. As expressed by Vonnegut's alter ego, Kilgore Trout, \\"The problem is this: how to love people who have no use?... if we can't find reasons and methods for treasuring human beings because they are human beings, then we might as well... rub them out.\\"This gradual effacement is the story of the residents of Rosewater County, Indiana, and the difficulty of loving them is the problem faced by Eliot Rosewater, and Kurt Vonnegut. These lost and lonely soles, consumed and regurgitated by the relentless appetite of American capital, are difficult creatures to love, indeed. Eliot Rosewater found a way, while Vonnegut was always conflicted between love, despair, and contempt (\\"sons of suicides seldom do well\\").This is Vonnegut at his most sardonic and contemptuous, the schizophrenic humanist and misanthrope. Thankfully, this is Vonnegut at his most socialist, and most of his venom here is directed at the ruling class: \\"Slurp from the Money River...slurp as much as you want, but try to keep the racket of your slurping down. A poor man might hear.\\"\\"P.S. Who really runs this crazy country?

Eliot stood to inherit control of the vast family fortune through the Rosewater Foundation (a legal entity constructed to shield that fortune from taxation.) But then Eliot went off to WW2 to become a highly decorated Captain of combat infantry. He served with men from all walks of life. Oh yes, he also accidentally bayoneted a 14-year old non-combatant, and afterwards tried to throw himself under a truck. After this he was never the same, much to his rich and powerful family's distress. While he did come back to graduate from Harvard Law and assume control of the foundation, he started behaving...irrationally. He started to actually use the money to HELP people! He also started drinking, wandering, and visiting volunteer firehouses- among other eccentricities.Eventually, he ended up in Rosewater, Indiana- a depressed backwater that his family had long ago used up and abandoned to found the beginnings of their fortune. He found the people there to be without pride, without hope, without work. So he opened up an office over the liquor store in order to help anyone who needed his help. The sign on the door said simply, &quot;Rosewater Foundation: How Can We Help You?&quot; So Eliot Rosewater, philanthropist, poet, volunteer fireman, Harvard graduate, and drunk proceeded to help any and all that came to him for help.Needless to say his family could not allow such insanity to continue. Why even Eliot's psychoanalyst came to the conclusion that Eliot was a pervert. The nature of his perversion being the fact that he had channeled all his psychic energy into bringing Utopia to earth for all those in need. What could be more abnormal in modern, capitalist society?This is my absolute all time favorite Vonnegut novel- and I have read them all.Oh yes, it also offers one of the best descriptions of the absurdity and injustice of the class system in the U.S. As one of the characters asks, who does run this crazy country? These cr**ps sure don't."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"There was something in Vonnegut's first rush of books that is lacking in his later novels. Although I enjoy his later books and for the life of me I can't say what this mystery quality is, whatever it is it tends to elevate even his minor books into affairs that are far more memorable than they tend to be. Maybe because the themes and images he's using here were new to him and he was still comparitively young . . . I don't know. It's not for me to say. This novel has a simple premise and a simple plot and moves unsurprisingly from point A to point B and yet I still have an incredibly enjoyable experience reading it, even though I finished it basically on my lunch break over the course of maybe an hour and a half. The premise then is that Eliot Rosewater has a lot of love to give to the world and spends most of his time doing very nice things for people who are almost pathetic enough to not deserve it, simply because he was born rich and feels he has a lot to give to the world. A lawyer, meanwhile wishes to prove that he is insane and has it in him to make quite the case. The book basically waffles back and forth between the lives of the various people Eliot helps, the comically depressing lives of some of these people, a little Rosewater family history and the lawyer's attempt to gather information on Eliot's apparent insanity. All of these pieces don't cohere into the great whole that his absolute best books (like Slaughterhouse-Five) do, but the pieces themselves are great fun and Vonnegut's humanity has never been as apparent here. It doesn't have the grim central event like the bombing of Dresden to put everything in context but somehow he manages to make the book moving and hilarious at the same time. The plot of course is slight and it's a fairly direct book, though the ending is about as abrupt as can be (and is mentioned in a later Vonnegut book I think, fortunately I forgot about it). This won't ever be regarded as one of his classics but even a minor work by an author working at his peak is worth another look and while the rewards here may not be as grand, they're simple and pleasant in their own small way."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Just as most of Vonnegut's novels follow a single character through a series of semi-plausible episodes, so does 'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater'. However, unlike the others, this story does not rely on science fiction. Rather, it focuses on one man's struggle to affirm his sense of self against great odds. Seems like an appropriate theme in a society increasingly concerned with style and ignorant of substance."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This book is a rather interesting one, with a fair dose of humor and philosophy. This is the first book by Vonnegut which I've read and I found his writing style easy to read and very entertaining and witty. I can't say I agree with his economic philosophy - I tend more toward capitalism than socialism - but I appreciate the unique way he put his ideas across. The titular character, Eliot Rosewater, is in charge of administering the family fortune with power to do whatever he wants with it. At one point in his life, he decides to abandon the trappings of a rich lifestyle in favor of a more modest one. He moves to a backwards county home to lots of people labeled as worthless by upper society. While there, he offers to help anyone in need however he can, whether it includes providing money or other types of support.While the people in need are very grateful to Eliot, most outsiders seem to look on his actions as evidence of his insanity. Eliot seems to be an alcoholic, but that bothers his father and others far less than his concern for the welfare of strangers. It's clear from Vonnegut's portrayal of Eliot's critics - his father and others each have their own issues - and the way they voice their criticisms that he's firmly on Eliot's side. Who wouldn't be - he's just a regular guy using his inheritance to help out the less fortunate. I find it interesting how Vonnegut seems to be pushing for people who can to help out the less fortunate, rather than having the government handling it. This approach to socialism is quite different - it's voluntary and individual. Even more importantly, Vonnegut makes a case against class distinction. The people Eliot helps need simple recognition as human beings and emotional aide even more than money. Too many people are like Eliot's father - too aloof and snobbish to give common people a second thought."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Now that I have been writing book reviews on almost everything I read, I feel compelled to write at least a few words on this incredible novel of Kurt Vonnegut's - of which thousands of reviews have been written already.I kept having to check the publishing information to make sure that it was written 46 years ago and not 46 minutes ago. Some of the concepts are so prescient as to seem almost spooky. (Or perhaps that means they are timeless...but caught up in today's crazy political spectrum, I am going with the prophetic angle.)\\"Thus did a handful of rapacious citizens come to control all that was worth controlling in America. Thus was the savage and stupid and entirely inappropriate and unnecessary and humorless American class system created. Honest, industrious, peaceful citizens were classed as bloodsuckers, if they asked to be paid a living wage. And they saw that praise was reserved henceforth for those who devised means of getting paid enormously for committing crimes against which no laws had been passed. Thus the American dream turned belly up...\\" Can anyone say Wisconsin in 2011?And, \\"An even more instructive motto, in the light of history made by the Noah Rosewaters, might be: Grab much too much, or you'll get nothing at all.\\"I tore through this book, amazed not only by Vonnegut's amazing social commentary, but also by the small pauses of quiet beauty he describes, scenes of a country that was and might not be much longer. \\"That's such an American sound, you know? School out and the flag down? Such a sad American sound. You should hear it sometime when the sun's gone down, and a light evening wind comes up, and it's suppertime all over the world.\\" So descriptive...I can see and feel the scene exactly.I must thank my aunt again for what turned out to be one of my best birthday presents...a book that seems one written in the past but most applicable for our tenuous present. If only we had an Eliot Rosewater to save us, to realize the unjust reality he describes that so many Americans now live in.\\"...fright about not getting enough to eat, about not being able to pay the doctor, about not being able to give your family nice clothes, a safe, cheerful, comfortable place to live, a decent education, and a few good times? You mean shame about not knowing where the Money River is?\\"\\"The what?\\"\\"The Money River, where the wealth of the nation flows. We were born on the banks of it - and so were most of the mediocre people we grew up with, went to private schools with, sailed and played tennis with. We can slurp from that mighty river to our hearts' content.\\"Because even in a land where there is the theoretical chance that a person can become \\"self made\\", what matters now more than ever, is how close one was born to that magical Money River."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"With \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\", Vonnegut takes on the sordid issue of class. The main character, Eliot Rosewater, has inherited vast wealth, but feels lost and adrift until he moves to a small town and spends all his time giving \\"uncritical love\\" and money to the depressed, disenfranchised locals. His behavior completely mortifies his elitist Senator Father and psychologically troubled princess wife. It also allows a greedy young lawyer ammunition to have him declared insane; the only way possible to get his hands on part of his fortune.If recent studies have shown that rich people are no more intelligent (at least in terms of IQ) than poor people, this is something that Vonnegut clearly knew decades ago. It's clear from this novel that he believed that the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" were usually separated by little more than luck; usually involving being born into the right circumstances. Eliot's father subscribes to the conventional American wisdom that hard work is all it takes to succeed. Eliot's idol, Science Fiction writer Kilgore Trout, has a more ambivalent point of view. The reader is left to make their own conclusion."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Okay, so God Bless You... may not be the the best thing Vonnegut's ever written, but Vonnegut on an off day is still well worth reading. This book has all his trademarks, from biting social commentary and blazing satire to dark humor and quirky characters. It's a speedy read that will make you both laugh and wince by turns. Don't make it the first Vonnegut book you read -- for that, I'd suggest Slaughterhouse 5 -- but if you're a fan give it a whirl."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"In \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" Kurt Vonnegut (one of my favorite authors) takes on the class system, capitalism, and philanthropy to splendid, wickedly funny -- and hopelessly accurate -- effect. It is the tale of the Rosewater family, which has amassed a fortune totalling $87,472,033.61 and devised an elaborate foundation to protect their money from the American government that would try to tax it away from them. Through meaningless acts of \\"charity\\" (such as loaning expensive art to a museum for an exhibition, and then taking it back) the foundation ensures that the Rosewater fortune will always be firmly controlled by the Rosewater family. Trouble brews when an ambitious young lawyer decides to prove that the current foundation head, Eliot Rosewater, is crazy so that an estranged cousin can take over -- getting the lawyer a nice chunk of the family fortune in the process. This will not be so difficult to do because Eliot has been doing the unthinkable since taking over the foundation from his Senator father: he has been using it to do actual charitable work. You see, Eliot suffered a breakdown after accidentally killing three innocent firefighters (one a mere fourteen years old) in Europe during WWII. Desperate to atone for his mistake, Eliot has returned to his hometown of Rosewater, Indiana to make a difference in the world. Within a year he has spurned the wealthy families in town who aspire to his company and come to be revered by the impoverished townsfolk as a saint. He helps anyone who needs it -- in one instance he has an abusive husband arrested, then turns around and hires him a lawyer when he can't afford one on his own. To the world at large these are the actions of a man who has totally lost his mind. But has he?Vonnegut masterfully navigates the reader through the saga of the Rosewater clan and the novel's themes with only one stumble to be found in the all-too quick ending. The rest of the book forgives this mistake. You can't go wrong with Vonnegut, and in \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" the remarkable author is at his satiric best."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Eliot Rosewater is giving away his money (and love and attention) to deserving people... and some maybe not so deserving. This proves he is crazy. Hence the subtitle \\"Pearls Before Swine.\\"That's the setup in this minor Vonnegut novel. Eliot has no illusions about the quality of the people he sometimes helps or how far his help will go. But he insists that the world would be a better place if everyone gave a little something to each other. This in turn sets Eliot up for a confrontation with a lawyer and his Senator father as the family fortune is threatened because Eliot can be proven insane. After all, he's giving it away. He must be crazy. Kilgore Trout comes to the rescue with his usual comically inverted (and yet somehow truer) morals.This isn't Vonnegut's best but it is a pleasant and gentle novel with a bit of a moral and some good comic moments. A nice read."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"&quot;God Bless you, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest books. It is based around Eliot Rosewater, a warm hearted, eccentric millionare, and presendent of the Rosewater Corporation, a incredibly rich foundation that is passed along from father to son. He abandons the high life in NYC, and moves to Rosewater County in Indiana, his family's home. Eliot begins to help the poor people (which is all of Rosewater County) with their personal problems, and soon becomes the &quot;father&quot; of them all. A lawyer, seeking the Rosewater fortune for himself, sets out prove that Eliot is insane. I won't tell you the ending, but suffice to say that it is excellent. Vonnegut shows us thatmoney isn't everything, and a poor person from Indiana is just as important as a Senator from New York. A matchless book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"When one has read many of the great and wonderful works of Mr. Vonnegut, this book leaves one cold. It compares well to reading the cover story in a tabloid."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"After reading a vast assortment of Vonnegut's work I found this book unsatisfying in the extreme. Usually honest, often brutally so, Vonnegut works this book into a crecendo of cheesiness. What had potential to be a genuine classic like &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, &quot;Dead Eye Dick&quot; and &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot;, became nothing more than a cheap commentary on the human race with a sappy 'love thy neighbour' quality. If I want to be scammed by an unimaginative ending I will go to Hollywood; movies are less time consuming."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is the worst book I've ever read by Kurt Vonnegut. Vonnegut's usual rapid-paced prose and intense dialogue is largely absent in this somewhat preachy novel about wealth and charity. Though there are a few interesting scenes which may save the story from total failure, both the plot and main characters remain underdeveloped throughout most of the book. This was the first (and hopefully will remain the only) Vonnegut book I have ever struggled to finish."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"To paraphraze Winston Churchill, if you don't weep over Vonnegut's acclaimed social satire at 20, you have no heart. If you still weep while re-reading it at 35, you have no brain. By masterfully portraying the abyss between the \\"dirt-poor\\" and \\"filthy rich\\", wittily arguing that the latter are far more useless than the former, Vonnegut only casually mentions the fairly well-washed millions in between; the ground on which the demarcation lines are blurred, and his personal rules of humanism are frequently set aside in favor of garden-variety street smarts. Vonnegut's trademark quirky characters, vivid style, and tight, beautifully wrapped up plot are, as always, very useful weapons in his emotional blackmail: if you don't see the world on his terms, if you take neither side, be ashamed of yourself! Be very ashamed of yourself..."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I've just discovered Rosewater and Trout in Vonnegut's book Slaughterhouse-Five....I'm interested to see what comical situations they get into in this book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater is a perfect example of a canned story. Nothing about this book could be considered excellent, nor original. The alleged wit of Vonnegut makes no appearance in this bit of tripe. The only somewhat redeeming facet of this book was the fact that everyone in it was useless: the Senator who obvioulsy bought his way into politics, the absent-minded heir to a fortune unearned even by his father, and the helpless souls of Rosewater, IN. Perhaps that's what this story is all about; reducing everyone to the same mean, useless status, and then showing how a &quot;great&quot; person will love them regardless. What a load of tripe."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"As a huge vonnegut fan, I was very upset to find that this book had a badly developed plot, uninteresting characters, and an almost tragic lack of all the things that make a vonnegut novel great. There really wasn't even what I'd call a complete story, and I skipped a lot of pages out of boredom just to keep things moving. Not recommended for anyone except the rare person who thinks Vonnegut's good books are bad and wants to read a bad one for the sheer pleasure of it all."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Even though \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" is well written, the story falls flat and also lacks the humor you'd come to expect from a Vonnegut novel. The message of the story is beyond cynical. The economic classes exist for a reason, and even though wealth being handed down to subsequent generations may seem unfair to most, it is the way of life and should be respected as such. This book carps on an issue that is just totally unfair to those who work hard for what they have, and they should most certainly have the right to pass it down to their sons and daughters. Doesn't posterity mean anything here? Maybe not. I do agree that the rich deserve to render a small amount of their wealth to the lower classes, but only through a fair taxation system.In an ideal world we would have more Mr. Rosewaters, mad with philanthropy, giving away their wealth as if the money would never end. Unfortunately, that's not how it is. That being the case, all of us should not hate those who have just because they don't lavish the have nots."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"After greatly enjoying some Vonnegut sci-fi, I was perhaps looking for the wrong thing with this book. It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine. While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is \\"luminous when wet\\"), the plot is weak and far-fetched. For example, Rosewater's grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text! That is too silly to be satire. Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant. He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.Not recommended."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Eliot Rosewater, a millionaire-become-champion-of-the-little-people is accused of being insane and floats through his attempt at a good benevolent existence in an absurd world where insanity is shunned, but simple existence is automatic insanity."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Slaughterhouse Five often gets the credit, but this is the best Vonnegut book out there.

Eliot Rosewater has no ulterior motives; he just wants to make people happy. GBYMR proves Vonnegut has range, as he can swing from the gloom of &quot;Slaughterhouse V&quot; to the bright outlook presented by GBYMR: That people really do have the capacity for good."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Eliot Rosewater could be someone you know. Though caught up in a family struggle of money and power, Rosewater himself wants nothing more than to read the science fiction novels of Kilgore Trout and be a volunteer fireman. Here, Vonnegut uses his great skill of detailing characters to bring this tremendous, lovable character to life. In the background, of course, are the usual life-problems which bring a tinge of dark humor and a sometimes muddling subplot about Rosewater's money which surround him in his life. A gratifying, and greatly humorous experience"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"In one of his last books, Vonnegut imagines a meeting with Eugence Debs, American socialist.\\"As long as there is a lower class, I am it it,\\" Debs once said, \\"As long as there is a criminal element, I am of it. As long as there is a soul in prison, I am not free.\\"Vonnegut had to report to Debs that people \\"snicker and snort\\" at that quote today. But they reacted the same way, Vonnegut implied to Debs, to the Sermon on the Mount.And so, Mr. Rosewater, leading messiah of \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater,\\" was snickered and snorted at. Of course, Vonnegut made this snickering and snorting funny. He also made it touching.Read \\"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\\" to see Christ's message clarified by Vonnegut; to see him sadly observe how this message in received in today's America--land of the ridiculous and home of the insincere."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"This book, which has been touted as a &quot;brilliant satire on almost everything&quot;, is, in fact, one of Vonnegut's second-rate novels. It is perhaps his most pessimistic, cynical, darkest book of them all. It's also different from the majority of his work in that it is fairly straight-forwardly written; it doesn't jump around on narrative detours like most of his books do. The story is told in fairly linear fashion. It is certainly a good book, and a nice, quick read (like all Vonnegut, it has that indescrible weird factor - not suspense, in the typical fashion - that keeps you reading it); it's just that it doesn't have that Great Underlying Moral like his best books do. The book's main character is Eliot Rosewater (undoubtedly a familar persona to Vonnegut fans), and he gives in this book - to everybody - what seemingly no one is willing to give these days: unconditional love. In turn for this, he is spit on by the world. This book says, in typical Vonnegut candor, Help people; you won't be appreciated for it, and you will probably even be ridiclued, but do it, anyway. It also says, Most people don't deserve help - they are worthless, useless, and stupid - but do it, anyway. Also, this book is a sharp-toothed satire of the American welfare system. Vonnegut's view of welfare echoes mine: it was a good idea to start out with, but its usefulness has passed. People who don't need it are milking it shamelessly, and the time has come to drastically re-organize it, or dispense with it alltogether. Vonnegut also tackles the issue of inherited wealth, and all forms of riches you earn by birthright, or other similar cirumstances, without actually earning yourself. Of course, this inevitably raises the subject of Communism. This book has a lot of interesting ideas, and points, but they are never brought together into that single, incredible cohesive whole, like they are in his best books. Certainly, it is a worthy read for fans; others, however, would be wise to start elsewhere."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Out of all Vonnegut's novels, this is by far the best. One reason is that there are no sci-fi trappings, no silliness about time travel or aliens, nothing but a real study of American history and the impact of wealth and greed on the ideal of democracy. While short and exceedingly easy to read, the book feels like an epic narrative, since it sweeps from the very rich to the very poor, from the battlefields of the Civil War to the modern sailing playgrounds of the very rich. It feels much longer and richer than it is in terms of page count alone.For the first and last time, Vonnegut takes the time to outline a realistic setting,Rosewater County Indiana, and observes the effects of poverty there with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of John Steinbeck at his best. At the same time he cuts back to New York, writing about the rich Rosewater clan and the wealthy families of Pisquontuit with all the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Edith Wharton. Last of all, he uses a brilliant series of flashbacks to describe America's tragic fall from the courage and carnage of the Civil War to the squalor and self-indulgence of America today. The Civil War sections alone are unique in Vonnegut's work; he captures the horror of the casualty rates without in any way denying or shying away from the ideals of the Union Army. He writes about the civil war with all of the power (but none of the sentimentality) of Southern apologists like Charles Frazier.Eliot Rosewater is an ideal American hero,and a fascinating foil to Billy Pilgrim in SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE. Both are All-American guys. But where Billy is an average Joe, Eliot is a scion of wealth and privilege. Where Billy is a ninety eight pound weakling, Eliot is a sailing and tennis champ. Billy is a one-dimensional anti-war propaganda device, (too \\"pure\\" to acquire even the most basic military discipline) while Eliot is a much-decorated officer who fights well and suffers as only a brave man can.The greater power of Eliot Rosewater means that the stakes are much higher. Unlike Billy Pilgrim, Eliot is not a passive weakling but a crusader who sacrifices wealth and privilege to help the poor. His warmth, gentleness and paternal concern for the less fortunate are rendered with tenderness and humor. Vonnegut creates a convincing modern day saint and gives him a real experience among fully realized victims of modern America.As always in Vonnegut, the few flaws in the book all involve women. Eliot's wife Sylvia is flayed raw again and again as a spoiled socialite who simply can't muster up the gumption to stand by Eliot's side. Vonnegut apologizes for her -- but with a sneer. He never seems to have realized that not all women are as fragile and treacherous as his own mother, who, as he never gets tired of telling us, abandoned him by committing suicide at an early age. By the same token, Fred Rosewater of Rhode Island, Eliot's distant cousin, is rendered as gentle and long-suffering, while his wife Caroline is a one-dimensional shrew. Vonnegut can't get away from an instinctive hostility to women as women, as if the mere biological condition of womanhood were some sort of moral weakness.His social criticism, as bracing as it is, often suffers as a result. For example, in the Rhode Island section, he feels like lashing out at the rich, so he writes (quite memorably) \\"four fat, stupid, silly widows in furs were laughing over a bathroom joke printed on a cocktail napkin.\\" Hell of a sentence! Sounds like Joseph Cotten in SHADOW OF A DOUBT. But what does it really mean?What's odd here is that Vonnegut is attacking the rich, only it seems he only means women. And what he hates about women is that they know about sex? That they enjoy sex? That sex exists? That somehow wanting sex killed off the men folk? As Thackeray's Becky Sharp puts it, he leaves women under the weight of an accusation that is, after all, unspoken.Still, this is the one Vonnegut book that really has the feel of a fully accomplished novel, a genuine American classic. It has moral depth and epic scope that he never achieved again."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"Vintage KV. An excellent yarn that occasionally moves along a bit slowly and with somewhat of a predictable outcome.Every town should have a Rosewater and yet we are most assured that for every Rosewater there is the plotting scheming lowlife lawyer in the weeds.In the end, right triumphs over the system.Def worth the price."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"&quot;God Bless you, Mr. Rosewater&quot;, is one of Kurt Vonnegut's greatest books. It is based around Eliot Rosewater, a warm hearted, eccentric millionare, and presendent of the Rosewater Corporation, a incredibly rich foundation that is passed along from father to son. He abandons the high life in NYC, and moves to Rosewater County in Indiana, his family's home. Eliot begins to help the poor people (which is all of Rosewater County) with their personal problems, and soon becomes the &quot;father&quot; of them all. A lawyer, seeking the Rosewater fortune for himself, sets out prove that Eliot is insane. I won't tell you the ending, but suffice to say that it is excellent. Vonnegut shows us thatmoney isn't everything, and a poor person from Indiana is just as important as a Senator from New York. A matchless book."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"'God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater' is a novel about conflicting social viewpoints, specifically, socialism vs. capitalism (although, to be fair, I would have to say ultra-capitalism, considering the vast wealth of all the people involved). I am a huge Vonnegut fan, and although this book was good, and had many quotable lines, it was missing a key element that most Vonnegut stories have in abundance: a plot. There is no actual plot here, nor is there really a resolution. The psuedo-plot follows the attempt by Eliot Rosewater to use his inherited vast fortune to help the less fortunate, while his father attempts to bring him back into the fold (start using his money for what it was intended, making more money), before an opportunistic lawyer from the firm that handles the Rosewater fortune declares Eliot insane, thus putting the money in the hands of another branch of the Rosewater family. In reality, the book is mostly a social commentary centering mostly on debates/arguments between Eliot (the \\"socialist\\") and his father (the \\"capitalist\\"). What I found really amazing in the book, is how it illustrates the genuine fear that the rich have of any type of socialism, not because it threatens their vast wealth (that is pretty secure), but because it runs contrary to the way they believe things are supposed to be, the most extreme type of social darwinism. The rich in this novel don't consider the system to be unfair and they don't consider themselves \\"lucky\\", in fact, they look at the fact that they are rich as proof that they actually ARE better than everyone, and that their fortune is actually given to them in a divine manner, as if God himself chose them to be rich and above everyone else. Most of the characters in this book, especially the Rosewaters, are all on the extreme side of their coin, probably not reflecting any sort of reality, but it does make the book fun to read. Who will like this book? Only Vonnegut fans probably, or anyone that wants to see capitalism and the rich portrayed in the worst possible way."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I loved this book and so will you. This novel truly displays how generosity can affect the world and how one person can make a difference. To the truly generous it seems rather selfless and only natural to give, but to the greedy and rich it is viewed as a rather insane act.

However, the line between \\"insane\\" and \\"saintly\\" is very blurry...As with most Vonnegut, the \\"plot\\" is the weakest element, and one reads the work for the dark humor and social insights. This is especially the case here, where things fall apart at the last chapter in (to me) a most unsatisfactory and unsatisfying way. Given the number of 5-star reviews, others are much more forgiving about this.Not KV's best, but not his worst, either. Maybe worth reading once, especially if you like the author."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"As a reader of historical fiction, I hadn't read any Vonnegut. Upon his death, I vowed to read him. Finally five years later, I finally tried this one, primarily because it was a book at hand.As to its being almost 50 years old, it holds up well. One reason is that there are no direct references to the Vietnam War or the Civil Rights movement to date it. There is an openly gay character who is naturally woven into the story, which is unusual for the time. The theme is even more relevant now that what was once the 10% has become the 1%.The novel began with a great satire. Somewhere in the middle the satire was no longer subtle. Perhaps it would be a better short story, or an even shorter novel. The ending was unsatisfactory, almost as though Vonnegut didn't know exactly how he wanted to end it.I'm not sure where or how this fits in with the Vonnegut oeuvre, but it didn't meet my expectations for this writer. I'm aware that this is considered a lesser work, and will try another."},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, or Pearls Before Swine","review":"I almost never read books anymore, but today I started this novel on the bus when I was going to my family's house for Thanksgiving and I surprised myself and read the whole thing.

It might not be as good as his three best-known works but it is still a 5 star book.

Instead of a large invisible rabbit, Eliot chooses as his soulmate science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, who becomes a sort of imaginary best-friend to Eliot, and, like Harvey, only asserts his actual presence at the end of the story. The book is better than the play (or the James Stewart movie, for that matter), but it is not one of Vonnegut's best.

It is the first book I read which is a guide to \\"mindful living\\" and it remains the best. This is in large part because Alan Watts wrote with such luminous clarity and with startling metaphors.

After reading a few pages I checked the publish date and was shocked to see this book was published in 1952! It sounds like Mr Watts wrote it last week (which is a sad commentary on our society)! After half a chapter I was 'wowed' enough to wonder who this author was and was shocked again when I saw his credentials (MA in Theology/PHd in Divinity). This is by no means a Judeo-Christian book.While Mr Watts doesn't specifically mention Taoism, his writing has the flavor of it. He spends a long time discussing the problems associated with living in the past, then jumping straight to the future without stopping to look around *now*. He explores the use of language and its shortcomings, but those arguments have become commonplace in undergrad courses everywhere. The real power of this book for me was the focus on letting go, for example, &quot;...the desire for security and the feeling of insecurity are the same thing.&quot; He expands on this quite clearly.Reading this book was a strange and fun experience in that I realized that I was thinking of a lot of the same issues that Mr Watts discusses, but was of course 5-20 years behind him on almost all of them.

However, it is not short on wisdom. In fact, it is loaded with powerful insights, analogies and examples that illustrate universal truths. It also embraces the reality of mystery and paradox. It doesn't try to explain them away and encourages the reader to avoid killing the \\"alivenss\\" of the world by putting too many things in boxes (i.e. concepts). Instead, it encourages an attitude of openness, wonder and awe at the miracle of life and seeking direct contact with reality.This book deals with the big existential questions and the problem of anxiety and insecurity. In my opinion, it is one of Alan Watts' best book, if not his very best book. He approaches his topic from an Eastern point of view, but one that a Western person could easily relate to. Alan Watts is a gifted author and a master of using language to convey complex concepts in easy to understand ways."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"While the thesis of this book (that existence is basically and fundamentally an uncertain and insecure endeavor and that our efforts at attaining security are futile) is deceptively simple, I find that most readers miss the full implications of its message. Indeed, I also missed it and only after multiple readings, did it finally dawn upon me. For it seems that the thesis of the book begs, yet does not answer the question, \\"How is one to stop trying to attain security in a world where it doesn't exist\\". This can lead to one all too easily dismissing the book for it's lack of resolution and result in the taking an \\"easier said than done\\" attitude toward Watts' message. However, answer the question it does, powerfully if subtly, which lends to the likelihood that the answer will go unnoticed. For Watts attempts to show us that the answer is contained in it's own question. By drawing upon eastern philosophical principles, he attempts to induce an experiential rather than verbal understanding, by posing yet another counter question, which in essence amounts to, \\"Why do you want to stop trying to attain security?\\" And at this point, the reader may yet still fail to see the full implications of this approach, which reveals the fact (and the deeper message of the book)that our attempts to stop trying to attain security are based in the same motivation as our attempts to attain it; they are one and the same problem, and both are, however deceptively designed, to achieve the same end: security. When this is realized, only then does the effort to attain security in any form cease and the state which Watts describes effortlessly become reality rather than cliche."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This book was one of my \\"bibles\\" when I was 15 years old.

It told me what I already knew but needed BADLY to be told and it told me things in ways I had never thought.One of my most lingering and favorite images from the book is his talking about the pain you feel when you stub your toe. How the knee-jerk reaction is to grab the toe, hold it tight, squeeze it to ward off the pain. He pointed out that doing just the opposite would actually be the least painful -- to will the body, the foot and toe to RELAX into the moment, and allow the pain in and to flow through.Like the title of the book, his writing takes you to a place to be able to see that grabbing for security is the least secure way to go about things. I love it. Five thumbs up."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I think Alan Watts was the finest writer of English prose I've ever read, and \\"The Wisdom of Insecurity\\" is one of his very clearest, wisest, and best works. If you doubt me, just read his opening words in the chapter \\"The Age of Anxiety\\" here on this site. Does anyone write more clearly and beautifully than this, especially about such profound matters?Watts wrote this book just after leaving the Episcopal Church upon his painful realization that he couldn't reconcile the official theology and his duties as a priest within that institution with his personal and very \\"Eastern\\" view of reality. The thesis of the book is that we find enlightenment and happiness not in looking for perfect and unchanging conceptual truths, metaphysical realms, or theological beings inside or outside us, but in feeling \\"in the very marrow of our bones,\\" that the Reality with which we're inseparably linked is an ever-changing, unified field of existence, and completely accepting and relaxing into this realization and Reality.A previous reviewer says that he was inspired by the Watts quote to the effect that life is a mere spark of light between the darkness before birth and the darkness after death. But this is misleading. Watts' point was that people try to escape seeing life this way by misguidedly clinging to simplistic and ultimately unfulfilling notions of permanence in this life or afterward. Watts argued that life was infinitely more than an ephemeral spark too, but that we will only realize this deeply when we joyfully embrace the \\"wisdom of insecurity.\\"I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's a masterpiece of poetic wisdom."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This is an amazing book for 1951. Watts is probably one of the clearst writers dealing with the indescribable I have ever read. In this book he deals with the major teachings of Buddhism including the first 3 of the noble truth, impermanence, no self and dependent origination without a single word of jargon. He is able to relate these teachings in a meaningful way to the daily life and concerns of a person living in a western culture with poise clarity and some beautiful if sometimes ruthless turns of phrase. No doubt a very important book that has had nowhere near the attention it deserves, a real pity that few were interested since he was pointing to the inevitability of the bind the west now finds itself in. Now that the publishing industry and the professional \\"psychobabblers\\" are on the Buddhism/mindfulness wagon, here is a dependable reference that puts all their gloss and marketing panache to shame with pure content; not a wasted self congratulatory word in it anywhere. It's a must read ... and now I will pursue everything I can get my hands on that has come from this brilliant man."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I t is hard to believe but in the first part of his life Alan Watts was an Anglican priest. His first two books,Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical ReligionandThe Supreme Identity, were written in that Christian mode. Watts however went back to college to study Eastern religion and philosophy, and this book is the first fruits of that work.If I were rating just the first half of this book it would get five stars. In these first four chapters Watts gives a brilliant diagnosis of the problem of modern man. Put very briefly we are caught in the eternal 'I', feeling separate from life, and caught up in contemplation of past hurts and future hopes. We never really live our life, which after all is in the here and now. We are driven to escape a sense of \\"insecurity\\" without realizing that this very uncertainty is a basic feature of life.In the second half of the book Watts tries to describe a new way of living based on 'now consciousness'.

Before the \\"Power of Now\\" by Eckhart Tolle, there was the \\"Wisdom of Insecurity.\\" A comparison reveals that everything is derivative. But, Alan Watts' style is so deep and revealing, coming as it has from his many lectures. It is also more fully grounded in an understanding of the commonalities of various religious traditions. But, most enlightening, in my mind, is Watts' description of how he explains God to children, and how his explanation so elegantly answers the question, \\"Why do bad things happen to good people.\\" This book is a must read for the heart and soul that seriously seeks a deeper understanding of human spiritual and philisophical questions from existentialism to Budhism, from hedonism to Christianity.

A personality and teacher is indeed a rare thing.Truth be told, Watts is NOT a pantheist nor does he call for any form of pantheism..he simply delivers common sense to make ones own spiritual life aware and mindful..no matter the tradition since we are concerned with the Good.Giving credence to Jung and Krishnamurti in explicating the need for wholeness between the I and the not I or the dialogue between the conscious and the unconscious, we learn that the Biblical Adam gave names to the animals after he saw them not before he saw them...does this connection seem reasonable? if so, then read on...insecurity?anxiety?..Balance between suffocation and abandonment.To believe is to cling, to have faith to let go..pretty impressive..the book is loaded and dangerous for those ready to wake and up and live."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I suffered from anxiety disorder following a psychotic reaction to marijiana.Two and a half years into my disorder I discover this book.BAM!

According to Watts and other spiritual giants, the task for mature individuals was neither to deny their insecurity, nor to attempt to overcome it through their own efforts. Instead, he called upon us to admit our own relative weakness, and surrender to God those elements of our lives that we shall never control.In short he called upon us, in faith, to abandon ourselves to emptiness: the great mystery. Dr. Watts' framework was Eastern; primarily Buddhist, but the reality can still be embraced by all people of faith."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This was written in 1951, so I guess it is one of Watts's earlier books. He may have been still a Christian at the time, but he seemed to moving away from that and embracing more Buddhist concepts. He discusses the human condition and describes modern life in a way that does not seem the least bit dated. He points out that we are all anxious, clinging to hectic pleasures but worried that they will be taken away. Watts has a real gift for fresh, engaging insights, and his prose is always elegantly readable.What is the solution? He gives us the Buddhist idea that there is no inherently existing self (although he does not use the term \\"inherently existing\\", that comes from Geshe Kelsang Gyatso). Watts does a lovely job of illustrating these ideas. He points out that there is no self apart from experience, and that there is no real time except for now. He brings up Ouroboros, the snake devouring its tale, and explains that this is a symbol of the divided self. When we posit a self apart from nature and experience, as Western thought does, we automatically create alienation.So this was good stuff, maybe not as good as what I have heard in some of his recorded lectures (those I highly recommend, they used to be on the radio and are available for purchase), but still solid. I plan to continue listening to and reading the work of Alan Watts."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"Maybe I'm just not into the heavily \\"mystic\\" (perhaps that's the wrong word) tone of the book, but I did not enjoy it for the most part.

I get the feeling that this book could've been two-thirds of its current length if Watts would establish points and move on rather than dwelling on them for pages on end. That's not to say that this book is completely without merit or that others may not enjoy it. Rather, it just was too tedious for me.There was one chapter I found particularly interesting and that is the chapter regarding our awareness of time and, perhaps more accurately, our awareness of ourselves in time and its relation to anxiety.

I came across it backpacking in Southeast Asia and was very grateful for having it along with me on the endless overnight bus trips on bad roads.Alan Watts's great gift was that he was such a gifted communicator of Eastern ideas to Western readers such as myself. You can wade through the Upanishads and the Tao Te Ching, and it's unlikely you will get a lot out of them (at least on the first reading), but Watts always had a way of distilling some of these crucial ideas and conveying them in a way that, for me in any case, sort of slaps you in the face with the lived reality of what he is saying, as opposed to just giving you an intellectual grasp. I read his \\"Tao: The Watercourse Way\\" during those same travels and found it similarly enlightening.Watts's main theme is that since everything is changing and nothing lasts, it is senseless to be clinging to ideas, things, people, and so on. Endeavoring to achieve \\"security\\" of any kind, in life, love, job, family, or whatever, is a perpetually receding goal for the simple reason that nothing stands still! Hence the wise man or woman learns to live dynamically balanced in the present, responding creatively and joyously to anything and everything that's happening. This at least is my distillation of the idea, and the more I study the more I feel this simple message is at the core of all meditation and 'seeking.' \\"Be Here Now\\" as Ram Dass put it, and Watts communicates this essential message not only better than anyone else I've read, but also beautifully and effectively.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"Thank you Alan Watts for this book -- that for the first time in my life allows me to understand my part in this world.

Basically, we spend too much time planning and anticipating the future and too much time thinking about, lamenting and wishing to change the past. I have dogeared too many corners underlying too many quotes to reproduce them all here, but let me give you a flavor:&quot;If happiness always depends on the future, we are chasing a will-o-the-wisp that ever eludes our grasp, until the future,and ourselves,vanish in the abyss of death.&quot;This quote is taped to the cover of my fanancial notebook that contains my financial portfolio data, 401K information and reams and reams of retirement plan calculations.He also wrote:&quot;But tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unlessyou are in full contact withthe reality of the present,since it is in the present and onlyin thepresent that you live.

Somehow he (who then and always has known too much) felt that by allowing me to find such insight while still so young he could show me intellectual avenues that happened upon him too late. Of course at eight years old I had not lived or thought enough to understand much of the more self-centered implications of what Watts has to say, but the intellectual gyrations got me started. I've never stopped since. Since then, now nearly twenty years ago, I have revisited this book whenever I feel myself growing unclear and uneasy about the universe and my &quot;place&quot; within it. The only problem is that I find myself buying it over and over again because I keep giving it away, to those that, at the time, seem to need clarity more than do I.

In it, Alan Watts explains to us various ways of accepting and dealing with anxiety and insecurity in spiritual matters. This technique of acceptance was clearly derived from the Hindu and Buddhist methods of establishing a calm and mellow outlook on life. Like these great Eastern religions, Alan Watts does not try to tackle issues of theological truth head-on, but instead sidesteps the eternal questions. This is not because he is incapable of dealing with more complex metaphysical issues - he does so in great depth in his other, longer works. Neither is this method of sidestepping our sources of anxiety an evasion of rational, empirical truth. This book is not a rigorous empiricist study, and never claimed to be. It is instead a psychotheapeutic work verging on the anti-intellectual, but at the same time embracing meditation and contemplation. Watts shows us ways to act out our love for wisdom and enlightenment by concentrating on the positive and accepting (but not dwelling on) disturbing questions which he considers to be unanswerable. This is not an atheistic work nor is it a tale of despair. This is a work infused with hope, while being mindful of the truth. It succeeds in treading a sort of middle ground between the love of knowledge and anti-intellectualism.The only problem with this book is its short length, although some might consider this an advantage. If you are looking for a more in-depth and rigorous study, try _Behold the Spirit_ or _Psychotherapy East and West_, also by Alan Watts."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"The path is simple, but walking it is more difficult than it sounds. This book was a gift to me from a friend whose sanity, insight and wisdom I've always admired.This book, although written in very basic, simple but elegant language, is a challenging read merely because the ideas that are expressed are so powerful that you may well find yourself reading the same sentence several times over before you feel like you've completely taken it in.Its been absolutely instrumental in helping me navigate through a particular instable period in my life. Everyone knows the key to happiness boils down to a simple, hackneyed cliche: 'Don't Worry, Be Happy.' But this books explains very rationally, yet gently, why this is so. I keep it on my bed at all times, and pick it up on certain difficult nights, read a few paragraphs, and remember: the future is out of my hands, and the past is both out of my hands and distorted by my own interpretation of it. The past can never be usefully compared to the present. NOW is the time to focus on. Wake up! Look around! Everything is before you...NOW."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. I've reread it more times than any other, but never without reaching new insights and finding new inspiration. It's filled with wisdom like the following: &quot;[I]t is a serious misapplication of psychology to make the presence or absence of neurosis the touchstone of truth, and to argue that if a man's philosophy makes him neurotic, it must be wrong. \`Most atheists and agnostics are neurotic, whereas most simple Catholics are happy and at peace with themselves. Therefore the views of the former are false, and of the latter true.' Even if the observation is correct, the reasoning based on it is absurd. It is as if to say, \`You say there is a fire in the basement. You are upset about it. Because you are upset, there is obviously no fire.&quot; Watts talks about the many subtle proprieties of life in which we are all engaged but which we seldom discuss. Then, the instant you read them, you feel as if your own thoughts had been read aloud. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"For my dollar this book, above all similar books of this ilk, explains in the most simple language, awareness to the fact of the fallacy of security. Now, this statement should not be just shrugged off as just another descriptive sentence. Think of it. Do you know how pervasive 'seeking security' is in your everyday life. Be aware of that. The brain as a matter of function is seeking security constantly. Can you be more aware than your own brain. It sounds funny but, I think you can. You can be above the brain. You can be 'mind', for lack of a better word. And, by the way, do not get caught in words or the security of them. After all the description is not the thing described...ever.

If only he were around today to see what has happened recent years and to comment accordingly! Perhaps he would give similar advice, as his principles should not be subject to the current events or fashion.His two main themes from my perspective, at least in the first half that I found much more enlightening, were that humans do not need traditional religion and that humans should not fight anxiety. In the first case, his analysis is not that science has solved everything, a topic lively today and likely to continue as a perpetual debate. It is more that the human soul can find nourishment and understanding in other ways, and does not need the tenets of religion to make life whole. He does, however, concede that belief has been undermined by the ceaseless march of human intelligence, while claiming that the coldly intellectual angle often leaves the human soul unsatisfied. Mystery helps feed the mind and spirit.Mr. Watts' insights on anxiety as the necessary complement to freedom and pleasure were particularly succinct and sharp. A favorite quote is, \\"If, then, we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures. Without such willingness there can be no growth in the intensity of consciousness. Yet, generally speaking, we are not willing, and it may be thought strange to suppose that we can be. For 'nature in us' so rebels against pain that the very notion of 'willingness' to put up with it beyond a certain point may appear impossible and meaningless.\\"Under these circumstances, the life that we live is a contradiction and a conflict. Because consciousness must involve both pleasure and pain, to strive for pleasure to the exclusion of pain is, in effect, to strive for the loss of consciousness. Because such a loss is in principle the same as death, this means that the more we struggle for life (as pleasure), the more we are actually killing what we love.\\"Well stated, obviously, and that is one of many. I endorse the modest length of the book, its lack of deep theological argument, and light touch on Eastern thought. Those topics are best served in other works dedicated to the proper depth and sophistication.I especially recommend a look back at Mr. Watts with the wave of anti-religion books by Hitchens, et al. Read them and compare to Alan Watts."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I am enamored of Alan Watts' writing. I find his books easy to access and yet profoundly interesting. This particular book encourages the reader to get comfortable with the instability of the modern world. It's a comforting, stimulating, intriguing read."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"....I recall one of those classes--I dunno, maybe it was an early General Science or Biology class I had long ago--where the teacher said that humans seldom use over one half of their brainpower and some brain cells go used...I know now that there are many ways that the brain controls various functions of the human body besides thinking, emoting and so forth. But, for me all that brings to mind Alan Watts and his brilliant carrer in trying to bring Zen and Eastern Influences to the Western World. The U.S. in particular. We have yet to scratch the surfaces of what the mind can accomplish....somehow, I think Watts knew long ago.In the preface to this great book he introduces to the reader &quot;the law of reversed effort&quot;. Insecurity arises when we expend our energies to be secure, and salvation comes form realisation that we really can't save ourselves from the inevitable. Life and change is flux. But the more you try to hold this flux in a freezeframe, it makes us go nuts as to whatever it takes to keep in in a freezeframe. There's a funny commercial with Dennis Miller ranting about the cost of bottled water. Alan Watts probably would have taken this rant even further--to take something fluid, flowing and liquid like water, the essence of all life and to capture it and package it and bottle it and label it &quot;bottled water&quot;--he'd say the best, freshest water is found naturally occurring and it exactly this kind of insanity that makes our response to the world jacked up...Watts has many books on Zen, Tao, and Eastern religion and in all of them, he tells the reader of this wondrous moment--now is the time! I've translated this for myself to be...&quot;Life is too short to be trippin'&quot;. If I am happy, I am happy &quot;now&quot;...We rampage evvyday in order to, in a certain time in the future, feel good, safe, and hitting all the notes we're supposed to be hitting just to find that we don't feel good, safe,(and the notes are so sour, they are not on the charts) whenever that point in the future comes. And like Watts says &quot;the sins of the saints are worse than the sins of the sinners, that in some mysterious way the one searching for salvation is nearer to hell and to the heart of evil than the unashamed harlot or thief&quot;....the seeing of ourselves as the whole, not apart holds the key to this nowness, this wisdom of insecurity. Once we accept that as part of the whole we can live in this moment and it will be all that we have to go one, then we will be truly alive and we can truly do great things...."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"First published 60 years ago, this slim volume could just as easily have come out this morning. If anything, today the world is even more torn by anxiety, fear, and the desperate need for security it can never hope to find. But as we read within the first few pages, philosopher Alan Watts had not only recognized this self-defeating struggle for control of our surroundings & our lives, he head seen that only by accepting the insecurity of existence could we ever hope to know any semblance of peace of mind.As always, Watts uses a marvelously conversational & accessible prose style to develop his ideas, which derive from a more Buddhist approach to life. As previous reviewers have noted, this isn't the trendy hipster Buddhism that's all too often the rage today. This is simple, basic teaching, intended not to swaddle us in complacency, but to enable us to live with the insecurities & gnawing doubts of the modern world with some equanimity.Warning: this is NOT just another self-help book, complete with numbered rules & bullet points, reducing an entire philosophy of life to a few sound bites. This is nourishing food for thought, intended to get the reader thinking, and even more to nudge the reader out of the cozy ego-centered comfort zone. For those willing to take that step, a remarkable & rewarding book!"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This book is a message from Alan Watts to anyone that feels anxious about ... oops, I am getting ahead of myself.Alan did not consider himself a Christian nor a Buddhist. Nor was he a Taoist nor even a Zennist. He was a philosopher and mystic in the tradition of the Perennial Philosophy. Alan's existential understanding grew out of his own direct experience. The mystical experience that is the prerequisite of Enlightenment. He knew first hand what it was that he was talking about. His was a non-sectarian approach to all things real, to truth. At one time or another he pretty much managed to put off the religiously inclined from just about every school of thought/belief where ultimate truth is concerned. He liked to poke fun at certainty. Religious, or Scientific. Alan was his own man. A rebel with a cause. His cause Truth, no matter where he found it. His was the way of no-way. His way did not fit into any of the categories of Western thought. The Way of Liberation can only be pointed to, inferred, for it is a way that is beyond words. The tao that can be categorized is not the eternal Tao. Though he often wielded the sword of wisdom in a manner that cut the abstractions of intellection to their quick he bore no ill will. His was a heart after the great Chuang Tzu. Alan did not take himself overly seriously. Sincerely, but not too seriously. If Alan had a consistent theme that was central to most if not all of his writings it was the role of man in nature. The relationship of the microcosm with the macrocosm. He was an imminently practical man. When he was hungry, he ate. When he was tired, he slept. He had a special place in his heart for the spirit of philosophical or contemplative Taoism. He was a man at home with unity and diversity, with yin, and with yang. A man that came out of the world, not into it. A man at home. Present and accounted for. Though not a saint, he was a sage.This book is an exploration of the law of reversed effort. The harder we try with the conscious will to do something the less chance of success. The harder we try not to be anxious the more anxious we tend to become. Simply let go of those things that make one anxious. Let go of the impermanent. Abide in the permanent. Turn the light around. We cannot make ourselves understand existential truth. All we can do is foster a state of mind that is receptive to realization. \\"Be still, and know the truth.\\" Psalm 46:10. Meditate. Let go of our preconceived notions so that we can be open to what is of itself so. Relax. No matter how hard we try we cannot save ourselves through force. Control is an illusion. That which is born dies. The body/mind complex was born and it will die. May as well go with the flow. And in letting go of the impermanent we can then realize the permanent. We are anxious because deep down we are wise and instinctively realize that we have things backwards. We are looking there, there, and over there, for something that is already here. Reality, truth, is so close it is easy to overlook. In dualistic terms the truth of existence is not out there, it is inside of each of us. In truth, inside and outside are but two different ways of looking at the same thing. Perceivable reality is symbolic reality. The tao that can be perceived is not the eternal Tao. Ultimate Reality is not a state of mind, but a state of being. It is not something we can discover through thinking, but by being. Not so much a think, as a feel.Our anxiety is trying to tell us that something is wrong with our thinking. That not only do we think too much but we think too much of thinking. That we have our cart before our horse. Awareness is not the by-product, thinking is. In reality there is nothing to be anxious about. Nothing to fear. Nowhere to hide, and nothing to hide from. The peace that passeth understanding is found within not without. All is well. Are there bumps along the human way. Yes. See them, then let them go. Will there be more bumps. Yes. But they do not happen in the future. Everything that happens happens now. Past and future are but mental constructs. Personal valves as it were that it is our tendency to over-regulate. We gain control when we let go of trying to be in control. The law of reversed effort is the means of entering the gestalt of Wu wei. The whole is other than the sum of its parts. Holistic action as opposed to structural or piecemeal action. Effortless action. Flowing action. Action in harmony with the way things are, not with the way we imagine them to be. One cannot float for long struggling against the nature of water. One simply relaxes into it.\\"We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.\\" Pierre Teilhard de Chardin."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I don't get the prices on this book. You can get it cheap with this very paperback cover from Hamilton Books in May 2012. Just a heads-up if you want this edition."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"His wit, his piercing insight and cleverness at explaining the unexplainable has been duly noted, so I'll leave that to the side and comment on something a bit more subtle but equally delightful and delicious: His nuanced way of speaking, his style and elegance, his ease with the subject matter, and his sense of humor about it all. His voice is at once conversational and authoritative. And no one can turn a phrase with quite the same panache.Nowhere is this flair more evident than in these \\"Wattsisms,\\" as I have referred to them in the past:\\"To feel that life is meaningless unless 'I' can be permanent is like having fallen desperately in love with an itch.\\"Or, this one, which also nicely captures the book's main theme:\\"A society based on the quest for security is nothing but a breath-retention contest in which everyone is as taut as a drum and as purple as a beet.\\"And, just for good measure:\\"You want peace of mind, but the attempt to pacify it is like trying to calm the waves with a flat-iron.\\"Like another reviewer, I had the good fortune of crossing paths with this book when I was young. And the better fortune of recognizing something special and snagging it up. It is undoubtedly part of the story of how I myself, became a Zen Buddhist, as well as a teacher of eastern philosophy.And how wonderful that in this capacity I'm able to share the brilliance of Alan Watts with my own students."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"Alan Watts, the man who supposedly introduced (or explained) Zen philosophy to the West, has penned a concise text on you and your relation to the universe. The title stems from the theme of book: that it's okay to not know the nature of things that are unknown and that there's no benefit in pretending to know what is unknown or can't be known. He also touches upon how an increasingly self-absorbed life results in increasing misery instead of increasing happiness or contentment.In his discussion on accepting that you're part of the universe while at the same time being distinct from it, he makes important distinctions between \\"I\\" and \\"me.\\" If, for example, you have cancer--that's the \\"me.\\" The \\"I\\" is the part that keeps itself distinct by viewing \\"me\\" as \\"that weak body I have the misfortune of being stuck in.\\"Well written. Uses good examples. To the point."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"The book has alot for readers to think about but the content is a bit esoteric. One can find alot of insight for their personal life and be freed from conventional thinking. Hardly do I notice any un-heard of powerful devices in the book but it serves as an introduction to the basics of life changing paradigms. I recommend this book to those who have never been schooled in thinking outside the box or to somone who has experience with such principles and wants to enjoy an antiquated delivery of inner discovery. When I say antiquated I mean the opposite of theto-the-point and broken-down-in-simple-and-easily-understood-techniques like that of modern literature.I like the book anyhow."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I t is hard to believe but in the first part of his life Alan Watts was an Anglican priest. His first two books,Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical ReligionandThe Supreme Identity, were written in that Christian mode. Watts however went back to college to study Eastern religion and philosophy, and this book is the first fruits of that work.If I were rating just the first half of this book it would get five stars. In these first four chapters Watts gives a brilliant diagnosis of the problem of modern man. Put very briefly we are caught in the eternal 'I', feeling separate from life, and caught up in contemplation of past hurts and future hopes. We never really live our life, which after all is in the here and now. We are driven to escape a sense of \\"insecurity\\" without realizing that this very uncertainty is a basic feature of life.In the second half of the book Watts tries to describe a new way of living based on 'now consciousness'. His task is I guess impossible as he is trying to describe something which is basically unknowable unless you actually live it. I did really understand his point that if you mind shifts off the 'I' it naturally turns to contemplating others, and this is the basis of compassion. I suspect that this second half of the book will mean more to me when I have experimented a little and reread a few times. This second half of the book has certainly given me something to think about.Don't let my comments in the above paragraph put you off reading the book.

Maybe you will become instantly \\"enlightened' as you read, where I was not."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"Alan Watts is one of my all time favorite spiritual teacher and master. He was or you could say still is an enlightened being, even though ultimately there is no enlightenment. The concept of of the \\"value of insecurity\\" is difficult to grasp for the Western mind, since everything in our society is based on \\"striving for security\\". Alan explains that the concept of \\"security\\" is an ilusion. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I think this book is the earliest example of what would become Watts' philosophy as a whole. I don't really like the title, I think that Watts had something other in mind than what most of us think of when we think of insecurity. The term \\"insecurity\\" has come to be associated with a psycholigical condition not unlike depression or anxiety. Given this development, a beter term might be flux, instability, uncertainty, etc. In any event, it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"I was surprised when I decided to look up the reviews for this book and found such positive results. I don't hate this book, I gave it a 3 out of 5, but I definitely do not agree that this is a 5 out of 5 quality book. With that being said, I do have the green and purple older version of this book so maybe these newer editions have been re-edited or fixed in some way.This book makes many, many assumptions throughout its pages. Quite a few of which many few people would disagree with; Some of which I think are out-right lies or at least misleading. An example can be found in the chapter 'Wisdom of the Body' when Mr. Watts makes the assumption that a women having a child naturally in a field is the \\"easy way of birth\\" compared to having the child in a hospital. While I actually think he believes it is easier, let's just assume he means easier as in, none of the complications of having doctors, medicines, the whole modern treatment - even if this is the case this is downright ignorant. Not even considering the chance of complications and having no one trained to deal with it, these \\"primitive\\" people he is referring to do this because they HAVE to keep working in the fields (which he refers to in the book) and they have the child in this manner because it is necessary to their way of life not because it is chosen. I'm sorry but all because Mr Watts says so it doesn't make having a child in a field magically a better than a hospital. It isn't a problem of perspectives on life, it's a problem of not understanding scientific facts and the past century of medical development.This book is littered with these assumption, these opinions of life - Which are OK (by all means, have opinions on life!!) but Mr Watts lays them out in such a matter-of-fact you've-been-misled kind of way that I find it hard to take this guy seriously as a credible source of philosophy and on his opinions. Maybe it is because I'm a regular reader of these sorts of books but this just doesn't fly as a 5 out of 5 book for me.After saying this though I would like to add the reason I gave it a 3 out of 5 and not 1 out of 5 is because this book DOES have good information. Living in the moment is great and this book does a pretty decent job describing what it means and how to achieve this. Combine this with the passion that the writer has for this philosophy of life and you have a pretty compelling book. I think this is what caused this book to become so highly regarded.BUT, most of this information is highly reflective of beliefs in Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies so it's really nothing new - and actually there are many sources which are much better if you want to live a life that is described in this book.Great passion, decently wrote, but with as many times as the author uses assumptions like they are definitive examples - it just isn't very professional. 3 out of 5 from me, but it's worth reading if you're into Eastern Philosophies or just philosophies of life in general. I don't remember the guy who said it right now but quoting him, keep an open mind but not so open your brains fall out. This should be considered while reading this book."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This is an excellent book, well-written, life changing.

Some very valuable points into a journey of self-discovery, however, too many words and not enough wisdom."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Insecurity","review":"This book's provocative title prompted me to pick it up at a used book store. As my life is built on a foundation of insecurity, I felt that Mr. Watts might provide some intellectual ammunition for making a virtue out of my necessity. As I started reading though, I became increasingly bothered by the book's resemblance to modern New Age texts, with its use of vague, pretentious language that meant precisely nothing. My first reaction was surprise that aspiring gurus had mastered the technique as early as 1951. My second reaction was to throw down the book in disgust.Cloaked in the mantle of psychological pseudoscience, Mr. Watts attempts to present Zen Buddhism to the West. What is the sound of one hand clapping? I don't know, and neither does Mr. Watts. Nor does he know how to form a coherent thought. However, he is expert at writing sentences of such ostensible profundity, but innate fatuousness, that several generations of people have questioned their own intelligence and comprehension rather than doubt this guru's worthiness.Look- this book is a perfect example of how the intellectual bandwagon works. Once a New York critic praises you, which is what happened back in the 30s and 40s, other intellectuals, afraid of being out-of-step, will become fervent backers of the work in question and start a process where the whole class of elite lemmings, generation after generation, will have you in reprints for 80 years. It's nothing but an exercise in peer pressure, with very unintelligent- but very affluent and influential- people being so desperate to be thought of as wise. They've rejected their own gods and are in search of something to fill the void. Into that space step confident and charismatic people like Mr. Watts, with volumes of \\"spiritual\\" sounding claptrap, and these seekers can all congratulate themselves for being smarter than the common slob.I was shocked to see that this book had 76 reviews. Why?? The reviewers can't even explain what's so great about the book or even summarize its main points. They simply gush over the \\"insight\\", the \\"mastery\\", the \\"wisdom\\", etc. Such is the nature of the Emperor and his new clothes.

Molnar offers themes such as schools for profit, corporate funded curriculum, advertising in schools, and schooling as a business with the enforcement of market based principles to build a powerful defense against a big business influence in modern day schooling.Strengths of the reading are many including Molnar's constant criticism of Nation at Risk and Workforce 2000, as depicting a failure of public education during the Reagan administration and a deceptive insufficiency of skilled workers in the 1990s which called for increased immigration to make up for the deficit. Molnar enforces the idea that there is no real skills shortage at all, only a decreased opportunity structure. The conclusion that reorganizing schools through market principles and emphasizing continuous worker training as the answer to school failure is just an excuse for corporations to blame schools and teachers for the corporate world's inability to reform public education. Molnar also criticizes big business for taking on a \\"schizophrenia quality\\" by later adopting reforms supported by the education establishment to create a situation where there is more equitable funding for both rich and poor school districts by employing private philanthropy instead of supporting an adequate tax base in spite of millions of dollars in profits. The author points out schools are eventually thrown into the free market to complete against consumer demand. As a result, profit and competition now become part of the school system by way of vouchers and charter schools. Molnar also directs the reader to become aware of the competition between corporations to compete with the minds of the children for brand loyalty by employing market driven principles within the curriculum disguised as efforts in school improvement.Even though weaknesses are infrequent, I think the author should have explored more viable solutions on how to take hold of the public education system and get the business world to relinquish their power over schools and our children. There is a type of open-endedness or \\"cliff-hanger\\" type ending of the book where Molnar leaves the reader to ponder solutions for the future. Though an excellent read with an abundance of attacks on the corporate influence in schools, just a few more options for direction in confronting the controversy could have been undertaken.In short, the book is a useful and effective critical analysis of the dominant market principles in schools. As an educator, I plan to use this information to further investigate and criticize divergent angles continue reflecting on my own ideology and philosophy regarding educational issues in our school system today."},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","review":"This is a rather unique book with many well expressed arguements as to why the current trend to commercialize our public schools is a really bad idea. Hello!! Calling all our elected and appointed Boards of Education.

The two enterprises couldn't be further apart."},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","review":"Thank you, this item was exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a good purchase on my part. thanks!"},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","review":"In the 1980s, starting with the Reagan administration, the governmentstarted deregulating or reducing controls on the way private businessesand corporations managed their finances. The proponents of deregulationargued that regulatory oversight was an additional governmentbureaucracy, costly to the taxpayers, or as some like to put it, \\"toomuch government\\". They also argued that the private sector wouldregulate itself and in its attempt to gain business it would providebetter commodities at lower costs. Some of the most notable examples ofderegulation include the 80s Savings and Loans scandal, and the 2000scollapse of Enron and MCI-World Com defrauding investors out of millionswhile emptying their retirement accounts. More recently deregulationlead to the collapse of the housing market and many banks and investmentcorporations including Lehman Brothers, AIG and the entire US economy.Molnar's book, Giving Kids the Business describes what happens whenderegulation and corporate interests are allowed to get their hands inthe public education system. Molnar essentially describes theintroduction of Channel One TV into public schools, the introduction ofadvertisement into the schools, the contracting between schools andcorporations for advertising and selling their products, and schoolvouchers and charter schools. According to Molnar, Channel One wasintroduced into schools with the idea of providing schools with advancedtechnology free to schools. Channel One would provide children with 10minutes of news and two minutes of advertising daily. School wouldreceive this for free but would make these 12 minutes of TV watchingmandatory. Corporations essentially would pay Channel One a fee to allowthem to advertise to children.The introduction of mass advertisement into schools was accomplished byprivate businesses that emerged to advertise for corporations bypresenting corporate products in so called educational packages. To me,the most obvious abuse of this is by a General Mills' product calledGushers which is essentially a gummy candy with a juicy filling. Thecandy was presented to kids as part of a science lesson where they wouldexperience the candy's juice exploding in their mouths like a geyser orvolcano. This was supposed to awaken children's interest in geologicalsciences. Of course the only thing that would happen was that a candymaker would get cheap advertising. By introducing their products inschools as educational, corporations would get tax breaks along withcheap advertisement.The exclusive contracting by companies, particularly soda companies withschools became extremely controversial because schools were supposed toreach target sales goals as part of their contracts. This has happenedat a time when the incidence of adult onset diabetes (type two) hasincreased significantly in children, along with obesity.School Vouchers and charter schools were introduced with the idea ofgiving parents and children a choice. Essentially, the portion of themoney from public schools destined to a child would go to the private orcharter schools along with the child. For people already sendingchildren to private schools, this would represent a savings. For theprivate school, it would represent additional income. For theoverwhelmingly poor and underfunded urban schools this would represent ahorrible blow. Since the poorest of the poor would continue to attendthe poorest schools, the quality of their education would continue todecrease. Neither private schools, nor charter schools showed muchsuccess. At the same time, reducing class sizes in public schools, whichwas shown to significantly increase school performance was neversystematically funded in public schools, and government officialsinvested in privatization of public schooling attempted to hide thiswhile touting the unproven wonders of school privatization.The whole idea of allowing the business world to tap into public schoolfunding was done on two premises. First was the myth that schools werefailing to prepare children for jobs or to compete in a global economy.Second, there was the myth that private businesses would be better atmanaging schools because the market would force them to offer the bestproduct at the lowest price. In reality, corporations received tax beaksand incentives to advertise in schools while public schools lost fundingdue to the decrease in the tax base. In addition, many argue that inschool advertisement has a pedagogically detrimental effect as well asposing tremendous health risks.This book should outrage readers and make them cynical of ourgovernment's promoting the wonders of capitalism and deregulation or thecall for \\"less government\\". The government is supposed to protect theinterests of the public by preventing corporate greed to run a mock atthe expense of the citizenry. Instead, government has systematicallyallied itself with the corporate world at the expense of the public."},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","review":"Alex Molnar's \\"Giving Kids the Business\\" portrays the self-serving, deceptive agendas of corporate schemes as they wedge unto the flushed open spheres of public education. Insightfully, there are many instances where the book reads very much like an engaging John Grisham fiction novel, particularly when reading about Christopher Whittle's propagandizing measures via \\"Channel One,\\" the Edison Project, and the brainwashing of poor minorities. One keeps thinking that such realities are fictitious and can't possibly be real. Regardless, Molnar exhibits the \\"usual suspects\\" aiding Whittle, via Benno Schmidt, former president of the prestigious Yale University, Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, corporate associate John Golle and a diversity of other corporate minded agents, politicians and organizations. In addition, Molnar demystifies the truth behind fundraisers, including the infamous \\"Book It\\" Pizza Hut reading program, General Mills tasty \\"Gushers\\" and many others, in revealing how they may actually do more harm than good, in addition to exposing the covert, and greed based operations behind vouchers and private schools. Here Molnar triggers the angry neurons of readers upon realizing how the corporate get rich and the socioeconomic deficient communities struggle to educate the diversity of children in overpopulated public schools.In essence, the text functions much like an undercover agent setting out to expose how the well minded facades of partnerships with big name business, with their tempting incentives and rewards, with the fancy labels of private schools, and the political recommendations, prove to be nothing more than a swindling redistribution of power where money shifts from the public sector to the private sector, from the altruistic economic well being of community members to the overfilled pockets of corporate agents, where the upper class looks to diminish the opportunities of the struggling class, and where public schooling is seen as a means towards a tax break rather than an altering and benevolent reforming of education arenas. Moreover, it is overwhelming to witness the rigid relationships between corporate minded individuals and both Democratic and Republican leaders. Also, it portrays how despite continued failure on the part of vouchers and the Charter school system, a rebirth and thus, continued attempts at re-swindling of public school economies, is reborn every so number of years. Respectively, this reading gets your blood and your mind boiling, and despite an informative appendix outlining key organizations fighting the schemes of corporate America, your temper will need virtuous patience to soothe itself."},{"Title":"Giving Kids The Business: The Commercialization Of America's Schools","review":"Alex Molnar once again writes an anti-establishment and anti-business diatribe. He uses this book as a platform to prosletyse his personal views rather than looking at the benefits and disadvantages of having businesses involved with education.A classic example of his selective scholarship applies to educational text books publishers. These for-profit entities produce the core texts which teachers and students have relied on for over a century in the US. Almost all major US educational publishers are owned by Fortune 500 companies, who mandate they publish for profit. This has not created a perfect system for producing school text books, but no one can seriously argue that education would benefit by banning their involvement with schools!Alex Molnar would have you believe all business involvement with education is evil, however his thesis is undermined by a blinkered and narrow approach. This is an important issue which needs better analysis!"},{"Title":"New American Book of the Dead","review":"Having been familiar with the Evans-Wentz translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead for many years I decided to give this &quot;Americanised&quot; version a try. I was aware that much of the rigid detail and ritual of the original was probably unique to Tibetan culture and I wanted to see how the author dealt with it. Now that I've read this version I'm somewhat conflicted as to my opinion of it. The basic ritual and structure of the original is preserved, but with modern terminology and images substituted. This is an improvement- sort of. However, I'd rather cut through the accrued ritual and superficial detail and get down to the core truths- not just make the dross more modern and &quot;hip.&quot; There is truth here, but you still have to cut away the obscuring distortions. First of all, the existance that is being described is both beyond time and beyond conventional aristotlian sequential logic. Think about it, do you really believe memorising this sequence of events- or reading them aloud to the dead on a rigid timetable- is of any real value? The afterlife doesn't run on a bus schedule folks- to use my own little modernism here.What is truly important are the deep truths and values that you have welded to your spirit before you cross over- memorising spiritual &quot;cheat sheets&quot; and last minute &quot;cramming&quot; just isn't going to cut it.... Though, the state of mind immediately before one's passing is of importance. It isn't the overriding determinate, however.Still, what is being described here as the &quot;macrodimensions&quot; do exist. I've always been sensitive to them, and you probably have too. And, yes, we do project much of what we are superficially familiar with upon them- as have those who have passed that way before us.Worth reading, but do so with a discriminating mind- and cross check it with your &quot;inner guide.&quot;"},{"Title":"New American Book of the Dead","review":"I used this book during the death of my father.

Note that actual planetary science covering our new knowledge of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their many moons is found in other books, even though that knowledge was provided by the Voyager vessels. Here the authors betray their weaknesses in planetary astronomy with very rushed coverage of those matters, which only appear in the final third of the book anyway.

All in all, I got what I wanted (the story of Voyager and it's discoveries), but I'd have liked better writing."},{"Title":"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond (Smithsonian History of Aviation and Spaceflight Series)","review":"\\"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond,\\" is an excellent book that tells the fascinating story of an overwhelmingly significant pair of probes that went to the outer planets of the Solar System, one of which is still providing scientific data as it reaches our heliopause.The Voyager project was one of the most important in the history of NASA and the first to visit the outer planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. It originated during the early 1960s when astronomers realized that once every 176 years both the Earth and all the giant planets of the Solar System gather on one side of the Sun. This geometric line-up made possible close up observation of all the planets in the outer solar system (with the exception of Pluto) in a single flight, the \\"Grand Tour.\\" The flyby of each planet would bend the spacecraft's flight path and increase its velocity enough to deliver it to the next destination. This would occur through a complicated process known as \\"gravity assist,\\" something like a slingshot effect, whereby the flight time to Neptune could be reduced from 30 to 12 years. NASA launched these missions from Cape Canaveral, Florida: Voyager 2 lifting off on August 20, 1977, with Voyager 1 entered space on a faster, shorter trajectory on September 5, 1977. These spacecraft would take a spectacular windshield tour of the outer Solar System gas giant planets.The scientific results of the Voyager mission were astounding, essentially rewriting the textbooks on the Solar System. Over a period of more than a decade the probes explored all the giant outer planets, 48 of their moons, and the unique systems of rings and magnetic fields that those planets possess. The two spacecraft returned to Earth information that revolutionized the science of planetary astronomy, helping to resolve some key questions while raising intriguing new ones about the origin and evolution of the planets in this Solar System. The two Voyagers took well over 100,000 images of the outer planets, rings, and satellites, as well as millions of magnetic, chemical spectra, and radiation measurements. They discovered rings around Jupiter, volcanoes on Io, ice on Europa, shepherding satellites in Saturn's rings, new moons around Uranus and Neptune, and geysers on Triton. The last imaging sequence was Voyager 1's portrait of most of the Solar System, showing Earth and six other planets as sparks in a dark sky lit by a single bright star, the Sun.Perhaps a personal anecdote is in order here. When Voyager reached Jupiter in 1979 I was a starving graduate student working on a Ph.D. in the history of the American West. Like everyone, I saw the images that came back to Earth and was truly impressed. When I filed my income tax form the next year I included a little note, which I'm sure made the clerk at the IRS chuckle, that stated that I wanted all of my tax money paid that year to go to NASA because of what it had accomplished with Voyager. Perhaps it was silly gesture but it points up the impressive nature of the scientific return.This book makes clear that Voyager was an early step in humanity's exploratory journey extending not only to the outer planets but also beyond the Solar System. It is a scintillating portrait of a critical program and a must read for all interested in the history of space exploration.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond (Smithsonian History of Aviation and Spaceflight Series)","review":"Very interesting read into a fantastic time in our space history. So much has gone into this book to tell of the grand voyage; beyond so many before. The science and engineering that was needed to make this flight is fantastic. Voyager is a huge landmark in our space program. I really liked how it presented the topic. Super man no. Super book about a wonderful machine, yes. Thanks, Rick L."},{"Title":"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond (Smithsonian History of Aviation and Spaceflight Series)","review":"I really liked this book. It starts out with the history of planetary exploration and how that technology was applied to Voyager. The science and the people involved get mentioned, too. The second half of the book deals with the planetary mission itself with summaries of what the Voyager spacecraft discovered about the outer planets and their moons.My only real complaint is that the first half of the book, that deals mostly with the history and development of Voyager, could have been more adequately summarized, if only so the sections on the planetary encounters could have been expanded. It is because of this I decided to give this four stars instead of five.The book was originally written in 2000, so it is a bit dated today with the new discoveries from Galileo and Cassini and the Voyager Interstellar Mission. This is not really a criticism, just something to note while reading this.If you are interested in the Voyager program or the outer planets and want to know more about how the discoveries were made, I would not hesitate to buy a copy. This was well worth the money I paid."},{"Title":"Voyager's Grand Tour: To the Outer Planets and Beyond (Smithsonian History of Aviation and Spaceflight Series)","review":"The authors managed to take mankind's greatest achievement and make it dead boring. Be prepared for endless lists of who took over what job at JPL for a year or two. They mention at least 10 times, without even changing the wording, that after funding cuts lopped Uranus and Neptune from the mission the designers' strategy was to not do anything that would preclude an extended mission. Got that? Could have used a lot more, and better quality, diagrams. Two of the few that did make it in show almost exactly the same thing--the structure of the launch vehicle. I don't think they even had a diagram of the actual probe, though I can't check because I couldn't be bothered to bring the book back from the Mexican vacation that I wasted most of slogging through this thing. I could have done with a lot more explication of the fascinating technical aspects of the probes and mission, which they pretty much gloss over. What you mostly get is a tedious history of the bureaucratic aspects of the mission, which is actually inherently interesting, but the writing just makes it dull as can be. One of the authors is a history professor, and seemed hell bent on writing the definitive historical account, laden with endless pages of uninteresting footnotes that are simply listings of the source of the information. We're talking 1/3 of the book here. The other author worked for NASA and I often felt like he was being careful not to place blame on anybody. Sorry guys, nice try, I'm sure this was a lot of work, but this ain't the definitive historical account. The best part of the book is the excellent bibliography. Unfortunately I can't use that, but maybe the maid down in Mexico is using it for cooking fuel or something.On a positive note for Amazon, my frustration with this clunker prompted me to come back and buy about 8 other books on the subject. The ones that have arrived have so far been fascinating."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"This was Robbins' second novel and there is a marked improvement in the quality of the writing over his first, NEVER LOVE A STRANGER. Robbins appeared to have had a better editor this time around, but more than that, the tone is more even and the narrative more coherent than before.I've always appreciated the fact that Robbins didn't \\"dumb down\\" or spell everything out. The reader is asked to fill in a missing blank now and then. The plot of THE DREAM MERCHANTS is quite complicated, but with complexity comes variety and action, and Robbins was a master at keeping things moving.THE DREAM MERCHANTS deals with the early Hollywood moguls, the deals they negotiated, the swindles they perpetrated. It treats of movie stars and directors, technicians and PR spokespeople only insofar as they relate directly to the moguls. There is a fairly long subplot involving a spider woman of an actress with whom the protagonist, Johnny Edge, becomes involved. Aside from that, the plot revolves mostly around the Hollywood bigwigs' business deals. But having already read quite a bit about the making of movies from the technical end, I was interested in glimpsing Hollywood from a different perspective this time around.Bubba"},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"In 1949, Harold Robbins followed up his first novel, Never Love a Stranger, with what would prove to be the first of a loose trilogy he would write on the history of the American film industry. The Dream Merchants covers the pioneer days of the motion picture, depicting the rise of a primarily Jewish owned and operated Independent company that would take on the WASP led motion picture patents combine and rise to become one of the major studios of the 1920's and 30's. Though the studio is called Magnum and headed by Peter Kessler and Johnny Edge, Robbins draws upon the history of Universal Pictures (where he was an executive in the 1940's) and its founder Carl Laemmle and his successor and long time associate Robert Cochrane.The book is structured between short passages set in 1938 narrated in the first person by Johnny Edge, who has just become the new President of Magnum, but must already contend with a board room power struggle as well as the news that his old friend Peter has suffered a massive stroke, and longer sections flashing back over various time points between 1908 and 1938 depicting the rise of Magnum Studio and the ups and downs of the friendship between Johnny and the members of the Kessler family. In these flashbacks, Johnny and the Kesslers work hard to raise what started out as a simple nickoledon business and transform their venture into a major producer and distributor of movies throughout the world. Over the 30 years, Kessler's children grow up, one of whom, Doris, falls in love with Johnny, and Mark, who becomes a spoiled adult child of Hollywood . A section of the book is also devoted to Johnny's experiences as a soldier in World War I where he suffers an injury that will change his life forever. There also a heaping slice of steamy melodrama in which Johnny becomes involved with an ambitious actress who unbeknownst to him is incestuously involved with a family member, a character that has more than a passing resemblance to \\"the Great Profile\\" of American theater and film, John Barrymore.The Dream Merchants is especially strong in evoking a sense of family and friendship that exists between Johnny, the Kesslers and other people who come into their orbit. You really feel these characters care for each other. Likewise, thanks to his background as a film executive, Robbins realistically evokes the business side of the industry with a number of scenes depicting bargaining, deal making, and executive maneuvering both within a company and between rival studios. Though tame in comparison to some of his later, more sexually explicit books, The Dream Merchants is still an entertaining read. It may not rank up there with What Makes Sammy Run as a Hollywood literary novel, it more than does the job as a good entertainment with plenty of heat, humor, humanity and heart."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"What could have been a great epic about the earlier days of filmaking has turned out to be a dreadful, overlong, uninteresting mishmash that even die hard fans will hate.

I have no intention of returning the duplicate since I hope to find a good use for it. Bravo Amazon!!"},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"Story of Johnny Edge from 1908 to 1938 and his partner Peter Kessler. It shows how they get involved in the movie business, build a studio and fight to keep it going. Through the years various characters and situations pop up to challenge them.This was OK but nothing new. Robbins has done this already with \\"The Carpetbaggers\\" a MUCH better book. Like most of his books this is long (I have the 1961 version and its 517 pages with small type). It's not completely uninteresting but some of it is VERY slow and puzzling. When they get incolved with the business, percentages and stocks I got bored and confused. Also the construction of this book is haphazard. It starts out in 1938 then keeps backtracking through the years to explain things. You have to keep track of quite a few characters and situations and it gets annoying. However the various stories DO move pretty rapidly and some of the situations are pretty ridiculous (but amusing). Since this was originally published in 1949 there's no explicit sex but it makes it pretty clear what's going on. It all ends up with a happy ending that I didn't buy for one second. Still it's a quick silly read. Good for summer or vacation time reading...but Robbins has done MUCH better."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"The Dream Merchants, are, of course, the lords of Hollywood. Having worked there, this is a favorite subject of Harold's, but this book is not as good as the Carpetbaggers.It is full of the shenanigans that go on, what you have to do to get into films, to get them made, all that sort of thing, from earlier Hollywood times."},{"Title":"The Dream Merchants","review":"As you can see in this book, the story of Hollywood was the same since it started, if you are a woman and you want to be in the screen, you have to have sex with the directors (Dulcie) if you are a man you have to deceive them (Mark).Apart of that, the book is really heavy to read because it repeat itself many times when you are reading the story of 1938, that makes the book a little boring. That doesn't mean that the book goes out of the main story but at least I don't like to read twice the same story in a book, no matter if it is written in two lines or in two pages.The story has ups and downs, is not a bad book but you will take some time reading it, so if you see it at your parents house take it, and before you read it get prepare for a heavy book to read."},{"Title":"Murder takes a wife","review":"I have had 4 different copies of this great book from the first copy of the original PB version almost 30 years ago.It is one of the finest pulp reads, written by a psychologist of all people, about a man who makes his living knocking off wives.

It's a collection of his writings which once aired on NPR. He chooses topics--Transylvania, Louisiana, his son, whatever--and then expounds upon them--expository style--in his own, singular, funny, forthright, post-beatnik, Eastern-European/Nawlins vernacular style. What I like about Codrescu is not so much his writing ability (not intended as a slight, Mr. Andrei) as his longing for a more human existence in an increasingly nonhuman/computerish world. His storytelling talent as well as his critical eye regarding mass media and things plugged in are top-rate. To anyone who's ever read Exquisite Corpse or has seen the video of Codrescu's ride across America, this book is certainly worth it's weight in . . . cat vomit? No. Gold?

The special features such as the self-assessment exercises, self-evaluation exercises, diary, and end-of-chapter questions are particularly motivating and instructive to the beginner transcultural communication practitioner. Although the book is practice-oriented, mentioning the contribution of Leininger to transcultural nursing theory would have been appropriate.Another special feature that I liked is the discussion of culturally appropriate nursing diagnoses. It explains why the NANDA taxonomy may be culturally biased and provides recommendations for writing more culturally appropriate nursing diagnoses.Another feature is the chapter on working with interpreters. It provides guidelines for working with and without interpreters.. I think a section on sign-language or deaf-interpreters would have been a nice addition. There are also on-line translation resources that are now available.I also liked the annotated list of books and films. I would suggest adding books such as by nurse-anthropologist Jody Glittenberg, &quot;To the mountain and back&quot;, of her experiences as a nurse and anthropologist in Guatemala.I reviewed the 1999 paperback edition."},{"Title":"Transcultural Communication in Health Care","review":"I recently ordered a textbook from a third party through Amazon.com which turned out to be a bad experience for me.

He effectively creates a fantastic, yet believable world in which your discomfort compels you to read on.

In \\"THE BFG\\" giants ate children, in \\"Matilda\\", the principal is always brutally punishing children, and in \\"The Enormous Crocodile\\", the crocodile loves eating children. Now Roald Dahl has made the ultimate child-hating monsters, disguised mysterious demons called the witches.Now a boy has seen one of the witches' top secret meetings and almost escapes normally before getting caught and being turned into a mouse, but then escapes getting stomped on and then rushes back to his grandmother, a retired expert on witches. They together make a plan to stop the witches from turning all the children in England into mice. There has also been another victim of the \\"mouse maker\\" formula, Bruno Jenkins, who's parents hate mice, have a cat, and will probably never be convinced that their son has been turned into a mouse.The witches in this book dress like ordinary women and look like ordinary women, but under their gloves, shoes, and wigs they are bald, toeless, have claws, blue spit, and a terrible hatred for children. They make the children disappear in strange ways, such as turning them into animals, paintings, statues, food, and other terrible things.They never murder or poison children, because that would mean getting caught, and witches never get caught. The other characters include the narrator( the boy who observed the meeting) who's name is never mentioned, his Grandmother, who's Norweigan, knows a lot about witches and smokes a big cigar and takes care of the boy .There is also a boy named Bruno Jenkins who is always eating and bragging about how rich his dad is.The Witches is a great fiction book . It's fun and scary for kids.. I would recommend this book to kids who like horror, suspense, and excitement, and has an exciting triumph at the end. If you're one of those people, start reading it, because it's great.After \\"The Witches\\" I would encourage you to read even more books by Roald Dahl, such as the enourmous crocodile, the BFG, and Matilda, but I think \\"The Witches\\" is the best."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Can you recognize a witch? \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl tells how to be able to recognize a witch.

I also like the bit when the grandma thought fast when the boy was in the Grand High Witch's room (which is number 499). It was frightening when the boy was with the witches and they found out he was in the same room as the witches and he was spying on them without their disguises.\`The Witches' is such a good book because of the way Roald Dahl writes and explains what is happening in the book.

Roald Dahl's book, The Witches, is a fantastic tale of a young boy who comes to realize that the seemingly normal women of the R.S.P.C.C. (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) are in fact, plotting the destruction of every child in the world. The narrator discovers that hiding underneath their nice clothing and ordinary appearance is a bald head, blue teeth, a scary face and no toes. This is all too familiar for the narrator because his cigar smokinh grandmother has told him of these creepy characters before. As the seven year old narrator hides behind a shade, he hears the witches plot to turn every child into a mouse because witches hate children. To a witch a child smells like extremely foul. When his cover is blown, the witches turn him into a mouse. Dahl take you on his wild and dangerous hunt for an antidote to turn himself back into a little boy. Dahl's imagination and incredible ability to tell a story are what makes this book a fabulous tale. Dahl grabs you on the first page and doesn't let you go."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Do you know how to sopt a witch?

It is about a boy named Luke who lives with his grandmother, because his parents died in a car accident. They are staying at a hotel, with a group of women who claim to be part of a society, but they really aren't. The leader is a beautiful tall women with a good attitude in public but when she is with just one person she is mean. She has a secret potion to turn her victims into mice. All of the women have very high voices which is a little weird at first. Then Luke and his friend sneak in to one of the society meetings. All of the women take off their hats. They are bald. They take off their gloves and their hands look horrid. They take off their MASKS they are WITCHES. Every person who finds out about the witches will be turned into a mouse. Read the book to find out if the witches are stopped and if the boys get caught."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"\\"Run...The witches, their coming.\\" A story about witches riding on brooms and zapping people with wands is what you would expect when you hear a book title like this The Witches by Roald Dahl. But this fiction book Illustrated by Quentin Blake is more interesting. This story is about a seven year old boy who finds himself in a hotel full of witches trying to turn children into mice. He has to get rid of the witches and their formula that turns children into mice. Will this boy be able to escape or will he be turned into a tiny mouse? Can he help save the children and demolish these repugnant witches, or will he fall into the witches trap and become a mouse?A boy the age of seven is traveling with his grandmother from Norway. He is now traveling to England just to find that he is surrounded by witches. Not the kind of witches with black cloaks, broom sticks, and pointy black hats: these witches dress like normal people, and have real jobs, and wear mask to hide there hideous faces. That's why it's hard to tell them apart from ordinary people. With a friend and his magical grandmother's help, he will go on a mission to try to get rid of these witches before they get rid of him! The most appealing ...part is that the witches are staying in the same hotel as him, and no one knows if he will be able to succeed. The witches have annual witch conventions. The reason I like this book is that it gets you excited; you never know what will happen next unless you keep reading. This book is fun, scary, and dramatic all at the same time and you won't be able to put the book down. I think this because it is like a cat and mouse chase and you think the witches will catch the boy, then the boy just escapes and it is like a fun maze.This book reminds me of the movie Harry Potter because of the mentioning of witches. This book can teach you about how you should never judge people by how they look or what they wear because they can have a totally different side to them. Do you think he will make it, or not?I would definitely recommend this book to others because it can be fun for children and adults to read. Once they start reading The Witches, they will never be able to stop. It can teach children to never talk to strangers. This book is for any one that can read, but will be best for children ages of 7 to adults. The Witches is so amazing that it won the Whitbread Children's Book Award in 1983."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"My daugher will be 8 in a couple of months, and she got this book for Christmas. Once she finished reading it, she declared, \\"This is THE BEST book I have ever read!\\" She laughed out loud a lot while reading The Witches and has instructed everyone in the family on how to detect a witch.One drawback to this book is that she now firmly believes she should stop bathing.We love Roald Dahl's books and I'm sure will add more to our collection as time goes on."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This is a neat, modern, fairy-tale about a boy and his grandmother's adventures identifying and eliminating witches. I enjoyed it as a child, as well as more recently. The story is exciting and the imagery is, as with all of Dahl's works, grotesque but incredibly appealing, especially for kids.This book has been accused of many things, ranging from Satanic content to anti-feminist rhetoric. It may be wholly gruesome, and the witches may all be female, as all witches are (according to the book), but I never quite got that impression by reading the book. For the people fearing that their children will want to pursue witchcraft, I would reply that that would mean their kids want to be bald with deformed fingers, have their peers all smell like feces, have square toe-less feet, and behave as the witches in this story behave.When Dahl picks a villain, he leaves no room for sympathy, and even less for admiration. As for the anti-feminism, the protagonist's savior and mentor is his grandmother, who is strong, feisty, and clever. She is modeled after Dahl's mother, for whom he had great respect, and helps offset the negativity toward the witches. The plot is fairly simple, but there are some very poignant moments between this boy and his grandmother. While the ending is a little bittersweet, it is still touching and leaves the reader feeling warm and safe."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Dahl has done it again in creating a fascinating world of fantasy that almost seems true. I liked the opening of the book best, when he's describing how to tell if someone's a witch. The descriptions are vivid and fun. I especially liked it when he tells you that maybe your teacher could even be a witch. Not my favorite Roald Dahl (BOY), but a great read, and, as always, much better than the movie."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I was first introduced to this book via the movie, which I adored as a kid (and still do). I enjoyed the book, though I did feel that the movie was better developed - that may be personal bias, as I have never seen any of Dahl's books as vividly as directors do. Still, Halloween has always been my favorite holiday -and I always dressed as the stereotypical witch with a wart on her nose and green skin- and this book, as well as the movie, has a special spot in my heart.This book is slammed a lot by quite a few Wiccans who are upset over this book's portrayal of witches and witchcraft, claiming that it is derogatory to \\"real witches.\\" Dahl never, at any time, eludes to any neopagan religion. He clearly stays within the confines of centuries old stereotypes regarding Halloween witches - which, in my opinion, falls into the same realm as vampires and lycanthropes. These witches turn two boys into mice - clearly not a real life scenario. This book is, beyond a doubt, fiction. People need to stop being so uptight - and this is coming from an eclectic pagan!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This was one of my first books to really read through. I fell in love with it at once and I couldn't stop reading it. It is brilliant writing! You can easily imagine everything Dahl writes as fact. I will always hold Roald Dahl in my heart as the person who set my reading heart on fire, and I have been an avid reader ever since! I still pull this book off the shelf and read it every couple of years. I am 21 and I still am enthralled with it. I now look for other books that he has written and still love his stuff. I will always be a fan, and you should be too, starting with this one! A great book - FOR ALL AGES!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This book was a book about trying to kill the witches! The narrator (his name is not stated in the book) is about 7 years old at the time and his parents died, so he lived with his grandmother. His grandmother was an expert when it came to witches. She told him that witches are bald (so they wear wigs), their tongue is blue, they have no toes, they have a keen sense of smell, and they have no fingernails (so they wear gloves). His grandmother also tells him about the Grand High Witch, which is the ruler of all the witches. Every year, they have a meeting. Witches hate children, so they use many different methods to kill them. Summer comes and the narrator's grandmother decides to take him to Hotel Magnificent.(They were supposed to go to Norway, but his grandmother is too sick to go so faraway.) Before they leave, he is given two mice he names the girl, Mary, and the boy, William. He is caught bringing the mice and the manager doesn't allow mice, so, he has to keep them in the cage. One day, he sneaks to a meeting room and hides there to play with his mice. That's where the witches' meeting was. The narrator is caught and is turned into a mouse with their new medicine the \\"Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker\\". Then, his grandmother finds out and they take the \\"Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker\\" and put it in all the witches' soup. At the end, the witches are all gone and the narrator and his grandmother live happily ever after.I liked this book because I thought it was very creative! Like in this part it says: \\"'Don't interrupt, \\" she said. \\"Just take it all in. The second thing to remember is that a REAL WITCH is always bald.'\\" Also, this book is a very fun book. Just like in this part: \\"No witch would be stupid enough to leave anything suspicious lying around for the hotel maid to see.\\"I didn't like the book because I thought it was a bit disgusting. Just like the ingredients for the Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker. It says: \\"Tventy-vun hours of boiling, \\" answered The Grand High Witch. \\"And while this is going on, you take exactly forty-five brrrown mice and you chop off their tails vith a carving-knife and you fry the tails in hair-oil until they are nice and crrrisp.\\"My favorite part of the book is the ending because it's happy and everyone can relax at the end."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The WitchesBy: Roald DahlReviewed by: M. JenPeriod: 5The book is about a young boy (later on turned into a mouse) and his grandmother trying to get rid of The Grand High Witch and her fellow followers, also witches. The two of them and the group of witches happen to be at the same hotel, the boy and his grandmother for vacation, the witches are having a meeting to find ways to get rid of the children of England. The boy gets caught by the witches and he is transformed by the witches' magical powers into a little mouse. Together, the mouse and his grandmother hatch a plan to get rid of the witches and in the end, they succeed.I really enjoyed this book because Roald Dahl used a lot of descriptive words and I could get an vivid image. The plot is really good and exciting. The story made me imagine what would happen next and it made me want to read more and I couldn't stop reading it. My favorite part is when the boy realizes he is in the room full of witches! it's really funny how everything fits together but he doesn't realize it until it's too late. (The following is from the book.) \\"She's wearing a wig! She was also wearing gloves! I glanced swiftly aound the rest of the now seated audience. \\"Every one of them was wearing gloves!\\" Then he goes on and says, \\"My blood turned to ice. I began to shake all over. I glanced frantically behind me for a back door to escape through. There wasn't one.\\" That part made me really scared and I began to read like crazy.The part I didn't like was when he was turned into a mouse and when the boy finds the three frogs. I felt very sorry for them becasue they were going to die. I also dont like Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. They are very rude and mean. I didn't liek the part when they mouse gets his tail cut off. That part was very horrible in my opinion.My favorite part was when the grandmother talks to the boy about how to tell the difference about witches and women and when she told the little boy stories about witches and what they did with children. I thought that part was very intersting. I also like the part when the boy and his grandmother defeat the witches by turning them into mice. That part was very funny and i thought it was very cool.

I instantly decided then that it was my favorite book and I read and re-read it many times. I loved it. I recently took on a research project involving children's and young adult stories and have a long reading list of Children's stories to read - I put \\"The Witches\\" at the top of my list for nostalgia's sake, not sure what to expect.As an adult, I can report, that it is simply a magnificent story. I can see why I loved it so much as a child. Dahl never dismisses the reader (children) as being inept. Like the Grandmother in the story, Dahl knows children don't require extreme coddling. He's not timid about using fear to tell a great story.Parent's strive to create a safe world for their children. But that illusion is one that all parents must slowly deconstruct to prepare children for reality. Fairy tales are an integral part of that deconstruction. In fairy tales, monsters can exist in a way that allows children face their fears and walk through those fears to the other side where strength, courage and confidence are found.\\"The Witches\\" is a frightening, yet thrilling read for children. Dahl is a masterful storyteller and in \\"The Witches\\" he has weaved imagination, fear and courage into a fantastically fun story that has stood the test of time and remains refreshingly relevant for each generation."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches has funny situations and an amazing and adventurous plot.

I would recommend this book to kids of any age because it is funny and scary."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"Dahl's tale about a 7-year-old boy and his fearless cigar-smoking granny is a delightful October read--light-hearted, cleverly plotted, and fast-paced with plenty of dialogue.Suddenly an orphan at the tender age of 7, the unnamed protagonist is sent to live with his beloved grandmother in Norway--a country he knows from summer vacations, but more importantly--a country which understands the Supernatural. His grandmother proves a walking encyclopedia of witch lore as she warns him in great detail in an effort to keep him safe from this global threat. At first skeptical, he soon realizes that there truly Are witches, disguised as humans, everywhere. And worst of all--that no child is safe from their wrath.Required by terms of his parents' will to live in England, they set up house there, but the boy has an encounter with a real witch, causing his granny great concern. While recuperating from pneumonia at a seaside resort, she is informed of a most dangerous situation: the annual convention of English witches is taking place in the same hotel! Mistakenly hidden behind a screen in the conference room, the boy overhears horrendous plans to wipe out all English children in one diabolical stroke. But how can a little boy and even his wise granny foil the schemes of the High Witch? With its implication that smoking is harmful to one's health, this tale endears readers by the close relationship between the boy and his granny, who loves him unconditionally and will do everything to protect him.

My favorite part of the book is when the little kid finally gets revenge and pours the mouse maker into her and her subordinates soup and they turn into mice. This book was a really different kind of book. I didn't want to stop reading it and at the end was the best part. Then it ends. I think you should read this! Its a GREAT book!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"One of the best books of one of the best authors in the world. What more can you ask for?The Witches is a story about a young boy who lives with his cigar-smoking Norwegian grandmother, and who comes into conflict with the witches of the world. As he soon learns, witches don't ride about on broomsticks or wear tall pointed hats. In fact, they takes great pains to blend in with the rest of society, and only a knowledgeable observer can detect them via a series of clues about their appearance. The boy gets a crash course in witchery when he and his grandmother check into a hotel which, coincidentally, is hosting an annual meeting of the society of witches.This book has all of the Dahlisms that make this author so special. There are entertaining sub-stories that are fascinating in their own right, as when Grandmother relates her childhood experience with a witch. There are grand and daring plans that may or may not work out as the planner intends. Moreso than in other Dahl books, the villainesses are downright creepy, and a child who reads it may find him or herself surreptitiously checking out women for signs that they are witches.The inventiveness, the humor, and the excitement of this book come through on every page, and no child will be bored during this story. There's a feeling that Dahl and his child readers are collaborating on something magical, bold, and a little naughty, and this sense of camraderie conveys itself to the childhood readers.Of all the Dahl books, this has to be one of the three or four best, and the ending, which isn't remotely tidy or ideal, may be shocking. The movie was kind of okay, but doesn't hold a candle to this exciting book.For entertainment purposes, I couldn't recommend it more."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I read this book to my two children (8 & 12) and of all the books I've ever read to them (which is alot) this one is our absolute favorite!

There have been stories of wicked witches forever and friggin' ever and unless a wiccan goes around wearing gloves and offering out candy bars then little kids won't be scared.

Some of his best of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" \\"Matilda,\\" and \\"The BFG.\\" Although \\"The Witches\\" isn't his best work, it is a fun story about a seven year old boy who finds himself in a hotel full of witches and not jus any witches mind you but witches trying to turn children into mice. To save everyone, the boy has to get stop the witches and get ride of their formula that turns children into mice. A wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The Witches is a great fiction by Roald Dahl that is great for almost any reader of any age.After a terrible accident, a boy is left with no parents and has to go live with his grandma. One summer, they decide to go on a vacation at a fancy hotel, not knowing that it is the secret meeting place of the witches. After a terrifying encounter with the witches, the boy and his grandmother realize they must get rid of them... before it's too late.What I liked most about the book was how the suspense kept building. What I didn't like was how the boy doesn't recover from his encounter with the witches, which I think is sad.My favorite character was the grandmother, because she started the \\"Witch Hunting\\" and told facinating stories about witches to the boy so he was aware of the horrible things they did.My favorite line was \\"a witch can be anyone, even your teacher or your neigbor, but you can never be sure.\\"I like this sentence because it can pertain to everyday life, because when you meet someone they can seem like the nicest person you've ever met, but be horrible once you get to know them, or vice versa. If I were to tell someone something about this book, I would say that this is a great book with lots of twists and turns in the plot. It has an ending that makes you wish there were a sequal. Some questions I have after reading this book are: Do the boy and his grandmother ever conquer all the witches? Does the boy ever recover?I have two reasons for recommending this book: It's not predictable, and by the same author as Charlie and the Chocolate factory."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This book is not about fake stuff, it is about real true witches.I'm not trying to scare you but witches have one need in this world....children!Witches see children differently then we do, when they see us they think of smelly, nasty, dogs droppings!There are a couple of ways to tell if a witch is a true witch..So listen up.All witches have no hair, well they have hair but they wear wigs.Another way to tell is if this is a witch is if it is wearing gloves, they wear gloves to hide their long fingernails!

The narrator takes you in and bears you along in a story that becomes ever more fancifully bizarre. When you reach the ending, which would seem bleak if not for the cotton-candy spun delight of the story, you take it in stride.&quot;The Witches&quot; is not for the literal-minded child, but for children who can understand a story as an exercise in imagination, it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"The WitchesBy:Roald Dahl,Reviewed by:K.Lperiod 3This book is about witches terrorizing children.

Later on the boy finds out where the all the witches met. And he over hears what their secret plan, about how they were going to get rid of annoying children. The boy sucessfully ruined their plans, but because of that he was turned into a mouse.I liked the book because, it was an adventurous and exciting tale. I'm a fan of scary stories, so the tales about witches interested me. I liked the author's creative imagination. He made up how witches looked like, and how to avoid them.\\"A witch has a bald head, not even a single strand of hair can grow on it.\\" \\"If you pay attention to the hands you can see that they always wear gloves.\\"I don't like the book because it had a poorly drawn illustration. It looks like a child drew it. Another reason was because the story wasn't very interesting until the climax.

Now, eight years later I have read it more than twenty times and I love it even more than I did the first time. Roald Dahl wrote books for both adults and children, and &quot;The Witches&quot; fits well into both categories. It is a book that makes you believe ( I must admit that I am always on the look-out for women with square feet and purple eyes...) A beautiful story, yet It will make your skin crawl...Exciting, mesmerising and cunning - clever, creepy and wise....need I say more?A CLASSIC for both children and grown-ups!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"&quot;The Witches&quot; begins with a short warning about witches--what they look like, how they act, etc.--, but the seven-year-old orphan boy who tells this story learns all about witches from his Norwegian grandmother--and, later, from firsthand experience.His first meeting with a witch is in his own backyard in Kent, England. She tries to coax him out of his tree house with a snake, but he recognizes her as a witch by her gloves and purple-tinted eyes and refuses to leave.The second time he meets a witch (actually, several witches), he isn't so lucky. This happens when he and his grandmother go to the Hotel Magnificent in Bournemouth so his grandmother can recover from pneumonia. The hotel they stay in is also the meeting place of several other English witches who are masquerading as members of the RSPCC (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Children). Leading the convention is the Grand High Witch, the most evil and powerful witch alive.The young boy accidentally overhears the entire meeting of the witches and their terrible plan to exterminate all the children in the world by poisoning their candy. He even witnesses their mouse-transforming experiment on a young boy named Bruno Jenkins. And before the meeting ends, he's discovered and changed into a mouse as well.Although they're hopelessly small to physically stop the witches, they aim to outwit them with the help of the boy's grandmother--and a stolen bottle of Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker.This was the first book by Roald Dahl I ever read and is still my favorite. I remember reading it dozens of times when I was a kid; it was that good. I highly recommend it to all 8 to 12-year-olds.I saw the movie several years later and thought it was all right, but not as good as the book. The movie's ending was too happy-ever-after, not that the book's ending was any better though. (It felt like there should be a sequel.) Nevertheless, I would still recommend the movie--right after you read the book, of course."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"This is a book about a boy,and his grandmother and witches.His grandmother tells him about witchesand he wounders if that is why his grandmothers thumb is missing.So oneday he was his treehouse and a lady was talking to him,so he thought it was a witch and she was.Later on they go rent a room in a hotel and he needs a place to teach his mice some tricks but he cant get cought.He didnt no that witches came in the room because they just came in.So they found him and turned him into a mouse.You should read and find out what else happens to the boy,its very good on what happenes next."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I like this book!

This, along with &quot;Matilda&quot; are the best of his later works. The story is neatly developed and tied up, though squeamish readers may dislike the fact that the protagonist must remain a mouse at the end."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I respect the Wiccan religion, but I think the Witches who were so appalled are missing the point. I don't think Mr. Dahl even knew Wicca existed when he wrote this book. He certainly is not trying to portray peaceful Wiccan Witches as mean people--his definition of a \\"witch\\" is the warty creatures from fairy tales who poison princesses and make obstacles. If you read it, you'll notice that there is no mention of Wiccan practices by the women who are witches; they seem to be Christian, actually, considering that most people in England at that time were. The Halloween witch has nothing to do with the Wiccan Witch except that they are spelt the same way, and I'm sorry that the Wiccan Witches can't throw off their prejudice and enjoy the book as a fantasy about scary witches and a little boy who saves England from these women, and have a laugh about the hilarious descriptions and cackling action."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"\\"The Witches\\" is an incredible novel that opens up people's imaginations. This book makes you travel into an extremely magical world where witches really exist! It is a brilliant and fascinating novel that grabs your attention from page 1!The adventure begins when this eight-year-old boy moves to live in with his grandmother in Norway because his parents were killed in a horrifying car accident. The little boy had always had a very close relationship with his grandmother, and now that they were living together they grew even closer to each other. Every night, the eight-year-old boy and his grandmother would sit in front of the fireplace where the boy's grandmother would always narrate incredible stories. One night the boy's grandmother decided to tell the little boy the truth about real witches! Now, real witches don't wear silly black hats and fly on broomsticks. Real witches wear disguises! They do not have any hair, instead they wear wigs. They do not have toes either, but they hide their feet in their shoes. They also have weird looking nostrils. All of these witches are followers of the Grand High Witch, who is supreme authority. This Grand High Witch meets with all of the witches of the world by making meetings with all of the witches in every country once a year. In these meetings, the Grand High Witch gives the witches of the country she visits new ideas in which they can destroy every child in their country! These meetings were usually held in hotels and were disguised as charity projects. Of coarse, the eight-year-old boy was shocked when he heard this. Who wouldn't be?Well, any ways the real heart stopping adventure begins when the little boy and his grandmother decide to take a vacation to Bournemouth, England and they stayed at Hotel Magnificent. The eight-year-old boy and his grandmother were planning on having a great time in this vacation, but unfortunately this was impossible! Since they were unaware that the annual meeting in which the Grand High Witch visits all the witches in England was going to take place on the same hotel they were staying at, they were bound to have an incredible surprise that would fill them with horror.You don't want to miss this breath- taking story! It is a real page- turner filled with laughter and delight!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I read the book called \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl. I'd say that this is one of the best books that I have ever read and that other people should share the experience I had too. I gave this book the full five star rating because it was hard for me to put it down. This is a somewhat rare thing for me due to the fact that I can't ever find a book that I qualify as a book worth reading. The book had a good plot - it kept you interested from the first page to the last. It was written so well that in the back of your mind you knew that this story could be true. This book starts out with a little boy living with his grandmother in Norway because his parents had recently died in a car crash. The grandmother starts telling the boy about witches to make him feel better and he is so intrigued that he won't let his grandmother stop talking. She starts telling him about what you can look for to see if some one is a witch. The grandmother tells him that there is a secret witch organization, run by the Grand High Witch. And witches have only one thing in mind, to get rid of all the kids in the world! One day the boy and his grandmother decide to go on a vacation to a wonderful hotel on the beach in England. While they are there the boy discovers that Witches are having a secret meeting there led by the Grand High Witch herself. He ends up inside the room along with all the witches in the meeting and he overhears a terrible plot to rid all of England from kids. The boy can't let this happen, but then he gets caught. To bad that this is all I'll say, but I guess you'll just have to read the book now, won't you."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I read this years ago, but I find it far more superior to Harry Potter and the like. This book by the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an amusing parody of witches and the myth. Imagine witches who hate children so much they will stop at nothing to destroy them. Perhaps a little dark for younger readers, this was fun. The witches cleverly disguise themselves as nice ladies and try and lure their victims with candy and the like. The only way to tell them apart is through their bald heads covered by wigs that leave nasty, itchy rashes. They have no toes and stuff their square shaped feet into pointy shoes and their teeth! Luckily a grandmother and her grandson are not content to stay at home and watch as the witches attempt to poison the world's child population. Mayhem and danger lurk around every corner in this entertaining romp and I think it a must for every child's library."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I liked, enjoyed, and loved this book. Be it had some interesting facts and some incredible things in it. I also liked this book because, I have read other books that the author has wrote, and that is how I think that this book was. My favorite character was Brunal he was a funny character, and he was fat or chubby should I say. The best part of that book was when Brunal had turned into a mouse. It was the best part because one of the withes had turned him into one. The ending of the book was enjoyable, and surprising. You have to read this book because if you do not,you will be missing out a lot of things."},{"Title":"The witches","review":"I loved this book because,its about Witches & Spells.

So far, each chapter has ended perfectly for a bedtime story, with the child saying good night to his grandmother and going to bed.I gave this book 4 stars only because the illustrations could be less crude.

This is probably the greatest fantasy fiction book I've ever read in my whole life- and I read a lot of them. Roald Dahl did such a great job writing this book, I couldn't stop reading it! If you are a big time fantasy fiction reader like me, go immediately to the bookstore NOW and buy your self this book, it's a classic!The main character of this book (name unknown) is a boy who nearly died in a car crash when he was little. He had lost both his parents in this accident and was to live with his amazing story- teller grandmother in Norway. She tells him many stories about witches and children who were eaten up by them, but before he knew it, he was face to face with the Grand High Witch who was the leader of all the witches in the whole world. The boy sneaks into the witches meeting located inside his building and finds out about their next evil plan, a formula that turns children into mice. The witches would hide their evil formula in chocolate bars to disguise it and sell to children. Now the heroic boy will have to save all of the children of the world by outsmarting the witches and getting them to drink the formula instead, and turn them into mice. On the way, the boy goes through the challenge of becoming a mouse himself but by accident and reveals his new small, hairy self.One theme in The Witches that I would like to talk about was the humor Roald Dahl included. He makes up these hilarious short songs in his books along with made up words he uses in almost every sentence, which is something very unique to books, and I really love it in this type of book. One of my favorite things is when authors crack me up, and this book definitely did the job.I truly enjoyed this book and I hope everybody does too when they read it. Who cares if the witches have no toes or are bald or have blue saliva, it's a great book!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"If you want a book that dosen't waste your time, that is actually interesting, and keeps you guessing, then i highly recommended The Witches by Ronald Dahl. He is one of my favorite writers of all times! Its a book with so many hooks you cant put it down, time flew when i read this! Great book for children, i laugh a lot in my head!This book is a great novel about some fantasy creatures, who hate every thing about children, mostly there smell. The witches are try- ing to overpower the world of kids. But a boy takes on the challenge, it seems like he if very frighten of those beast! It seems like he wants to destroy them and there hideous bodies for all the scams they set up in are life to kill, we the kids. He goes to a famous hotel, where his grandma grew up, for summer vacation. His grandma gets him two mice, but the manager said he had to keep them in the cage. So he sneaks into a empty ball room down stairs, and plays with the animals behind a screen. But then all the witches held a meeting there, and he... read it to find out!"},{"Title":"The witches","review":"When you turn the first page of this book, you are already convinced that it's the best!
