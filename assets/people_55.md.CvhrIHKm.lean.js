I can not think of a book that would be of less interest to a teen age american boy than this one. All the reviewers who praise this book make me wonder about what else they read. It was beyond boring and had no possible points of reference to me. There are literally thousands of British novels that would be better choices. If you are going to assign students a British Novel pick one that at least they would enjoy reading. Thank god I liked to read or after this experience I would probably not read anything for years. I hope to god that this is no longer assigned or rather forced reading for HS. When there are books like 1984 or Brave New World available why use one that has so little possible interest to students."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"do not recommend this book to anybody for a number of reasons. First of all, it is very boring and reading can become extremely tedious at some points. The storyline and plot is actually very interesting, but I think that if Eliot had presented it in a less descriptive and detailed way, it could have been much easier for a larger spectrum of readers to comprehend the messages she was attempting to transcribe through this story. This is definitely a selection that should be avoided by and young reader with any lack in patience or determination. This book is aimed much more towards scholars, historians, and English teachers."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book drags on about the most senseless details that neither matter at all to the book, or interest the reader. The book's plot is loosely connected through a complex and boring trail of these mindless details, overall, a very boring book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"After Silas Marner's hoard of money was stolen, I was afraid this would be another dreary, Bronte-like novel, full of doom, gloom and cruelty. I almost decided not to finish it. However, I looked up a plot summary online and found that it was not so dark. I'm glad I went ahead and finished the book. The author paints for us all kinds of interesting scenes of life in a small English village in the 19th century. We read of virtue and vice, pompousness and humility, love and devotion, and even of good intentions backfiring.All in all, this is a pleasant read. The good are rewarded and the bad get their just deserts."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I give the book Silas Marner a mixed review because although it is a good book with a lot of details, it is hard for younger people to understand. I am a freshman in high school and I found it difficult to read. Geoge Eliot has written a fable about Silas Marner. After his friend blackmails him, Silas moves to Raveloe after losing his faith in the Lord and starts a new life. He gets rich from weaving and becomes obsessed with his gold. His life starts to crumble after something happens and then it all comes back when a little girl with golden hair comes to his cottage.Silas Marner is not the best book because the narrator tried too pack to much information in to this book for how short it is. It is too hard for younger people to read because of the hard words like metamorphosis and the time period it is written in which was the Victorian age. Another bad thing about it is there are too many coincidences in it that makes it seem like a fairy tale; for example, like when Silas has his fits at the most convenient time in the plot. Some good things about the novel are that there are some good morals in it for people to learn. Eliot helps up realize the importance of love, trust and religion as Silas loses and gains these things back again. Some other morals that I learned from reading this book are not to keep lies from the people that you love and to always think about your decisions. All an all, Silas Marner is a good book. I think that George Eliot did a good job on this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I don't know about anyone else, but when I read a plot synopsis on the back of a book, I like for that story to kick in at some point. However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer). A plodding, slow book for the first two-thirds, it picks up somewhat before somehow managing to wrap things up in 10 pages...making me wonder why the book is even this long in the first place."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This book is billed as a reproduction of a classic edition of Silas Marner. It appears as is someone just scanned the pages of a classic edition and bound them together. There is no warmth to this edition. The pages are overwhelimingly bright white with a reproduced page in the middle. Doesn't even have a book title on the edge binding. This is not the edition for anyone who loves the warmth and comfort of reading classic books."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner was a good book. I give it three stars because it is kind of hard to read and the beginning of the book was really weird, but the ending was pretty good.I give it a mixed review because the beginning of the book is very boring because all George Eliot writes about is Silas' life in Lantern Yard and the boring life he leads. The middle and the end are the best parts because they at least have some excitement with some people dying in the snow and the water. I think there should be some more action in the book like fights. I am a freshman in high school, and I thought that the book was kind of hard to read because of the long paragraphs and the hard vocabulary in the book. I do not recommend this book to high school freshman because it is hard to read and hard to follow.Silas Marner is a good book because it teaches you some lessons on life. It has some good morals like to think thoroughly before you marry or before you have kids. I think that George Eliot did a very good job of writing the story with the morals even with the hard vocabulary and the long chapters and paragraphs. I think George Eliot should have written about someone who actually lived around that time because it would have made it more interesting. She should have made the book she wrote more exciting than it was."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Eliot is clearly a master - I've read \\"Mill on the Floss\\" and loved it, and I look forward to reading \\"Middlemarch.\\" However, \\"Silas Marner\\" was a bit of a disappointment. The supporting characters are well-drawn as is the town, which is really the star of this book. I found the character of Silas Marner to be vague and unbelievable. His growing isolation is described in a fair amount of detail, but his transformation is glossed over too quickly. It is simply not believable that someone who shuns others would be so willing to adopt a child and change so quickly. The message that love can transform even the most hardened person is beautiful, and the ending is wonderful, but I found it difficult to make it through most of this book."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"If compared to Eliot's best (Middlemarch, Mill on the Floss), Silas Marner is almost a disgrace. The brilliant literary style of Eliot seems all but gone, and the story could have easily been dispensed with in a form of a short story. The story, taken on its own, is heart-warming. But there is so much &quot;background noise&quot; to contend with. Overall this book should be a definite miss, even for Eliot fans (like me!).In addition I'm quite surprised this novel is used as part of the English literature curriculum in many schools (here in England at least). I feel sorry for those young minds having to wade through this. I hope schools will choose Mill on the Floss instead despite its length."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans)wrote \\"Silas Marner\\" in 1861 and it is still being read to date. I read it first in junior high school, so long ago I had forgotten what it was about so I reread it. I had high expectations for it, lasting so long but I was disappointed. First, it is a hard read, her sentences are so long and so convoluted it is hard to maintain the connection from one sentence to the next. In addition many sentences are written phonetically, to create, I guess, the sense of the spoken word in the time period (early 1800's) as well as its sound and locale(Warwickshire, middle England). Add to that the coincidences involved to have the novel generate the correct happenstances of most of its characters and you have a novel incorporating most of the defects most stressed in English writing courses. How could this story have survived 150 years? If the reader is a juvenile he or she empathises with the characters and wants them to get their just desserts, and the reader has an opinion of who gets what. Eliot satisfies these desires and the young reader has read a story with characters who strike a responsive chord with the reader who then keeps the story in memory.Most accounts of the novel speak highly of the effect of Eppie, the supposed orphan, on the protagonist, Silas Marner. But she does not appear until about two thirds of the book has been read and I think this makes her a minor character. The book is primarily devoted to character changes in Silas Marner and Godfrey Cass, that is what the book is about. Yes, Eppie is the major factor in Silas's changed character but first his character must be developed. The same is true of Godfrey Cass, the biological father of the girl. His character is developed independently of her; Nancy Lammeter does her duty towards him but she does not get the attention Eppie does. The title of the book is Silas Marner but he only gets a slightly greater mention than Godfrey, the title must be the deciding factor. I think the book is highly overrated and is a book for juveniles except its construction is so difficult it is hard to praise for young readers. But I think I read it in juhior high, has reading changed for present day youth?"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I don't really care a whole lot for this book...mostly because in 9th grade advanced english at school, my first high school experience, I was forced to read Silas Marner. The language and literary context is very deep and very advanced...it's a struggle at first to read until you get used to the flow of the book. This is definitely a book that you cannot read/skim like you can in most others. You have to carefully read and think about every sentence in order to comprehend the plot. The book gets better about half-way through, where more conversation takes place and is easier to follow. The worst aspect of the book, in my opinion, is the sentences that run on and on and take up entire paragraphs and in turn, the paragraphs that run for pages. All in all, the book was OKAY, but I don't really recommend it for pleasure reading."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a classic book but it is really hard for Freshman to grasp due to the Old English style of writing."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. In the beginning, it was hard to read though. But the story itself was marvellous! It made me think of redemption (Godfrey Cass kept many secrets from people) and rebirth (Silas's new love in his life: Eppie). The story provides moral things and it made me think of the most precious things in my life (-&gt; not money)."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The beginning of this book was slow and long. The writing style was somewhat difficult for a 9th grader, and the sentences tended to run on. Almost an entire chapter, in the beginning, was about a long, dull conversation almost irrelevant to the story itself. When Eppie enters Silas's life, however, the story becomes more interesting. She makes the characters more interesting, and the whole story more enjoyable. The large development of Silas in the beginning to the end is apparent and important. The few final twists at the end also make it a story worth reading. Therefore, this book was a good classic and should be read by those interested in historic England."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Not too bad, not great, just an enjoyable book for some light reading. Yes, I'd recommend it if you would just like a nice story without any hidden meaning or deep thought necessary, but if you can only afford a little time to read in your hectic life, you'd probably be able to find something more worth your time."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a pretty good book. It has some pretty good points to it because it is pretty realistic, but it has its monotonous spots to it too, like the introduction. Toward the end, the book improved though the beginning was pretty dull because there is so much background information. I wouldn't suggest this book to readers below eighth grade since the way it's written makes it a little hard to follow for younger readers. The novel, Silas Marner, could have more action in it because there wasn't much to keep me on the edge of my seat. The book also could have used some more dialogue between the characters; some of the paragraphs got pretty long and hard to understand. Younger readers would probably lose interest in it because the paragraphs are so extensive. Although the book gets pretty good toward the end, the person reading it has to be patient to reach the exceptional parts. Although it is very challenging, Silas Marner is still a fascinating book because it teaches a lot about trust. The end of the book is pretty commendable because it's suspenseful. I like it more than a lot of other books endings. This book had things transpire that may happen in real life, like the mom dying from an opium overdose. This novel is a really good book to teach about the way one would want to deal with people and the way one may want to be treated. I like this text because it is one of those books that anybody could be able to sit down and appreciate as long as he or she is an efficient reader."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I couldn't bear reading this book for long periods of time because I would fall asleep. It does have a theme and a moral, although a seemingly generic one at that. I don't want to overly influence anyone's decision to read this book, but think twice if you don't like extremely slow moving books."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"The plot begins like a story about the biblical Job. Silas, a young man, feels connected to his neighbors and his God. He works hard and looks forward to a normal life. But then he suffers an injustice at the hands of his Christian neighbors and blames his community and God. He suffers a self imposed alienation from both. He resorts to greediness. Suffers injustice again and hits bottom. Then the focus appears to turn to how does such a person redeem his faith in neighbors and God? How does a community redeem an outcast like Silas Marner? Also interesting was how the Church functions in the community to provide for the aged and and the disabled. Marner is told he would be taken care of despite the fact that he for years made no contributions to the Church to help it provide for his old age and disability. First rate author, this Mary Anne Evans, and a significant contribution to our great conversation about life, injustice, religion, and the redeeming power of love and loyalty. BW"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I loved this story from years ago, and it's still amazing. It is one of my favorites from classic English literature."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I failed miserably at reading The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, but I loved Silas Marner. I think it was just that my edition of The Mill on the Floss has really off-putting font, and seems really long. At any rate, I sped through Silas Marner, which is a slim little volume, and is quite interesting. \\"Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.\\" (from the Penguin Classics edition). Yes, \\"her.\\" George Eliot was a pen name. My question is, why do we still use the pen name in this case, but Charlotte Bronte's pen name (Currer Bell) isn't used anymore? I might research that...The actual edition that I read called it a moral fairy tale, and I would agree with that term. The book is fairy-tale-like, and highly entertaining, but also thought-provoking, as moralities (and fairy tales for that matter) are supposed to be. The sentences can be very long, but somehow, unlike Charles Dickens, they don't seem overwritten; they seem to fit the tone of the story just right.I loved how the little golden-haired orphan Eppie made her appearance; she is the child of Godfrey Cass, and when her mother keels over, Eppie toddles into the cottage of none other than Silas Marner, who now has a chance for redemption. She is the reappearance of his precious gold that he lost.A chance for redemption. I suppose that's not really the right phrase; Silas Marner isn't bad per se. He's complicated, and yes, he's miserly, but that's because he was wrongfully accused of a crime in his past life. He's just drawn into himself, and he no longer wishes to associate with the rest of the world or have anything to do with religion. But bright little Eppie gives him a chance to get past that and start again. Godfrey too isn't strictly good or evil. He's conflicted, and he's done some bad things which he wants to forget about, and he's done some good things. I won't tell how the book ends, but suffice to say that Silas Marner is an amazing classic novel, for its social commentary, and its humor, and its symbolism. I would highly recommend it, and am thinking of trying to tackle The Mill and the Floss once again. Or perhaps Middlemarch. I do think Silas Marner is a good book to start off with if you're going to read George Eliot; it's short and (it seems to me) less overwritten.My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"It has been several decades since I last read it. It was not an overly exciting read, but well crafted and worth the time. Better use of time than most TV shows or movies."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Here's a blast from the past. I must have been nearly illiterate when Silas Marner turned up as part of my 9th grade English class. By all recollection, the text was reprinted into our English text book for that year; and it was a class-wide assignment during that year.My best memory is that I couldn't read it; I couldn't understand a thing about it; it was daunting. Somehow, I got a good grade in the class: it was either that the standards had already fallen or maybe that it was just the Cliff's Notes allowing me to escape the experience with pretense that I may have actually read it at the time.So, it happened to come across my desk four decades later (February 2013); actually it showed up on my Kindle app when we purchased the complete works of George Eliot, when my wife wanted to read Middlemarch --- who knew that George Eliot was a pen name for a female author of the early 1800s, at a time when only male authors could garner a readership.I suppose a theme of man's moral certitude and the perseverance of man's spirit could be a central message here. But I wasn't struck with a particularly artistic nor elegant narrative. It all seemed a bit on the stilted side, although with some flowery language sprinkled in. The unfolding of events is more or less just told straight out, and not revealed using a colorfully narrated unfolding of events.I ploughed through it with a sense of duty to complete something that I only pretended to complete in high school. And I was immensely relieved to discover that it wasn't unreadable, as I had thought all these years. Tony Morrison and Immanuel Kant, however, do remain unreadable."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This is a classic and should be read as such. Going in, you have to know that Eliot is a master at words and dialects and that this will not be easy reading. I did find that reading it was tedious at times. It wasn't the kind of book that I couldn't put down or that I'd look forward with eagerness to picking up again.That said, there is much to recommend this book. The morals and the values are excellent. From the first few chapters, you might be afraid that the book is going to be filled with rather amoral, money-grubbing characters, but you will soon find that the good, decent people here are head and shoulders above many people. There is one thing about certain writers of classics--when people are good or evolve from good to better they are superior people. You'd be hard put to find such perfect people. The father-daughter relationship in this book is incredible. I'm always amazed at the classics that have extended families living together and it's all so beautiful. The in-laws become beloved family members and look after the old folks as though they were blood relations. It's a fairy-tale experience, but if you can suspend judgment and believe that people can live together in harmony, not to mention choosing the spiritual over the material, your heart and soul will be warmed by this story.But be warned that although it's a short book there is a multitude of wordiness to get through. You may have trouble with unfamiliar dialects and long sentences that never seem to end, but your patience will be rewarded. There is nothing stereotypical about this story. It's quite unusual, has some twists and turns, and ultimately a very satisfying finish.Just a postscript: I decided to read this book because I remembered a nun who recommended it. She had just had our junior class in high school plow through Eliot's Adam Bede which is considerably longer, but we all enjoyed it. So she said that Silas Marner was good also and several girls groaned audibly. This was all I needed to hear--those groans convinced me that this wouldn't be easy reading for a 17-year-old young woman. But the nun said, \\"Oh, girls...\\" in the most wistful manner. I always wondered what there was about Silas Marner to make Sister look so moony-eyed. Now I know. I had to groan a little through all the verbiage, but I did find the warmth that Sister had evidently discovered."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is something of a rustic parable, in which the concept of wealth is held under a critical, moral light. It concerns a miserly hermit-weaver, who, after years and years of hoarding his earnings--reveling in the shimmer and chime of his beloved coins--is robbed of all his money. Yes--the thieving Dunstan Cass is punished for his wickedness, drowned in a nearby pond. But most intriguing is the way Silas's monetary misfortune marks the beginning of his passage to spiritual wealth. From the moment he is robbed, he is compelled to go out among the townsfolk, and establish relationships with his neighbors. Eliot's description of Silas's coins as \\"children waiting to be born\\" will remind some readers of one of Marx's descriptions of money as \\"monetary larva.\\" But the central transformation in Silas Marner does not occur in the market realm of commodity exchange, but in realm of symbolism and spiritual reformation, when Silas discovers the little \\"orphaned\\" Eppie in the ruddy glow of his hearth. It is, of course, a new, human treasure that Silas discovers in Eppie--one of rejuvenating import. And one of the most poignant scenes in the novel is when Silas confuses Eppie's golden locks of hair with his stolen gold coins, for it offers him a startling, new vision of human wealth. It's rather a queer novel, but not without its charm."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"A simple but beautifully written morality tale. Established religion, through church and chapel, is shown to be wanting, the petty aristocracy eats its own and Silas, the sad downtrodden misfit, wins the day and the girl.

The meek do inherit the earth, or at least find contentment, and live on in happiness.The best 89c I ever spent - thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Read this as a Sophomore in high school.

I remember first reading it when I was a child but rediscovering it as an adult has been fantastic.

It is also a secular resurrection story: Silas, after losing his friends, his faith, and his fiance, becomes a reclusive, obsessive weaver, who is essentially dead to society and himself. He hoards his money, but when it is lost, he finds the baby, Eppie, who is a greater treasure, and who essentially restores his life.It is also a terrific study in Class Conflict--a favorite of Eliot's. Silas, of the lowest (almost serf) class, is hardworking, honest, helpful, whereas the Casses, Dunstan and Godfrey, are both aristocratic scoundrels. Dunstan steals Marner's money; Godfrey attempts to steal his child.The language may be daunting to modern readers, but it was standard prose for Victorian novels. Oddly, the most difficult chapter for readers today, Chapter 6, was the one most loved in Eliot's day: it is a tour de force of local dialect of the Midlands.Eliot, as usual, sees clearly, almost like God: she knows everyone's flaws and strengths, and is harsh on what causes harm to others; but she is always generous-hearted and understanding."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a classic. Once you come to terms with the old English the characters take on an intertwining story of symbolism and intrigue. A great plot dealing with human nature at it's best and worst. A good story of any age."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This was a perfectly agreeable, though not exceptional, specimen of the 19th century British novel. Eliot was a very fine writer in the Victorian style, with an assured, elegant vocabulary and lofty moral sensibility. Like other authors of the period, she occasionally gets carried away with grandiose elliptical constructions yielding minor observations of human nature that could be conveyed much more simply. Here's one that occurs early on: &quot;For the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants.&quot; Translation: powerless people distrust powerful people. Or this gem: &quot;a dull mind, once arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started was purely problematic.&quot; Whew. Translation: people believe what they want to believe.OK, so sentences like these fall a bit humorously on modern ears, but that's half the fun of reading this stuff, and Shakespeare did it too. Anyway, these characters are very likeable and the story is engaging. You'll sympathize with poor Silas and fall in love with adorable Eppie, and everything turns out well in the end. It's not as great as Middlemarch, but it still delivers the goods."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Early in the story Silas Marner has a great life - he's happily engaged, living among good friends, and doing work he enjoys.

This beautiful tale is literally filled with credos on how to live a quality and meaningful life! But we, being mere immature elementary students at the time, had most of these teachings allude us completely.'Silas Marner' truly is a literary classic. The author brings to light the life areas of deceit, mistrust, bribery, greed, and eventual unrepentant love through a set of intermingled and memorable characters. Her style is very similar to that of Dickens insomuch that there is not only a riveting plotline that weaves its way throughout the book but a series of side adjuncts which not only give us a firmer grasp of the life and times of a small town but the inequalities that are caused through its income and social disparities.Take the time, as I did, now that you are an adult to grasp the life-teaching tale that our 8th grade teacher so desperately wanted us to glean from this classic novel.

I had never heard of this particular Elliot book until I acquired the list of \\"1001 books to read before you die.\\" I can see where the language in this book would be troublesome to many young students, particularly if they have little to no experience reading anything from the time, much less anything written in phonetic slang. But the theme should be universal.Short Synopsis - we follow to individuals through the tale, the title character - Silas Marner, a weaver who has had a long run of bad luck in dealing with people who has then holed himself away from society and fills his days with weaving and counting his slowly growing stack of gold. The other is Godfry Cass, a wealthy son of a land owner who's poor in morals and scruples. Through a series of events triggered by Godfry and his brother, Silas is thrust into various situations of both grief and joy. Always Silas maintains his high moral standard and simple way of life and is thusly rewarded for it.As is standard in the literature of the time - the good get what they deserve and the morally lacking get their just ends. The interesting part that Elliot weaves in to the tale is that the unfortunate events that happen to Silas, all end up leading him to true happiness. Now I don't want to give the story away as many others have, but I will say that once you get past the first third or so (where the reader will find themselves wondering if ANYTHING is ever going to happen) the book picks up and becomes very enjoyable.The language may be tough for some, but once you get about 20-30 pages in, you shouldn't have much trouble reading it. If all else fails, read it out loud. On the whole this is a very enjoyable book, though not my favorite - the story is fun and happy and leaves the reader feeling rather warm and fuzzy."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Unlike the tragical nature of Eliot's \\"Mill on the Floss,\\" for example, \\"Silas Marner,\\" is an inspiring, thought-provoking story of a lonely old man who is given a gift that illuminates his life. The story is written in Eliot's astute and intelligent way with words, and also sparks discussion of some underlying themes (such as religious faith issues). It would be wonderful if A&E or the BBC would give it a faithful movie adaptation. We only have Steve Martin's movie, \\"A Simple Twist of Fate,\\" that is loosely based on the text of this timeless story. If you are a fan of Victorian fiction, don't miss Eliot, as her writing differs in style and tone from other works of the era, and offers the reader a lot to sink their thoughts into."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is a wonderful story about life and love. It begins with our hero, Silas Marner, a lonely, luckless old man, being robbed of his life savings. But then a mysterious appearance of a homeless, golden-haired little girl opens up an unexpected new chapter in his life. Silas Marner was a weaver who through loneliness and through life's occurrences becomes bitter and miserly. The theft of his life savings causes him to rethink everything about his life. Ms. Eliot also introduces Godfrey Cass to her cast of characters. Godfrey is a foil to Silas. He is the real father of Eppie, the young girl that Silas adopts. We watch as Silas' lot and outlook on life improve, Godfrey's life dissolves into disappointment, fear and guilt. The book is not \\"preachy\\", but a reader cannot help but be improved by reading and learning the moral lessons that it delivers."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"When I first started reading this book years ago my first impression was how boring, but as I read on it became more and more interesting. When I finished reading this book in the ninth grade I was impressed with my English teacher because she gave me credit for having the intelligence to comprehend it. Also, through reading this book, I not only enjoyed a great piece of literature but gained self-confidence because someone believed in me enough. This book changed my life."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"This 19th century classic by George Eliot/Maryann Evans retains its timeless appeal; it charms and touches us no matter how jaded or sophisticated we consider ourselves. Perhaps the characters are something out of Dickens (in their extreem personality types and the idealized heroine). Yet this novel reaches our inner selves, where it is safe to applaud the unselfish and the compassionate, to appreciate social redemption and sincere devotion.Silas, a disillusioned weaver who lives the life of a recluse, has never been accepted by the villagers of Raveloe. Paid in gold for his fine cloth, Marner hoards most of it in an iron pot buried in the sand under his loom. Having lost faith in God, church and his fellow men because of a tragic injustice in his former town, he lavishes his lamentable affection on indifferent gold. Until it is stolen.The theft of this gold--his only friend as it were--leaves him desvastated. Yet fate seems to compensate him by the sudden apperance of a golden-curled baby, who toddles over his doorway one night when he is in a mild catatonic state.How Eppie pulls at his heart and transforms his miserable, miserly life is the soul of this novelette. Evans' weaves a tapestry of tenderness and redemption through juvenile affection. SILAS MARNER remains a contemplative read for students 14 and up, and for all who enjoy British classical literature. The action is in the Heart."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot's SILAS MARNER is a literary classic. What does that mean? A classic is a book that has passed the test of time. A book taken out of its historical milieu and placed in a contemporary one, e.g. our 2008 society, and still reads fresh is a classic.SILAS MARNER still reads fresh, if you are a sophisticated reader or have a teacher to guide you through the ground mines of vocabulary and complex writing. However, wrapped inside those is a great story, even a soap opera that students recognize as soon as the Cass brothers are introduced.Two story lines run parallel until they intersect with the theft of Silas's gold. Silas Marner has been in this village for seventeen years, living a life of isolation, while he makes a living as a weaver. Even if he had chosen to live amongst people, he possesses two things that would always hinder acceptance: he is a herbalist and a victim of catatonic seizures. He discontinues his use of herbs early on, but he cannot stop catatonia, which of course becomes a metaphor for his life with others before Eppy appears.It is these quiet seizures that result in blackouts that--bottom line--cause his banishment from a religious community where he was highly respected. In the seventeen years near Raveloe, nothing has happened to change his life with a dead heart. His great love in this time is his growing stacks of gold. He loves it! He idolizes it!Enter Godfrey and Dunstan Cass, two landed gentry, both dissolute in differing ways, both catalysts in the change in Silas Marner's dull life. The younger brother, Dunstan, is a n'er-do-well, a gambler in debt and subject to embarrassment by a man to whom Dunstan owes a great deal of money. He finds gold in Silas's house. On the other hand, Godfrey leads a superficial respectable life, because he too has indulged himself and has a child born out of wedlock.One cold, dark, stormy night two stories intersect: Dunstan steals Silas's gold, then disappears forever, and Silas is devastated by the loss of his gold. However, this loss brings Silas into community. The night the golden-haired child appears magically on Silas's hearth clinches Silas's total acceptance into village life. Silas adopts this child and Dolly Winthrop becomes his guiding angel in helping to raise the child.When the two secrets are revealed concerning Dunstan and Godfrey, the reader cheers Silas on, directs hisses at Godfrey, and stands amazed at Dunstan's revelation.Inside this \\"soap opera\\" is a fabulous story of love and redemption. Without love one man lives a life of solace in gold with a heart dried and shriveled. With love his heart beats passionately and lovingly and makes him live fully with family and friends. No greater lesson can come from a story as one of redemption. From the still-point of one golden-haired girl radiates a life that redeems a man.George Eliot, or Mary Ann Evans, is a genius in depicting the lives of men and women and their influence on others for good or evil. Eppy is the source of good out of sinful circumstances and selfishness on Godfrey's part. Godfrey continues his static life force by not claiming his child at one point and trying to claim her when it is too late. The contrast between one man who has little and the other who has everything is instructive in explaining the ways of the heart.If I were marooned on a deserted island and could take ten books with me, SILAS MARNER would definitely be on the list. It is a great book to teach and listen to students respond to it (and NO, I won't be stranded with students). Watching their faces in class discussion concerning Dunstan's re-appearance in Raveloe is absolutely priceless. Even though the foreshadowing is huge, students never figure out what happens.Just think of all the choices we make in our lives, some irrevocable as to cause and effect. SILAS MARNER is a caution and a beacon to making the right choices. Making wrong choices to hide one's actions, more often than not, results in dire consequences. Silas shows us that right actions produce right results. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Silas Marner is quite an unusual piece of work. Not as lengthy as Eliot's other books, yet has more meaning and elements.Fantastic! It may be hard to understand at first, but it's an emotional dive into the deep."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"George Eliot never fails to entertain me, her books are a wonder and a glory to read just for the fun of it. SILAS MARNER is one of her shortest novels, but that doesn't keep it from being one of the best.Although I prefer ADAM BEDE, SILAS MARNER has that little charm in it, either you pity Silas and his daughter, or that snobby rich family who wants everything."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"I loved the confusion in Adam Bede. And the hate and prejudice in The Mill on the Floss was astounding, even with all that, Silas Marner is the one that touched my heart and caused pain. This is a brilliant book by a brilliant author."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"As an A-level text there's plenty of material to discuss, I hope I pass. But in my opinion Nancy and Godfrey deserve each other in their stupid piety, Eppie is contrived and spouting with saccharine, the villagers are patronised, Molly is treated dreadfully, Dolly is held up as some kind of saint, Silas is treated like a freaky experiment subject to a string of highly unbelievable coincidences despite all Eliot's psycological reasoning. And all the time Eliot sits on her high horse above them. A large part seems to our ears to be sentimental tripe, for example Aaron's charming little carol..I'd love to hear what Goldsmith had to say about this purile pampering of the reader. I'll leave off what I think about portrayal of women in the novel before my blood boils...."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Very chilling tale.

Both posessions were in a way stolen, both were worth it's price, and the prior owners will do anything possible to get it back. A creative and surprisingly touching novel, written in such a way that you KNOW that George Eliot was just a psudonym of a gifted woman writer."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book a lot, though it is sometimes hard to understand. I found that seeing the movie version before or after reading segements of the novel helped me visualize and comprehend the action more.I particularly enjoyed seeing a book showing how greed and denouncing religion and charity only backfire. I also wish people who are about to give up their children for adoption would read it, to make them think about the precious gift they are surrendering. It also illustrates how unfair it is to try to reclaim a child you give up. On both the surface and deeper meanings, it is a good novel."},{"Title":"Silas Marner","review":"It is interesting to note briefly George Eliot's background when setting out to examine the novel from the standpoint of a moral or religious philosopher. Brought up in a strict evangelical home, and sent to a school institution run along similar lines, she rejected this evangelicalism, forging a sort of broadly &quot;Christian&quot; humanism, which undeniably belonged strongly to Eliot. This is powerfully evident in 'Silas Marner'. Marner's rejection by the Leeds brethren on the grounds that he had stolen the church revenue, (when in fact he had be 'framed' all along,) led to his rejection of evangelical beliefs. As he moves away to ply his trade as a weaver, &quot;his God&quot; remains in the congregation in the city. Faith belonged not to him, but to a particular place. He replaces his religion, with the worship of Mammon - drawing comfort from his gold pieces. When these are stolen, his world falls apart once again. It is then that the child Eppie comes into his life, and becomes his ambition. Thus, she is seen by some as a &quot;Christ-child&quot;, in turning him from is love of the material, but importantly she is seen as the fulfilment of NATURAL JUSTICE - a concept which Eliot clearly espouses. The other predominant theme in the book, is the conflict between Nature and Nurture. As Eppie's natural father - the wealthy Godfrey Cass, a victim of circumstance who disclaimed the child - tries to claim her back at the age of eighteen she refuses. Thus, against the recieved morality of the time, nurture wins over nature, and a poor but contented way of life is chosen over one of status. The other notable feature of the book is its fairy tale quality. The first two chapters serve as an introdution to the scenario, but the third chapter, introducing village life in Raveloe, has a definate fairy tale quality about it, as does the sickly-sweet end. A radical and deeply profound, thought provoking work, it is a must for any student or lover of Victorian Literature, and should not be overlooked as it ha! s been in the past."},{"Title":"The Essential C. S. Lewis","review":"This book gives an excellent, balanced introduction to the wealth of ideas found in C.S. Lewis' many works. It includes some complete works of differing genres, and many selections from an even wider range of his works including letters and essays. Many of the most quoted passages from a large number of works are included. A great book for anyone who knows a little of Lewis' works and wants to know what else the man has to say. Especially good if one feels a bit overwhelmed by how many works there are to choose from and wants to sample first."},{"Title":"The Essential C. S. Lewis","review":"This volume is a good selection of Lewis's complete works, even tho it is not quite the book I would have made. However, it does lay a fair claim to presenting the essential CSL both in terms of what he was best known for and what his devoted readers would agree is most important. Included are two of his indispensable essays, Abolition of Man and De Descriptione Temporum. Two novels are included, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe; and Perelandra. Poetry, writings on literature, autobiography, letters and apologetics are all represented. The only glaring omission in my opinion is his introduction to George MacDonald: An Anthology, but it could be argued that that essay was about someone else and did not really belong here. And my only real complaint about the book is that it is printed on what appears to be rather cheap paper: books like this one are meant to be kept for a long time."},{"Title":"The Essential C. S.

Lewis is for the thinking Christian and you find yourself, especially with his essays, looking for a piece of paper to write down the ideas.The binding of this book and the paper make it very attractive.

Few readers are likely to possess her remarkable knowledge of Italian paintings, murals, frescoes, sculpture, and architecture, and in the hands of a lesser writer, these essays might easily have become tedious and overly detailed. Wharton's essays achieve a singular balance between scholarly analysis and captivating memoir.Italian Backgrounds begins not in Italy, but at a small alpine posting-inn in Switzerland close to the Italian border. She contrasts a picturesque \\"toy chalet, with its air of self-conscious neatness\\" with the untidiness of nearby Italian villages. Despite this negative comparison, with little effort Wharton convinces us that we must take the dusty, windy road downward into that land where church steeples become campanili, liberated vines wrap themselves around mulberry trees, and far off across the hot plains domes and spires, painted walls, and sculptured alters await us.Italian Backgrounds is not a conventional travel book. Edith Wharton's discursive essays are not arranged geographically, nor chronologically. The chapters could be read in any sequence with little loss of continuity. They might compare favorably with an extensive mural, one that draws your attention first here, then there, then elsewhere.Despite the passage of 100 years, Italian Backgrounds should be mandatory reading to anyone planning to visit Italy, especially those with aspirations to write travel essays. Likewise, Italian Backgrounds would be ideal supplementary reading for a general art appreciation class, as well as targeted reading for art and history majors.The chapters are titled An Alpine Posting-Inn, A Midsummer Week's Dream, The Sanctuaries of the Pennine Alps, What the Hermits Saw, A Tuscan Shrine, Sub Umbra Liliorum, March in Italy, Picturesque Milan, and Italian Backgrounds.Ecco Travels specializes in re-publishing rare and hard-to-obtain travel writings by exceptional authors like Henry James, Charles Dickens, Andre Gide, Freya Stark, Augustus Hare, Aldous Huxley, V. S. Pritchett, Evelyn Waugh, and Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"Italian backgrounds (Flexibles)","review":"&quot;Italian Backgrounds&quot; by Edith Wharton is a somewhat charming travel book (a quick read) about her time in Italy as its veteran traveler. The piece is not written in a narrative, but is rather more thematically arranged. Wharton doesn't write about the Doges Palace or the Duomo, her milieu is the deeper background of the dedicated traveler.The title comes from her theme derived from an analogy that traveling in Italy involves various areas of a painting. Italian paintings, she writes, have fore- middle- and backgrounds. The two-or three-day tourist in Venice spends all his or her time in the foreground, traipsing the well-established routes and keeping to the guidebooks. If one has more time, one can go farther into the \\"painting\\" by discovering more, and, of course, finally, as Wharton herself has done, one can dwell in the backgrounds, knowing the country well, understanding all its eras and its different brands of beauty.Wharton is a harsh art critic, and much of the book deals with her assessments of lesser known (to me as the foreground tourist of Italy) artists and their works. My favorite chapter retold the story of her identifying some mislabeled statuary in Tuscany as belonging to a different artist and era altogether.It was pleasant to read. For me, I am a fan of Wharton, so enjoyed this look into her experiences and the life of her mind."},{"Title":"Italian backgrounds (Flexibles)","review":"Interesting information written in the superb style of Edith Wharton.

He was only a monster because his eyes just didn't have human life in them because he was created by Frankenstein, which is the name of the doctor and not the monster.I'm pretty sure none of the following constitutes a spoiler:Dr. Frankenstein is a pretty wimpy guy, who slipped into an apoplexy (okay, I did read part of it myself due to my daughter's exuberance) over nothing but his emotional reaction to the monster not turning out as hoped ... and then killing someone.

The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship. Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to &quot;benefit all mankind&quot; with his scientific project. His &quot;selfless&quot; ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a &quot;most severe evil.&quot; Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none. While observing an impoverished family, &quot;the bitter gall of envy&quot; arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great need for mankind.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our &quot;native town to be the world,&quot; he adds, &quot;yet another may succeed.&quot; You could interpret this as Victor not &quot;learning his lesson;&quot; that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be a contradiction."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"Read this book many years after enjoying the mini-series.

A mini series was made for TV some years ago, and I may try to purchase the tapes for that later. Excellent story."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"Although it has been many years since I read this book, what struck me was how a cadre of mega-rich businessmen had the means to manipulate the public and control the world. They believed they were, as the author put it, \\"beyond good and evil.\\" I plan on re-reading this book, as I have begun to follow politics, and see how the CEOs get Republican mouthpieces to ensure their wealth. Witness the current \\"Right to Work\\" laws that are being passed, ensuring the demise of unions, and therefore workers's rights. The idea that states may file bankruptcy and all state workers would therefore lose their pensions, among other benefits, are of paramount concern.The villians of her novel, through force and cunning, work to ensure that the John Birch agenda of a society where market is king, govenment intervention is unheard of, and private charity is tolerated becomes the great ideal.The Koch brothers -- characters who could have came straigt from the pages of \\"Captains and the Kings,\\" are doing their best to promote the vary ideals that Mrs. Caldwell claims to disdain -- at least in her writing. Let us also not forget the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with thier secret backroom meetings.It is further interesting to note that Mrs. Caldwell was a card-carrying member of the John Birch Society (formed by Fred Koch), whose views are actually in line with the cadre of mega-rich businessmen whom she claims to despise. I realize this blurb is somewhat off the track, but not entirely, for the problems Taylor Caldwell writes about are with us today more than ever. It just seems hypocritical that she would join a society whose beliefs ensure the social darwinism of let the rich take all and run roughshod over the poor. All of which is hardly in sync with her professed Christian beliefs."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"A DEAR FRIEND RECOMMENDED THAT I READ THIS BOOK .

I've read it something like 3 or 4 times already."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"I firmly feel that this book is amazingly written, and the views and plot are entirely different from many other historical fiction type books. It is in the time of a war, but it focuses on one of the most horrible things America has done. The prejudice against Irish immagrants, which included not hiring them, making them live in run-down homes, and forcing them to go back to Ireland as soon as they arrive on their ships. Joseph Francis Xavier Armagh is a captivating young Irish lad who will do anything to earn a dollar so he can finally give his younger brother and sister what they deserve. He embarks on a long journey to the town Titusville, where he intends to harvest black gold and make millions. He ends up working for the prestigious Mr. Healey, and after many years of hard labor and amazing intellecual ability, he finally realizes his dream. He then owns a mansion that only one of the most wealthy in the world could own: and that's exactly what he was. Wealthy and feared, he is determined to make his handsome first-born son the President of America. This book is wonderful.

I am not through with the book but Ms. Caldwell's writing is excellent. The main character, Joseph Armaugh, is an Irish immigrant who becomes a wealthy and powerful man in America. However, he is a grim distrustful character who I neither like nor would I ever like to know.All of the book's characters are well drawn and there are many interesting subplots.This is a very serious, deep novel and it will keep your interest.

Her forwards always remind us that there is, indeed, a conspiracy and after being caught up in the first book of hers that I read,\\" the Devil's Advocate\\", I have become more and more convinced that this is all truly happening.The Devil's advocate takes us beyond this book to the future when the takeover has actually happened and all of the things that led up to it, which are happening right now and have been happening steadily over the last 50 years or so. It is remarkable that The Devil's Advocate was written in the 1950's! To me, these are not books of fiction!It is not surprising that this book and The Devil's Advocate are out of print!

He had goals for each person in his family, and was terribly disappointed when they had ideas of their own. His loveless marriage was arranged as a business deal and it allowed him to begin a relentless pursuit to make his son President of the United States.

Absolutely recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"Although it took me longer than I'd have liked to start and finish this book, it was worth the effort. This novel first came out when I was still in high school, and regrettably I have never seen the mini-series. Wouldn't it be great for cable tv if they'd have the Mini-series channel-rerunning all those old, classic mini-series and made-for-tv movies? Anyway, getting back to this book. Right from the beginning, it was very clear that Joseph Armagh was not a very likable character. I realize all that he'd been through with his mother dying while they were crossing the ocean(in steerage), leaving him with his younger brother and newborn baby sister. Finally reaching New York, they(the Irish)were turned away, sent off to Philadelphia where Joseph eventually learned of the death of his father. Broke and starving, Joseph puts the children in a Catholic orphanage &amp; does whatever he can to earn a few dollars &amp; feed himself. As the years go by he realizes he needs a fortune to survive in this country, and will do whatever it takes to build one. Coming upon a newspaper article one day he reads of men making money working in oil, all it takes is drilling equipment and determination. After making arrangements to leave the children at the orphanage for at least a year, he books passage on a train to Titusville and meets up with another young man named Haroun with the same idea. Reluctant to make friends with this boy, they find themselves squeezed onto the train like cattle, and without any seats they have to stand on the steel plates between the cars. Haroun slips when his foot is caught &amp; Joseph does his best to free him without losing his foot. As fate would have it they meet the very rich &amp; powerful Mr. Healy, who takes a liking to the boys, moving them into his home &amp; the rest, as they say is history. Both work for Mr. Healy, Haroun out in the oil fields &amp; Joseph in his office where he learns the business &amp; inherits everything years later when Mr. Healy dies. As he gets older Joseph becomes more &amp; more set in his ways, angry at the world &amp; not wanting to open up to anyone. The story takes a more interesting turn when he marries &amp; starts his family, but enough of my synopsis, get the book for yourself &amp; you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"I first read this book many years ago and have recommended it to many fellow readers who I belived would &quot;get it&quot;. This woman (Taylor Caldwell) was so ahead of her time! Remember how long ago this book was written! Yet almost everything she has fictionalized has happened in a similar fashion in real life!

So I finally buy the book in 2013 and find it amazing. It's not just a rags to riches story, although it is indeed that too. The characters are so lively and interesting. The descriptive language brings to mind an amazing story of environmentalism: \\"Though Joseph had rejected the world of men.....he could not be insensible to the beauty of the land.\\" The writer uses the most descriptive, colorful language throughout the book to describe the beautiful world we live on as well as taking us inside the hearts and minds of men who she surely believes will eventually destroy it.\\"The earth we abuse and the living things we kill will, in the end, take their revenge; for in exploiting their presence we are diminishing our future.\\" ~Marya Mannes, More in Anger, 1958"},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"Have been a fan of Caldwell for years and even though I saw the movie years ago - I had to read the book again!

We would love to show it to our children."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"There are two sides to this book, one is typical of the romantic pulp fiction style of the 70's, this is first the life story of Joseph Armagh, a destitute orphan who emigrated from Ireland because of the famine. His bitter experiences in childhood leave him cold hearted and in pursuit of money at all costs, and he achieves incredible wealth and power in America. His goal at any price is to make his son president of the United States. There was a made for TV mini series based on this story.The other more interesting part of this book though is about the control of wealth and real power in the world in the hands of a few. Taylor Caldwell has written an add on to the story that is a warning that the &quot;controllers&quot; are not fiction and were more powerful than ever. In the Captains and the Kings some historical events described are the US civil war, the presidencies of Lincoln, labor struggles, the making of Teddy Roosevelt, and immigration. Was the civil war after all just an event arranged &amp; set up mainly by rich European bankers for profit? Are all wars always set up by a handful of distant people for profit? This book really makes you wonder"},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"If I could recommend only one book, it would be Taylor Caldwell's \\"Captains and the Kings.\\" Here are three reasons.Caldwell's fascinating tale is filled with ironic, powerful, and unique insight into human nature and behavior. She will entice you into turning page after page without rest, until you reach the end of her story. Then you'll sit wondering if you really read all that, tempted to go back to read it again. Craftsmanship and story-weaving earns \\"Captains and the Kings\\" a place among the world's ten best books.Caldwell writes historical fiction with intimate knowledge and perception. Her readers often wonder if she actually lived through the times she depicts with her pen. It's been said that she believed that herself; many of her other books tend to encourage this idea. \\"Captains and the Kings\\" offers a vivid and unsettling view of an earlier and much different America, in a time that was more free and open than our modern age, but also more dangerous and a great deal more heartless. If you've always wondered what the term \\"nitty gritty\\" means, read this novel! So saying, I boost the book into my top-five list!Finally, this book has defined my experience with personal computers, the Internet, and Reality (tm) itself! After purchasing an Amiga 1000 almost twenty years ago, I found my way onto a BBS that feaured FidoNet forums. I began reading and posting on the \\"Issues\\" board. One poster commented cryptically that \\"Taylor Caldwell's 'Captains and the Kings' exposes how the Council on Foreign Relations rules the world.\\" I was driven (as if by an invisible hand) to the public library, seeking out Taylor Caldwell's book. I found a captivating, often dark story that gripped my interest in sinuous coils as its weaving, bobbing head rose up to mess with my memes. With her right hand, Caldwell uses her suburb writer's skill to dazzle and entertain, but the whole time, her Left hand is busy imparting knowledge and understanding of how things really work in this world. She administers her synergistic potion in just the right strength, proportion, and rhythm to assure that most of us who might never otherwise read about a \\"Conspiracy\\" lap this up like mother's milk. During the ensuing decades, I used the 'Net to verify what I'd read; and I learned a whole lot more.In retrospect, speaking as someone who has \\"earned a Ph.D. in Conspiracy Theory,\\" it's necessary to add a small disclaimer: Caldwell does not tell all. There are things she could not or would not divulge. But don't fret! If you've had your eyes on the news the past few years - and especially the last few weeks - you'll certainly discern the missing part. The late Sufi, Idries Shah, claimed there are times when long-hidden knowledge suddenly becomes available to one and all. We are living through such a time!Summarizing, Captains and the Kings is a remarkably well-written and captivating piece of historical fiction that will carry you back to an earlier and intriguing America at the same time it fuels you with subtle insight and knowledge and kick starts your thinking machine, proving once and for all that willful ignorance is the only real sin.I visited Amazon this evening to buy a used copy of this book for a workplace friend. So I dedicate this review of Taylor Caldwell's \\"Captains and the Kings\\" to Ernestine."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"Joseph Armbaugh was only 12 years old when his mother brought him and his siblings from Ireland to America to reunite with his father, who had come before them.

He worked with driven single-mindedness to provide for his family and he learned what is took to survive in his adopted land.

It's the classic rags to riches story. The main character is Joseph Armaugh, who grew up poor in Ireland and is finally able to go to America. His mother dies onboard ship. Joseph is determined to be rich, and of course America is the place for a determined, young, ambitious immigrant to acquire vast riches and power. It's also the story of how a few powerful men run the economic strata of the world. I also got the impression that this book is loosely based on the life of Joseph Kennedy."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"I first read this book aome 20 odd years ago, and just finished it again. The reason I read it again is the amazing phiosophical and intellectual insight into the humanities of man, along with the current politcal happenings all over the world. Taylor Caldwell will go down in history as one of the greatest authors of our time. I've worn out my dictionary, but I've enjoyed doing it versus the usual annoyance of having to use it. I also this believe this book should be a &quot;must read&quot; assignment in college. Thanks again Taylor.Michael Collins"},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"If I were marooned on a desert island, I would have to have this book with me! I read it in the 70s and have also enjoyed the mini-series many times over which starred the late Richard Jordan as Joseph Armagh. While it would be easy to draw parallels with the fictional Armagh family and the Kennedy dynasty, I prefer to think of the book as a testament to one Irish immigrant who found and then lost the American dream. The more disturbing aspect of the book (and one I always think of when a major news event takes place) is the presumption by the author that there are powerful men with money who control much of the destiny we call history. Do these men exist? Who can say? A riveting book and one worth more than one read."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"This book is one that truly stands the test of time. I first read it in the 70's as a teen, and it has stayed with me all these years. If you are a lover of historical fiction, appreciate bold, sweeping epochs, and are fascinated by human nature, this is a read for you. I love Taylor Caldwell's books, but beware if this is your first foray into her works, as she sees the world and people in general as very duplicitous. She can be very dark and brooding, and appears to have been a rapt conspiracy theorist judging from the introduction and the bibliograpy that appear in this book. Her characters tend to be quite black and white, but that of Joseph Armagh is quite complex and will be an endless source of fascination to the reader. Aside from the heavy handed political tones in this book, it is the saga of the Armagh family that will keep the reader engrossed. Caldwell weaves a formidible tale-one that is engaging, educational, emotional, and yes even a little frightening. I find myself wondering at the conclusion of this book: What if, in fact, we truly are at the mercy of the &quot;deadly quiet men&quot;? This book will entertain you and make you think!"},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"This is simply the best book I've every read. It has an appealing sense of uproar that grabs you from page 1, and it will not let go until you hit the last page. The violence and the change of vast fortunes will give you a feeling of power of a capitalistic society untold in any other book before. I believe in a small round about way, it is telling a story about the Kennedy dynasty. With the untimely passing of JFK-JR, recently it is bringing up many discussions; is there a curse on this family. Read this book, and you decide if is there a curse, or if this book brings back memories of this well know \\"POWERFULL\\" family."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"The world we live in has little to do with what we see on the evening news. A wise person values truth above all else, and is willing to search for it.This book will reward those who seek the truth. The true acid test of a person's wisdom is that their theories not only explain the present reality, but are accurate in predicting future events as well. Written over 35 years ago, this book explains how the world REALLY works. It's truth is validated on a daily basis by ongoing world events.I've underlined more quoteable quotes and pure wisdom in this book than any other work of fiction I own.A top shelf, dog eared, never give away classic."},{"Title":"Captains and the Kings","review":"The intrigues and and captives of this incredibly epic saga take place mostly in the 19th century, and it is a tale of a man named Joseph Armagh, an Irish man. Joseph has come as a poor immigrant child to this great United States of America, only to find it is not a land of opportunity at all, unless of course, you have money, which is his one and only goal. Money rules and supremes all in this terrific tale of one man who will settle for nothing less than the country he has adopted, but who finds that perhaps in the end, honesty and integrity might not have been a bad idea after all."},{"Title":"King: The Photobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"I have many photography books in my personal collection, and I have several on the civil rights movement, but this book is by far the best I have seen. The book combines the work of several photographers - including Alfred Eisenstadt, Charles Moore, Henri Cartier Bresson, plus some lesser knowns - who have been individually recognized for their own work.

Beginning from the early childhood of Mr. King to his untimely death,Adelman's photographs depict a very young King with his family. It provides insight into his his upbringing and illustrates the foundation that culminates into the life of the great civil rights leader. It continues to depict his educational pursuits and ultimate marriage to the lovely Coretta Scott.The books carries the reader through the voyage as a young King rises to prominence as a preacher, his continued quest for racial equality, and mainlyhis persistent call for agapic love in conjunction with nonviolence. Also, shared in this tome is intimate photographs of King's time spent with his loving family and information about King's life that may not be well-known.Although nearly 300-pages, this book capitvates the reader from cover to cover.

Stacey (strategic management, U. of Hertfordshire, England, and management consultant) has contributed for years to our knowledge related to organizations and management. His previous publications primarily served toilluminate the relevance of applying strategic approaches and complexity theory to organization and management in a rapidly growing environment (see for example, Stacey, 1991, 1992, 1993).His latest installment, Complexity and Creativity in Organizations, represents a significant step forward in his thinking by reviving systems theory and integrating insights from a variety of disciplines to create, he proposes, an original perspective. More precisely, Stacey combines his acquired acumen from the fields of chaos and complexity, organizational behavior, biology, and psychoanalysis to demonstrate how complexity concepts may be used to create a framework for understanding organizational processes and learning.During the course of his presentation, Stacey reviews current knowledge in the nature of human networks and complexity theory. He explores the place of complexity in individuals, groups and organizations. He also discusses the implications of applying the complexity paradigm for management research and practice.Complexity and Creativity in Organizations is aimed at &quot;consultants, and managers, those concerned with life in organizations, to new efforts being undertaken to understand life in nature.&quot; It is organized into ten chapters divided into four parts: Part I: The Complex Nature of Human Networks, attempts to demonstrate &quot;that human systems are indeed the kind of system that the science of complexity deals with.&quot;Part II: The Science of Complexity, reviews literature on &quot;the dynamics of deterministic feedback networks,&quot; and explores how some &quot;scientists have come to understand adaptive feedback networks.&quot;Part III: Mapping the Science of Complexity onto Organizations, &quot;seeks to locate the space for novelty in human systems and explore the process of evolution in that space.&quot;Part IV: Implications of Complexity Theory for Organizations, attempts to illustrate that by adopting the complexity perspective, our understanding of organizational life is &quot;completely different from today's dominant frame of reference.&quot;It includes a brief glossary; some expected references; and an index appropriate to the depth of this work.This book is well intended, but falls short of stated goals and purpose. This reviewer was unable to discover sufficient value in Stacey's recent contribution to merit its recommendation. A genuine disappointment considering his earlier, value-adding writings.Stacey's Complexity and Creativity in Organizations fails in areas ranging from the timeliness of his information--it is out dated; to lack of contribution--it's an unfortunate attempt to repackage existing knowledge; to coverage and depth of his subject; to the tone and presentation of the work.His writing style and tone are that of lecturer dealing with elementary school students as he avidly invokes the royal &quot;we&quot; to connect with his readers. He offers paragraphs of immoderate length, some consisting of one sentence. (This reviewer became discouraged trying to decipher some sentences ranging from seventy to ninety-five words. She had to edit them into four or five sentences so she could follow his points. Points which, when understood, were not worth the editorial effort.)As a combined example of &quot;we&quot;-ness in a two sentence paragraph beginning with a ninety-five word sentence advancing too many concepts at once, &quot;let us&quot; consider the following.We have now mapped the novelty onto organizations, and we have found . . . nonlinear feedback system: . . . phase transition . . . stable and unstable zones . . . control parameters . . . at a critical point . . . the edge of system disintegration in which paradox is sustained . . . archetypical behaviors are actualized . . . creative destruction.This is followed by a 33 word sentence which includes two &quot;we&quot;s and the phrases &quot;peculiarity of human dynamics of anxiety-inspiration,&quot; &quot;individuation-conformity,&quot; &quot;leadership-followership,&quot; and &quot;participation-observation render mapping invalid (page 183).&quot;This reviewer places part of the blame for Stacey's presentation on the publisher who seems to have been remiss in the discharging of editorial responsibilities.Stacey may also confuse some by not offering comparable terms from different fields. Those less inter-disciplinarily trained may not recognize, for example, that the term &quot;Shadow system&quot; (to which he has apparently developed a fondness owing to its usage every few pages), is not discernibly different from the concept of &quot;Informal organization&quot; which he does not mention, but is often speaking about.While his book is presented as inter-disciplinary in nature, me thinks and &quot;feels&quot; that Stacey's study of psychology and psychoanalysis have overly influenced his writing. He frequently discusses &quot;how we feel&quot; or &quot;feelings&quot; in relationship to how consultants might analyze a complex organizational situation.His current writing is rich in banality and incomparable comparisons. My personal favorite is when he compares schools of psychology. In one paragraph, he discusses with equal fervor the work of Berne, Freud and Jung. Specifically, he discusses Transactional Analysis (TA) brought to you by Berne in Games People Play. TA was never much more than a popular 1960s parlor game. And Games People Play primarily served as the textual reference to inform the Friday night pop-psychological critiques bandied about by those who had one too many beers. Stacey then proceeds to Freud as relates to anal retentive, anal explusive and orally fixated scripts; and to Jung as it relates to personal archetypes and personal behaviors activated by specific experiences.There are many other problems with this book which &quot;we&quot; do not have the space to discuss. Those deeply interested in chaos and complexity theories as applied to management and organizations are better served by examining earlier, and in my opinion, more informed writing on these topics. See, for example, works by Gleick, 1988; Waldrop, 1992; and Wheatley, 1992. Moreover, a search on the internet concerning chaos and complexity will yield much information on current states of theories, research and practice, as well as discussion groups and detailed bibliographies.Bottom line, this reviewer gained little from this book, but did have a few chuckles. Read Complexity and Creativity in Organizations at your own risk.REFERENCES:Berne, E. (1964). Games people play. New York: Grove Press.Gleick, J. (1988). Chaos: The making of a new science.

In the first 25 pages of &quot;At Home in the Universe&quot;, Stuart Kauffman sucessfully introduces more than Stacey stumbled over in 282 pages. If it's an organizational perspective you want, buy Margaret Wheatley's stuff."},{"Title":"Complexity and Creativity in Organizations","review":"Organizations are adaptive structures that respond creatively to changing circumstances. This responsive evolution takes place on an official, surface level, and also on a deeper, personal level composed of interactions between people. So says Ralph D. Stacey, who combines insights from psychoanalysis, behavioral research, the new science of complexity and other disciplines to suggest ways for your organization to become better at learning and adapting. While the basic concepts of complexity theory presented in this book are steadily gaining popularity, the actual complexity of the book's content might make it difficult for non-experts to follow. Although the book's tight organization keeps chaos at bay, some of the language might leave you at \\"the edge of disintegration.\\" Nevertheless, we at [...] strongly recommend this book to executives and managers looking to build a theoretical foundation for their organizational approach, in addition to the many academics who will appreciate its systematic explanation of the organizational consequences of systems thinking."},{"Title":"Complexity and Creativity in Organizations","review":"Stacey did a good job applying chaos theory to business in this book. He develops a very convincing and interesting conceptual framework for organizations in the future. Although the book mainly focuses on theory, he does provide some practical guidelines and case studies. He repeats the theories quite often and thus, the book is especially appropriate for students who really want to get the jist of the theory. If you read it for fun, all these repetitions might become tedious. All in all, a great book!"},{"Title":"Complexity and Creativity in Organizations","review":"This book is really good to give the background for using the principles of complex systems in human organisations. It covers the principles of complex adaptive systems but acknowledges that human systems are CAS, but have some extra qualities that need to be taken into account. humans have emotions, feels anxiety, have power dynamics etc. Ralph Stacey covers the topic well. The book is getting a bit old in the rapidly changing field of complexity but remains as a good foundation"},{"Title":"Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)","review":"Here is another book of philosophy lectures with no index. The Contents has a lot of section number and titles, but the possibility of some confusion is already obvious in the title for section 3, &quot;The significance of the first part of the system with regard to the designation of both its titles.&quot; (p. v, pp. 17-26). This still relates to the early part of the Introduction before &quot;Preliminary Consideration&quot; (p. v, pp. 32-42), which consists of section 5, &quot;The presupposition of the Phenomenology: Its absolute beginning with the absolute.&quot; If this seems excessive in the substitution of words for whatever this series of lectures is supposed to be about, there is a little chart of the basic Phenomenology-system at the bottom of page 7 which shows how Part I of Hegel's philosophy, his book, PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, is merely an introduction to the Encyclopedia-system, which Hegel originally called Part II, before it was written, but which was divided in three parts, Logic, Philosophy of Nature, and Philosophy of Spirit, in the Encyclopedia which included Phenomenology of Spirit as merely &quot;The second section of the first part (subjective spirit)&quot; (p. 7) of the three main divisions included &quot;in the transformed system of philosophy.&quot; (p. 7). Heidegger admits that this is a very philosophical move:&quot;But should one not say then that Hegel already at the beginning of his work presupposes and anticipates what he wants to achieve only at the end? Certainly this must be said. Indeed, whoever wishes to understand anything of his work must say that again and again. The attempt to diminish this \`fact'--as we would like to call it--show, furthermore, how little this work has been understood. . . . For it pertains to the essential character of philosophy that wherever philosophy sets to work in terms of its basic question and becomes a work, it already anticipates precisely that which it says later.&quot; (p. 30).These lectures on Hegel's first major work &quot;constitutes the lecture course given by Heidegger at the University of Freiburg during the winter semester of 1930/31. The German edition, edited by Ingtraud Goerland, was published in 1980 by Vittorio Klostermann Verlag.&quot; (p. viii). Normally publication dates matter little in philosophy, and the English translation did not appear until 1988, but the publication in German in 1980 might be considered an answer to specific questions raised by hotshot American philosopher and Princeton professor Walter Kaufmann, near the end of his life, who published a three-volume set in 1980 called Discovering the Mind, after some of the ideas were presented in 1974 and the first draft was completed in 1976, in which Hegel was considered too rushed to be considered philosophical: &quot;especially in his first book he came to write at such a pace that he put fleeting thoughts and doubtful notions down on paper and then had to send them to the printer without any opportunity to rethink what he had written.&quot; (DM, V. I, pp. 255-256). Volume II made the same points regarding the publication of Heidegger's first original work, only half a system in which &quot;Heidegger secularized Christian preaching about guilt, dread, and death, but claimed to break with two thousand years of Western thought.&quot; (DM, VII, p. xvi). Privately, in &quot;an unpublished letter that Heidegger had written to Karl Loewith on August 19, 1921&quot; (DM, VII, p. 170), Heidegger had written &quot;but it must be added that I am no philosopher, and I do not imagine that I am doing anything remotely comparable; that is not my intention. . . . I am a \`Christian theologian.' &quot; (DM, VII, p. 171).It should be obvious that Heidegger was capable of recognizing systems and identifying them quite easily. In HEGEL'S PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT, he has titles in his Contents that call out: &quot;the System of Science,&quot; &quot;1. The system of the phenomenology and of the encyclopedia,&quot; &quot;2. Hegel's conception of a system of science,&quot; &quot;b) Absolute and relative knowledge. Philosophy as the system of science,&quot; &quot;4. The inner mission of the phenomenology of spirit as the first part of the system.&quot; Such an understanding of systems is entirely philosophical, and Heidegger's defense of his BEING AND TIME in the final few pages of these lectures is entirely philosophical in nature. He was not supposed to be writing about himself, but about the philosophical &quot;problematic of \`being and time' &quot; (pp. 146-147) which previously flared up &quot;for the first and only time, namely, in Kant--people refuse to see the problem and speak rather of my arbitrarily reading my own views into Kant. There is something peculiar about the lack of understanding in our contemporaries by virtue of which one can become famous all of a sudden, and indeed in a dubious sense.&quot; (p. 147). That he could complain about being famous as a philosopher already in 1931, before any notoriety from political scandals could make the picture as messy as a German mentality would be a few years later, tends to show that Heidegger had a better grasp of philosophical matters than any of his competitors, of whom only Karl Jaspers, the famous doctor-philosopher whose books include one on GENERAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, springs to mind as truly great.Heidegger pictures Hegel's first book as a process of creeping up on absolute knowledge. &quot;Hence, the work ends with the short section DD, which is entitled \`Absolute Knowledge.' &quot; (pp. 32-33). This leads up to the main assignment:&quot;In this lecture course I presuppose such a first reading of the entire work. If such a reading has not taken place or does not take place in the next few weeks, there is no sense in sitting here: You cheat not only me but yourselves. However, the first reading is not a guarantee that with the second reading we really understand the work. Perhaps the first reading must be frequently repeated, which is only to say that the first reading is utterly indispensable.&quot; (p. 36)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"To rate with a star, or a hundred stars, what Rand has created, is like measuring Everest with a foot ruler, but for this purpose, Five Stars must do.The fountainhead is written with caustic wit that only a brilliant--free-thinking--mind might understand; definitely not a book for the corporate mentality that imbues America today.Rand has an uncanny ability to weave words into a beautiful mosaic; her characters come alive on the pages and dance before the reader's eyes.One character in particular, Howard Roark, is what all men should seek to become. Ayn saw this; why can't we all.I would like to exit with a quote from the book: &quot;We live in our minds, and existence is the attempt to bring that life into a physical reality, to state it in gesture and form.&quot;Read on!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"...as evidenced by the extreme polarization of reviews, if nothing else. I think it is Rand's best book. It is not as simplistic and long as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (which is a momentuos book, too). I have just re-read it at age 30, and liked it even more than 4 years ago. Contrary to what some 1 and 2 reviewers say, it does have artistic merit, but to enjoy it you need to accept the fact that it's incurably Romantic. It's rather black and white (even so, not as nearly as much as &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;) and her heroes are people as they should be, not as they are. If you can only accept a character that has the same weaknesses as you do and can't deal with an idealistic character with no weaknesses, you will not like this book. I got from it the feeling and appreciation of the incredible beauty man is capable of creating and living, and the uplift you get from watching a strong person laugh in the face of adversity and winning. It's unreal? So what? You see what's possible and worth trying to attain. I think the best way to describe &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a quote from the book itself: &quot;...a sense of joy. Not a placid joy. A difficult, demanding kind of joy. The kind that makes one feel as if it were an achievement to experience it. One looks and thinks: I'm a better person if I can feel that.&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book because Paul Ryan (Rep.

While the theme of \\"free markets\\" and laizzze faire economics\\" is the credo that all behaviour in a persons own interest is acceptable and should be free from societal interference, the characters are so flawed it is hard to be sympathetic, even if one beleives in the premise. The book is a \\"pudding\\", a \\"tome\\" that no one should be subjected to even if required reading because of academic requirements. I have also purchased \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" which I do not intend to read unless forced to or am paid to do it. Since neither is likely the book will simply be part of my Kindle archive."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read the Fountainhead in the Summer of 1961, when I was 22. I thought it was the best book I had ever read - until I read Atlas Shrugged. Even then, with no experience, I understood what Ayn Rand was writing about. Now, as I approach 70, I remember those reads as if I had them memorized, and here is my book report on the first.The Fountainhead is about the war waged by one, Ellsworth Toohey against the soul of the individual. Why he waged such a war, I have never been able to determine. No more have I been able to fathom the choice of crime over hard work. No more the choice of religious terrorism over religious tolerance. No more the atheism which is nothing without God. Better to be counted a Taliban who would NEVER bomb a statue or diminish a woman.Ellsworth is one of the great enigmas of literature. He would rather no progress than to have to produce anything that has calculable value to another. He would be the one who decides what the value is and who will posess the title. Ellsworth is a cheat, a liar, a prevaricator, a manipulator and, because he is all of that, and intelligent, he is Ayn Rand's example of the Great Progressive. His only decent characteristic is that he is not a politician. He is a carp by choice and by literary design.The Fountainhead is fiction, but be certain of one thing. Ellsworth is alive and still working as hard as ever. Sadly, most folks haven't got a clue about that. They don't see him everywhere the way I do. Well, here's the way you can see him as clearly as I. When you meet someone who justifies mediocrity in anything, look carefully, and you will see Ellsworth as himself or in drag. Once you get his message, you will understand and 'objectivise' his universal presence. Ayn Rand wrote about the ease with which the mass of non-geniuses, to which most of us belong, can be led to believe that those with ability are to be channeled into endeavors of value to us. We are led to be social workers rather than engineers by insuring that the least trouble with math during elementary school is an excuse to shunt someone to non-quantitative employment. The bright are separated, because we don't want them to be bored, but they are bored anyway. They do not even have the challenge to help their less able classmates, because they have been isolated in another track. Children are labeled by their academic performance in K-4. Parents lobby for quick advancement for THEIR offspring who are, naturally, the best and the brightest is neither in or for their best interests and futures. Everyone has to have the opportunity to be the best that s/he can be, so everyone goes unprepared. Ellsworth and mediocrity. Those who can analyze Ayn Rand by the power of her character constructs do NOT dare go near her philosophy. Her philosophy is the philosophy of clear, and brutal, honesty. She would rather that the education that has devolved so surely to the medi-ochre, be redesigned, instead, to teach all knowledge to students who may need to measure, divide or imagine, as well as they can learn, by the hands and minds of those who understand the fundamentals of what it is they now only pretend to teach. Of least concern in one's education should be what the teacher thinks. Rather, the measure of a good education is the degree to which a student learns to think with objectivity/clarity and individuality. Ayn Rand is bemoaning the progressive creation of the eternal, unthinking, mob. As fiction, it may have the weakness of too much crystallized truth. As fiction, the strength of The Fountainhead is that Ayn Rand captures us all in her stark characters. She has an agenda, and she presents it in a timeless manner. Why else are folks still calling her names and characterizing her nature rather than discussing her thesis? Her FICTION is not set in any past, nor any future. Her story is set in the now. It is always relevant in the NOW. No less so than when I was 22. If you want to discuss a theory of mine, try the following. There are more communists/socialists in Burbank, CA than in the whole of the Czeck Republic (past CR president) - US versions of the Taliban, too. Don't deny it unless you have evidence to the contrary, such as, are there more male or female mud wrestlers in the USA? And, how many of the Abu Graib miscreants were members of a religious group? My estimate is that most of them would ascribe to the doctrine of the Progressive; yet, in the way of the progressive, it was the political (religious) right that received the enmity of the mob. Even now, the progressive excuse for failure is \\"GW\\". Ellsworth is everywhere, and Ayn Rand was correct. We have a weakened system of governance, a weakened system of education and a weakened economic system. Current governance depends on the manipulation of the mob. Education creates the mob, and the bankers, the rich, and the religious are to blame for everything. The much more intelligent progressives will come to our rescue again. Oops! I suspect Ayn would strongly suggest that I either end or get back on point. So, my advice is buy it NOW, read it, and screw your head on properly as soon as possible! Best wishes to all, and \\"Hic Finis Est\\"!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A portrait of a man who has a vision and lets nothing interfere with his quest. Very inspirational. This book uncovers the phallacy of charity. To give a man something without getting anything in return, disrespects the recipient as well as the giver. Expect more of yourself and your fellow man. We are great even if we forgot it. Don't be a sucker."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book after completing Atlas Shrugged. I started the Fountainhead keeping in mind that since it was written earlier in Ayn Rand's career than Atlas that it probably was going to be less refined, and perhaps less articulate in its philosophies. I was correct. Atlas Shrugged in my opinion is brilliant, and it has assumed a position on the top of my favorite books list. However, Fountainhead i felt was rather boring in comparison, and far less powerful. None of the characters possessed any real charisma that made characters in Atlas Shrugged such as Francisco D'anconia and Hank Rearden so memorable. Fountainhead also lacks any truly poignant scenes, resulting in a mesh of seemingly meaningless events making up the story. Roark's speech at the end in the court case is the only moment that is comparable to the radiant brilliance of Atlas Shrugged, and for the most part is the only piece worth re-reading in the book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is absolutely a journey that consumes a tremendous amount of energy and a high level of thinking.Other critics are very correct that the Fountainhead does have an ideology that may not be suitable for everybody. The key to reading any book is to read between the lines and filter the author's own ideology, and then learn the important lessons that can be learned from the book.This book covers many areas in life that I was previously sub-par without understanding what caused it. Extracting one of the things said in the book:&iexcl;Most people go to very great length in order to convince themselves of their self-respect.&iexcl;&iexcl;Yes.&iexcl;&iexcl;And, of course, a quest for self-respect is proof of its lack.&iexcl;In my opinion, this book is for those who have reached a certain level of maturity in mind to think deeply for himself (or herself). The lessons from this book would be significantly less worthy otherwise. For those in the 'other' category, it is likely preferable to learn from other sources and coming back a little later."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead has been my favorite novel since having been assigned to read it over 10 years ago. Since that time, I have read it over and over. I greatly enjoy the depth of the characters and the numerous interpretations you can derive from the story. In reading some of the previous reviews, I saw that some people mentioned whether or not they felt inferior or that the philosophy was essentially garbage. I believe that a mature reader derives pleasure out of a good story and does not just throw it down or scorn it because it mentions things they do not agree with. I disagree that Ayn Rand was trying to make people feel inferior, that is not at all what individualism is about. I have read all of her books and greatly admire her writing style and the passion which she conveys towards her beliefs. Whether or not I share those beliefs is irrelevant and you can enjoy the book either way. Please look farther and don't dismiss such a valuable classic so easily! This book is amazing and is one that should not be missed by the avid reader who wants a stimulating and compelling read that they will not soon forget! Thanks."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In her book the Fountainhead Ayn Rand writes one of the most compelling narratives ever. The story makes the book difficult to put down, while the underlying philosophies awaken the reader's since of self. I can not praise this story enough and although I do not necessarily agree with all of Ayn Rand's philosophies, I will continue to promote this book to anyone willing to listen."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many of the low marks for this book are from people that either did not read it, are incapable of understanding the material because they are projecting their own psychological dysfunction's and problems into it, or just too stupid and close minded to understand. The bottom line is that you have to think for yourself, and that parasites rely on your thinking and efforts to survive. Anything taken out of context can be used as a non-sequitor, which is to twist the truth into meaninglessness. If you read the book objectively, that is with a clear mind, free from bias, I guarantee that you will understand Rand's concepts. Yes, Rand did not live her life according to her own philosophy, and yes the Randites are rather rabid, viscous narcissists; but so are any groups of zealots. Look at the content and framework of her work, not her life. She was a narcissist, but she was also one of the most brilliant women to have ever lived. Many of our greatest geniuses were nuts and quite eccentric, look at Newton and Edison, they were extreme egotists, but it doesn't take away from their work, it has even been suggested that you have to be a bit nuts and an egotist to really be creative. That's just my opinion, I may be wrong but at least I think for myself and take responsibility for my actions."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Here is an uncompromising book that places the individual in the highest regard. Non-conformity and creativity reign supreme in her story. Ayn Rand's heroes (and heroines) spit in the face of the menace of collectivism. Fresh 50 odd years later, your brilliance is greatly appreciated, Miss Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"speaking honestly, (informal review) The Fountainhead is the best book I have ever read. It made me think in a completely different way. They say every person finds a piece of themselves in the things they admire.

Thank you Ayn."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read it at 16 and again at 43, and enjoyed it immensely both times (though in much different ways). Thanks Ayn!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is just one of the coolest stories I've ever read. To me (Gen-X male college-graduate), it stands out not so much for its interesting philosophical/political undertones (overtones?), but for timeless human-interest content penned in Ayn Rand's clean and balanced writing style. It's not verbose so as to bog you down in fluffy details, yet I could still richly visualize every scene in the book. The characters are very memorable, and Rand did an excellent job of extrapolating the consequences of the choices made in their youth and early-adulthood, throwing in enough twists and turns to keep the development of their lives very interesting, which is a very fortunate thing, because when you first pick this book up it will seem forever."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My first thought on finishing this book was &quot;it's a litmus test for the ideologue&quot;. It seemed to me that a great many people will find themselves either enthralled or repulsed by this &quot;book of ideas&quot; (that's right: it's not strong on characterization). As a result, they will be too quick to judge, and they will likely judge too kindly or too harshly.Rand presents a strong argument against a simple-minded collectivism... a collectivism that is probably more a strawman than political reality.Even so, as a critique of collectivist mediocrity, it is a success. &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is an intellectualized, breast-beating, defiant statement of individuality and individual integrity -- it can be a sort of a tonic for the soul for certain people, in certain situations.So, read it. Be provoked. Consider its ideas. Don't accept the &quot;conventional&quot; wisdom about this book, be it favorable or unfavorable.The folks that shriek the loudest about this book (for or against) are those that brought more into it than they took out of it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Sure the characters are idealized that is a major tool of fiction. I read The Fountainhead with no knowledge of who Rand was and knew nothing of her philosophy. This book is her masterpiece. Atlas Shrugged does not try to hide her massiah complex, and suffers for it. I could not put this book down, I missed a day of work because I called in sick to finish it. This book as a novel is better than every book I have read(except old man &amp; the sea). If you want a book that will grab hold of you and make you think, this is it. I can see how she may have created a cult like following. It took me a few days to adjust my thoughts back to the real world."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand's characters are critisized for being too static, and it is true, they are static, but purposely so. If all the characters in the novel went around contridicting themselves in all there actions, then the whole point of Rand's books would be loss. Roark can't be dynamic because he encompasses an ideal. If he contradicted the ideal, he would not be Rand's hero of the novel. I would also like to add that just because a novel is plain stated does not mean it is intellectually inferior to so called complicated novels. The whole philosophy is plain stated because it has to be in order not to contradict the philosophy. Any one who makes the above argument is intellectual inferior."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A wonderful book. I don't entirely consider Atlas Shrugged to be in the common range of fiction (its more philosophy centered), so I would have to say that the Fountainhead is the best fiction novel I have ever read. Howard Roark is the greatest hero ever written."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------THE FOUNTAINHEAD : I read it.

Besides changing the lives of untold thousands of people, this book is my candidate for the greatest novel ever written. The only challenge, in my humble opinion, comes from its older, big sister, Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; which belongs in a class of its own: mythical novel; philosophical treatise; blueprint to societal collapse.In &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; one witnesses the heroic struggle of Howard Roark as his vision of life triumphs over the anti-life forces that would &quot;Iron Heel&quot; him to a spiritual death. The theme here is the individual spirit soaring through life, in love with creation and the act of living.&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a masterpiece, integrating theme and plot; characterization; and writing craftsmenship together in one tightly wrapped story that will remain in the hearts and minds of the American culture as the Mt. Rushmore of a New Age.This book was originally rejected twelve times by major publishing houses. Quite recently, Modern Library, under the auspices of its editorial board, choose the 100 most important novels of our time. James Joyce's &quot;Ulyssus&quot; was choosen first, Nabakov's &quot;Lolita&quot; was chosen fourth, and Norman Mailers, &quot;Naked and The Dead&quot; came in at fifty-first. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; wasn't mentioned, nor was Ayn Rand. Some day people will look back at this -- as we look back at those who rejected the printing press, the car, the airplane, and the computer -- and laugh at the folly of those so blind.People just don't like this book; they fall in love with it. This is a great book to give as a gift to a loved one, for what better gift could one give a person, than the gift of their own life. Amongst other things, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was another benevolent gift Ayn Rand gave to the world -- the gift of one's life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rarely does one come across a work of such fervid ideological passion. Written on mild amphetamines by a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; who saw her family ruined by the Bolsheviks, Rand's immensely successful novel is less an articulation of a specific philosophy (as it is generally advertised) than it is a dramatic attack on Marxist ideas (collectivism, altruism, \\"dialectical materialism\\"). Her celebration of individualism is overranked and her notions of selfishness as a high ideal are misplaced. Perhaps if she defined more strictly selfishness within an aesthetic context, or used the term \\"self-centered\\" in its place (for selfishness implies a consideration of self to the detriment of others) her argument would be more palatably logical. We might also add that there is altogether too much laughing, smiling, inner knowing, too many speeches that sound the same, too much dialogue that doesn't fit the mouths of its characters, and repetitive, declarative syntax that absolutely CLUNKS. Nevertheless, this is a great novel for its dynamic spirit and its towering archetypal characters, which clash and collide wonderfully about. I first read The Fountainhead when I was eighteen, and in many ways I am still influenced by Howard Roark, the uncompromising architect and hero of this novel (the book ends and begins with his name). Rereading Fountainhead thirty years later I still find it compelling and even motivating. Rand was an atheist, but her God was Art, and her Satan was any system that organized against Art to protect its own mediocrity and power, an observation as fresh today as it was a century ago."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's novel introducing the world to her powerful concept of objectivism. The protagonist is Howard Roark, the ideal objectivist man, who holds himself to standards above those commonly held by society. He avails himself against medicority in the form of outdated schools, petty peers who get by purely on social skills, and a socialst organization bent on proving that everyone really is equal.There are three criticisms frequently made against the novel:1) The characters are one dimensional, lacking depth. To this I respond that Rand writes in the Romantic tradition, preferring extreme characters (whom we should strive to become) to clearly dilenate the battle between good and evil, rather than more complicated or in depth characters.2) The positions she takes are too extreme and unrealistic. For this, I suggest looking at the timeframe. It was the 1940s, and the US was just waking up to the horrors of communism. Coming out of the 1930s, the US could have taken a dramatically more socialist turn. As a wake-up call, this book needed to be stark.3) The rape scene is hardly becoming of an \\"Ideal\\" man. I have no response to this criticism, as it is likely true.Despite being perhaps 400 pages too long, and rather one dimensional, this still ranks as one of the most influential works of our century. Many silicon valley execs praise the self-deterministic beliefs, and even our Fed Chairman is an admirer (though he's backed off many of his more extreme beliefs). If you agree with the precepts, consider it fuel for your fire. If you consider Rand a crackpot cult leader, read it to better understand your enemy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read \\"The Fountainhead\\" when I was 17. I have re-read it many times in my late teens and early twenties, but did not return to it again until last year, in Berlin, at the age of 36. Well, a lot has changed in my life since. I guess in that sense, my own story is somewhat different than many reviewers here: Although I considered myself an Objectivist until my mid-20s, I fortunately took Rand at her word, and made up my own mind on issues Randist. So, even when the revelations came out in the 1980s of what a maniacal and cult-like figure she was, I never felt the sense of betrayal so many others did. Actually, I kind of felt sorry for her, and for the people she manipulated and duped. Life is too short to give and demand blind worship and obedience to some celebrity.Sum it up to say, if you're looking for \\"I read 'The Fountainhead' as a teenager, but now -- ouch, I can't believe what an awful piece of turgid nonsense this is,\\" look elsewhere, not here. On the other hand, those people are welcome to their opinions. Neither am I a dyed-in-the-wool Objectivist Randroid, who will tell you that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is the greatest novel ever written. When I was 17, I fervently believe it was; I don't now. People read more, they develop new tastes. So, for me the greatest novel ever is Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" But, that doesn't mean that I'm going to swing to the other extreme and deride it into the ash can.I agree with many reviewers that \\"The Fountainhead\\" is adolescent. But, it is not adolescent in the same sense that \\"Beavis and Butt-Head\\" or \\"American Pie\\" is. \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures that confused yet clear-headed sense of anticipation, loneliness, grandeur and fear of failure that make up the contradictory state of our teenage years, rather much like J.D. Salinger's writing did for some, Daniel Clowes' \\"Ghost World\\" does today, and Hunter S. Thompson's \\"The Rum Diary\\" did for me later on. It is rather revealing that many reviewers recoil from their adolescent fervor for \\"The Fountainhead,\\" because adolescence is an awkward, confusing and often embarassing time. It is fraught with heartbreak, social faux-pas and immaturity. But I have never felt the need to disassociate from my adolescent self, and this is why I can reflect upon this book more objectively (no pun intended), yet still appreciate it for its strengths.One of the hallmarks of this book's adolescent spirit is that it is a paean to individualism and never selling out. Of course, reality gives us all a swift kick in the rear, but I stopped confusing \\"The Fountainhead\\" with reality around the same time I started having to shave daily. There is no sadder a scene than seeing Rand's acolytes and detractors waging life-or-death battle over this book and her philosophy. It reminds me of all the rather more rabid history buffs reliving and refighting the American Civil War. Come on, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is fiction, Rand died 20 years ago, and no-one is scared any longer of Leonard Peikoff's excommunicating temper tantrums, so lighten up out there!The old cliche goes 'No-one has yet written the great American novel.' Well, in the sense that it must encompass all things American, no. To me, if a novel catches the _essence_ of America, that qualifies it. Sinclair Lewis' \\"Elmer Gantry,\\" Ernest Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" Stephen Crane's \\"The Red Badge of Courage,\\" Mario Puzo's \\"The Godfather,\\" all these qualify in my mind for that elusive title. And so does Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" captures the spirit of America. I loved it thoroughly. Her characters are larger than life, the message of being true to one's self, and not selling out, sorely needed today. Rand expertly contrasts the novel's hero, Howard Roark - an uncompromising architect - with the tragic Gail Wynand, a newspaper baron who, like Othello, is a flawed hero, and whose quest for power and domination leads him to almost destroy that which he loves most. Actually, I DID find Roark a bit wooden (but not as wooden as Gary Cooper's portrayal of him in the 1949 movie). Really, Gail Wynand is the most believable main character in this book, because he's torn by dillemma. His is a character of tragic dimensions, rather like Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane (who, like Wynand, was also based on William Randolph Hearst). When Wynand sells out Roark, it isn't a betrayal so much of Roark, but of Wynand's own soul, and this is why I cry for Wynand. Because of his basic fatal flaw. Wynand chose damnation over redemption, rather much like Michael Corleone did in \\"The Godfather Part II\\" when he ordered and watched his brother Fredo's execution. I can't countenance THAT being labelled \\"two-dimensional\\" or \\"cardboard\\" at all. It is the great tragedy of the story.Ellsworth Toohey is the story's Iago, a small, cunning manipulator who himself tries to use Wynand's greatness to destroy Roark. Because of Wynand's own fatal flaw, he refuses to acknowledge Toohey's ability to influence and control.I especially love the book's Roaring '20s and Depression-Era feel. Rand may have painted her heroes in romantic, Nietzshean brushstrokes, but her characterisations of her villains and non-heroes is sardonic and small, and owe's much to the naturalistic novels of Sinclair Lewis and the newspaper columns and book reviews of H.L. Mencken. Her desciption of Stanton, Mass. -- tight, manicured, exhibitionist lawns in front of crackerbox houses -- is right out of Lewis' \\"Main Street\\" or \\"Babbitt.\\"And, close your eyes - you'll see a Hell's Kitchen as painted by Edward Hopper and Roark's skyscrapers as photographed by Alfred Stieglitz.\\"The Fountainhead\\" may not be the greatest novel ever written, but it IS great."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I think the Fountainhead is inspiring and capable of actually changing one's entire attitude towards life. However, it can also be a bit damaging in that it makes unrealistic demands of its &quot;converts.&quot; One thing that really bothers me: Ayn Rand seems to believe that repressing all emotion, even the deepest pain, is &quot;heroic&quot; while allowing emotion to show is a sign of &quot;weakness.&quot; Howard Roark seems to be completely untouched, emotionally, by the setbacks and attacks he suffers. To me, this seems inhuman, but the message in the book is clear: He's superior to those of us who spinelessly exhibit emotion. In fact, in Atlas Shrugged, one of the good guys is actually physically tortured and barely exhibits discomfort! Does this mean that to be a true &quot;hero&quot; of your life you - almost literally - must not feel pain?I still think this is one of the greatest books ever and it influenced me deeply in a lot of positive ways. However, be alert for the flaws. Ayn Rand and her philosophy were not quite perfect. I spent a few years after the first time I read her works believing that if I got &quot;too emotional&quot; over a situation, or preferred a folk song to a symphony, that I had serious character defects.Still and all, I'm glad after all these years people are still reading and being inspired by her works."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"\\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand is an engaging, powerful read that totally captures the reader. I've read quite a few books, and my favorite novels all have captivating characters -- 'Fountainhead' is no exception. By the end of the book, Howard Roarke, Ellsworth Tooey, Peter Keating, and Dominique were all familiar people to me. I hurt for Howard, found myself sympathizing with Peter, and slowly nursed an overwhelming dislike for Ellsworth. These characters really come alive, and are rendered in absolutely beautiful prose. I simply could not put this book down.It's true that 'The Fountainhead' will make you see things differently when reading it and shortly after. However, once the worldview wore off, I started seeing the flaws of this work, and especially after I started reading the follow up, 'Atlas Shrugged'. While Howard really is a hero in this novel, Ayn Rand's view towards the 'unwashed masses' can become quite tiresome. Rand wrote that she often saw herself as seperate from the rest of society, along with her husband, and one does not have to look far to see that she obviously sympathized with Howard. However, this rather elitist perspective can wound as well as illuminate, and her constant barrage of insults against uncultured humanity reveals itself to be rather unattractive once the book's aura wears off. It's rather revealing that Rand never writes of children, or humor, or real satisfaction: her perspective truly was rather unique.I can't vote this anything other than five stars. It's a true classic. Rand saw the world in a very unique way, and while in some ways it might detract, it overwhelmingly give the book the powerful vision that makes it a classic. Pick it up."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When I read this book about 8 years ago it completely rocked my world. Is it realistic? No. Does Rand over-simplify the world into mere black & white? Yes. Is it preachy? Certainly.Now I can see how these aspects of it would turn off alot of readers, but I think the thing that still makes it a masterpiece is that it is such a unique outlook. Howard Roark is the ideal hero of anyone who tries to swim against the stream in their art, business, etc. His attitude is not one that you could live by on a day to day basis, and yet, it is a refreshing outlook because the creation is coming from within.Although Rand oversimplifies the good/evil dichotomy to the extreme, it still works in this book. It is not trying to be the real world, and yet many of the things you see in this book will certainly remind you of the real world.There are certainly alot of Peter Keatings in the world. People who are afraid to think for themselves, or take a stand. Sadly we often knock down the visionary Roark's of our world.Anyways, read it for your self and see what you think. This book is an inspiration to me and I've read it about 5 times. It certainly has it's flaws (like Dominique), but all in all, if you like a good root for the underdog story, this is about as good as it gets.Also, from a literary standpoint I think it is pretty masterfully written.Howard Roark laughed."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This reviewer needs to reread the book and try not to skip those long speeches which, like it or not, contain the real kernels of the philosophy.This reviewer says that Rand would approve of child molestation because it is 'selfish'. No. It is not at all selfish acording to the Randian definition of selfishness. She never advocated self-indulgence or sexual promiscuity or sexual deviance of any kind. Selfishness is more akin to self-reverence and self-esteem - literally 'holding yourself in high esteem'. The violation of another's rights ( certainly a child's rights) would make a person unable to claim one's own rights. This is fundamental.This reviewer rants about capitalism and communism 'requiring an elitist undemocratic government'?? What?This reviewer says that 'the things necessary for success'..'just happen randomly to some people but not others.'What? I am not a leaf in the wind. My attitude counts. Rand believed that a man is the product of his decisions and advocated that those decisions be rational and self-interested for the benefit of himself and for the benefit of those around him. Someone who is debilitated, delusional and foolish is certainly no help to himself, his community, his family or the world for that matter. The book portrays the rewards of 'correct thought' and the disadvantages(should I say horrors?) of wrong thought.The reviewer then rants about the non-existence of right and wrong and that all things are relative. He needs to read other books. Ayn Rand believed that man can discover the right thing to do using the power of his own reasoning mind. This reviewer goes on and on about minority rights which is a non-sequitor for this discussion.This reviwer talks about a supposed contradiction in Objectivist thought because 'it is OK to have collective national defense and collective law enforcement.'Of course she does - she isn't an anarchist. Governments exist among men to protect the rights of men. The Constitution then protects the people from it's own government.The Fountainhead really isn't about this though- Atlas Shrugged is really more about the Objectivist's relationship to society.Granted, the philosphy of Ayn Rand has some deficencies but none of them are articulated by this reviewer. The Fountainhead is an inspiration. Read it and reread it.I recommend 'The Virtue of Selfishness' and 'Capitalism;the Unknown Ideal'. Other non-fiction by her is also good, but some is hard to get through."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this book in 1986. It was the first serious piece of literature I read outside of school and it had a dramatic affect on me. I was struck by Howard Roark's unfaltering adherence to his values when society in general portrayed him as &quot;dangerous&quot; and a &quot;failure.&quot; While society happily jumped on the latest bandwagon without a second thought, Roark continued on his own journey even in the face of personal and economic tragedy.A self-proclaimed &quot;non-conformist&quot; at the time, this novel forced me to re-evaluate many of my beliefs. Was I truly marking my own path, or was I just conforming to a smaller group of outsiders? This novel does not attempt to prove that the &quot;good guys win in the end&quot; - so how far was I willing to walk my own walk?To this day, I am still asking those questions. I re-read The Fountainhead last month and found it no less profound than I first did in 1986. I can't help but picture Roark as the subject of Robert Frost's prose, &quot;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.&quot;In the end, whether or not one agrees with Ayn Rand's picture of man and his role in society, The Fountainhead will stimulate thought and discussion - and in that respect, this novel serves its social purpose."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You can tell what I thought of this book by how many stars I gave it. So this review is written more to the people who gave it one star. It seems to me that the people who don't like this book need to reread it and pay attention to the characters such as Toohey and Keating and see if perhaps they relate to these people. To say this book can get boring is a fair statement. Any book that's 700+ pages gets boring in places. To say it's evil is plain stupidity. The people who despise this book and Rand's ideas are scary, to say the least. Altruism is a very scary thing. This book is great because it conveys the virtue of being yourself. It's not about one man rebelling against society. If you read it, you'd notice that he doesn't care about society enough to rebel. It's about society's desire to crush greatness because the public knows that it's something that they cannot reach. This is truely a great book, as are all of her books."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've heard of Ayn Rand for years, never read her in high school or college and found myself in a rut of reading non-fiction (educational perhaps but ultimately uninspiring in the godlike way). I kicked off my new plan to read more fiction with The Fountainhead and could not have made a better choice. This is a book that I had always feared would be long, dry, \\"good for you\\" - but au contraire! As a writer and television producer the struggles of Roark and the lethargy of Keating really struck home and made me consider many of my own artistic challenges in a commercial world. The book reads like a good screenplay - fast, furious, and unforgettable. I found myself reading only a page or two at the time as the book came to an end, because I had grown so familiar and happy to have these characters in my life and informing my own humanity through their actions and choices.Life changing? I suppose so - I find myself thinking often of Howard Roark and Peter Keating (though not so much of Dominique Francon - her character is surprisingly the least human/developed in the novel, surprising considering that Ayn was a lady).I've also never heard the concept of humanism expressed this way before - it turns the accepted idea of \\"good humans\\" as those that \\"do unto others\\" on it's head and makes you realize that if we are all truer to our core selves, we wouldn't need \\"doing unto-ing\\".Read it.

With the encouragement of a friend, I recently finished it. I'm glad I did and don't understand why the book didn't interest me earlier. The character development in THE FOUNTAINHEAD is far superior to ATLAS SHRUGGED.I have seen the film GONE WITH THE WIND (GWTW) an uncountable number of times. I decided to read the book and learned that the book is better than the film. Like GWTW, I saw the film THE FOUNTAINHEAD prior to reading the book. UNlike GWTW, the acting in THE FOUNTAINHEAD is terrible. Although Gary Cooper was captivated Rand's theoretical perspective, he was not acting, he merely read the lines. Like GWTW, the book version of THE FOUNTAINHEAD is far superior to the film. As I was reading THE FOUNTAINHEAD, I found myself realizing that I had seen the Dominique character in the past. It took a long time, but in a slow unfolding series of page-turns, I came to the realization that Dominique shared many of the psychological characteristics of Scarlett O'Hara (bi-polar, in particular). Since there are too many similarities to be a mere coincident, I think that Rand subconsciously used the Scarlett character. For example, both authors glorify the raping of these women. On a personal level, I found the raping description distressing. Since our cultural attitudes toward rape have changed, I suspect that if Mitchell and Rand were writing today, they would drop the rape scene. The similarity becomes more obvious if one reads the 50th anniversary edition where Rand's original notes are included in the appendix. However, the parallel between Howard Roark and Rhett Butler are not as clear cut.I find Ian Rand's work a wonderful paradox! Although her religious belief structure is identical to Karl Marx, her intellectual pathway takes a different direction. Listening to her interviews and reading her biography, one learns that she detested communism. However, both her novels (ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD) address state-controlled capitalism. That's far from Communism, that's Fascism. It is not surprising to learn that Rand had little intellectual insight into Fascism. Giovanni Gentile didn't write A DOCTRINE OF FASCISM until after Rand completed graduate school. Her novels articulate the application of the framework presented in her academic works. She doesn't acknowledge that Communism is an honest portrayal of an economic philosophy. Communism does NOT endorse a free market; not even a state-controlled free market! Fascism is more insidious and deceptive because it embraces capitalism without a true free market. Within a Fascism structure, the state-controlled economy is regulated to enable the rich to become richer (except Jews). Pragmatically, the government must have the support of the wealthy. Sound familiar? If Rand was born 15 years later, her books would have been richer and her theories more sound. I wish she was writing today.After reading ATLAS SHRUGGED and THE FOUNTAINHEAD (and other academic stuff), I don't understand how contemporary right-wing conservatives can envision Rand as their intellectual fountainhead.

Now I have read both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and have become a fan. Some of the long diatribes of her \\"Rationalism\\" philosophy can grow a bit dry and redundant, but I found that I could leave them for a moment and skip forward to the main story line, then return without losing the meaning of the philosophical statement."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have just finished reading the book and I was confused most of the time. Some of the time I would wonder why Roark did not just go into a blinding rage and strike everyone who hated him. But I felt connected to him when he was put on trial. He spoke the truth and others lied to destroy his reputation. Dominique loves and hates him for reasons of her own that no one I know has been able to fathom. That just goes to show you, you can't ever trust women and their emotions. Keating, on the other hand, knew nothing about his profession, he knew only what other people have shown him and told him.The book kept going between at least five different characters and they each had their own woes and blows, but Ayn Rand knew what she was doing when she wrote this book, she probably researched architecture and business, both the good side and the ugly side. She gives you an okay background on some of the \\"main\\" characters and an intricate web of past memories for others like Gail Wynand.The obstacles of this book are society and their prejudice. They want to take over and swallow Roark whole, they never want to hear of him, even when it seems like his business is booming, they do not want to hear about him and his \\"ugly, atrocious designs.\\"Good book, but I don't know if I would recommend it to my best friend."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I received the book quickly and in perfect condition.

Too much detail and agonizing prose for much of the book (with a few minor exceptions), but then becomes a page turner during its last 100 or so pages.Really emphasizes individualism vs. collectivism, and Rand does well highlighting the evil of Ellsworth Toohey vs. the creativity and integrity of the novel's protagonist - Howard Roark. I think the book and many of its points emphasized could've been written with nearly half the length, but then again if it were that short, it wouldn't be classic literature, now would it?!!All in all, a good read, if you have the patience to make it through to the more exciting parts."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a great classic where you can discover something new each time you read it, particularly as time passes and you find yourself digging the book out again when in a different phase of your life.

I am not an proponent of the objectivist philosophy, but I found myself thoroughly engrossed in the protagonist and his passion.

There are a few things you must remember, before you bury your nose in the book.In her desire to present a complete view of life, Rand found it convenient to deny the existence of everything that did not measure up to her own tunnel vision. There is a danger in thinking that Rand's is an integrated philosophy. It is as integrated as laboratory experiments are, in which you ignore or nullify the effects of certain things. This is alright for experiments in simulated lab conditions, not in real life. Rand applies this inadequate approach to real world. Well, we can't expect any one system to provide answer for every thing, and the danger is in thinking that 'Yes! This is the way it is'.In Rand's writings you meet nice people who turn out to be weak in the knees, or have venom in their hearts, and rude ones, who turn out to be heroic. A combination you don't always come across in the real world. But conditioned to associate certain behaviour with certain others, you may find yourself barking at the wrong trees. Beware.Think for yourself. Perhaps this is the crux of Rand's philosophy. As in one of Rand's early plays, the hero admonishes a kid 'Don't let them steal your soul' (or mind or something to that effect). But generations of Rand's fans have been doing just that. Surrendering their ability to think to Rand. Leaning heavily on her writings rather than their own experience. Doling out Randspeak with an air of originality. Forming a cult, whose goddess is Rand. Just have a look at some of reviews in this section for examples.A proponent of rationality, Rand sways her readers not by reason, but by emotion. You may not realise it for the chains of such emotional appeals are too light to be felt, until they are too heavy to be broken. Nothing wrong in it. For any good literature appeals to the heart. But the problem is you may reel under a spell of emotion to deify rationality, or worse Rand herself.Rand's books have often been criticized, primarily because of destructive influence they have on those who take them too seriously. For you, however, there should be no problem as long as you don't suspend rationality."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" is now more than sixty years old, yet it retains its relevance and urgency, Judging both from fellow reviewers, and from personal experience, every reader of \\"The Fountainhead\\" emerges either loving or hating the book. I personally find Rand's ideas uplifting, and though her philosophy is not entirely of her own creation, Rand's presentation is compelling and her formulation is clear and striking. Furthermore, for all the controversy Rand's philosophy may inspire, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is undeniably an entertaining and well-written book. That Rand is able to demonstrate her fascinating philosophical views in such a well-written and well-told story should be recognized as a tremendous feat.\\"The Fountainhead\\" tells the story of Howard Roark, a young architect who is, as Rand describes in an early manuscript, \\"a man who is what he should be.\\" Roark is a self-contained human being, who lives entirely for himself-by his own definition of himself. Roark's buildings are considered both radical and offensive by many observers because he fails to pay homage to the styles of the past or to collaborate with anyone on any part of his designs. As Roark states at one point, he believes that buildings, like people, have one central theme or idea, and that idea cannot be compromised.The leading figure in opposition to Roark is Ellsworth Toohey, an \\"intellectual\\" with a particular specialty in architecture. Rand, in the same early manuscript, describes Toohey as \\"a man who never could be-and knows it.\\" I take delicious delight in every word Toohey speaks; he is one of the most evil characters every created, and there is no doubt he is extraordinarily good at what he does. What Toohey does is attempt to destroy the heroic, self-sufficient men by setting forth as the moral ideal those men who live by everyone else's standards but their own, who are mediocre and could never achieve greatness, and who submit themselves to the collective will.The conflict between what Roark stands for and what Toohey stands for demonstrates quite clearly Rand's philosophy: in short, she upholds Roark as the ideal. This contrast can also help explain why some readers feel uplifted by Rand's philosophy while others are horrified by it. The heroic in Roark can be inspiring, but also somewhat menacing; Rand is very clear that it is not possible for everyone to achieve the ideal demonstrated by Roark. This runs counter to ideas most Americans have been instilled with since youth: egalitarianism and the accessibility of the American Dream. On this basis, it is easy-as several characters in \\"The Fountainhead\\" do-to dismiss Roark as an egotist and to hold up Toohey's intentions as benevolent and charitable.As this is a book review, it is not my intention to argue for Rand's positions-though I realize that my admiration for those positions is plainly evident. I mention these conflicting views simply in hopes that readers will approach \\"The Fountainhead\\" more willing to allow their own values and expectations to be challenged, and honestly assess Rand's ideas. This book is able both to entertain and to inspire thought, and any reader should remain open to both."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read The Fountainhead as a junior for my English research paper. I was skeptical about such a large book, and my attitude toward reading it was likewise. However, after reading it the first time, I could not stop talking about the intense philosophy Ayn Rand introduces with Howard Roark. The idea of Objectivism, essentially the glorification of individual man's prominence, is intriguing and worthy of consideration. I love the character of Howard Roark because he is the perfect example of a man who becomes successful despite the restraining presence of a society bent on the normal. Our greatest historical thinkers were Howard Roarks: Galileo, Einstein, Newton, and the list goes on and on. This book, although fictional, gives proof to the reader that mankind has the desire to move forward regardless of other people. I see Roark not as a depressed and pitiful weakling who blames society for the downfall of man, but as a true hero among men. He stands out because he does not fold under the pressure of the majority; he does not bail out on the obvious answer when he knows a deeper meaning exists. Now, I am reading the book again, one year later, and I find myself underlining most parts of the book. The story line is filled with true-to-life situations; social darwinism, society v. man, revenge, desire, lust, and every other symptom of life the reader could think of. The Fountainhead is truly more than a classic, and it is worth reading time and time again. The more it is read, the more the reader knows about the idea of Objectivism and how accurately it pertains to the life of mankind. This is definitely a five-star reader, and I encourage everyone to give it a look."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I bought a copy of The Fountainhead at a used bookstore. At the time I had never even heard of Ayn Rand. After reading The Fountainhead I began searching for information about her and was surprised to find how prolific she was. Most people either love her or hate her; no middle ground. Rand has been much criticized for events in her personal life. Let me just say that if all philosophers were discredited on such grounds, there would be few who could withstand such scrutiny. Human beings aren't perfect. Rand's mistakes in her personal life do not detract from her brilliance. Her support of logic over emotion is just plain good sense. She encourages everyone to be self-sufficient and to base their decisions on reason rather than blindly accepting what others would tell you is right based on their own agenda. However, don't take my opinion or that of anyone else. Simply read the book for yourself and draw your own conclusions. Even if you don't agree with Rand's philosophy, the story is riveting. But I must say that the validity of her ideas is illustrated every night on the six o'clock news! Since reading this book I have viewed politics, philosophy, and human relations in an entirely new light."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book before I knew anything about Ayn Rand or her philosophy and I absolutely loved it. Roark earns his self-esteem through excellent work. Therefore, he rightly refuses to compromise his work for those who are less talented or have less integrity.These ideas may be difficult for some readers raised in our current culture where self-esteem is bestowed, rather than earned, and cooperation is valued over results. But if you've ever seen your work watered down with the input of your less talented colleagues or if you've been passed over for advancement despite high ratings because you're &quot;hard to work with,&quot; this book may be for you."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It makes no sense to attempt to separate the story of The Fountainhead from it's philosophy, because they are one in the same. I read the first page of this book while bored at a yard sale, and was immediately hooked. Rand's character introductions are excellent, and immediately give picture to the character. This is especially important because for the most part, her characters each represent a personality type consistent with a particular aspect of her philosopy.What I believe unique about this book is the singular challenge Rand had in crafting a novel that can stand on it's own as a story (it can), while each page advances the specific set of philosophical, political and economic positions that are the true reason the book was written. I imagine that other writers have sat down to write \\"the novel\\" deep within them, with major philosophical themes providing dramatic tension. Other writers, wanting to advance their own complex philosophy, would simply write a non-fiction book presenting themselves as gurus of this \\"new\\" way of thinking (whole sections of bookstores are full of such books). Rand's courage to attempt to write a great novel that is in fact a primer for Objectivism, and her skill in doing so is what makes The Fountainhead the achievement it is.Now, why only three stars? A couple of reasons. First, although her story arcs are superior, her paragraph by paragraph writing is often heavy handed, and beats her points to death. Secondly, the length and scope of some of the philosophical speeches given by her characters, particularly in the last quarter of the book, are simply not believable. Employing other writing techniques could have achieved this more believably. It's as if Rand hasn't trusted her own characters to carry the point she put them in the book to illustrate. The speeches do however, make their points crystal clear, especially Toohey's speech about collectivism. It's just that you don't believe Toohey would have made that speech, to that person, in that setting.I said at the beginning that it makes no sense to separate the story from the philosophy, and though I know I am now criticizing the philosophy and not the writing, here goes. If I read this correctly, Rand's \\"ideal man\\" is entirely self focused, does nothing he doesn't want to do regardless of anyone else's need, does everything he wants to do regardless of how it might effect others, places himself above the rule of law, commits several felonies, watches virtually everyone around him self destruct and leaves the novel entirely self satisfied. Rand calls this the \\"ideal man\\". Others might read the same book and identify Roark as a sociopath, just a very talented one who also possesses many admirable qualities. By the way, on a factual point, the idea of Roark being acquitted after admitting the deed in open court is ludicrous.Wasn't it Shakespeare who told us \\"To thine own self be true\\"? The notion of being your own man, and standing on principle is as old as philosophy itself, but Rand has given it entirely fresh treatment and perspective.One last note- my wife was reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at the same time I was reading \\"The Fountainhead\\". It took until I was nearly finished to notice that there are no children in the book. None of the main characters are raising the next generation of ideal men. I asked my wife about \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", and she said the same. I wonder if this isn't the fatal flaw of Objectivism- can you be true to Objectivism and be a good parent? Or raise a family? Or preserve a marriage where \\"the two shall become one\\"? Her two major novels show that her characters can't, and a glimpse around you might show that the \\"me\\" generation isn't doing such a good job either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Having heard that Rand was the poster-child for unrestrained capitalism, I wanted to read The Fountainhead with a mind to hate Rand. When I finally had an opportunity to buy a used copy, a 50th Anniversary Edition, it was shamelessly full of in-my-face self-promotion and Ayn Rand marketing hype. Before I could even begin to read the story, she had two-strikes against her.Inexplicably, I found myself liking the story, and even appreciating what Rand was trying to tell the reader through the voice and actions of her characters. It was also a fun read, a page turner for at least the first 400 pages. And, while there was a lot of tedium in the last 200 pages, the story climaxed fruitfully at the trial. I was climbing walls during Toohey's God-awful monologue in Peter Keating's apartment.At extremes of believability in the four or five main characters, there was Wynand on the believable end of the spectrum, and Toohey on the list of the century's least believable characters of any novel. I felt that Rand had to satirize the Collectivist in order to scapegoat him. Ellsworth Monkton Toohey wasn't just satire, he was a caricature.Keating, Roark and Dominique each had their shining moments, but Roark's didn't come until the end: Once, when Keating sold his dignity (yet again) for the Cortland Homes, and also at the trial. Before those flourishes of verbosity, it was as if Roark was unable to speak in complex sentences. If you had to ask yourself honestly, how was Roark any different from an idiot savant, you wouldn't be able to show that he was.Though her characters wouldn't necessarily behave like people you or I might know, Rand used them effectively to teach her little lesson about where America seemed to her to be going. As for character types, I know Peter Keatings and Ellsworth Tooheys. My disgust for some of these people in my own life actually came into focus after reading The Fountainhead.And, each of us have seen the bad and ugly side of capitalism, but compared with the prospect of losing individuality, creativity and the purity of our own excellence, I guess it is an idea worth defending. This review comes a day after reading that Osama is telling all Americans we must convert to Islam, and only then will he stop terrorizing us. Pause for thought.The Fountainhead was predictable at every step of the way. I found myself saying, \\"Keating will stab this guy in the back and get his job,\\" \\"Keating is going to ask Roark to do his work,\\" etc, from start to finish. There was one event I didn't know how it was going to turn out, and that was what defense Roark was going to use at his trial, and the trial's outcome. But, even Guy Francon, Dominique's father kind of gave that away when she and he were talking over the phone. That defense, by the way, seemed rather brilliant to me. First, it explained satisfactorily why Roark did what he did; second, it was a genius bit of psychology to cause the jurors to think of themselves as Creationists and not Collectivists. Put in those terms, who could refuse?Ironic that the Second-hand Man was so reprehensible to Roark, and yet he ended up marrying a second-hand woman. I conclude the whole dysfunctional relationship with Dominique could only be explained as Rand's sexual fantasy. After all, look at Roark: The strong, silent type. Red hair, sweats a lot, full of testosterone. Look at his antithesis, Toohey: diminutive, doesn't engage in anything physical, 100-percent cerebral.If you can read The Fountainhead as a novel without getting carried away by the Ayn Rand philosophy merchandising, then there is no reason why it should not be an enjoyable, educational read.Incidentally, I recently got to see some of Rand's world played out in real life. Two camps of people were promoting a new town flag, or condemning its artistic merits. The against side were invoking some pretty specious accusations, ones that seemed they couldn't substantiate, when questioned. A third man walked into the conversation from off the street. \\"Very nice,\\" he said, making a statement of his own, without asking anyone what he should think. Later, another woman was asked, and she looked from face to face, unable to form an honest opinion all by herself. \\"I don't know, what am I supposed to think? Am I supposed to like this, or not? I'm not a history expert.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"While I am by no means an objectivist, The Fountainhead is one of my favorite books. Why? Because its theme reflects and glorifies my deepest values of art.This is the story about two architects. One, Howard Roark, is a brilliant yet radical artist who wishes to design buildings strictly to satisfy his own desire to create. His uncompromising and unusual designs get him kicked out of school, and he heads to New York to start a career. Roark is pensive man, impossibly confident, proud, and never sees himself or his work in relation to others. He judges himself strictly according to his own values. Truly an independent man. He endeavors to please no one but himself.The other architect is Peter Keating. Keating is also a brilliant young man, but he lacks Roark's sense of assurance and individuality. Lacking self-confidence, he feeds on the flattery and can only exist on others' opinions. His designs are unoriginal menageries of past architectural conventions, and he must compromise artistic integrity for satisfying everyone else.The book spends much of its time following these two men and their careers. Keating meets with easy success thanks to his mainstream designs that make everyone happy. Roark often struggles to find work with his atypical designs, and his refusal to accommodate the desires of the client makes things tricky. The Fountainhead's objective is to show why Roark is the hero and Keating is the \\"bad guy.\\" (There's other \\"bad guys\\" that come into the plot later with their own complexities, but let's keep the review simple.)One problem is already evident. Architecture is largely comparable to any other business...it's about serving the customer. If someone wants a \\"lame\\" Greek- or Renaissance-style home, an architect isn't necessarily inferior as a person because he's trying to do good business.But this book is not about architecture. To me, it's about a heroic artist. Architecture is just the vehicle with which Roark's story is told (Rand could have made Roark a musician, or something). In any case, The Fountainhead makes Rand's case (that man's ego generates the desire to create) in a striking manner. I think the ideas in this novel have tremendous impact, especially today....You see, The Fountainhead, despite the faults of Ayn Rand's philosophy (more completely explored in Atlas Shrugged, another good book), is a powerful story because of its credo on art and some other themes that can be extrapolated through Roark. And Roark is a fantastic hero. Yes, in standard terms he's a self-absorbed sociopath (although he does get friends later), but he has many great qualities. He's honest, he knows what he wants, he's a genius, he's individualistic, and perfectly happy with himself. Is he the perfect man (as Rand would have it)? Probably not, but in The Fountainhead he's the perfect hero.Many have faulted The Fountainhead for being a naive projection of ideals, for its unrealistically black and white characters, and didactic writing. The didactic thing bothered me -- later in the book there's parts where Rand loses that narrative objectivity and gets a bit pushy instead of just letting the character convey the ideas and letting the reader see things himself. But as for the romantic and black & white elements, I think those are part of makes the book so much more powerful. The message would have been suffocated by characters possessing a mix of good and bad qualities. With Roark being \\"white\\" and Keating and Ellsworth Toohey being unambiguously \\"black,\\" Rand makes her message remarkably powerful.And I also think Rand's a great writer. She can get more out of a person's physical description than any author I've read, and the way she captures that lucid sense of greatness in Roark's buildings is pretty magnificent. As for Roark...I wouldn't want to be him, but he is a great hero. One that I'll never forget."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A friend gave me this book my last term in college, and when I started reading it I could not put it down. I read it in class, before work, and at home. After college, thinking about this book helped to motivate me and pursue my career with vigor. I wanted to be Howard Roark. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many people dislike Ayn Rand's writings solely for her Objectivist philosophies, but these are the people who can't disassociate Objectivism from narcissism. Taken as a novel, The Fountainhead is stunning. It uses a powerful story with clear but masterful writing to make the book engrossing and pull you along. Howard Roard, Rand's uncompromising hero, is a strong model for her Objectivist philosophies. He lives his life as an ideal, for himself and for no one else. He doesn't want to live off anyone else; he makes his own life. He is far from narcissistic; rather, he doesn't even take credit for his greatest acheivements. Instead, he takes personal pride and satisfaction in the things he has created without relying on others' praise for said things. How is this a bad thing? One should not want to live vicariously through anyone except for themselves. The Fountainhead is an amazing book, both as a novel and as a philosophical work, so long as one doesn't forget the basic tenet: that one lives his *own* life. That means that while Objectivism may be a guide, it is only the man (or woman) himself who decides how to live his life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have read this book once a year since high school.

The Fountainhead was another example of Rand's genius we so seldom experience in today's writers. Commercialism has captured and doomed any ability that most current writers might possess so it is impossible to compare The Fountainhead by utilizing the same scale of 2-stars, 3-stars, etc. that we use for other works; such comparisons just don't suffice. However, being limited to 5-stars, this is the level I choose."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand was a worthwhile, if lengthy, endeavor.Being too lazy to actually attack this by *reading* it, I picked up the audio version. I have listened to Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at least a half dozen times over the past couple of decades. If you know me you'll know that I don't give up the time to do this lightly. \\"The Fountainhead\\" I found to be somewhat more preachy (yeah, yeah I know. Is that even possible?). Ayn's never really been known for multifaceted and realistic characters, instead they all rather assume aspects of her ideology and remain focused in that manner throughout the book.About halfway through \\"The Fountainhead\\" I had considered not bothering to finish it (it *is* just under 31 hours long after all) because the characters really are not at all accessible to me. The motivations the characters espouse for their apparently sociopathic behavior toward each other (protagonists and antagonists alike - although which are which is sometimes not really obvious) are absurd to a rational human. They make sense only in Ms. Rand's relatively black and white conception of the world and the values that one needs to hold to be true to themselves within it.But I persevered and was gratified by the way the story wound up finally.I would say that it's worth experiencing this book at least once just to get a sense of Ayn Rand's philosophies. But I am unlikely to listen to the book again.For someone interested in a more entertaining and mildly grayer (IMHO) view of the world I would suggest \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this as a senior in high school.

They did not say enough. This book is beyond good or true or beautiful ... it is holy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is an exciting book that has a very powerful message. It can be read on many different levels. It can be read simply as a fictional story about an architect who overcomes obstacles and challenges. It can also be read for the deeper meaning of the philosophy behind it. There are also many different levels of thinking in-between. No matter what level you read it on, it is still a powerful book.The main character, Howard Roark, is based off Rand's perception of the \\"ideal man\\". Roark lives out Rand's philosophy of objectivism, as the main characters in other Rand pieces similarly do. Rand's integration of philosophy and exciting fiction makes for a good read whether you agree with objectivism or not.I gave this book 5 stars because it holds your attention, makes you think, and helps you develop your own views on life. While the book doesn't necessarily contain \\"action\\" the whole time, the characters and their personalities keep you turning pages. The book is written in a way that it doesn't force any ideas on you, but it lets you form your own opinions. It all depends on what level you read the book. If you read it as just another fiction novel, you'll come away with the same beliefs as you did before, and that's great.

Either way, that is soooooooooo much BS. I'm fourteen, and I loved this book. It's one of my all-time favorites, right up there with The Stranger and Lord of the Flies. The struggle for the preservation of integrity and self is very interesting. Everyone who read this book with me commented how &quot;Roarkian&quot; I am. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

There is a creative individualist with integrity. b). There are people who resent the creative individualist and go through great lengths to bring them down. This happens not only in this book but everyday in the real world. Ask yourself a simple question. Why are such unreasonable and painful things happening to me at my office? (Or at school?) How come I do my best and someone else (the most undeserving sycophant) almost always gets the credit? Is this person very persuasive, vindictive, and intimidating on one side and full of superficial charm on the other? Do you dread every interaction with this person? If your answer to these questions is in the affirmative, then you are interacting with parasytic personalities as described in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; like Peter Keating, Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand. This book will make you a lot wiser - and give you strength for your lifetime. Howard Roark will be a source of tremendous inspiration for you.

She espouses individuality and artistic freedoms over classical reproductions and socialism. The book is rich with metaphor, concepts and philosophy. Her characters are one-dimensional stereotypes that could be viewed as ideas, not as human beings. I found her depictions of anyone who needs a helping hand in society, as useless, less than human, unfit to take up space in the universe, to be extremely disturbing. Her glorification of rape, and her masochistic female characters saddened me. Ayn Rand was so fanatical in her beliefs that she neglected to present any problems with her point of view. She makes a powerful case for capitalism and individualism. Take what you like from it and forget the rest."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Firstly, it is not weakness to feel emotion; Roark is a passionate person. His perfection, as the ideal man, comes not from his suppression of emotion (he never suppresses an emotion), but from his lack of negative emotion.He feels no jealousy when Keating brags to him of his success. He feels no disappointment when the architecture community mocks his efforts. It's best summed up as Roark stated to Toohey, when Toohey asks what Roark thinks of him: &quot;I don't think of you&quot;. Roark doesn't need any outside confimation of his success, because he has not let anyone else define his terms. The point of the whole book is that it is glorious to be a passionate person, to live up to your potential. This is possible. But don't create your success on other's terms. Don't define yourself by other's standards. Don't lift yourself up through other's failures. Be who you are, not what everyone expects you to be, and you have nothing to fear.I especially enjoyed the number of people who wrote how this book inspired them in their youth, but as they grew older, they realized its shortcomings.I agree, it is much easier to realize the book's shortcomings as opposed to your own."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is certainly an extremely well written book. As I read the book I found it very mind stimulating and the way the story is witten intergrates a killer story with objectivist philosophic views.

If you are looking for a story that will change the way you look at the world and think I would totally recommend this to you. I plan to read this book many more times in the future because I believe I will get more and more out of it.Howard Roark is truly an insperational character and I hope I can emulate this person as I get older and never become an evil man like Elsworth Toohey. Roarks triumph should be an inspiration for all of us and I hope those who will read and those who continue to read this book will feel (exuse me think) as I do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;What you feel in the presence of something you admire is just one word-'Yes.'&quot;Howard Roark makes this statement in the Fountainhead. This explains exactly how I felt as a reader.In this Novel the main character Howard Roark lives his life for the right goal, happiness. Roark seeks only to please himself. Rand makes a strong argument that this is the way to live life correctly. Rand is one of the few authors to dissect the idea of sacrifice and explore its negative sides. Her stance that the indvidual is much more important than the collective or society is advanced through Roark's dialogue and interaction with the other characters especially in his dailogues with Keating and Gail Wynand.Rand creates a believable picture of Roark as a superman type character. She uses Nietzche's idea of the superman to formulate an explosive hero who drives the book. I do not feel it was a mistake to make roark flawless. Although many epic hereos are expected to have a hamarita Roark is the portrait of the ideal man as Rand sees him therfore he has no flaws. This makes sense the highest ideal should be free of error.I also think that there are more than three types of character in this book. To state that there was Roark Dominique and everyone else is overgeneralizing. Toohey is a believable character and a powerful man. There is really no reason to doubt or reject the things he says or does until his final discussion with Keating. Many of Toohey's statements and ideals are present in the comman man's ethics and value sytems. Many people believe that altruism and sacrifice are noble. The reason readers reject Toohey early is because Roark is made out as the hero and toohey attacks roark form the begining. Gail is another character who is developed well as the person who could have been but wasn't. Peter Keating is also an excellent portrait of the comman man. Dominique is an interesting female character she does not appear lovestruck early in the novel especiallly before and during Keating's pursuit of her. She seems the perfect companion for Roark. And it is intersting to see her character develop form the cold unexpected vixen to the domestic wife of Keating and Wynand and then to Roark's lover.To sum up this novel moved me it has and still does make me think more about why I do things. I think Rand did an excellent job with this book and I think it advanced her message of the individual over the collective well."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book causes controversy in every aspect, because it chooses to analyze the depths of the human psyche. As one of my dear friends put it, &quot;it is either the most or the least moral novel ever written, but I cannot discern which it is.&quot; After reading the final pages, I was transfixed... not by Ayn Rand's theories of objectivism (I disagreed on some points), but on the character of Howard Rourke, a person &quot;an end in himself&quot;. Rand's portrayl of Rourke left my heart both broken and healed. Buy this book. Make the moral decision for yourself about the quality of the book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Leaving aside for a moment the onerous philosophy that this book describes, this book is the work of a uniquely untalented writer. Rand's literary style is on a par with Jackie Collins: overheated melodrama, strong masculine hero, simpering female heroine (whose casual acceptance of her rape as Howard Roark's perogative as a man of ego is horrifyingly offensive), and lots...of...breathless...ellipses. All of which makes for a long, boring read. Philosophically, Rand's Objectivism has holes in it big enough to drive a Communist May Day Parade through. For example, if the ego is the most important aspect of a man's life, and altruism is one of the great negatives, what would she say about altruism for egotistical motives? I don't think Ted Turner is giving all that money to the United Nations simply for humanitarian purposes - otherwise, he would have been horrified at the magazine covers and long articles praising him. I read on the Ayn Rand institute's web site that she is looking for &quot;men of intellect.&quot; Men of intellect would cringe at the oversimplifications rampant in &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; which might explain why so many high school students, whose intellect is still forming, like this book so much. The only reason that this book doesn't get a lower rating is that &quot;We the Living&quot; is so much worse. To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is not a book to be dealt with lightly, but should be flung against a wall with great force."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Very old book but true to the day on how mas media can make or break (shape) public opinion."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"600 pages of set up, 127 pages of a point.

I am 50 and have just finished my 5th read of Atlas Shrugged. Alhtough one needs a break after AS, I feel that The Fountainhead has been peering at me from my bookshelf lately.THERK"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In this humanizing work, Ms Rand, with typical objectivity and lack of hateful editorial voice, explores a maligned and troubled member of modern society - the sociopath. A sociopath, for readers not studied in psychiatry, can lie without any rise in nervousness, has difficulties relating to or empathizing with others, and may be prone to violence. For obvious reasons it is a hard disorder to detect and indeed, many sociopaths are economically successful. Understandably, the sociopath has historically rarely been presented as anything other than the most cardboard of villains, and it is this wall that Ms Rand breaks down in her opus the Fountainhead, where - perhaps relying on the experience of an afflicted brother or aunt - she shows a heterodox, humanized conception of such a person, whose condition causes as much pain to himself as it causes him to, unwittingly, cause to those around him.Howard Roark is the protagonist of this tale, and the author never wavers from he strict first-person viewpoint, so much that she never explicitly mentions sociopathy. Howard Roark is - at least by his own dubious account - a brilliant architect screwed by The Man, and views himself as misunderstood, hardworking, and honorable. This is the supreme tragedy of the work - isn't full of just the smug self-assurance we expect but a desperate, burning desire to know of his own moral rightness. Possessing an adolescent's desire to buck the authorities, be original, and simply be a badass all-around, the reader also comes to realize that Roark, although he will never admit it, also possesses the child's need for parental approval of his being good, in the right. But since he does not believe in God and refuses to admit his vulnerability to any other person, he has only one way to turn - himself. Science has yet to validate whether complex psychological causes like this, or some defect of genes, or a chemical imbalance is responsible for sociopathy but this implicit explanation is certainly sufficient for literary purposes. There are overtones of paranoia as well, and some of the most heartrendering scenes involve his imagining his percieved \\"enemies\\" conspiring against him in the most cardboard of manners - \\"Blast that Howard Roark! His architectural originality threatens our plans for world domination!\\", etc. - while Roark's train of thought, as represented by the text, is unable to waver from this. Although he initially grates, the sheer annoyance and/or hatred one holds against him eventually gives way to sympathy, much like the sympathy any decent human being feels for Gene Ray, the troubled founder of Timecube.com.Unlike many of the clich&eacute;d novels which chronicle some person's descent into depravity, Roark is neither aware of, nor in control of, his actions and the harm that they cause, and so even as he proceeds from mere rudeness, to raping a woman, to blowing up a building, he is fundamentally innocent. He is not evil, merely just another victim of his own disease - for instance, when he rapes Dominique, he sincerely believes that she wants him to, even as she explicitly says \\"no\\" and he physically overcomes her. Milton's Lucifer invented elaborate intellectual justifications for his narcissistic rebellion, and so does the windy Roark - indeed, his most common act of unconscious sadism may be in the boredom-inducing speeches he is prone to give, and that Rand forces the reader to endure these is an ultimately rewarding experience as it personalizes the pain that he causes. But Milton was never so fully (perhaps for his own sanity; Rand has unselfishly cast off such concerns in pursuing her compassion for all persons) committed to the character, but neither does it romanticize or try to give crecedence to its narrator's justifications, and that may be why the Fountainhead is the righteous successor to Paradise Lost. For one of the most courageous and complex literary acts of the century - as well as a call for greater public commitment to the treatment of our most vulnerable brothers and sisters, the mentally ill, and if the tragic \\"not guilty\\" verdict was any indication, reform the legal system to ensure that sociopaths are not allowed to slip through the cracks of the legal system but find a safe home in publicly-funded institutions - I heartily recommend the Fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A surprisingly easy read for 700-odd pages, and a surprisingly easy read considering Rand's unique mixture of sexual and philosophical babble. This book is of course the manifesto for ultimate license of the 'artist',love song to the ego of the superman etc etc. so there isn't so much dialogue as rhetoric throughout. Plenty feisty ladies dislike Dominique (\\"I wish I'd never seen your skyscraper!\\") Francon's rape scene, but it doesn't bother me because the overall mood is, well, camp.The themes are uncomfortably neo-Nietzchean and right-wing for me, but I like the work of Lloyd Wright and Rand basically took him as inspiration. This preposterous novel is required reading nonetheless.* Check out the wonderful dramatic & oversexy 1940s movie version with Gary Cooper in it and phallic imagery the likes of which has never been seen since."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Certain people obviously can't separate the writing from the writer. I'd agree that Ayn Rand is a bit fanatical, however she presents an inspiring and unforgettable example of her philosophy in this book. Hard to get through at first but well worth it. It will change your life if you are open to it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's always great to see extremists of both colours arguing about Objectivism and Ayn Rand in general. Both sides miss the point. Although the philosophy of Objectivism may not stand up to close scrutiny, The Fountainhead and its companion Atlas Shrugged are interesting, inspirational novels that have a lot of value for an intelligent, dedicated reader.Some have pointed out that Ayn Rand's characters are cardboard; they are indeed one-dimensional, but each in a specific way. I viewed them more as characterizations of specific traits, and the technique (assuming it was intended) heightened my enjoyment of the novel.Others have waxed poetic about the long, self-serving, drawn out passages. This is also true, but numerous authors of classics employ the same technique. Who, for instance, could claim that the writing of Thomas Hardy is not a disgraceful example of butchered English? Nonetheless, his literature is still valued for its depth and meaning.I like the novels. They inspire me, they motivate me, and, yes, they give me sanction to be the self-centered human that I am. It would be a shame to not read for yourself and draw your own conclusions; keep an open mind, challenge the assertions, but draw your own conclusions. The works of Ayn Rand were and are popular with young, intelligent readers for a reason."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I will read it again and maybe again. Ayn Rand had a mind like no other. Her characters are perfect and each fits into her story to last forever. The story line takes one into the world of architecture leaving not only a feeling of talent, wonderment, beauty and glory; but also jealousy, dishonesty, manipulation and more. Above all, it is a love story and a story of great accomplishment against all odds."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I heard Mark Cuban recommend this...so I expected it to be great, and I wasn't disappointed. The audio version is extremely well read and expressed."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is another work by Ayn Rand expressing thetheory of objectivism. It is philosophically challeging attimes, but very easy to read. The book is about threepeople: a Modern Architect who loves his work more than moneyor himself, his friend who has not the necessary talent but,at first,knows how to give public what they want; and anewspaper columnist who perhaps understands everything thatis going on around, but uses his knowledge as he wishes,which is not necessarily the best decision. The Fountainheadargues that the worst kind of people is the &quot;second-handers&quot;,people who are ruling and supporting our society, sacrificingtheir inner self-respect for the sake of their outer ego.Overall, this work is terrific, it can be read both asphilosophically challenging novel and serious but entertainingbook. And it is great in both."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In this 1942 novel, Ayn Rand established the basic tenetsof her philosphy of Objectivism, with the creation of her --&quot;ideal'-- man, Howard Roark.

Using the principle, opposing in character architects, Keating and Roark, Rand illustrates her philosophy of individualism as god and collective thought as the downfall of man. It is well written, twisting the lives of several dynamic characters together in one man's final struggle for the freedom he desires. Roark is an architect, not because he enjoys money, not because he wishes to bring joy to his customers, but rather because he creates buildings that need to live. Keating, on the other hand is an architect for the prestige, borrowing every bit of any building he designs from past greats. This story, much like her 1984-ish Anthem, shows the struggle between the id and the super-ego. Overall, this book is worth reading- whether one is a capitilist or a socialist"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was the foremost advocate, and indeed the creatorof objectivist philosophy. Howark Roark is the champion ofevery man or woman who has ever felt beaten down by a systemcreated by and for self-serving incompetents. His unwaveringdevotion to himself and his ideals is an impressive testamentto Rand's philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book a few years ago, but I still remember, after reading the first twenty pages or so, looking up from the book and realizing that I was reading fiction. Every word I had read seemed so true that I almost forgot this was a book, and that I was not Roark. For years before I read the book, I had always wondered whether or not there were others like me, but after those twenty pages, I knew. I shake my head in disbelief when I read the other reviews that say Roark was cold, without feeling. I remember feeling the same soulfulness that Roark must have felt for his art. A central theme of this book is that one's art and self cannot be created for (by) others, or it is not art, or a self, at all. It's interesting that Objectivism goes hand-in-hand with creative art, which seems a much more subjective activity. I can't explain it, but as soon as I discovered true music (way back in Middle School), my life took a very Objectivist turn. I don't know everything about Objectivism (time prevents me from reading much), but after reading the Fountainhead, I felt that I would fit under the 'objectivist' title quite well. Even though, today I just use the title 'Brian.' I don't feel any need to learn more about Ayn Rand's philosophy, since I already have my own mind. That would be like reading the Khoran [sic] to find out I don't believe in that religion either. I don't have time, and for someone who already forms his own beleifs, I don't think it necessary to read why Rand thinks capitalism is great. I would love to read Atlas Shrugged, however, because I like fiction, and believe that is where Ayn's strength is (in her self-art). But I digress. The Fountainhead is a masterpiece by a true artist, about art. The book is obviously a work of the heart and soul. I suggest to anyone that feels alone against the prevailing trends and social ideals of the world, and has a surge in their breast that tells them to create and be happy, to read this book. It will only take a few pages to realize that you are not the only one out there. You may be so drawn into the book as I was, that you start to take the fiction for fact. For example, I was scared for the sake of others (wait a minute... I'm supposed to be an egoist) when I found out that it can be too late for a person to find happiness (i.e. when _____ showed his try at 'art' to Roark). I took that as fact, because all the rest of the book seemed to be true. I supppose Rand may have had more insight (or more like 'outsight') into the matter as I do, but I still hope for everyone that hasn't found true happiness, that it is not true. If you haven't found true happiness, I suggest trying this book, and trying to find your self-art. (Also listen to a good helping of Devin Townsend's music.)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've hesitated to write a review about this book - when I first read it I was enamoured and thought it was one of the greatest fiction works ever. Since then I read it five more times, and the first few times I enjoyed it nearly as much, but after that the veneer wore off.This is not because it is shallow as some claim, (i can read Wodehouse over and over) or because it is bad writing, but I think because her premises are just wrong.I still think this is a good book about a creative person's struggle, and a refreshing counter to socialism, but as I have gotten older, better read, I find her ideas as destrucitve as the collectivism she purports to have hated.And you really can't discuss this book without discussing her ideas, as the philosophy plays a central role to the plot. In reading her further, I found her radical atheism and indifferance to nature disturbing and as destructive as collectivism (as her discples are proving to be)There are some interesting, exciting parts- and her descriptions of how bad art becomes popular are probably uncannily correct.If there is one thing to take away from this book it is the determination of an architect (howard roark) to not comprimise his principles and creative vision. Those who would believe such a character unrealistic only need to read Ayn Rand's real life story of getting this book published."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Scary how this book seems to be set in the present (2009). A fascinating read and a must read for our times!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I found the writing to be very rich and fast-paced. The characters and storyline were, for me, gripping and exciting to the very last page. The love story is twisted, and simply delicious. The main characters, Roarke, Dominique, Tooey and Wynand are all peculiar and fantastic in their own ways.The main characters have very distinct roles and outlooks, which was also true in Atlas Shrugged. The are very bold, passionate about their points of view, and expressive. I greatly enjoyed them, and I'm sad now that I've finished the book (which rarely happens for me).The underlying theme of the independent spirit, and the fascinating observations the author has made about society really come together in the 4th part of the book. I found myself reading and re-reading the final monologues of the characters, reflecting on their insights.5 stars. I would recommend this book to anyone. I wish I could find more books like this."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"An interesting book that comes close to championing the value of common sense, but unfortunately veers into unresolvable philosophical issues. That caring for oneself is absolutely crucial for human happiness is obviously true, but Rand goes too far in praise of this fact and in effect weakens her argument. But I guess for an argument to be considered \\"philosophical\\" it has to worship idealogy over boring old reality. At least Rand had more common sense than the Buddhist reviewer. He, as I once did, values idealogy over his own experience. One doesn't really face the \\"truth\\" that there is no self unless one is sitting around reading a book about it. This philosophy pretends to embrace the transitoriness of life and thus paints itself as brave in the face of harsh realities, but in fact it is merely and intellectual fantasy. It pretends not to be intellectual but is really hyperintellectual: it places its own idealogy above the basic instincts, feelings, senses, and desires of humankind. I talk too much of this because I have experienced it, and I believe deeply that it is a sickness. Sometimes religion can certainly be healthy, and I am sure there are plenty of positive aspects of buddhism, but any philosophy which tells you that caring for yourself is merely caring for an \\"illusion\\" and that valuing and cherishing your own desires and aspirations (assuming they are healthy, etc.) is a sin is essentially the cruelest form of masochism in a kind, gentle cloak. Whatever you think it will do for you in terms of happiness and mental health, please rethink it. It is an easy trap to fall in for idealistic people, and I speak from experience. Anyway, if anyone has any comments I'd like to hear them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I recently began reading The Fountainhead, but am only about 200 pages into it. Granted, I have not read even half of it yet so I am not totally qualified to pass judgements on it, but I just had to say something after i read these reviews. First of all, I don't know a thing about Ayn Rand or what she felt about her characters, etc. All I know is that i cant put this book down but I dont like any of the people in it. I do not feel in any way that Howard Roark is the &quot;ideal man.&quot; In fact, I find him to be somewhat of a warning. Everyone in this book is an extreme of something. Roark will sacrifice anything for his ideals while Keating will sacrifice anyONE for success. In my opinion, this book shows the reader that one cannot live in the extremes. One must find a comfortable middle ground. Why is this a bad book just because you dont agree with the people in it and how they behave? It is excellently written. That cannot be denied. I think Rand could write a paper describing a soda can and it would sound like music to me. not only that, but its the disgust one feels towards the characters that makes it so exciting to find out what happens to them. read this book, not for a lesson on any particular viewpoint; not to be preached at, but because it is a wonderful symphony of words which take the reader away. It is one of those books that cause one to lose sense of everything around him. I can't wait to finish it!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'm a libertarian and an avid reader, so a counselor at my high school suggested I might enjoy this and lent me a copy. I enjoyed reading the book, but was ultimately somewhat unsatisfied at the end. The plot was interesting and kept me reading, but I found the characters to be very shallow and uninteresting, and I found it difficult to sympathize with The protagonist Howard. At first I was rooting for him, but when he experienced one defeat after another and didn't seem to care, I stopped caring, too. I actually found the villians more interesting than the hero, for the most part. Peter was interesting, and it was interesting to read about his rise and what he did to achieve it. Toohey was interesting at first, but after his big speech to Peter he descended into cartoonish supervillainy. The only character I really liked was the sculptor, who was admirable but, unlike Howard, actually seemed human. I realize that Rand was trying to create a portrait of her ideal man with Howard, rather than a realistic person, and that this ideal man would probably require equally unrealistic supporting characters and enemies, but I felt the characters were so unrealilistic as to be mostly uninteresting. Still, overall I enjoyed the book and would reccomend it. Just don't expect it to be as earthshattering as the positive reviews say."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I always wonder at the anger that this book elicits from some critics, the hatred of and fear of the ideas Ayn Rand expresses. I wonder what, specifically, these readers find so offensive. The idea that individual thought and achievement must be respected? The idea that people are intelligent enough to run their own lives and do so best with the least interference from government or other &quot;well-meaning&quot; groups? That people have a just claim on the rewards of their own hard work? That people have the right to think and live for themselves, rather than according to the will of others? Are these ideas so frightening? Aren't they the very ideas upon which this wonderful experiement, The United States, was founded? Or perhaps what galls critics is Ayn Rand's observation that great advancements invariably begin with the vision of a determined individual, whereas mediocrity invariably seeks (and finds) the comfort of numbers, and then congratulates itself for having achieved &quot;consensus.&quot;Critics seem particularly fond of explaining that they loved The Fountainhead at seventeen, but now from the advanced wisdom of their adult years, realize that Rand was all wrong, that &quot;real life doesn't work that way.&quot; Perhaps Rand's idealism is, in fact, unsuited to the real world of grown up people. Or perhaps dismissing Rand's idealism is merely an attempt to dignify one's own compromises and capitulations. Either way, Ayn Rand and The Fountainhead deserve to be celebrated and admired for appealing to that part of ourselves that continues to believe in the possibilities of the unfettered mind, that part that is forever seventeen."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was born and raised in the Soviet Union at the height of Communism's influence there. She moved to the United States around the age of 20 and embraced American ideals in a way that is made easier and more whole by having experienced the opposite and seeing how horrible it is.Rand lays out in The Fountainhead the idea that human acheivment is, in and of itself, a wonderful thing. When people love their work, produce something of value, and profit by that endeavor, the highest human ideal is reached. For Rand, altruism and the false ideal of selflessness are the greatest evils in our world, made dangerous by the ease with which they can be made to sound wonderful and undercut the engine that drives mankind forward - man's selfish desires.In The Fountainhead, Rand lays out a stylized story of a New York in which alruism has become the central philosophy of the people. One man, an architect, refuses to live according to the prevailing ideas of the times, doing his own work in his own way. The novel follows this architect as he comes up against a progression of figures more and more central to mental disease that is eroding New York.Rand's writing is odd and stilted, but her philosophy is so important and compelling that you become wholly invested in the characters specifically because they are an embodiment of an ideal.Rand's ideas aren't popular in the United States right now. In an era where we think of Enron and Tyco as representative corporations and speak the words \\"big business\\" with no question as to the assumed and implied idea that they indicate something undesirable, Rand's ideas are more important than ever. We need the jobs, the advances, the wealth and the innovation that are produced almost exclusively through the acheivement of self-motivated individuals. We can lose them if we forget the lessons taught by Rand and by history.A huge book with huge ideas. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's life, works, and philosophy still remain mired in dispute 23 years after her death. But you if you are reading this review page you are already knew that.My review will try to focus on the actual work in question instead of judging Rand's personality, affairs, intellectual ability, The Ayn Rand Institute, or gasp! Even her smoking (I have yet to meet somebody who had a problem with Sartre smoking). But this course of action is unlikely.This book along with Anthem and Atlas Shrugged are morality plays. Just like The Scarlet Letter, Everyman, or even The Jungle (yes Virginia, socialists have morality too.). That fact that this is a morality play is what turns some people off.The prose and plot structure turn off many people who demand \\"realism\\". I put realism in quotes because I really don't believe that this book is totally detached from reality as its detractors claim, each character is a moral abstraction. Taking bits of realistic human behavior and taking it to its logical and often ridiculous extremes. Keating is a bumbling everyman, Wynard is a Nietzschen/Stirnerien overman, Dominique is the depressed existentialist, and Howard is the Randian ideal. The only character that I would agree is totally unrealistic is Toohey, who is an abstraction for everything Rand views as evil.Now for the part you all have been waiting for, the commentary on the rape scene! My first comment will be totally off the record and totally not intellectual. \\"That's hot\\". Its no secret Rand liked to have her heroines get smacked around when they were having sex. As a male who would like his girlfriend to smack him around in bed I have no problem with this scene.Since Howard is the Randian moral ideal and he did commit rape many people assume this means that Rand supported rape. Rand also didn't help herself when she said she was a \\"male supremacist\\" and that no healthily woman would want to be President. (Well so much for not discussing Rand's beliefs). But on the same flip of the coin Atlas Shrugged main protagonist is a woman and Rand's newspaper endorsed The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. Eh I have gotten sidetracked, check out the book The Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand if this stuff interests you.Well my review has gotten rather long I will end with some advice1) Take all reviews on this book, including this one, with a grain of salt and read the damn book anyway.2) Counting reading philosophy once you're done with the book. If you don't like Rand there are more fish in the sea. Try Camus, Sartre, Nietzsche, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein, Popper, Ayer, Foucault, Thoreau, Plato, Aristotle, etc. I don't care just read some philosophy. You might learn something about yourself and the world you happen to live in."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"bias n.- a predisposition to prejudice.Every negative reviewer of this book I have encountered thus far is infected with just this- a predisposition to be against anyone who speaks out for rationality; against anyone who is not a slavish follower of a seductive creed, such as the creed preaching altruism and the superiority of blind belief to understanding and reason.I beg everyone to read this book with an objective (not \\"Objectivist\\") mindset; don't compare it to other philosophers you have read, and don't shut your mind against seemingly unorthodox opinions.I think this is an unmatchable book in the realm of philosophy and ethics. It is brilliantly written and, if you have read Rand's other works, very easily dissectable.

(And I speak as an Oxford MA Hons in English Lit, if that's worth anything, which I doubt.)However, Rand was a deeply mixed up gal. She worships rapists. (*All* the heroes in her novels are rapists - look carefully!)She'd have swooned at Saddam Hussain's feet. (He is, after all, by her definitions a man of integrity, naked strength and moral courage - true to himself. Just as a hyena is true to itself.)Rand's favourite characters are, as has been said elsewhere, psychopaths.Her female protagonists in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are, frankly, insane. Just as, I suspect, Rand was.Look more closely at her 'philosophy', expressed in her non-fiction works, and it disintegrates into a babble of circular logic."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I can understand why young people would like Ayn Rand: she tells us to love ourselves, tells us we are capable of great things, tells us to persist. And these teachings are, especially for high-schoolers, good things to embrace. But the other stuff she espouses, i.e., selfishness, social darwinism, compassionlessness-- these things are profoundly destructive. Sadly, Ayn Rand never realized there was a way to love yourself, help yourself, do great things, and still love and help others out, too. For some reason she thought the two were mutually exclusive.Moreover, from a literary point of view Ayn Rand is an aggressively bad novelist. Her characters are one-dimensional; her prose is bizarrely bland and plodding (and that's not even mentioning the forehead-clutchingly-bad dialogue); and her plots are as predictable as third-rate soap-operas. If you want to read great long novels try Dickens, Tolstoy, Faulkner, Woolf, or Melville. These cats make Ayn Rand look as sophisticated as a hyperactive first-grader with her first Etch-A-Sketch.Rand's vision of existence ultimately was a very cowardly one: she only saw what she wanted to see. Instead of opening herself up to life and all of its beautiful complexity, she vainly sought to reduce it to neat, tidy, hateful philosophy. And plus philosophy-- as any philosopher whose worth his salt will attest-- can only solve so much."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There are two approaches one can take to reading this book. The first is to read it as a 700-page propaganda piece for Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Objectivism is not entirely without merit. American society could benefit from a booster shot of personal responsibility. We would also do well to place more value in the individual. Unfortunately, it is fatally flawed. Apparently, for one to be perfect, one must have no concern for any other human. Some tidbits of Objectivist wisdom:* Any altruistic act is degrading to both the giver and the receiver, and will lead to the destruction of both their souls.* Anyone who values his or her family is a self-deluded failure at best, and at worst a thoughtless automaton, lacking the capacity for original thought.These beliefs have their roots in very good values. Altruism can foster learned dependence. Valuing other people's opinions over one's own is very harmful to one's self-worth. Objectivism does not, however, account for genuine compassion or for the human need for companionship and affection. I highly recommend the philosophy to independently wealthy, anti-social geniuses. For anyone who needs other people for any reason, Objectivism is a call to examine one's motives and relationships, and nothing more.The second approach is to read it as a novel. Rand's use of language is very good. The prose is clean and elegant. For the rest of it, however, I borrow from Woody Allen &quot;the three S words&quot;: self-indulgent, sophomoric, and solipsistic. The characters are two-dimensional and the plot is trite. Character development is thoroughly absent. Any concepts that challenge Rand's philosophy are completely ignored. She did not know how to reconcile filial love with her ideal of utter selfishness, so the hero, Howard Roark, has no family at all. It seems he sprang, like Athena, fully formed. Which begs the question: From whose smitten head did he spring? The antagonist presents a greater problem: How to create a nemesis who can threaten Roark, but who has no positive qualities? The solution: Ignore the problem. Elmore Toohey is a very intelligent man with a great deal of insight into the human psyche. He is an excellent orator. He manipulates people like a master puppeteer. His goal is to rule the world, and he seems to have the capacity to meet it. But Rand refers to him as someone who has no inherent talent, who could never have been anything but a social parasite. She did not feel the need to explain how he came to be an evil would-be dictator. She gives brief overview of his childhood, and apparently he leapt from the womb plotting and scheming. The only character that rings remotely true is Gail Wynand, and he is clearly a sketch of William Randolph Hearst.The last 30 pages consist almost entirely of long soliloquies in which the characters go on ad nauseam with very important ideas Rand couldn't fit in earlier. A large portion of the book took place during the Great Depression. The Depression is mentioned exactly once, and had absolutely no effect on any of the characters. I recommend this book only to those who want to know more about of Objectivism. It gives a good overview of its few merits and its many flaws."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Like Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is one of the finest peices of literature ever written. This book emphasizes the importance of individualism over collectivism, and of sticking to principals. Howard Roark, the hero (arguably modeled on Frank Loyd Wright), is a hard working architect who learns not to compromise with his ideas on architecture. He doesn't believe in designing with architectural styles of the past - Classical, Gothic, Rennasaince - and instead uses a new modern style that hasn't been done before, using new concepts and new technology to create unique buildings.Although he is a brilliant architect, he refuses to build anything in a historical style, resulting in his expulsion from his college, and later making it difficult for him to get any contracts. Even when faced with closing his business, he still refuses to do work he doesn't believe in.Peter Keating, on the other hand, is a talented architect who at first becomes wealthy and famous designing buildings in historical styles. He quickly rises to becoming a partener in a great architectural firm, and designs many buildings that are praised by the public. However, he has no talent for designing anything new, and often has to ask for help from Howard Roark. Much of the story revolves around the conflict between the two - Roark would rather create a magnificent builing, but Keating would rather get credit for creating a magnificent building that he didn't design.The story takes twist with the involvement of Elsworth Toohey, an architecture critic who preaches altruism, and despises any form of sucess, like the buildings of Roark. Dominque Francon, a manipulative woman, gets involved with both Roark and Keating. And Gail Wynand, a very wealthy an powerful man with no principals, becomes great friends with Roark, although eventually he will learn why his lack of principals will ultimately be his demise.Hoard Roark constantly struggles against the general population, who view him negatively for being selfish and stubborn. He goes through expulsions, bankruptcies, betrayals, but because of his determination he eventually ends up on top - above Keating, Wynand, and Toohey.The great thing about The Fountainhead is that it still applies to modern life, as individualism and principals are just as important. For instance, John Kerry, like Peter Keating, based his policies on what the public thought was good, and not what he felt was good. And like Peter Keating, John Kerry ended up as someone who will never be on top, and who will soon be forgotten (I'll remove this review if he somehow does get elected in 2008). On a more positive note, many people throughout history, like Susan B. Anthony and Martin Luther King, had strict principals on what was right, and they did not compromise with their principals, which is why we achieved gender and racial equality. The Fountainhead will continue to be a commonly read book, and the principals of it will continue to be true."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you don't know who Ayn Rand is, read this book. It was a life changing experience for me. Trust me, READ THIS BOOK! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was so immersed in her heartless, simplistic ideology to take the time to create interesting, human characters. Instead, we have dummies inflated with rhetoric and ideas. I would hate to be in the room with one of these people for more than a few minutes -- some would bore me to tears, others would make me get violent. The plot of this novel is pretty weak, too.Rand's philosophy is very easy to understand, and as a consequence this \`\`philosophical novel'' is very easy to read. For readers ready for novels with human *and* philosophical content (and better philosophical content at that), I advise reading Iris Murdoch."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"What can I say? Philosophy is philosophy. Fiction is fiction. Can the two be mixed, intertwined as it were? Certainly; Joyce did it. Dante did it. Plato did it. Many other authors did it, all in different ways. Do I mean, in dropping the above names, to compare Rand to such great pillars of the Western Canon? Certainly not. Rand's implantation of philosophy into her writing is about as subtle as an appendectomy without anasthetic, and just as painful. Her characters are one-dimensional vehicles for abstract concepts. They lack any depth, and I as a reader could not care for them. Her metaphors are incredibly awkward, and her prose style seems to look forward uncannily to the books one can now find in wire racks at airports. As for her philosophy itself, she can keep it. If I want to embrace a Cult of Personality, I'll look no further than Stalin, thank you very much. I suggest to all of those who have turned to Objectivism to think for a moment, at which point I hope they'll realize that &quot;rational selfishness&quot; is no more than &quot;rationalized selfishness.&quot; If you wish to read a REAL bildungsroman, pick up Joyce's &quot;Portrait.&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A while ago, Sarah Palin and her band of tea party protesters started mentioning \\"going Galt\\" (a reference to Rand's book Atlas Shrugged) in their protest signs.. I don't think I need to explain how eye-roll worthy the idea was of Palin ceasing productive activity leading to society falling apart. (In Atlas Shrugged, John Galt organizes a creative strike of genius individuals which results in society's collapse, so that these geniuses can be free to carry out their ideas the way they want). This primed me to hate Ayn Rand, her philosophy, and body of work. I was as annoyed as I thought I'd be when I started reading, but as silly as her caricature characters and their drawn out repetitive speeches were, I still found myself thinking about this book a great deal.I think to get something out of this book without getting extremely annoyed or overzealous, you need to have an understanding of Ayn Rand in the back of your mind as opposed to taking the work completely on its own. This is a very emotionally written book; as much contempt as Rand might have for emotion, someone doesn't get this dogmatic and rigid without having an emotional reason for it... it's not rational! (Sorry Ayn) As another reviewer pointed out, her family fled Russia after the Bolshevik revolution, and they fell into terrible living conditions due to the communist overtake. After coming to the States she found success after some hard work, its no wonder she hated communism and respected capitalism. Not sure where her violent sexual fantasies come from but I'm sure there's something behind that too..There are some very irritating flaws that I need to vent about before I can go on. She seriously needed to learn more about architecture. So many of her descriptions were just calling buildings brilliant, clean, and rational and telling us to take her word for it. Could she not open a freaking book on architecture? What really bothers me about this is that she doesn't allow the reader to form their own opinion on these buildings, but to accept that this pinnacle of modern architectural achievement exists and that Roark was the one to bring it to life (hypocrite!). So basically Ayn couldn't actually fathom these buildings to describe them, so we must accept that they are so awesome. Not impressed Ayn, but ok, architecture is a metaphor and not your point, fine. Whatever.Story-wise, I don't see what the point is in her characters being so absurdly tunnel visioned except that perhaps it reflects her own refusal to more fully understand people she disagrees with, or even agrees with. Out of any protagonist I've read, Roark grows such an incredibly little amount. He is perfect (by the way he is not perfect), therefore must not be questioned. Again perfection cannot really be fathomed by Ayn so he is not given much dialogue, and we're not able to get inside his head and empathize with him. He is a hero to be worshiped by the readers. Rand herself has said however, that she creates her characters this way intentionally so that they are almost purely vehicles for her philosophy as opposed to believable people. Thus explaining why Roark seems more like a sociopath than the ideal man.A bigger problem that sticks out to me is how easily this philosophy can become hypocritical for people who buy into it. It is so easy to think of oneself as a misunderstood genius and to shun away people that disagree, but real people are not infallible. They have to be able to take constructive criticism so that they can improve. When someone isn't able to grow, we get the ugly Grecian buildings in this book that symbolize mediocrity (can't imagine what Roark's response to post-modernism would be). I mean, Sarah Palin is the shining beacon of mediocrity in America and if she can use Rand's philosophy to justify her beliefs then I am scared. I personally was very individualistic till I saw how problematic it is when taken to Rand's extreme. This level of egoism will prevent one from making positive change, even if they have something of value to contribute.So. Let us take a few steps back and reflect on the good. The individual is a wonderful thing, and people should strive for greatness and to be as un-compromised as possible. Nietzsche does a much better job of explaining this I think (though he's just as sexist) and also is adamant in pointing out that people must constantly question, and struggle, so that they can grow. I'm pretty sure he'd refer to Roark as an inverse cripple, people who have too much of one thing and too little of everything else, and are called great by the people around them. Dominique thinks society is the reason Roark can't reach his full potential, but that is just an excuse for Roark to not truly self actualize by achieving well rounded perfection. Reason is also a wonderful thing, the most wonderful thing. But reason without humanity is really boring (as evidenced by brutalist architecture). All in all, this book made me stay up and write a long review on the points I've been obsessing over, meaning it made me think. And what is more important in a book than that? It has its merits, could have been better, and is abrasive enough to force one to formulate their thoughts on what exactly they love and hate and why."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Various things are exaggerated in the book, but yet it manages to articulate those inarticulate views on e.g. individualism and collectivism that I've had for many years and was sometimes critized for.

Hers is a stridently simplistic and sophomoric philosophy, far removed from the kind of carefully reasoned discourse one expects from someone alleged to be a &quot;great philosopher&quot;.Rand's plots are unctuously contrived to buttress her obsessively monochromatic portrait of human nature, one oblivious to life's true subtleties and uninformed by a deeper wisdom. Her characters are cardboard cutouts designed for little more than advancing her childish laissez-faire rhetoric, and seem utterly incapable of even thinking of the kind of insightful questions that could mar the author's heavy handed operatic themes.Perhaps most troubling for me personally are her paeans to reason, something I consider to be the foremost of human accomplishments, but which in Rand's clumsy hands devolves disgracefully into blind, uncritical adherence to her churlish libertarian dogma of unrestrained greed and reckless individualism. With such &quot;friends&quot;, reason needs no enemies!There are those that actually argue that the fact that Rand is so vilified by thoughtful reviewers means that she must be &quot;on to something&quot;. This is a remarkably vapid observation, for one still routinely hears and reads much justifiable criticism of numerous historical figures who have helped to reverse human progress. Perhaps you can think of a few...To conclude, fans of Rand's books, in my experience, seem to have been all-too-easily bamboozled by one-dimensional characters with no trace of nuance, profound-sounding but empty-headed sophistry, and all-out rhetorical sledgehammer blows wielded in the service of avarice.My advice to readers is to pick up some real philosophy or science or carefully reasoned economic work -- or even the latest thriller -- and to leave Ayn Rand's deluded, crackpot vision to the dustbin of history."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If one reads the commentaries recorded by RASHI on the Bible book \\"Song of Songs\\" the description, lovely, by the man of his beloved's breastsis annotated as meaning Moses and Aaron.The author of Fountainhead has the quality of the commentary--taking the life out of the wonderous.

Another good one is narcissistic. And, of course, boring. Wretchedly, perversely boring.If you need a plot summary, oh well. Howard Roark is an ubermensch, I mean architect, and the &quot;ideal man&quot; of Ayn Rand's philosophy. Roark &quot;rebels against convention&quot; and builds ugly buildings, whereas others design aesthetically pleasing buildings, incorporating elements from earlier works, and therefore are evil second-handers who have no integrity.Howard Roark is an unpleasant human being, one who a sane person cannot relate to. He is obstinate, excessively so, and mostly seems like a projection of a stoic god onto a plane of &quot;mere mortals.&quot; He is a hero by definition--he commits rape (in the name of love, if that's to be believed), blows up buildings, and generally acts like an ***hole and yet Rand expects us to believe his ideal-ness.Don't worry, though, this book's not just a shallow plot, with bad architectural ideas and characters who wish they were 2-dimensional. It's a &quot;philosophical novel.&quot; Well, actually, no. Dune, by Frank Herbert, is a philosophical novel--a study of a messianical figure, and his triumphs and ultimate failings. A novel with a heavy philosophical theme. Fountainhead is a monumental tribute to pseudo-intellectualism.You see, Ayn Rand's &quot;philosophy&quot; is called Objectivism. It's a fairly simple, if not valid, viewpoint: good actions are intended to benefit the individual, and all that stuff that appeals to people looking for justification for who they are. It's proven by the tried and true method of &quot;You must interpret reality, but since reality's objective, people who disagree with me are wrong.&quot;And Fountainhead hits you with this philosophy about as subtly as a brick. It's amazing how easily people swallow this crap. Unfortunately, Rand's followers subscribe to her ideas in their totality (imagine a crowd chanting, in unison, &quot;we are individuals,&quot; and you'll get an idea of the attitude), and preach them.If you want to read a novel with lots of philosophical ideas, read something interesting like Stranger in a Strange Land or Dune. If you want to read great philosophy, you have centuries to choose from. Read Plato or Descartes, read Sartre or Machiavelli. Read the Bible. Or the Tao Te Ching. Or the works of Marx and Engels. Take a serious philosophy course. Just stay away from the stylings of Ayn Rand. Once you've gotten through some decent philosophy, Rand will just seem puerile."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am a 30 year old architect. I read fountainhead for the juicy details of big time architecture. Rand wrote a story that is both bigger than life and true to life. She was a voracious researcher and a highly imaginative writer.Art imitates life in Fountainhead, in glorified fashion. I can attest from personal experience that a career in architecture does indeed include elements such as school rivalries, office politics, insecurities, megalomania, long hours designing, critiques, skyscrapers, mansions, engineers, contractors, tradesmen, and wealthy clients.There is mediocrity in American architecture, and there was a modernistic movement in the early twentieth century. Rand abridged it for her story. The lives of her magnified characters are entangled in destiny. This could never happen in real life, could it?Many scenes are so confident and gritty I cannot forget them. Also, her building descriptions are vivid and beautiful.As you can tell, I needed some extra excitement in my 9 to 5. I thank Rand for the greatest American story about architects that I know of.Only, I wish she would have finished it.I have a big problem with the last third of the book. A misplaced dialectic of philosophy cuts into her ending. The ending is missing something. If only Rand would have kept her artistry and philosophy more separated.Thus, as is, Fountainhead ultimately is not literature to me, but propaganda. And every person should be wary of propaganda. The message of this story is not universal. It is a mistake for young readers to imitate Rand's protagonist.Roark is the most wooden hero. He is a robot programmed to design masterpieces. A puppet in a book, not to be confused with a real life fountainhead.Instead of anthropormizing Roark, look for real life leaders who struggle and ultimately change our world.

This is a book that requires you to think. The majority of you will not understand the book. Some will understand it but not agree with it. Only a small minority will understand and appreciate the book.&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a classic tale of good versus evil. To Rand, the individual is good, and any restriction on the individual is evil. The ultimate form of evil is collectivism. The protagonist, architect Howard Roark, is Rand's perfect man. His life is his work, and vice versa. He works on his terms or not at all. The plot centers around attempts to crush him--by those who do not understand him and by those who understand him too well.Some of the characters are good, some are evil, and some are not quite one or the other. Some, you will know which way they fall almost from the beginning, and others not until the end. The characters often appear to take actions opposite to what you think they should. You must look beyond the short term to see the true motives and why each action has a purpose to the overall plot and why each action helps the character achieve his ultimate goal.It helps to remember the times in which this book was written (i.e., 1930s and 1940s). Socialism was gaining ground in Europe. Ayn Rand had seen this firsthand in her native Russia. She saw a very real possibility of socialism taking over in the United States, and her goal was to prevent it.The book is not without its flaws. Rand's writing can be rather strident, and some of the wording sounds dated. She overuses certain terms. The last twenty pages do not live up to the first 660. But these are minor drawbacks. The plot development and character development are masterful, and the pacing is just right.If you are in the minority who understand and like this book, I would also recommend &quot;We the Living&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"About 6 years ago, I read this book because someone with whom I was co-teaching a course put it on the reading list. I actually read it twice, the minumum number of times I read anything I teach. I would not have finished it even once if I had not been paid to read it. Don't get me wrong--over the previous 20+ years I had read most of Rand's non-fiction, and her play(s). I had used essays by her in classes I had taught. Her non-fiction I find mentally stimulating, partly because I strongly agree with some of her ideas, but definitely not with all; so it is a challenge to disentangle them. But reading her non-fiction first had warned me about her fiction--for Ayn Rand is her very own favorite authority to quote in her essays. These copious quotations from her novels had given me the idea that her fiction was non-humorous and greatly didactic. The Fountainhead proved that Rand quotes herself fairly--it's gossly didactic and has little intentional humour. It is, though, a good example of camp--probably the Hollywood influence on Rand--in the posturing of it main romantic pair. Dominique, who I gather is supposed to be an ideal female character, strikes dominatrix poses, but when it comes to the &quot;right&quot; man, she's an enthusiastic masochist. There's the notorious &quot;rape&quot; scene, but even more grotesque is her marriage to someone else for whom she feels no real attraction but who keeps in close contact with the &quot;right&quot; man, and most grotresque is the scene where she swooningly slashes herself--with shattered windshield glass, I believe. This Aryan-featured female turns out to be the right woman for the Aryan-featured hero, who is supposed to be an ideal man. (It's interesting that in a book set mostly in the 1930s and published during WWII, a Jewish author would choose to make her two ideal characters both physical types the Nazis would have approved of--surely Rand could have found beauty in variety.) Looks aside, one wonders if an ideal man wouldn't have loved someone less perverse that Dominique. Rand also does not play fair politically--in that the book does take on elements of the New Deal, but doesn't seem to acknowledge the Great Depression, so that the New Deal seems wholly perverse and arbitrary. The book does have some virtues. It describes non-organic things well. It describes work--especially work involving more than one person-- well. The long trial oration is a relief, because the ideas are presented openly and therefore Rand doesn't get so gummed up in the demands of matters like plot and character or in matters of irrational, incompletely examined sexual feelings. The main villian is very boring--Rand avoiding a flaw that writers such as Shakespeare, Milton and Dickens sometimes fell into, the flaw of making a story's main villian more interesting and compelling that the good or heroic characters. Unfortunately Rand' main villian has several subtantial scenes, which are excrutiatingly dull.shakespeare, Milton"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am currently listening to this on audio and its pretty good.

It is her definitive piece. It is her essay on what she believes to be the semblance of perfection, in the form of one man - Howard Roark. Actually, it is the story of four different persons: one who can never succeed in life, but doesn't know it; one who can never succeed in life, and knows it (this is the archetype evil Rand character - using the ways of a socialist to achieve his ends); one who can succeed in life, but gives into the way of the world; and the hero (Roarke), who does succeed in life through his individualism and love of his work. This is the story of the power of the individual over the collective or state. The Fountainhead is the person who creates, no the second-hander. Overall, the story was very engaging, though the best part was Roark's trial speech at the end of the novel. That speech is what defines Rand.

And he is. His friendships are real and passionate. His triumphs and victories become ours.

Her first novel, \\"We The LIving\\" blasts the alligator sleep off all our preconceived ideas of what Russia must have been like up to the fall of the Iron Curtain. \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a must read for every citizen. Written in 1957, this novel is a perfect scenario, frightening in it's scope of how, bit by bit, our way of life in America is stripped from us."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The novel as a device of entertainment succeeds. It entertains. Not just the character development, but the plot, too. Sure, Camus and Voltaire write more entertainingly, but they present lenses which we are all familiar with. Ayn Rand's lens, or philosophy, is perhaps what renders the novel as entertaining as it is.On the philosophy.... Huh. Aristotle held self realization to be the purpose in life. John Stuart Mill believed happiness was a result of individual development. Many other philosophers seemed to adopt similar positions.But we intuitively know that there is some difference between John Stuart Mill's \\"individuality\\" and Ayn Rand's individualism. Ayn Rand's individualism seems a tad bit one-sided. Don't get me wrong here - I am the furthest thing from a collectivist you'll find. But Rand seems to be a bit too silent on the topic of individual accountability. A man who has no children, no contracts, no duties - that man is free to think only of himself. But when you bring children into the world, or enter into voluntary contracts, you have obligations. Rand doesn't deny this, but she doesn't seem to openly acknowledge it here either.She also seems to see criminals and heroes in the same light, or not. I'll be reading her other novels and hopefully they will shed more light on these questions of mine."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is difficult to summarize what \\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand is about. The simplest explanation is that it is about an architect named Howard Roark who saw the world very differently than others did and the people who are intent upon destroying him. But simplifying the premise down to that sentence does Ayn Rand an injustice. For \\"The Fountainhead\\" is an examination of society and individualism and it touches on themes that greatly exceed the reach of its characters.The readers are first introduced to Howard Roark on the day he is expelled from Stanton Institute of Technology for refusing to conform to their expectations of architecture. For Roark believes that buildings should be built based on personality and purposes, as well as from the land that surrounds it. His ideas are revolutionary in an era when architects were expected to draw upon all the preceeding styles to build their own greatness. Roark's struggle to establish himself as a worthy architect who should be allowed to build things his own way is contrasted with the meteoric rise of Peter Keating, whom Roark had boarded with during college. Keating conforms to every expectation, becomes wealthy and famous, but knows that he will never measure up to Howard Roark and will always be a mediocre architect.As the world slowly begins to accept the idea of modernism in architecture, Roark becomes a major league player in the building business, a rise that several people try to destroy. Dominique Francon, the woman who loves Roark but cannot choose him, sets out to destroy his prospects by winning jobs for Peter Keating, among other attempts to hurt him. But the real threat lies with Ellsworth Toohey, a philanthropist and self-fashioned expert on architecture who writes a column in the most popular newspaper of the day. He recognizes Roark's genius but knows that it goes against every grain of information he has brainwashed his readers into believing, so he does all in his power to conserve his anonymity and bring him disgrace. Yet in spite of all these obstacles, Roark continues to fight for what he knows to be his personal truth, no matter what losses and battles get thrown his way.\\"The Fountainhead\\" by Ayn Rand is an intriguing read, but definitely not one that is fast-paced. At times, the storytelling seems deliberately slow; in an attempt to discuss society within the novel, Rand had to introduce great portions of that society which sometimes distracts from the novel on the whole. Even if one is not a fan of Rand's philosophy and her beliefs, one can definitely appreciate her thoughts about the struggle between an individual and society."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"amazing. This book is completely worth your time. It's quite slow in the beginning, but keep reading; it gets much better.The Fountainhead takes the reader on a journey through the life of a young architect, Howard Roark. He is the perfect archetype of Ayn Rand's ideal man: independant, idealisic, and completely selfish. He lives for himself and what he beleives in and lets no one come between that.Rand contrasts Roark so vividly through the lives of Peter Keating and, the antagonist, Ellsworth Toohey. Keating lives for others. He constantly worries about what others might think of him, and his drive for sucess pushes him over the edge in the long run. Toohey seeks to control the public. He tells them what to think, and they listen. His goal is to destroy the creator, and to build a united world of one colletive brain.And, of course, what's a good story without a bit of romance? Well, the readers of this novel are in for a surprise when Dominique Francon steps on the sceen. She is the perfect match for Howard Roark. She loves him with all of her being, and becasue of this, she tries to destoy him.Sound like something you'd enjoy? If not, order it anyway. You'll thank me later. :)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I wish I'd read this _before_ \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" which I thought _was_ the best book ever. Rand really has a way of making me think. Atlas and Fountainhead share a lot of similarities, I recommend them both."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand, was recommended to me by my brother. He told me it had a strong impact on him and his perspective on life. I decided that if this novel could have such an intense impact on its readers, it was a book worth reading.The novel is primarily about Howard Roark and his battle against the world and its desire to destroy him and his ideals. Howard Roark is an architect whose greatest joy (and believed purpose in life) is to design and create buildings. Roark is an idealist, for he stands strongly by his principles-even when faced by extreme poverty. His struggle against society is characterized by his individualism (or egoism). Self-reliance and self-respect are his virtues; virtues not held by the common man. Roark's buildings are reflections of his human spirit, for they embody his ideals - self-respect and integrity. His buildings are condemned for their lack of beauty, yet they are praised by their mathmatical and structural genius. Roark's buildings do not contain an external facade; they have no columns, no arches. They simply, completely, and beautifully fulfill their purpose, displaying man's capacity for greatness. The novel depicts the life of Howard Roark and his individual perfection while contrasting the lives of weaker, more corrupt, and more successfull men such as Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey.Ayn Rand's philosophy regarding egoism and individualism is extremely controversial due to its extreme repudiation of common conceptions. I believe certain aspects of her philosophy are quite beautiful and profound, but other parts are also radical. There is beauty in self-respect and individuality, which is depicted through Howard Roark and his unfaltered passion for designing his buildings with integrity, without corruption. Yet Rand condemns all acts of \\"selflessness\\" for she believes that these acts are truly selfish in the immoral sense. Seemingly selfless acts are often used to obtain power and control over those who are supposedly receiving aid. However, I believe there are exceptions. There are people who believe in God and truly desire to help others who are in dire need of it, who also believe in man's capacity for greatness, who may have both self-respect and humility. The novel is worth reading for it is a poignant story as well as a profound social commentary."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this first in September of 2004, and after a lot of thought, it officially replaced Nineteen Eighty-Four as my overall favorite novel.Many people think that this is a psuedo-fiction 'novel' about capitalism with a lot of rhetoric - it is not. Though brilliant, Atlas Shrugged touches a lot more on politics and has a lot of long speeches by its characters, and therefore could be said to have non-fiction segments.However, The Fountainhead is the story of an egoist/individualist and his consistent optimisism in an irrational society. The novel is dedicated to 'The noble profession of architecture,' the perfect profession to use as an example in the story. The characters are strong, the plot builds up to a passionate climax that compeltely reflects his personality, and you grow attached to the different characters, especially him and two others.This is one of, or the greatest novel ever written. If you haven't bought it yet, I suggest that you do so now - it will be one of the most selfish things you've ever done, nobly enough."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"if you are like me-that is are looking for fiction and not philosophy-but don't mind the speeches-well this is the book for you. it is not a slow book nor a fast one-and all i can tell you is that you will like howard roarke for the simple reason that he is immensly likeable.the debate between selflessness and selfishness-objectivism-well it's there-but you can ignore it and read the book for the simple pleasure of reading.this is definately a easier read than atlas shrugged and in my opinion a better book---read it and decided for yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I loved this book and admired Ayn Rand's philosophy. As a novel, however, it is about as subtle as a jackhammer. Pulp philosophy, but unforgettable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It would be very easy to reject this massive work as a simplistic product of yet another humanistic evangelist. The worldview is more black and white than the Koran. Parts of the plotline don't work. The romantic dynamics are silly. And there are other pretty transparent weaknesses (more below). But the truth is that buried in almost a thousand pages, and underneath some laughably cardboard characters, there is an absorbing story here.First off, not all the characters are weak. The protagonist, an unorthodox architect, is a sensible and dedicated hero worthy of respect. His fundamentalist dedication to Reason is strange, and in some ways robotic, but he is a likeable fellow. Be warned: his expressions of the Reasoning Self are disturbing and sometimes criminal and they inevitably place him in conflict with society as a whole. But not to worry, reassures the author, it's all for a good Reason.Mr. Objectivist is surrounded by some pretty fascinating supporting characters as well. The character problem becomes evident about half way through the book when we recognize that most characters are not so much persons as caracitures of a various ideological perspectives. Their interactions often become predictable and irritatingly pedantic.This problem is amplified in the climax of the novel, a scene in which our rational hero is confronted in a courtroom by the legal implications of his behavior choices. This scene degenerates into a sophomoric lecture on the moral superiority of rationalism and the human spirit. Which isn't a spirt, it's a consciousness. Except it's a Reasoning Consciousness. With Purpose. And that's what makes it Good. You get the idea.There are other baffling odddities. The symbol of objective purity is ... architecture and building design. Hmmm. That's a pretty subjective starting point.Still, I didn't mind the book. It's written at a level for thinking adults, worthy of the priorities of its author. The plot isn't predictable. The key areas of architecture and New York elite culture are treated with humorous sophistication. Perhaps the best thing is that the worldview is not hidden, which allows for some critical evaluation if that's your bent. Just be warned, this isn't light reading and doesn't pretend to be."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Unbelievable, superb! The author depicts characters which not only intrigue but depict the extremes in society. I do not believe that Ayn Rand was an extremist; it is through her extremist characters in the novel that Rand describes objectivism, the goal towards ego and capitalism, as not 'evil'.It is man's desire to achieve a goal using all instruments at his/her disposal which promotes improvements or degradation to society as a whole.Toohey as a character was resolute in his goal for power and it was this determinedness which allowed him to obtain his strength and manipulate people. Ayn relates the methods used to stifle the soul of man and kill the spirit.Howard Roark strives for a 'quality' in architecture which many attempt to destroy (even unknowingly). Roark's glory is achieved in the doing and the finality of the work. The achievement when completing his works alters the architectural and imaginative ideas of others.I highly recommend this novel to all the philosophically minded readers. Whether or not you agree with the author, the ideas will have you thinking."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"What can one say about a novel so extraordinary, so rich in &quot;human&quot; characteristics? Here I was, drifting through life, nearly lost as a twenty three year old. Aimless. Then I was introduced to Miss Rand's genius via The Fountainhead. I have read this novel 25 times, cover to cover, since being introduced to it in the late Seventies. I've never looked back. Young American's desperately need to be introduced to this artwork. It will save a lot of growing pains, let me tell you! Don't hesitate in purchasing, then reading, this book, for he who hesitates, is lost. However, this novel was written to assist anyone who chooses reading it, to find your &quot;self.&quot; Indeed the most sacred possession we have."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead does a commendable job of telling a reasonably good story and showcasing Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Unfortunately, it fails in doing what Atlas Shrugged did--and that is really interest me. All the characters in the Fountainhead are nearly carbon-copies of all of Rand's characters--either emotionless egotists or maddening socialists. It's to Rand's testament that she manages to still make an interesting novel despite the lack of broader character development. The characters she does have are done well, but they're just all the same.Still, The Fountainhead is a beautiful nexus between pounding out a novel-as-philosophy and making it an interesting thing to read. Atlas Shrugged also did this very well, but it had the added advantage of a wider array of character types and a streamlined plot line. Both novels drag in places when Rand shifts into soapbox mode, but this can easily be forgiven since even the dullest moments in a Rand novel are greatly multiplied in creativity than most other novels that attempt the same thing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book in art school and loved it. 15 years later, I am still very much indebted to this book for changing the way I look at things. I understand that because Alan Greenspan recently mentioned Ayn Rand, everyone is going out to purchase this book. All I can say is, this book is not for everyone. If you are going to take the characters in the book at face value, you will hate this book. If you are a working architect, you might laugh at this book. If you are a &quot;team-player&quot; you will not want to pick up this book.Lighten up people! Howard Roark is an idea, not a person. He is an idea that lives in all of us. A desire to be individuals in whatever we do. I may not agree with Objectivism all the way through, but this book definitely made me look at what makes up an individual. Then and now, I respect and admire Ayn Rand for writing it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I had just finished Atlas Shrugged and realized Ayn Rand had insight into the minds of social justice progressives unlike anything seen or read today. I ordered Fountainhead with one day delivery because I could not wait to read more on her philosophy. One week later I was done and ordered five more of her books. One cannot go wrong with Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is a brilliant author. This book is written extremely well, and once you start reading it, you will find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When I bought the Fountainhead several years ago I did not realize the large impact that the novel would have on my life. There are very few books that I have read (currently read several hundred), and believe the book is the only book written in the epic/romantistic style in the last hundred years that is a must read (excluding atlas shrugged). The novel is split into three sections and can sometimes drag on, however, I have found that the feeling of dragging only occurs to those who do not truly wish to read the novel. As stated it is written in a romantic style, and is a love story of sorts explaining Ayn Rands philosophy in an entertaining artful form. I feel that every person should be at least invited to read such a well written and interesting book. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's work, though written in the 1940's, encourages one to compare that decade with today.

As for the book itself, I would have to say otherwise by itself this book is a great read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"But I hated every character in this book. Everyone of them was a selfish, self-centered person. Even those who pretended to be caring about their fellowman turned out to be selfish. I think that is what I liked about the book, everyone behaved like many people I know. Nobody was a \\"god.\\" The story itself a pretty good read, but I'll be remembering these people for a long time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"OK, I have read everything Ayn Rand ever wrote. I am a Randian nut. Her notion of capitalism and government applies to me. I believe in the free market economies and that only through free markets will society be achieved. Fountainhead speaks to all those factors brilliantly in the Randian style of pictorial wording and pithy elegance of character creation.Howard Roark, is an individualistic architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision. We follow his battle to practice what the public sees as modern architecture, which he believes to be superior, despite an establishment centered on tradition-worship. How others in the novel relate to Roark demonstrates Rand's various archetypes of human character, all of which are variants between Roark, the author's ideal man of independent-mindedness and integrity, and what she described as the \\"second-handers.\\"Powerful, visionary, and moving. Rand gives us ideas as poignant as The Republic by Plato."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read the Fountainhead after readingGoddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right. I believe this is a good starting point for Ayn Rand. I wanted to know her belief system before reading any of her material. This made The Fountainhead easier to understand. This is a book about an architect fighting to make it in society. This is also a book about individualism and the greatness of the individual. Many people have written in-depth analysis about the novel so I will not do the same. This is the foundation novel by Ayn Rand, which established her as a writer and eventually led to her masterpiece Atlas Shrugged. The story of a man against society was nothing new to novels. The manner in which Rand compared individualism to collectivism was a new idea. Rand was heavily influenced early in life by the effects of Communism on her family. Rand did not hide her disdain for collectivism in The Fountainhead. The timing of this book coincided with the Great Depression and the invention of the modern Welfare state. Her book said many things that people did not say at this time. The relevancy of this book will never fade as long as government wants to intervene in our lives and redistribute \\"wealth\\".This book will always stay in my short list of great novels. However, Rand added so much detail to the book there were times when I did not want to continue reading. She made sure the reader understood everything about her main characters. At times, I did not care about childhood of some of the characters. Rand did make the book strong as a whole and the slow parts were only minor bumps in the road. The slow parts eventually led to good parts. The good parts would lead to reading for several hours nonstop."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead contains a simple, yet powerful message: innovation, originality, and determination will always triumph over trying to be the best in a conventional world. Because of this, I feel that this book has far more universal appeal than Rand's later work, mainly Atlas Shrugged, when she descended into extremist libertarianism. Though its been years since I've read this book, I still consider it a masterpiece, and a truly uplifting one at that."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I chose this book to do for school and it's a great book! The language and the use is so vivid. Not too hard to read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"what randroids don't like to admit is that there's a reason the fountainhead was rejected by twelve publishers. it is in your rational self-interest not to read rand's one-dimensional, strawman-loaded objectivist diarrhea."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is so poorly written that it really can not be evaluated using standard criteria: in fact, in her introduction, Ayn Rand complains about naturalistic fiction - that is, fiction with plausible plots and characters that could exist - and explains that she is trying to write about ideal characters. Judging from what she has written, in her ideal world, people would be thin, entrepreneurial, and selfish.Some people are of the opinion that this book is a page turner, and it is true that Rand can be compelling in a bombastic, apocalyptic way. One character - Tooney, a bad guy - wants to control the world. Another character - Wyand, who is both good and bad - also wants to control the world. A third character - Roark, a Christ figure - just wants to put up some nice buildings but is attacked at every turn by corrupt gangsters. They all want to sleep with Dominique Francon, a thin and beautiful (what else?) social critic. When these supermen clash over the fate of the world, you think something pretty dramatic is going to happen. In fact, nothing much does. The losers drift away, diminished, and the last man standing gets the girl.As others have noted, the dialogue in the book is not believable. Rand is nothing if not preachy, and her characters don't talk to one another, they make speeches to one another. Because of its defects as fiction, The Fountainhead can only stand as a book of ideas, and even Rand's ideas are not presented very attractively. In the New American Library edition, there are 15 pages of end material that apparently were included to try to present her philosophy in a more persuasive fashion than she does in the novel. Rand is an atheist and sees no reason for people to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others: in fact, selfishness is good, since each individual human life is an end in itself. Most people have at least some libertarian leanings and so will find some superficial appeal in her ideas. But there is nothing of lasting value here. Who can believe that there is no higher purpose or meaning in life than pleasing oneself?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"At the conclusion of this book, I took the Knife that was near me and thrust it trhough the book to about pg 400. I found the charactors to be flat, the plot perdictiable, and the dialoge very unimaginative. But more inmportantly, i thought that the ideas contained within the book were very shallow minded. Selfishness as a virtue is beyond my ability to accept. Many of the people we look at in history have been humble while strong in their convictions. The founding fathers of our nation are a good example of this--they fought for and brought about a revolution, but not for thier own selfish desires. Yes, they did have invested interest, but thier personal motives were not the exclusive ones. This is a book that i can understand a rebelious teen-ager reading and agreeing with, but not an adult. She advocates an idea that one's own ideas are of paramount importance, and that achiveing them at all cost's is man's purpose in life. This idea runs in the face of most of the lessons that history has taught us. Every charactor in her book lacks the trait of humily--and by this i do not mean walk all over me kinda thing--rather a recognition that other people in the world to matter. Her book would say that humble people cannot get a head in life. History has taught us otherwise. But ignorant societys have always touted arrogance as a posotive trait. I would encourage you to read this book, and to study history. I do not want to sound arrogant, but i belive one with some understanding of history would come to the same conclusoins, but could not say for sure. In any event, This book will either prove to be very offensive to you or very apt. In either case, I encourage reading it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Haven't you ever had to laugh at a joke that wasn't funny? Did you enjoy that? When was the last time you complimented someone for gain without truly believing what you said? How many times have you smiled when you weren't happy? Who hasn't stood aside and let their principles fly out the door? Does that feel good? My grandmother died when I was 11 and I didn't cry. Did I feel sad? No; so why should I compromise myself to make everyone believe I was hurt? Through my entire life I've fallen for the traps presented by those who wish to control me. As a teen I was embarrassed to ask girls out because when I was a child and teen I was ridiculed for being different since I was the new kid at a small school. I felt guilt when I felt good because I feared egotism! I carried a deep self-disdain because I was athletically and mentally skilled; I'd let others win when I could have easily bested them. They labeled me hyperactive and persecuted me for it and made me believe that I was the \\"wrong\\" one. My ego depended upon your acceptance, which was a weak foundation to begin with.When I read this book it was like looking into a mirror. I've always realized that I had to \\"let go\\" at some point but couldn't discern what I had to let go. Psychologists told me I had to listen and feel for others; they said that intellect shouldn't be a basis for friendship, less intelligent people could carry an emotional depth that would bring about a prosperous and rewarding relationship. What a lie! Dependence is that's called. They were a crutch that I used to create myself. This book revealed what everyone has effectively concealed from me: I could only rely upon myself. I feel guilt no longer. In some ways I'm now guided more so by my emotions than ever; these emotions aren't empty hunches but rational and logical reasoning. But, I guess, such things would be incomprehensible to those who base their lives around Ally McBeal, spiritual searching, and trends. I guess I should feel stupid because I had to discover this from a book. Well, I don't feel any such remorse. I've seen much in my short life; I've fallen for the best lies there are, ranging from self-sacrifice to spiritual enlightenment. None of these answered any questions or cleansed my soul in any way. The people who beat me down into a sniveling social worker are the collective minds of a hundred thousand years. I was bested by the best and have accepted the knowledge of my impotence. Everyone seems to believe that such a philosophy doesn't leave room for love, happiness, or emotions. Well, I disagree. I laugh when I'm happy and cry when sad (which isn't often). There are those I love, but I they aren't the foundation to my temple, only I take that honor. Others cannot hurt me anymore. This all came out of a single book, The Fountainhead. Laugh, flame, scorn, insult my grammar and organization, debase my intelligence, and attack my mistakes all you wish. You no long control me.Do I worship Ayn Rand? No. Unlike those of you who worship and dedicated yourselves to those who give you knowledge or freedom, I owe no debt to Ayn Rand. You describe those of us who subscribe (I like that term) to her philosophy as \\"drooling masses\\" and use that as a weapon to depersonalize my beliefs. Ayn Rand didn't create her philosophy any more than birds created air or chimps created bananas. There is truth in her writing and that is all that matters to me. Believe in your god or your neighbors and I will believe in my god, myself.I don't simple believe what Ayn Rand has to say. I've read the works of those who disagree with her such as R. Buckminster Fuller and still agree with Ayn. The Fountainhead wasn't meant to reflect reality but rather exists in a vacuum to prove a valid point. Maybe I enjoyed this book because I come from a fiction/sci-fi literature background and can easily accept the reality presented by the author.

Its most often a truth which is relevant within a range, taken out of its context , blown out of proportion to fit into all aspects of life and given a name.There is a certain amount of seductiveness to all philosophical schools.When you read them you tend to fall into the trap, atleast momentarily and Fountainhead is no exception.Well here the truth is world can be divided into two camps.The geniuses who are often ridiculed, but who form the pillars of civilization and the second raters who live through their lives sucking through the efforts of the former.The name given to this brand is &quot;Objectivism&quot;.Two characters Howard Roark, representing the genius camp and Ellsworth Toohy representing the later , Peter Keating an example of traditional orthodox brilliance , and an enigmatic Dominique make up the story.Architecture is the leitmotiv.While Keating tends to see it the traditional conformist way, the genius in Roark tends to see through the phoniness in most of traditional architecture.His designs tend to be radical and because of the same find little acceptance among hiscontemporaries.Fiercly individualistic he persists with his ideas.Ellsworth Toohy is the second rater who exploits the talents of the first raters.The concept is heavy and writing is sometimes inconsistent and incoherent.The literary quality is way below other philosophical novels like &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, for example.But inspite of the novel's shortcomings you cannot but help get influenced and moved by its power.And this is exactly where Ayn Rand triumphs."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"the longest book i have ever read and probably the most profound. i have often wondered if it was a sin to be truly original, to be able to follow my own vision and not give a damn about the masses. our society preaches individuality, but in reality, we don't want people to be &quot; too different &quot; then we chastise them for being freaky. we're not supposed to love our job; it's just something to pay the rent. is the need of one more than the need of many?ayn rand thinks so. and i'd like to thank her for writing this book. when i started reading it, i didn't read it for it's philosophical merits; i read it because it was a well known book. but i have to agree with some of the ideas she puts forth here. i think a man is honest, if he lives his life on his own terms. if he does work that is true in his mind and heart, and not simply for the masses. i think you help your fellow man most, by helping yourself first. then you can put yourself in a position.i could be all day talking about the characters. i will just say that they are dynamic. you won't get bored getting to know them.dominique francon is the most intriguing character in the book.more so than howard roarke. ellsworth toohey is the ultimate heavy....don't be afraid of the book's length...it goes by quickly... after reading this i feel courageous enough to take on longer stuff..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My, how time has a way of changing us. I first read The Fountainhead many years ago, while still in high school, and I clearly remember liking it a lot. It seemed then a compelling, well-written page-turner, filled with memorable characters and one finely-honed scene after another. So imagine my surprise when I picked the book up again not long ago and discoverd after only a few hundred pages that the brilliant masterpiece I remembered so fondly is in reality little more than turgid melodrama populated with cartoonish characters, all built around a philosophy (I use the word loosely) that only a self-centered egoist could have come up with.What are the elements of good literature? Consistently well-crafted prose? Multi-dimensional characters imbued with the foibles of real human beings? A grappling with mature themes and subject-matter? Boundless imaginative energy? Relentless narrative drive? The Fountainhead sadly falls short on all counts.The book's plot largely involves the tribulations of Howard Roark, a brilliant, dynamic architect whose singular vision of the future (which always takes the form of buildings, of course) is forever being thwarted by a world in which conformity is valued over individualism, and where Utilitarianism (the greatest good for the greatest number) is the overriding principle around which society is organized. The world of The Fountainhead, in short, is one that seeks to hobble genuis while rewarding mediocrity, and Roark, being something of a Knight errant, is determined to turn this world on its head. Aiding him in his quest is beautiful, headstrong Dominique, who despite her own strong will has a weakness for powerful men; and Guy Bannister, a newspaper magnate who sees in Roark the embodiment of an ideal that he himself lacks, and who willingly risks his hard-won empire to help further Roark's cause. Arrayed against Roark are an assemblange of sycophants, lackeys and dupes, all of whom Rand portrays as being little better than sheep. If you're looking for a novel that deals with life's gray areas, for a book that dares venture into the disorienting fog of ethics and morality, The Fountainhead is not for you. Here everything is either black or white, good or bad, right or wrong. On the other hand The Fountainhead does contain all of the elements of a good read. Romance. Murder. Deception. Betrayal. A climatic courtroom battle--in short, the very essence of good pulp fiction. But, unfortunately, Ayn Rand never intended The Fountainhead to be taken as pulp fiction, and as evidenced by more than a few of the reviews posted here, many of her readers don't see it as pulp fiction, either. They see it instead as a blueprint for the future.Admittedly, Rand's prose at its best is succinct and transparent, with sentences that move the story forward without getting too much in the way. And occasionally her writting is even borderline lyrical, especially in the book's early descriptive passages where Rand seems most at ease. But let her start describing one of her heroic characters -- Howard Roark, Dominique, Guy Bannister -- and all of a sudden we're deep in the land of Purple Prose. Every man's profile is seemingly chiseled out of granite. Every torso is as sharp and angular as the images in a cubist painting. Michelangelo's David would envy the physique Rand gives Howard Roark. Dominique's statuesque figure exists only in the imaginations of pre-pubescent boys. These aren't characters Rand is creating, certainly not characters meant to represent real flesh-and-blood human beings; these are merely cardboard cutouts that Rand can manipulate in the service of her plot, which in turn exists only to further explicate her sophmoric philosophy. And as for the character's thoughts and musings, they generally range from the historionic to the banal with little else in between. If one didn't know any better, one would swear these \\"people\\" all suffer from a sever case of bi-polar disorder. Case in point: Dominique is a model of independence, determined to make her own way in life; that is until Howard Roark rapes her (there's no other way to describe their first coupling), at which point she becomes totally subservient to Roark's will and ambition.For what it's worth, it's interesting to note that there isn't a single child to be found anywhere in Rand's massive tome. And the only two people who are less than physically perfect are the art critic Ellsworth Toohey (can there be any greater parasite than a professional critic?), and his \\"crippled\\" niece, a social worker (maybe not as bad as a critic, but still beyond redemption). In both cases their physical imperfections serve as outter manifestations of their inner flaws. Both characters are portrayed as morally weak, conniving, manipulative, and imprudent. And poor Ellsworth Toohey: descriced as squat, swarthy, hairy, with an almost rodent-like countenance, his appearance could easily have been lifted straight out of the agit-prop \\"literature\\" of 1930's Germany used to stir up anti-Semitism. In the forward to my paperback copy of The Fountainhead, Rand describes a night in the early 1940's, her book as yet unfinished, when she was overcome with a sense of dispair upon realizing that the vast majority of people in the world were far less intelligent, less ambitious, and less productive than was she. How could such a drab, uncreative world ever possibly understand the likes of a Howard Roark? A Dominique? A Guy Bannister? Or for that matter Ayn Rand herself? Fortunately for Rand, her husband was there to talk her out of her dispair that night, and thus she was able to finish her book and bequeath it to the undeserving masses.I guess this brings us finally to Rand's \\"philosophy\\" of Objectivism. But is it really a philosophy? as rigorously thought out as, say, Kant's theory of knoweldge? or Locke's principles of democratic government? Or is it really just a disjointed world-view expounded upon ad infinitum in one big novel after another. Personally, I believe the latter. Rand titled another of her books \\"The Virtues of Selfishness,\\" which in fact is a more apt description of her world-view than is Objectivism. But perhaps an even more apt desription would be \\"Survival of the Fittest,\\" or \\"Dog Eat Dog,\\" or \\"Every Man (and Woman) For Himself.\\" Because, after all, isn't that what Objectivism really is in the end? To quote that old poster from the Sixties: \\"You Do Your Thing, And I'll Do Mine, I'm Not Here To Fulfill Your Expectations, And You're Not Here To Fulfill Mine...\\" and so on and so forth. In other words, just let things run their course without rules or regulations, and in the end we'll see who comes out on top. The funny thing about the followers of Objectivism is that, like believers in reincarnation who all imagine themselves as having been kings and queens in past lives, Objectivists all see themselves as standing on top of the social and economic heap when the dust finally settles. And that may be so for a few of them. But the truth is, in a world where anything goes, for many of them, should they ever get their wish, it's just going to be one long hard scramble at the bottom of the hill.I never finished my second reading of The Fountainhead, and although I still have my copy of the book, I doubt I ever will. I'm giving the book two stars instead of one largely for sentimental reasons, and because more often than not the book is well written. If a young person ever asks me, should I read The Fountainhead? I'll say, \\"Sure, if you feel you must, then go ahead and enjoy it. But whatever you do, don't take the damn thing seriously.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you look further, you will find good reviews that outline the plot of The Fountainhead, so I will not offer my own summary. I will not comment about its merits as a novel either, other than saying that I read the whole damn thing in a day and a half, so it is obvious that I liked it.What I really want to talk about is its philosophical and ethical content, which in my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt.For starters, according to Ayn Rand compassion is nothing but a hypocritical lie, invented by totalitarian governments to control and degrade humans. While I can understand the emotional response of a woman that fled communist Russia, and later observed the excesses committed in her former country, that view is absolutely wrong.Setting aside the fact that I feel very bad for the people that do not believe in compassion and altruism (what could possibly have led them to that conclusion?), you don't even have to \\"defend\\" cooperation and compassion on ethical grounds.There is an enormous amount of biological evidence that shows that humans' behaviour (and of other social species) is determined by complex emotions, that combine both competitive and altruistic urges, to maximize reproduction potential.On another hand, and this will get me in trouble with other reviewers, Ayn Rand cheats while pleading her case. How is that? Well, basically she attributes a bunch of desirable characteristics on the good guys, and all kind of defects on the bad guys. That way, her philosophical beliefs are reinforced by the emotional response generated by prototypical characters (Roarke = intelligent, good looking, brave, independent = good; Toohey = intelligent, but devious and cruel, and bad looking = bad). If her story was told in a less biased way, her philosophical views would probably feel less &quot;evident&quot;.Such manipulation is not unlike the one displayed in bad action films, in which the bad guy kills in some horrible manner the family of the good guy during the first few minutes of the movie. That way, the writer can feel safe of not disappointing us in the end even though all we'll see is a totally simplistic and predictable final showdown, in which the good guy avenges his family.On another subject, please, never say things like: \\"this is the best book ever written, and people who can't see that are imbeciles\\". That only shows that you have totalitarian tendencies and that most likely you haven't read too many books.I wonder if Ayn Rand ever stopped to think how dogmatic and totalitarian her own views sounded?In the end, in my opinion this book deserves 3 stars (the average of four stars for the story and two for its philosophy)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Why I loved this book:-Roark is the ideal human, but is not out of reach to the reader; he is pure of thought and action, meaning he does not use others or steal other's ideas-- everything he does comes from his own creativity and intelligence-The passionate and sexy relationship between Roark and the woman he loves, Dominique. Dominique is his equal, but she seems to struggle with the fear of others who prey on the rawness of the person who puts their SELF/ideas/creative work out there. She hides her true self but knows she is good; Roark does not hide and he does deal with more adversity, but he also attains greatness and loved himself even through the dark times.-All the characters are relateable and interesting. (Note: this is where Atlas failed me-- the characters were too cold and fake)-Challenged me to respect my self more, to not be ashamed or think my own ideas suck.-Challenged me to bring out and strive towards the best I can possibly be.-Challenged me to not look to others for direction and acceptance, but to find these things within myself and trust my own judgement."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many people told me this was an anti-democrat book or a pro-republican book. They told me this book was all propaganda and would brainwash me. I read this novel like any other and it was good. Some characters bothered me, some scenes bothered me. But it is Rand's novel, not mine, so I read on.The people who told me this was Republican brainwashing material were really reaching. Communism and Socialism were the enemy schools of thought in this book. If you feel that those are the same as the democratic party, then yes, she condemns it. The Fountainhead promotes individuality and self-worth, not any specific political party.I didn't try to take this novel as a bible. I am not going to try to interpret the philosophy into a style of life. It was not life changing, but it was thought provoking.Overall, I enjoyed this book. Rand's writing style jumps from interesting situation to interesting situation, and as a result, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"While reading The Fountainhead five years ago I neither sought nor felt any real deeper meaning or lesson from it. I found it to be incredibly well written and thought it had excellent character development (with the exception of the protagonist Roark, who was too unusual to connect with in real time.) It is engaging and easy to read.More important is how often I find myself thinking \\"what would Howard do?\\" in stressful work and other life situations. If one judges a persons ego on their unwillingness to compromise a principal for the main purpose of staisfying others, Roark had the worlds largest ego. If one judges ego on their need to be admired and praised, he had no ego whatsoever.Compromising your principals will win you praise from others. Praise feeds the ego. Ego raises our expectations of what the world owes us. Raised expectations lead to self entitlement. Self entitlement leads to dissappointment. Then, when the world fails to deliver what your ego thinks it's owed, you have compromised your principals as well so there goes the ego!Roark had absolutely no interest in being praised. He wanted to create structures as he envisioned them and he wanted Dominique. He got what he wanted and everyone else went home dissappointed.This is almost a cartoonish way to live your life. One would never find long term happiness in treating their family and friends this way but I frequently come across situations where the thought of Roark makes me consider whether I'm doing something to win praise and feed my own ego or doing it because it's the right thing to do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I hadn't heard of Ayn Rand until I was in college. I met her through her writings as a \\"libertarian\\" and I didn't agree with those opinions. Although I was a philosophy student, I hadn't heard of objectivism, and given my previous exposure to her, I was quite wary of reading her novels.I'm sorry I hadn't read her novels first. I know that there are few objectivists in the world, and I'm not a strong one as far as they go, but I immediately related with the main character. I found this a totally successful novel (unlike Atlas Shrugged) because I was immediately drawn into novel through the characters.This also makes a compelling philosophical argument. After reading this it's hard to imagine that one shouldn't try to do the best work possible."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have read this book three times. I read regularly, and I value this book above all others. When I read any part or page or paragraph of this book I immediately experience a certain kind of joy that is expressed very, very beautifully in the Fountainhead. Every word that drips from the pages into my mind surges with life! That is the focus of my praise for this book: As a work of art. I find it incomprehensible how anyone could fail to appreciate this, even if they disagree completely with Ayn Rand's philosophical views. In response to the reviewers that have found distaste for this book, I offer the cautionary account that I, when I first read this book, could make almost no sense out of it at all. I deduced that philosophically it was very pro-individualism, and this I liked, but beyond that my insight saw no further. I tasted the individualism, and more I didn't even realize I was tasting, and I came back to this book twice more. Since then I have matured and learned so much more about what it means to be alive, and in The Fountainhead I see a philosophical monolith both structured and woven with brilliant metaphors and an artistry of the english language rarely found.Ayn Rand was a bitter genius who saw into a part of reality deeper than anyone had previously done, and for this she was condemned? I embrace this fact fully, but I want to cast it away! Is bitterness unforgiveable? Is insight immoral? Anyone who is unable to find value in this book has never known for the most fleeting moment what it means to be alive!Feeling unqualified satisfaction with what I have just said, I want to add that I do not agree completely with Ayn Rand's philosophical ideas. But that is not important. What is important is that the book presents her philosophical ideas as elegantly and as powerfully as a fiction novel is capable of achieving.If you have any sense whatsoever that on occasion it is a noble thing for a human being to go to a secluded corner of the Universe and think for himself or herself, absent any regard to what others have thought before, and to enjoy this, and to use this thinking to change things, to create, then the totality of Ayn Rand's faults will seem trivial as this book causes you to exist more than you had existed before."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is the story of Howard Roark, the fiercely individual, independent, and unbreakable architecht. He is the ultimate testament to human spirit. The Fountainhead is wonderful for the intellectual intrigue in exploring Rand's philosophy, and in its own right, as a gripping story of Roark's perseverance in the face of countless obstacles.Howard Roark sets out to design buildings as he knows they should be: pragmatically. And he will not bow to pressures to build ostentatious works, regardless of the costs to his career. He suceeds on his own terms -- the only way to truly do so -- while ignorant tabloids and untalented, unprincipled coleagues do everytyhing in their power to bring him down.Also interesting is the novel's exploration of Rand's objectivism: the notion that the individual should never lie prostrate to the masses. Even in the extremes, the seeming selfishness of her philosohpy can be forgiven here, as the polar opposites in the novel -- the \\"altruists\\" are more manipulative and self-interested than any self-proclaimed \\"selfish\\" character of the novel. A must read, both to enjoy on an intellectual/philisophical level, and for the simple enjoyment of reading a gripping, well-written novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand managed to find the perfect way to capture my attention, because I am an architecture nut. Maybe it comes from growing up in Chicago--Frank Lloyd Wright territory. At any rate, early in the book, the protagonist Howard Roark is &quot;accused&quot; of designing buildings that don't look like anyone else's. They're great, as everyone with an eye for architecture can see, but they don't conform to everyone else's expectations. I can relate to that, because I am a struggling fiction writer, and have yet to &quot;categorize&quot; my own writing. Reading Rand made me realize that this is not such a bad thing. This is a story about the value of achievement, and how the world is made better by the unique contributions of creative minds.To get the story of The Fountainhead, you can rent the movie (which is great, and stars two of my favorites, Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal). However, to get the flavor of Rand's ideas, you need to read the book. In fact, if you have a serious interest in philosophy, it might not hurt to read all of her books. The fiction is mostly just an excuse to expound upon the philosophy.I read The Fountainhead at a time when I was pretty aimless in life, and so I'd have to say that the book gave me courage and the desire to read more Rand. I did. This is probably Rand's best piece of fiction. Atlas Shrugged, while impressive for its relentless, moral defense of capitalism, is more of an extended lecture in philosophy.I read one review which referred to the behavior in this book as &quot;masochistic&quot; or &quot;sadistic.&quot; I think, somehow, that that's a misreading of the text. You have to accept (at least for the purpose of &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;) the author's viewpoint, or you just won't get where these characters are coming from.There are strong characters and there are weak characters. The strong characters' &quot;masochism&quot; derives from their temporary willingness to submit to the whims of others. The weak characters' masochism comes from deliberately submitting themselves to the whims of others when they KNOW that others are wrong but don't have the strength of character to stand up for themselves. Rand's vision is not compromising, nor terribly sympathetic, but it does make you think.I will add one bit that I read somewhere else. Frank Lloyd Wright, when asked about The Fountainhead, said that Rand neglected to include those moments when an architect laughs, looks at a problem from a new light, and says, &quot;What a fool I've been!&quot; I agree, and that is where I part company from Rand. Many of us learn much from error and laughter. Rand's characters are a little too &quot;perfect&quot; and a little too cold to appreciate the value of either. If you've read this far, you might as well pick up The Fountainhead. It's only a little longer (kidding)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Yet again, a story about the ideal man. Yet again, a tale of a hero. And again, individual versus society. Been there, done that.But never with these epic proportions, and never as well written as this.Like the rest of Rand's novels, you either love it or hate it. I just started reading Rand this year, and although I disagree with her philosophy in many areas, I have to revere her brilliant, bitter writing style; it made her book live and breathe in a way that few other books do. I found the character of Roark to be decent, but I think that too much emphasis was placed on his cold selfishness and his indifference toward most people. Dominique Francon and Gail Wynand, on the other hand, were much more human and convincing. The philosophy when Roark was on trial could be cut, but ultimately, this novel casts a ray of hope when there seems to be none."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book was helpful in giving insight into how people should live life. It signifies the creations of mankind and how we can learn from their actions. I really enjoyed the ideologies of Roark. I loved how he practiced architecture not for the money and fame, but for passion. He was a creator that practiced originality. He believed that every building has its own purpose for its certain surroundings. In a way this can be correlated to us humans. We ourselves have to stay original to ourselves. It will do us no good to immitate the actions of others as it will only lead us to self destruction. It is these correlations that give this novel praise."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Okay, the person who originally said this didn't say 'mind-tuck', but for the sake of decency (and I don't want to be scolded by the Amazon censors), 'mind-tuck' will have to do. But I think y'all know what I mean.This book, which I've had in my \\"Will Someday Read\\" pile since my junior year of college, has finally been read - 14 years later. And well worth the wait, I may add. It's probably for the best that time has gone by and life experience has accured for I may not have been able to appreciate all the intricacies and intrigues of this novel back when I was 19.The book is definitely a page turner. Ayn Rand has a superb sense of pacing in drama. If it were written by anyone else, it would have been a pure fluff soap piece. The characters are fleshed out to the point where they seem quite real. Every sentence that comes from a character's mouth is consistent with the groundwork Rand has laid for that character.Roark, the fiercely independent architect. Who doesn't want to be more like him? How can you beat Roark's reply when asked \\"What do you think of my work?\\" Roark's response? \\"I don't.\\" BURN! Roark is the person you want to be at your high school reunion. The person you want to be when you run into that ex. Unflappable, determined and single minded, never wavering from course.On the flipside is Peter Keating. A whiny, self-important, wishy-washy fraud of a man. A well-dressed, blubbering mess. A man who wants nothing more in life than to be admired by others.Dominique, the intelligent femme-fatal, able to get any man she sets her sights on but only wanting the one that gives her the most chase. She mirrors Roarck in her intensity and singlemindedness. A strong woman with incredible faith that things will work out in the end.The monologues given by some of the key characters were - at least, to me - breathtaking. Roark's vituperative speech about 'second-handers' had me talking back to the book, much in the manner of 'screen talking'. At other times, I had to get up and pace around my apartment. So much happens in this book that it would be impossible to 'summarize' the plot here. I can only describe my reaction to the book.This novel left me feeling as if I had ended a long term relationship. I didn't want it to end and didn't quite know what to do with the time I had previously reserved for reading the book. I began looking for the Roarks and Keatings in my own life. When faced with a tricky social situation, I asked myself, \\"What would Roark do?\\" I found myself re-reading passages and mentioning the book to all who would listen. One good friend of mine decided to take my advice and borrowed my bedraggled and marked up copy to read on his trip to Korea. When he came back from the trip and called, the first thing he said was not about his experiences in Korea, but instead, \\"Man, that was a 900 page mind-'tuck'!\\" I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with my fellow reviewer's opinions. Ayn Rand is brilliant, and I could not put this book down. Never have I encountered such compelling characters - or a more honest look at society. Don't be influenced by others - read the book and find out for yourself that this book beautifully celebrates man - you will come away from from it feeling proud."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's fascinating and complex characters and her insight into American society are what make \\"The Fountainhead\\" such a powerful classic. Though it contains some out-dated themes, the timeless story of one man's vision and integrity in the face of impossible obstacles is still profound and enjoyable over a half a century after it was written.Ayn Rand's descriptions are mesmerizing but she is never much of a romantic. The love story angle is weaker here than in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". While Dominique may seem unrealistic and difficult to identify, the story's main character, the unbendable, unbreakable Howard Roark, will always remain one of the most memorable in American literature.There is an interesting side note about this novel-- Rand's inspiration for Roark, Frank Lloyd Wright, refused to ever meet the famous author despite several attempts on her part, a typically Howard Roark thing to do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I absolutely loved this book, and I'm thinking that I'm going to love the other Rand books I have yet to read. This book is quite philosophical, so you are looking for a beach read, mystery, or simple romance, look elsewhere. It is not for everyone, but if you read the first few pages, you will probably either find yourself hooked, or put it away fairly quickly.I was supposed to read this book as part of a special program in the third grade, but I'm very glad that I didn't, I probably would not have understood even a tenth of it. The theme of the book is fairly serious, and as I mentioned before, very philosophical, so I doubt I would have gotten the full meaning back then. It's a huge book, but I spent every spare minute I had reading it, and it just took me a couple of days. It is a wonderful book and provides a very insightful look into the human spirit in its various forms, and how it can either shape or be shaped by society. I already have my copy of Atlas Shrugged, and will undoubtedly be reading it soon. If you are a fan of Ayn Rand's books, don't miss this one! If you're not, you probably won't like this one either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a very powerful story. Ayn Rand explored good and evil like no one else.

It is by the very virtue of lust that power exists among the like minded who think, and are in a materialist sense, capable of influencing and dominating the people who have no easy means of proving their potential, except their voice. Men have lusted for power since ages. It is a natural emotions, and deceptive enough. It is somehow inherent in any individual who cannot tolerate the co-existance of another superior being. Men have been mentors, there is something called conditioning of the mind, in which people are made to belive in certain theories in life. The earlier it happens more ruthless a person becomes. It is easy to affect ordinary, regular men and women who can be driven like flocks. Amongst them who are easily bored in life of secondary positions in life for themselves, but who wish for othes to remain in the backseat, must become supreme by cutting down any possibolity of opportunity of thought and action among the other. And lesser lot is the only word that the others must be confined toFountainhead is about Howard Roark, a firm believer in himself.

It's my first Rand book; I've heard more about Atlas Shrugged but wanted to read her first book first.I have rather mixed feelings about this novel. I love the message as I thought I would. Other reviewers I'm sure have covered that aspect of the book adequately so I won't get into it here. I loved it because it spoke to me, my experiences in life so far, and deals with a topic so rarely addressed.My gripe is with the more mundane stuff--her writing. If I had a penny for every appearance of the word \\"bromide\\" or \\"whom\\" I'd be posting this review from a luxury resort somewhere. The book is 70 years old and it shows it the stiff writing style.Rand also fails to give the characters any real depth with the possible exception of Ellsworth. For a novel about a topic so near to the author's heart (and presumably many of her readers) this makes reading it a dull experience. Only the continuous pace of the story kept me going.And lastly this is an unnecessarily wordy book. Rand loves to spend a page or two on something that only requires a paragraph. Only when you've dug through 80 percent does the story become interesting. Rand seems to love writing but not storytelling.Still I recommend this book (with the above caveats) but perhaps only because I haven't read Atlas Shrugged yet.

I am a bit disappointed that the persons that transferred this book to Kindle did not do a better job at proof reading in order to prevent the simple errors that are very distracting throughout the progress of this book. I also do not like that there is only one review form for both copies because mine will probably get lost among the others and I do not want to give this book as a whole a low rating because there is a good story line and I like the way that the author builds on her characters.

I found it hard to concentrate on but it did string me along to find out what eventually became of the principal characters.There are five of these. Howard Roarke an architect who's an egocentric uncompromising self proclaimed genius, Peter keating who's a middle of the road architect fully aware of his limitations but quite successful ( and envious of Roarke), Gail Winart an arch typical news paper mogul who vainly assumes he can rule the world by what he publishes, Enrite Tuey a crashing bore who values only his own opinion; a person you couldn't argue with so end up agreeing with to get him out of your hair and Dominique Francone a silly (if not stupid) female who thinks she can protect her lover (Howard) from the ravishes of mediocrity by trashing his reputation and marrying his enemies. This is all in vain because Howard doesn't give a damn one way or the other; but they end up married.Poor old Peter is swamped by all the quasi intellectualism and is vilified by the author for being more or less normal.The story plods on page after page without achieving much until the last chapters when Howard finally releases his philosophy to the universe during his trial for burning down what he proclaimed to be an insult to architecture. However, his diatribe, although crucial to the outcome of the story (the jury release him based on this) doesn't contain anything that would be used in a book on philosophy or human enlightenment. But the author obviously thinks this is the kernel of her 'great' story. If there were any other philosophical truths lurking between the lines I failed to detect them.Not in any way comparable to, say, Jane Austin for story, characterization and humanity.Note: I listened to an unabridged CD version of this book therefore the name spelling may be in error."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Review by Jack TrammellThe Fountainhead is a brilliant novel, written by a brilliant thinker--but it has been greatly abused in the name of so-called Objectivism and in terms of Capitalism and Christianity. While Howard Roark stands sublime and triumphant at the metaphorical pinnacle of modernism and individualism (at the top of his own architectural masterpiece, a skyscraper of steel rising above the ordinariness of the city below), his now obedient wife at his side (Dominique), and his enemies humbled (Gail Wynand) or banished (Ellsworth Toohey), the novel none-the-less ends with the central issues of modernity and of morality completely unresolved in terms of plot.This novel, taken as a whole and as philosophy, is in reality nothing less than a scathing indictment of Capitalism and of modernity, and antagonistic to the most basic tenants of Christianity. Roark may indeed be a literary hero (and his counterpart, Peter Keeting, a literary goat), but in terms of realpolitik Roark represents selfishness, arrogance, and utter disdain for man as a social creature. To quote one reviewer of the book, \\"it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point,\\" and the point according to the overarching storyline is that any individual man does not need any other man (or woman). All of the characters, including Roark, engage in a Capitalist orgy of the self, recognizing no profit but that which pads the economy of their own egos.From an Anarcho-Syndicalist perspective, The Fountainhead represents a kind of postmodern self-obsession, a fairy tale trip into the delusion that anything we do is disconnected from other people, or somehow does not build upon the work (and ideas) of others. It is actually a stark warning of what happens if you take the philosophy underlying Capitalism and a totally free market economic system to its ultimate logical, supposedly amoral conclusion--a conclusion that assumes concepts like tangible social progress, the beneficence of economic Darwinism, and the complete realization and perfection of self.Even Rand's intentionally collectivist character, Toohey, amounts to nothing more than a self-centered, power hungry, deluded intellectual trapped inside his own notions of progress. His altruism amounts to the benevolence of the dictator who seeks power only as a means to self-actualization.The basic tenants of Christianity are to love one another, to share resources (the fish and loaves), and to value the individual within the collective (as demonstrated complexly in the disciples' argument over who was the greatest among them). There is not a character in Rand's story that comes remotely close to those ideals, nor one who uses his profits, be they monetary or intellectual, to further the collective health of his fellow men and women (and Toohey, least of them).The Fountainhead represents nihilism, greed and callousness; the very aspects of Capitalism that constantly call its moral foundation into question.###"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading through the comments (especially a lot of the \\"one stars\\"), it basically seems like the cult of personality surrounding Rand and her philosophies has led to the heated reviews of this book. It seems to me that a lot of people are raving about how brilliant her ideas are (because they agree with her) or how terrible she is (because they disagree with her). While this is fine, my comment will simply address THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK as someone who picked it up without knowing anything about Ayn Rand and as someone writing a review strictly from what I read.While I do not agree with Rand's overall philosophies, I will simply say this: This is the best written novel I have ever read with an enchanting and complicated story. Yes, the characters are unrealistic caricatures of the philosophies they represent. The book is an allegory - it's supposed to be that way. All allegories from all philosophers I've ever read (as someone studying philosophy in university) are this way. The characters represent ideas in process of framing the philosophy of Objectivism.The book is long, and with a full course load in college it took about four months to read. Even if you think the ideas are crazy, it is still a brilliant and tasteful story that is filled with insightful allegories. The writing flows beautifully.On a final note, I must include that I learned a lot about architecture from this book. It really helped me appreciate the design and effort that goes into the buildings I enter every week and helped me see beautiful art in everyday life. It also got me started in a rudimentary ability to recognize certain styles in architecture - which is in and of itself something priceless to walk away from a book with."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of those ceiling shattering books you only read every five years or so. A book that is powerful enough to change one's world view for months after they read it should not be missed.

To me, you are one of the greats."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Truly a brilliantly written story that was years ahead of its time. A page turner that I couldn't put down if ever there was one. Ayn Rand saw where the world was headed with socialism long before the masses. I felt as if I was reading stories in todays papers. The world needs more Howard Roark's, especially in public office at the national level. Sadly Washington DC and the world is filled with Toohey's. Personal responsibility and achievent is penalized and so-called victims of capitalism and other parasites of society are lauded and branded as undeserved heroes. Half of American households are receiving tax payer funds in some form. This can never be sustained. Europe is already too far gone, but maybe the U.S. can be rescued from the evils of collectivism if we wake up immediately and realize individual freedom and the capitalist spirit ordained by our brilliant founders is what made us the greatest country in the history of the world. Pitty Ayn Rand's wonderful novels couldn't have been read more widely and the common-sense ideals propagated applied much sooner."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Set in the world of architecture and the arts, 'The Fountainhead' tells the roles and lives of four influential people.Peter Keating. An ambitious but mediocre architect who rises to the top through patronage and plagiarism.Ellsworth Toohey,an Iago like figure, who manipulates and grooms public opinion.An advocate of alturism and collectivism which he uses to exploit others for his own political ambitions.Gail Wynand, the born poor, made good (but unfullfilled) ruthless newspaper baron who shamelessly courts and creates popular public opinion which gives him vast wealth and associated power.Howard Roark, a maligned genius who lives for the pure joy of creating and existing.And intertwined is the beautiful Dominique Francon....Rand uses their stories to illustrate her philosophy of 'Objectivism';the individual spirit and freedom of man against collectivism;that mankinds advances are made by individual freethinkers who are always hated by mob man,who only benefits-ultimately-from these advances. The mob man who cannot invent and lives of the backs of those that do.When Rand wrote this (1943) the world was very much dominated by collectives-from communism on the left to fascism on the right with laissez faire to dogmatic socialism in between. It was an age where freedom of the individual was much under threat, and Rand wasn't alone in this idea or feeling. George Orwell-no less-recreates Rands distopian collectivism oppressing the freedom of man in '1984' and 'Animal Farm'(With 'Keep the Aspidistra Flying' as a prequel where Gordon Comstock is forced into conformity)As a novel, 'The Fountainhead' -for me who has read both authors;I know fans of either will be up in arms!-is very much like the works of Upton Sinclair ('Oil!' for eg) as both use very stylised characactures (pantomime ?)to illustrate their philosophies and ideologies,albeit from different sides of the fence.Realism isn't what its really about. Initially, it was difficult to see who were Rand's heroes and villans, and Dominiques relations to Roark are quite bizarre. But it all adds up by the end of the novel and it is a good read for all that.Rand seems to provoke violent reactions, but having actually read this work and understood her philosophy, it definately does have a place in modern debate, and I seriously doubt-now- that her fiercest critics have actually read beyond a precis,second hand opinions,or a few chapters.(And the same goes for some of her most ardent fanatics!)Rands philosophy is observable. From the damning of Galileo and Da Vinci (would we have been flying way before the Wright brothers if his ideas were pursued?) to the religious 'collectives' of Iran and Pakistan today-all of whom rely on a free thinking inventive west for any technology they have. They are Rand's 'Second Handers' without a doubt. And where free West Germany made the BMW and Mercedes, collective East Germany gave the world the Trabant! But the problem-as with all ideologies- is that they want to be absolute, and its more this 'absolutism' that destroys freedoms.Man exists somewhere inbetween all of them. And not to forget, probably mankinds greatest ever achievement came about through collective thought and invention; the Apollo mission.An unlikely legacy of Rand ? When Roark built Monadnock, the developers thought it would be a sure fire failure and sold 200% worth of stock in it. It was a success and they went to jail. Was Mel Brookes inspired by this to write 'The Producers'?! And a billboard advertising 'Romeo and Juliet' as a simple love story; 'A boy from the Bronx meets a girl from Brooklyn'.....'West Side Story'??To keep ahead of all angles of every debate,'The Fountainhead' is a very good read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have no qualms with the content of the book.

I may have to buy another edition. Cheers!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The book driven mainly by a single character, Howard Roarke, an architect who is the symbol of ideals, values, morals and principles leaves us in doubt. Who gets the credit? Howard Roarke or Ayn Rand, the author? Ayn has created Roarke to perfection and his ability to stick to his strong ideals in the face of adversity leaves the readers with a sense of deference towards Roarke. The main theme of the book is whether an individual has to live for himself or should he survive by appeasing the whims and fancies of all around. The latter is referred to as the Second Hander. According to the author, the creativity of the owner is modified by the second hander to get adoration and admiration that would prove to be futile in the long run.The Fountainhead is a simple story of the life of two different kind of architects - Peter Keating(second hander) and Howard Roarke(creative idealist). Roarke is suspended from Stanton institute in his final year of his architectural study as he refuses to believe in the confined system of education that provides nothing to enhance his ability. On the contrary, Keating sticks to his education which lands him in a top architect firm in New York city. The initial struggle of Roarke reduces him to penury and the roaring success of Keating(thanks to Roarke's help in various architectural drawings) makes him the top architect of the country. There is a stage in Roarke's life, where he has not paid his office rent for two months, telephone bills, electricity bills for the same duration and the remainder of his life cringes on a bank contract that he eagerly awaits. In spite of his hard-stricken financial position, Roarke has the guts to refuse the contract since the committe members suggest modifications in his drawing. This tells us the kind of stance taken by Roarke in the worst of circumstances. He undertakes all kinds of work to keep his life moving, even going to the extent of working in a quarry. At a later stage, he meets the woman of his life - Dominique Francon. They share a passionate relationship and Dominique's mind-duels with Roarke forms a very interesting and fascinating sequence. Howard Roarke's association with Gail Wynand, the owner of the prestigious newspaper The Banner, who also happens to be Dominique's husband, steps up Roward in the success ladder. Whether Roarke is successful to stick to his ideals and live out his life in peace forms the essence of this brilliantly crafted book.This is a book that really gives the reader to ponder whether he is on the right path of fulfilling his dreams. Fountainhead springs forth the virtues of solitude - the ability to think alone. The highly philosophical drama embedded with strong messages is a must read for people who look forward for a book without any tinge of commercial elements - thriller, mystery or romance."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand is an amazing writer. This book is such a breath of fresh air. You don't see any story lines like this anymore. The people who do not like her seem to have more of a problem with her philosophy versus her story and writing. If you yell a lot about the rich getting richer then you're probably predisposed to dislike this book but I still highly recommend you open your mind and give it a shot. If nothing else maybe you'll understand your enemy's frustration."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Wow. This book was such a treat to read on so many levels! Don't be intimidated by the length - this book is incredibly readable, and you can read just a few pages at a time and enjoy what you are reading. However I guarantee by the end you will be up all night to see how it unfolds. I really was not sure up until the very end. This book is more than just a story of characters, it is a story of society, of power, and an assessment of what makes man tick. You can read it at any level you want. The book has helped me put my finger on many things I have thought about myself and others - it has expressed why I might like or dislike a person, and it explains why different personalities act as they do. Although the author is strong in her convictions, she allows alot of room for interpretation. How I interpret scenes may not be how others interpret the same scenes- thus it is a wonderful book for discussion. This is one of the few books where the character development is sufficient that i actually bothered to \\"question motives\\" of fictional characters - something I usually am uninspired to do. A word of caution, many of the characters are portrayed in absolutist terms, something which normally does not appeal to me. However in this book, it really helped to clarify my thinking on the matters which the author is presenting. In a nutshell, it was more than just brilliant, it was truly memorable."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Another example of Ms. Rand's understanding of our future in this country. She understood liberals before they had a title."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Howard Roark, struggling architect, has to compete with meritocracy and the system. He has no intention of corrupting his principals. The world (good guys and bad guys) plans to do that for him. So he finds a unique solution.I have read the book, saw the movie (1949, Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey) and listened to the audio tapes. Each media gives a different feel to her story and brings out the underlying message in different ways. If this is your first Ayn Rand book then either you are in high school (where they think this is the pentacle her work) or you started in the middle of here forming. Other books as \\"We the Living\\", she knew something was wrong, but did not know what it was. In \\"The Fountain Head\\", she puts her finger on the symptoms and rebels against them. In \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", she finally identifies the source of the problem and even if it seems like a surrealistic story, she offers concrete solutions. Out of this process Objectivism was born.Atlas ShruggedWe the Living"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is an epic story between good and evil. It details the life of the unrecognized genius of protagonist Howard Roark and his struggle against the cunning and evil Ellsworth Toohey. Howard Roark is an unconventional and creative architect whose style is not commonly accepted among the masses. The book eloquently recounts his battle to make people see beyond the materialistic opinions of others and think for themselves. Ayn Rand truly highlights her controversial philosophy in a way that truly envelopes you in her world. However, this book is not just a philosophical revelation. It also recounts the turbulent relationship between him and Dominique, a beautiful yet violent daughter of one the most successful architects in New York City. This book has captured one of the most twisted and exciting love triangles of all time. Though heavy and slow - going at times I truly enjoyed The Fountainhead. It has achieved its ultimate purpose - to change the way I think about the world and the purpose of my life. I would recommend this book to nearly everybody. For if you cannot extract life long lessons from this novel, you will at least walk away with the ultimate story of evil, romance, and the triumph of the human will."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"THE FOUNTAINHEAD was my first exposure to Ayn Rand and her objectivist ideas. I'm surprised how much I enjoyed it. This novel is brimming with Rand's philosophy, but also presents a very compelling story about a man (the brilliant architect Howard Roark) who refuses to compromise his integrity against all odds. For the most part, this book is a real page turner.This type of novel isn't for everyone. The writing is dry in spots, and much of the dialogue is stilted and unrealistic. But I do really admire Rand's ambition here. In THE FOUNTAINHEAD, she tries to convey a lot of big and demanding ideas that are normally not expressed by the mainstream media, or by most of the artistic community. This book, in many ways, is one of a kind.Although I don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's philosophy, I still found myself looking at society in new and different ways after finishing this book. So this is the type of novel that can change your world view. And even if it doesn't, it's an interesting experience that you won't forget. I heartily recommend THE FOUNTAINHEAD to those interested in being challenged as well as entertained."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a very good book. Would I call it incredible, nuanced, beautiful art exposing the foibles and contradictions of the human condition? Hardly. But if you encounter Rand understanding the world in which she was raised- Communist Soviet Russia- all her works become flagrant, indeed beautiful manifestations of how important it is to honor an individual's life, ideas, work, and soul. The Fountainhead is an enduring testament to the importance of the free-market, and a disturbing reminder of those regimes who laid waste to millions of human lives."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The topics that Ayn Rand chose to write about are dense. Her books make every woman or man think about their potential. Society is challenging and Rand paints a picture of people who face the challenges and succeed.

These books will challenge your views of society, politicts and potential."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"\\"The Fountainhead\\" was the first of Ayn Rand's works that I read. After reading \\"We the Living\\", I understand her a little more, but I think that this still lags behind.Ayn Rand is a good writer, but even lovers of long fiction will find this to be a little extreme. Rand took an interesting idea and puffed it up into a huge novel. It was fascinating. It was good. But still? There were times where it was just \\"wow, ease up a bit\\".The thing is, I didn't find it boring for a moment. I was sucked in from the first word and I wasn't able to put it down until I finished. The story constantly moved and shifted, and if a part was boring, it was because someone had decided to have a four-page long monologue. A bit long-winded, a bit dull.For the most part, though, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is fascinating. I thought the characters were interesting because they were so vivid and different. I liked the plotline, and I liked the characters. I thought the ending was interesting. It's a good piece of fiction, though it would probably be better if Rand had cut back on some of the too-long speeches some of the characters are prone to giving. I didn't find it as well-written or good as \\"We the Living\\" (which I actually read after this, and really liked), but this is still good. It's a challenge any serious reader should take on.If you read \\"We the Living\\", know that this isn't as good. If you're new to Rand and want to take on the challenge, start out here. It's a good jumping off point."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Howard Roark, an iconoclastic loner, gets kicked out of Stanton Institute of Technology a year to graduation; Peter Keating, a top of the class student, gets a job in a prestigious firm. Two architects, two visions, one story about the Fountainhead.From Ayn Rand's introduction, when she observes that \\"Religion's monopoly in the field of ethics had made it extremely difficult to communicate the emotional meanings...of a rational view of life,\\" my goal was to understand Objectivism (her philosophy). By the end, it was still murky, but I had an engrossing read.The plot is simple, yet complex. In Democracy in America, Tocqueville noted that the egalitarian tendency made it harder for people to disagree with the status quo - they would have to stand alone, ostracized and broken by separation. Roark accepts this as his cross, the price paid for his ideals, reveling in the rejection of his modernist architectural concepts. Keating, meanwhile, backs the right horse, advancing to the top of his firm, designing the most popular buildings of his time. It is the end that matters, and we know Roark - a true Randian hero - triumphs at last. Still he seemed too cocksure to be real; his perambulations quickly grew tiring: This was my main grouse with the book - the stiff, unnatural, didactic dialogue.\\"Man's first duty is to himself\\" is a rejection of Communism. However her philosophy ends up being antidemocratic - \\"No work is ever done collectively, by majority decision.\\" This is not objectionable in itself, what jolted me was the possibility that Objectivism and Communism would reach the same end - a stateless society.If you are looking for provocative reading, forget the naysayers and critics and pick up The Fountainhead; =after all \\"it is so much easier to pass judgment on a man than an idea.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I gave Ayn 2 stars just for the amazing amount of words devoted to this tripe.

I'm bashed about the head again with the same ideals... then again... and again... and again. The story is boring, the prose is uninteresting, the story insulting (especially to women), and the philosophy is wanting. I rather thought it was like treking through mud with rubber boots.

I read Atlas Shrugged about 25 years ago and found it to be an overwritten bore. Some interesting points, but certainly not worth the effort of 1100 plus pages to pour through it all. Admittedly, the Fountainhead reads far better than Atlas, but it still suffers the typical Rand oversimplification plague: Her contention about the evils of collectivism is so wrought with emotion, that her dialog ends up being incredibly superficial. When the Stanton Dean contends that &quot;everything worth doing has already been done&quot; it just doesn't ring true. What 20th century person of ANY intelligence would ever say that phrase with a straight face? Collectivism or not, I have never met anyone who believes that, in or out of the education ranks.The art of good writing is to show strong aspects of both sides of the debate. Ayn Rand is so fervently on one side, she actually derails her entire argument. Roark and Keating are nothing but bad caricatures, rather than flesh and blood characters. There's no depth to Rand's ideas. Even her introduction to the 25th edition (1968) has a lot sour grapes dripping all over it, although for what reason I am not so sure. I guess the 1960's were probably a bummer for Rand. The hippie generation's central theme was everyone getting together (hence, a form of collectivism, ouch, Ayn!).Had Ayn Rand lived into this century, she probably would have been ecstatic with FOX NEWS and Rush Limbaugh (or Sean Hannity, for that matter) could have been her real life Howard Roark(s) model."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Here's a helpful hint: When a person makes an argument as obviously flawed as the one I just made (see two reviews below), it's likely he/she is making fun of someone (in this case paranoid negative reviewers who don't know the definition of \\"fascism\\").

It's been referred to with the most clarity as the \\"selfish gene\\": Not meaning that an individual has a particular gene that makes them selfish, but that we all have genes that demand to be passed on, and thus compel us to behave selfishly: to hog resources, to create as many babies as we can (for the males at least), to lie and cheat to clamber our way to the top of the evolutionary pile, or at least make sure that our particular genes aren't extinguished in this round.And it makes perfect sense. Obviously, in the stone age, those who didn't get enough resources perished along with their genetic code, and those who produced more offspring were more likely to pass the code on to future generations. The result: we're now in the 21st centure with an artifact in our brains telling us to do whatever it takes to maintain status, resources, and offspring.Now, what are the most base, shallow, crude, and salient indicators of reproductive fitness primitive man and woman would have looked for? Simple: Secondary sex charcteristics and wealth. The former needs no explanation, the latter indicates ability to survive, intelligence, power, etc. etc. Never mind that there are people who are incredibly weatlhy now who have little intelligence, wit, or work ethic (eg Paris Hilton) our primitive brain still sees all that wealth and says \\"good good, me likey\\" or just \\"oooohhh shiny\\".Now we have Ms. Rand- pseudo-intellectual poser writ large. With her bloated, pedantic, patronizing tome, glorifying monkey brain style status indicators and by god, your right to seek them at all costs. \\"Altruism is for the weak\\" shouts the Ape Queen. She towers over her drone-like followers as they worship at the temple of their own primitive drives, now given legitimacy (at least in their minds) by this and a few other of her \\"novels\\", snapping and salivating at any who may have the audacity to question the sanity of their philosophy.Can't we all agree in this age that this kind of dressed up selfishness just doesn't work? Sadly no.For those about to whine that I \\"didn't review the book\\", if the entire philosophy underlying the book is bankrupt, then by reviewing it, I am, in essence, reviewing the book. The plot and characters are just paper-thin window dressing for said philosophy anyway.Ok, so altruism is bad eh? For the weak you say? Ethical self-interest you say? Let's look at that under the clear light of science, not the murky bog of philosophy.If we have different genetic groups, let's call them \\"races\\" (though that term is somewhat dubious from a strictly genetic perspective, but we self organize based of \\"race\\" so its useful), and these races tend to group together to promote their own interests over those of other groups WHICH THEY DO (because at a, usually, unconscious level, they realize that they share more genes with each other than with those in the outgroup), and if there are limited resources WHICH THERE ARE...Now if we remove altruism from the picture because its \\"for the weak\\", and we say that the self-interest of the individual is paramount at all times, then it follows that the group in power could and SHOULD exterminate the weaker group(s).Ah, that's \\"unethical\\" you say. Why? Because its morally bankrupt? Because no one in their right mind would say that's ok? But that's the end result of your insane philosophy isn't it? It's funny how when its put in this light you all have a hard time standing by your own conclusions.But there it is. Allowing outgroups to use your resources up IS altruism, plain and simple.

If anything, I would consider Howard to have been extremely lucky in getting away with being an architect who considered his clients to be guinea pigs for his creative ideas.Howard's statements in his own defense at the final trial, in which he draws a comparison between the creative human spirit behind the first use of fire and that of his own experiments in architecture, are contemptuous. In my opinion, Ayn Rand could have show-cased her philosophy of objectivism more effectively by grounding her story in some other profession which has a more direct impact on people's lives than in the field of architecture.In summary, I found many parts of the story defying common sense and what emerges from the book is the mindless quest of two cold individuals who want to have their own way in the world, oblivious to whether they fit into the larger interests of society and in the process willing to subject themselves to adultery and violent schemes-all in the name of pioneering human progress.

It espouses the cause of the gifted and unique individual against the forces of conformity, be those political ideologies or the attempt within interest groups and professions to promote consensual mediocrity over genius. It also espouses capitalism naked in tooth and claw against any form of collectivism. This philosophy has thrived in post-Carter America. The book itself is poorly written because it overstresses the polemic, with many stretches equivalent to the speech-to-camera technique on film, This is all too common in novels striving to put over a message. The characters are cardboard cutouts. In this I find the book similar to another pioneering work, Radclyffe Hall's \\"The Well of Loneliness\\". If the central topic of that work had not been lesbianism, but heterosexual love, the book would be long forgotten, as the prose rarely rises above the level of Peg's Paper or Mills & Boon.

It also explains why the draconian controls by socialism at every level society wide, drive geniuses insane!It is still written in the same easily and sharply understandable novel form that Atlas Shrugged is.

The intense love between Roark and Dominique, the idealized rape, the hot sex scenes! A rags-to-riches story of an uncompromising architect, struggling against his purely evil second-hander opponents; manifesting his individual potential via heroic speeches. A man sells his wife to a rich dude for a job commission (Indecent Proposal, anyone?) Tortured suicidal millionaires, love triangles, explosions. Man, it's all there. And it's all wicked awesome. There isn't even any pesky character depth to get in the way of this book's pure unbridled ownage!The reason I am giving it 4 stars (instead of 500!) is that this incredible novel sometimes get bogged up in some crappy quixotic philosophy that dumb megalomaniacs tend to accept unquestioningly(probably due to overwhelming pride at having read a 900 page book that is not Harry Potter). Ayn Rand could not possibly have intended this silly Objectivism thing to be taken seriously! What sane person would? Obviously this book is a brilliant satire of what sophistry, irrationality, arrogance, and a smokin' pair of pink sunglasses can do to people's minds. A psychological thriller, so to speak! But if you ask me, all that \\"thinker\\" mumbo jumbo just gets in the way of a slammin' story. I suggest you ignore those parts.

I highly recommend this book to all teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"FountainHead and Atlas Shrugged are two books, especially the former, that have gained the status of Modern Classics. The thoughts expressed below are, well, my general thoughts on the two most popular works of Ayn Rand.After I finished reading FountainHead, the character that impressed me the most was Gail Wynand, the next being the iconoclast Ellsworth Toohey. I found the final monologue, if monologue is the word I am looking for, of Toohey to Peter Keating and the defense of Roark(for those who have not read the book, Howard Roark happens to be the Hero of Fountain Head) in the climax the most impressive parts of the book. It is definitely a book that is a must read for any bibliophile worth his salt. In fact, each of the characters sketched out by the writer in Fountain Head have something definite and unique. In stark contrast to this, Atlas Shrugged has most of the characters, the Heroes of the book, very similar to one another and after the point to be put across is put across, the theme repeats itself again and again and the writer tends to get excessively didactic. I must, at this point, confess that the 90-odd page radio speech by John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged, took a lot out of me, leaving me practically a spent force by the time I finished the Chapter ''This is John Galt speaking''. The sheer size of the book Atlas Shrugged is very intimidating. Anyway, I managed to read that, spreading it over a period of nearly four months.Ayn Rand happens to be one of the most compelling and influential writers I have ever read. Though it is highly difficult to rise up to the standards set in her philosophies they definitely influence the reader immensely. The philosophy she professes though hard to live up to and emulate definitely sets standards to the way an ideal man has to live. I do not presently remember, but a writer or critic once pointed out that after reading Fountain Head, one would feel that the rest of the writers through the generations have written their works while sitting on the potty or something to that effect. Though I would say that saying so is going a bit too far, it definitely gives an idea as to how powerful Ayn Rand's writings are.Delving for a while on the cover illustration of FountainHead, I have this little theory of mine that it shows the picture of the Titan Prometheus from Greek Mythology, stealing fire from Gods, which, as the legend goes, he gifts to mankind and for doing so Zeus punishes him by chaining him to a rock and leaving eagles (another version says it is vultures) to gnaw at him. The illustration in a way, I think, encompasses, or is symbolizes the word I really am looking for, the idea of the Creator, the first to go on an un-laid path only to get pilloried, inviting the world to point the finger of disdain and scorn, the idea Roark so convincingly presents in his defense.In Ayn Rand's own words, the philosophy of objectivism sums up to this:''My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.'' In a nutshell, one sees the Earth in the eyes of Ayn Rand as a place where there is no room for those wallowing in mediocrity. Well, that, if you practically look at, sends most of us packing to the outer space with a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy; but then, that is neither here nor there. The nearest antonym to ego, according to her, is altruism. Her theories severely pan the concept of Collectivism and glorify Individualism and the Virtue of Selfishness. In this context, it doesn't need a rocket scientist to understand her views on Soviet Communism vis-a-vis American Capitalism. It would be of interest to psychologists to know that the writer was a Russian immigrant to the United States.The Ayn Rand Stereotype:Ever observed? All her heroes have to possess lean frames with athletic builds and angular faces (Hank Rearden, Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, Howard Roark). All the bad guys should be fat with flabby masses of flesh falling off their bodies (Peter Keating, James Taggart, Ellsworth Toohey et. al.). All her heroines (Dagny Taggart, Dominque Francon) have to invariably sleep with all her heroes. Of course, in pointing out the last observation, i don't mean to say that Dagny Taggart from Atlas shrugged goes out all the way to sleep with Howard Roark who appears in FountainHead.PS: Err... possibly this review is more comprehensible for those who have read Ayn Rand's works."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There was a time when the Fountainhead was required reading in many high schools, and in a large number of college architecture programs -- it still should be. This is a book that should stay accessible in your home, and it is one that you will enjoy reading more than once. Each time, you may see in it more than you did before and draw parallels to contemporary events, people, and ideas. It is not surprising that political liberals tend to hate this book and the author. The Fountainhead remains a refreshing and optimistic story that continues to inspire true free-thinkers."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"What a great and powerful book on the value of individuality, character and value of art."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I would not recommend Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead to anyone looking for the remotest form of suspense. The reader is kept waiting for 700 pages for some sort of climax which never materializes. The plot is based on archetitcure and one man's journey in life told through this perspective. I could not relate to this book at all because of this.The novel is supposed to have the hidden morals of life, and it does to some extent. Ayn Rand does a beautiful job developing her characters. The reader can see different aspects of society through each different character and their interactions with others. I, however, could not personally relate to any one of these characters. This hinders my perception and opinion of the novel.Overall, The Fountainhead is a wonderfully written novel which was very planned and thought out before Ayn Rand began the writing of the actual novel. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has enough time to read large novels and who doesn't mind the lack of suspense found in this novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The first time I read &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, I was deeply impressed with the plot, characters, and events it portrays. Howard Roark is one of the few fictional characters I've encountered that I would definitely want to meet. His capacity for sheer joy is almost unequaled in literature. Yes, the characters are abstract, but that's infinitely preferable to yet another novel about yet another damsel in distress, or poor man crushed by the evil capitalists. In my opinion, Dominique Francon was the least &quot;believable&quot; of all the characters, but one of the most interesting...her motivations may not have been realistic, but she is fascinating from a philosophical perspective. After reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, you'll be amazed how many Peter Keatings you see in everyday life.After reading reviewer after reviewer complain about the book's lack of realism, I want to say that I was amazed at the number of events in this book that rang true for me. The description of Gail Wynand's schooling still stands out in my mind, along with the contest held by Wynand's Banner to see whether they could raise more money for an unwed mother or a struggling scientist. I've said this before, in my review of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; - Rand's minor characters are incredible. Mrs. Keating is exactly what she needs to be, and she is such an accurate picture of so many well-meaning but intervening parents! The description of Mrs. Wayne Wilmot, a potential client of Roark's, is just staggering - it so perfectly characterizes so many people.I'm currently in the middle of my second reading of the book, and I'm surprised how many little details I'm noticing now that I skipped right over before. This is definitely a book you have to read twice. Rand had such an acute sense of contrast and irony, and it's such a shame to miss all the little details she put in for the reader to find. It's like an irony gold mine. Just compare the descriptions of Roark and Keating walking down the same street and you'll see what I mean.There's just one thing missing from this book - illustrations. I would give anything to see a building that Howard Roark could have designed, and the movie adaptation's models were so bad I cringed when I saw them. I'd love to see someone design the Stoddard Temple, or the Enright House, or the Wynand Building...basically any of the buildings Roark did. Even the gas station. It would be great if the Ayn Rand Institute or some other Objectivist institution sponsored an architectural contest for a design for one of these buildings.The first time I ever heard of this book was in an essay about Objectivism which called &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; poorly written and awkward. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Say whatever else you like about Ayn Rand, she was a phenomenal writer (that English wasn't even her first language still amazes me). I highly recommend &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; to everyone - even if you don't agree with the philosophy, the story and the writing are sheer delight."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountanhead is a masterfully done novel. The way that Rand tells her story, and incorporates her philosophies into it is positivley outstanding. In my eyes, this is perhaps the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was my first book by Ayn Rand and now I want to read all her books. The author's style of writing is very captivating- all the characters in the book are so real - Howard Roark, Dominique Francon , Ellsworth Toohey, Peter Keating. While one realises that the world is so full of Peter Keatings and that its not difficult to be a Keating yourself, one admires the character of Howard Roark which though is a little hard to achieve. The author's philosphy that its only Individuals who finally do something exceptional is totally undisputable and has been very well presented in the book. Its a book to read over and over again - worth having a personal copy !"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;Man's ego is the fountainhead of all progress&quot;... the quote from which the title comes from. The Fountainhead is such an incredible example of what man (and woman) should strive to become. It is the ultimate &quot;anti-compromise&quot; novel ever written. The theme is simple. All of human progress is the result of someone using their abilities to go against the established way of doing things and create something new and better for all to enjoy. The book is not meant to be an accurate description of life as we know it, but rather an example of the type of people that create the future and those who act to stop progress. As with all of Rand's work, this book is a series of &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that play out in a melodramatic manner to make a point about both sides of human nature. I have read it four times now and everytime I open its pages, I am inspired to become the best person that I can be. I recommened it to anyone who wants to better themselves.For those who claim the book is not realistic or not truthful... There is a famous saying that all truths go through three stages, first they are scoffed at, second they are violently rejected and third they are accepted as if they has always been true. (Copernicus and his heliocentric model experienced these stages in attempting to change the status quo...) Ayn Rand's work is experiencing stage two right now, but in time i think it will be understood and not seem so threatening as it does to some today."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is Rand's best book. Sure, it's preachy at times, but so was George Eliot or Dickens. Randians believe that the most effective way to help others is THROUGH enlightened self-interest. &quot;Selfishness&quot; as Rand discusses it, does not mean a lack of interest in one's fellow men &amp; women. Rand understood that the attempt to CONTROL relations between people, through well-meaning restrictions on speech and behavior, always backfires. It ends up hobbling the one force that can create the new ideas that create a new reality: individual human energy. The tide has gone against Rand and her type of attitude, but that attitude is the only thing that can get us out of these dreary, sterile times. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I LIVE to read great novels, but of the ten or so novels I've read in recent weeks, only &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; has the potential to become a classic.

Rourke is one of the truly memorable protagonists of our time, and I am rediscovering the magnificent talent of Ayn Rand. READ THIS BOOK !"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Novels are about stories, right? Characters, emotions, real people, right? No one ever told Ayn Rand"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand has been an interesting influence on me throughout. While I have never subscribed to her objectivist phiolosophy outright, I value her opinions about individualism and share her passion against anything remotely to do with Communism.The following is, however, a spoof on her first major success: Fountainhead. Hoard Roark is the protaganist of this fictitious venture and epitomizes individualism. However, since I feel it's neither possible nor practical to live like him, I have come up with this little take-off on one of the meetings Hoard Roark has with his friend Peter Keating.=======Hoard Roark was sitting at his desk in his office. He was looking at the designplans for the new building he would be working on. \\"Would\\" is the operative word here because nobody has offered Hoard Roark any work in the last 3 months. He had to pay his landlord. He had to pay the Electric and Gas services. He had to pay and he had nothing to pay with.Peter Keating made a sudden entrance into his office. Keating was famous for his sudden entrances. It gave him that extra power, that extra hold over his audiences. However, he realized that Hoard was never in awe of him. He would look at him with the same impassioned gaze he would employ when he watched grass grow. Peter Keating felt uncomfortable in Roark's presence. Roark seemed to look through him and Keating didn't like it at all. Who would?\\"What do you think of,\\" Keating blurted out. Before he could complete his sentence, Roark cut him off mid-way. \\"If you are talking about anything that interests you, then I don't think of it. I only think of my work and myself all the time. By the way, I don't think of you either,\\" Roark said with that same impassioned gaze of his.\\"I was going to say, \`What do you think of the weather today.' But you cut me off,\\" Keating angrily said. \\"Oh, that! I don't care much about the weather,\\" replied Roark. Keating didn't know what else to say. Roark always did that to him.\\"What about other people? Don't you think of any one?\\" Keating asked Roark. He had to continue this conversation. He wanted to run away from there screaming, tearing his hair, back to his $300,000 dollar per year job, but he felt a strange urge to continue.\\"I don't think of other people too. In fact, when I am walking on a street, I don't notice them,\\" Roark proclaimed. He wasn't sounding obnoxious. He was stating a mere fact. The conviction clearly shone through his eyes.\\"Well, wouldn't that cause you to bump into them sometimes?\\" Keating asked incredulously. He could never understand Roark.\\"It does,\\" admitted Roark. \\"But it's a small price to pay for preserving your individualism.\\"Peter Keating changed the topic. \\"There is this girl I am in love with. I don't know how to say it to her,\\" he said.\\"Peter, you must solve your own problems. If you don't know how to profess your love, then you're not fit to love,\\" said Roark amicably. Then he continued. \\"I will tell you what to do this time though. Find out when she sleeps. Find out if there is a window through which you can enter her bedroom. And then, get in and make love to her, forcibly if necessary.\\"Keating was aghast. \\"But if she doesn't like me doing that, it would amount to rape. I would be arrested. Worse, I would lose my job.\\" The mere thought turned his stomach.\\"There is only one way to find out, Peter,\\" calmly said Hoard Roark. (Since this essay needs to end with the words \\"Hoard Roark.\\")"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand wrote The Fountainhead to illustrate several points: revealing how morality is based on egoism, showing the importance of architecture, showing how progress comes from the individual and not the group, how evil people subvert the arts, and how her protagonist Roark is the perfect human being.I enjoyed the book, but not for the reasons she would have wanted. It is a relentless and humorless novel of overt propaganda. Rand is at her best, not with her grand themes, but her smaller nifty insights. I found Roarke to be a flat character who designed buildings about as attractive as Albert Speer. He was a genius in some ways, but also an emotional cripple. Rand keeps telling the reader how wonderful he is, but shows him largely humorless, as a rapist, unable to talk to friends about feelings, someone who is silent and then gives long speeches, and someone who is conflicted. This last point deserves the greatest attention. In all of her writings on this book, Rand states how Roarke is a wonderful character, the best in all of us, who is not conflicted at all. However, what she shows in the book is much different from what she tells. Rand is at her best dealing with supporting characters, never her main ones. With her supporting cast, what she shows and what she tells about them is consistent, but for her main characters, the showing and telling is divergent. I ended up enjoying this book as an example of taking an argument to its extreme, and as the grim story of a conflicted if talented emotional cripple.Some people really hate Rand, others really love her work. The truth, I suspect, lies in between. Her novels may be masterpieces, but they neither deserve the acclaim or derision they always receive, but instead, deserve some judicious perusal and open-minded discussion."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"He is the hero of The Fountainhead, the acclaimed and largely original 1943 novel of Ayn Rand, and the manifestation and representative of Rand's objectivist manifesto.At one level, The Fountainhead is a brilliant ode to mankind. The unbounded and limitless demigod can do no wrong when he is he. The ego (fountainhead) is the source of all that is right, righteous and just (and unjustified) and rises above. Those who create, face and dominate nature; others are mere parasites. The skyscraper implies achievement; the &quot;housing project&quot; the prelude to the cave.It is given this context that I salute and abhor The Fountainhead - an unnecessarily long book whose most virtuous characters have no kin, friends or family and abhor love of all except a subjective material creation.I salute her conviction: it drips from every page. I cherish her writing: it is fluid as only that of a single-minded and honest artisan can be.Yet I abhor the world she models. The paradigm that convinces that charity is evil and altruism hatred bears no real resemblance to the paradigms of the planet third from the sun. The notion that man serves by solely serving himself is too simplistic for this ball in the sky. Not surprising from a writer who condemns Nietzsche for diluted philosophy; and whose ideology pretends the earth as the perfect conveyor belt of production and product.This reader's enchantment with Rand's conviction and literary prowess (despite the uneven characters) was not able to drown the flawed cruelty of objectivist good (ill?) will."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rarely do I come across a book that is as striking, disturbing and thought provoking as &quot;Fountainhead&quot;.. while some of the reviewers argue that the characters of the novel are a bit too extreme in many ways and unrealistic, I would argue that there was no other way to deliver the message and to provoke the appropriate level of self-analysis and questioning of the world around us..In the world where spinelessness, conformity and obedience often get rewarded, Ayn Rand has boldly risen to defend the virtues of personal integrity, principles, idealism and individuality..While each of us has had to compromise our own ideals at one point or another to reach our objectives, the book cries out to limit the compromise we undertake in our daily lives to a minimum, for every little compromise chips away from whatever remains of our character and individuality.. and the compounding effect of all the little compromises eventually destroys what we are and what we intended to be..While this is my first experience with Ayn Rand's writings, I feel like I've identified with many of her ideas long before I picked up this book, as I have often resented the world around me pushing me in the directions I don't want to go to..This novel calls for leading the life according to our own ideals as opposed to expectations of others.. and those who will be able to extract the message are likely to attain internal peace and self-understanding.."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

While it sounds like an auto commercial today, the notion was more revolutionary when the story was written in the forties.True to Randian form, the pack instincts of Roark's peers take over as they vow to take him down. His originality and, more importantly, his refusal to act on any terms other than his own infuriate those around him. Also true to form, our superhuman protagonist has a superhuman mate equally dedicated to pure excellence and pure ego.Both &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; make for great reading aside from Rand's tendency to engage in speechmaking. She never trusts the reader to draw the appropriate lessons from the story and therefore sets up melodramatic, scripted speeches of heroic length to drive her points home. Nevertheless, the books are interesting, with powerful plots, and mark a potent answer to the drive toward collectivization of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished my third reading of The Fountainhead. My first time was in my early 20's when I absorbed little beyond the wonderful love story; my second reading was in my late 40's, and this time I was jolted into digging deeper into the philosophy of the book. I'm now in my late 60's, and finally really understand what Ayn Rand was saying in this outstanding book. Because she had firsthand experience, Rand has given us a clear picture of the never-ending stuggle between good and evil in the form of capitalistic versus communistic/fascistic philosophy.Having lived for a time in a socialistic country has given me an even better understanding of how dangerous it is to allow either government or man to attempt to breed the idea of individual thinking out of a society.With all of our troubles, we Americans must continue to be on guard against the liberal factions that don't mind if it takes another fifty years to acquire power over us through our individual thinking.Read Ayn Rand's writings and you will see why I call her my heroine."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"While Ayn Rand has written a rather predicatble storyline, it is remarkable how she shifts the readers feelings towards the characters from one extremity to the other, and how the main characters in her book always seem to &quot;play both sides against the middle&quot; with respect to their views on the hero.It is a fascinating book, and well worth the 9 bucks. I enjoyed it a great deal."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"this book was captivating, i just picked up my friend's copy and got sucked into it from just reading the first page.

It is a very nice book for those who believe in the good of people.

It is a little too much into architecture but I like the message behind it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you want to read this book only to entertain yourselves then this book will not serve you. If you are traditional and like the idea of following what your previous generations have done and followed and treat them with awe or consider them respect without reasoning them out then this book will help you an encounter with a totally opposite realm of ideas. I will not say that it will be interesting to you. It is either possible that you undergo a paradigm shift or you hate the ideas presented in the book and write up a review loathing what is presented in the book. If you are moderate and do not have strong conviction on any idea then you may find the book whimsically nice and not pragmatic. And if you are the person who does not believe in tradition, culture or anything for that matter except reason then this book is a must read. If you are an architect irrespective of what genre you belong to it will serve you better to read this book.The philosophy of the book is simple but strong.Just by virtue of the fact that man is born in a society it should not mean that he is a slave of the society by blindly accepting whatever the society thrusts on him or his ideas. He or she should think for himself and have his/her own convictions on things. An illustrious point can be, just by virtue of your being born to your parents, it should not mean that you should learn the subjects your parents choose for you or marrythe girl/boy your parents choose for you, and so on...The individual should live for himself; he should have his own ideas; he should do things for himself. Only if there are such individuals can a society improve.The words selfishness, egotism and collectivism used the book are in a subtler sense and do not carry the popular meaning and have to be understood from the context. Even in this age when team-work is the word of the day the ideas presentedin the book will still hold good, for without individuals who can stand their ground there cannot be a good team. The denunciation of collectivism is only in the spirit of saying that &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot;.I feel that the plot and the characters in the book have been fastidiously built to bring out the philosophy of Ayn Rand which pitchforks individualism and reason to the top of all ideas and beliefs."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"IF YOU EVER WANTED TO FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT BEING YOURSELF FOR WHO YOU ARE, AND NOT WORRY ABOUT WHAT OTHERS THINK, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.

At first I was daunted by its mammoth size, but as soon as I finally started reading it I found myself so engrossed in its language and message that I could not wait to complete it. Rand portrays the struggle of the individual characters to keep their souls amid the corruption of organized society brilliantly. This is not a novel about the evils of conventionality but of the neccesity to be true to oneself. It is the humanity of this novel that makes it a must read regardless of the philisophical views anyone may have."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A Wonderful reading experience"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Probably on one my top ten favorite books.

I let it be. I don't fight the system, but I do fight back in my own actions. The truth is, I haven't even finished this damn book yet. And I won't tell someone to like this book or don't like it. And itt doesn't matter if this book brought up some words in the past...it's your book, it's your story, and it's your interpretation.

I found Fountainhead to be a better mix of philosophy and entertainment, although i reccomend Anthem also.As a college student, I am in the point in my life where I(and most of my peers I believe) seek the most direction. I believe that trying to find ones direction solely from outside sources can be destructive. I think many readers are apt to avoid the task of forming their own ideas by simply swallowing Ms. Rand's. Thus, many confused individuals are likely to commit the same mistake as Toohey's prodigies in the story.It is almost dissapointing that Rand has received the cult following she has, as it seems to me a contradiction of the philosophy put forth in the text.Nonetheless, I think this is a good book for everyone to read, just to gain another perspective on the world and living in it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read The Fountainhead almost ten years ago and I must tell you that it has resonated in my thinking ever since. While I can understand much of the indignation which other reviewers have expressed about the book, I suggest to you that the drama (granted, perhaps melodrama is the better-suited word) of this book coupled with the pacing and the obesession with important ideas will really rouse within most people a great deal of thinking. For those of us who are not particularly religious it is very satisfying to find something which encourages us to believe in something greater...and with Rand that something greater is the greater part of ourselves. Howard Roarke is the prototype of an individual who has unqualified confidence in &quot;the verdict of his own mind.&quot; You do have to accept that Roarke is an abstraction, as are most of the other primary characters in the book. But this approach is common with many of the greatest books ever written. &quot;Reality based&quot; prose is not the measure of value for all books, although some books do shine through simply because they so fantastically convey reality. Rand, rather, conveys the divine potentials of inner strength and confidence. I see that as having been her special contribution to the 20th century; no one has more compellingly illustrated these ideals. Rand's &quot;ideology&quot; as I interpret it is simply to be true to yourself and your values, don't allow the mediocre masses to wear you down and away. That's good advice coming from any source. I've given this book to dozens of people and almost every one has indicated that they felt quite revitalized by it....not just for a short while but in an enduring, organic way. After you read this book you may want to climb aboard Atlas Shrugged for more of the unique kind of intellectual euphoria which Rand offers. I would suggest that you should wait a year or two before you do so. Let The Fountainhead sink in. True, it is a &quot;love story&quot; and that is a genre many of us avoid because it typically is so inane, but in this case you will find that setting so replete with ideas (encouraging ideas; confidence-inducing ideas) that you will really grow, and grow healthy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"a great book for those interested in objectivism, which sets forth the fundamentals of Rand's philosophy. it is a challenging new look at modern society by one of the most of provocative individuals in american scene. an amazing book to read"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I think that this book is one of the best fiction books I've ever read. Although I don't understand some parts of it, I try to piece the information I collected together during parts that I understood. Because I didn't understand Ayn Rand's philosophy beforehand, I didn't understand why the characters chose to do the actions they did, until I read further and started to make more sense out of it. This book mainly mentions Ayn Rand's philosophy on individualism and objectivism, and how collectivism doesn't enhance the society but instead is bringing it down. She further explained this in 'Atlas Shrugged.'In the Fountainhead, the society turns against the protagonist, architect Howard Roark, because he has a mind of his own, loves his work, is unbending to his clients, and has real talent on modernistic architecture. Others probaly hate him because they have on 'original' idea of their own to 'beat' him. According to 'Atlas Shrugged', people who can't think on their own, at such creativity as innovating new ideas, feel guilty that they can't do it. They tend to value people who say, &quot;It's all right, you don't have to think. We're all like this, you're not stupid.&quot; If the whole society is like this, there will be absolutely very little improvement in anything because people are 'encouraging' each other not to innnovate new ideas for the sake of 'feeling good' together.So far, I think that Ayn Rand's philosophy makes sense, which proves to me why she is called 'one of the most influential thinkers.' Although in the Fountainhead, Ayn Rand's philosophy on Individualism is quite extreme. I don't think that absolutely no negotiating, compromising, and group work can exist in the world and this society where it's most encouraged to do so. Roark was turning every client that didn't accept his work by not signing the contract, eventually leaving him with no job for a while. I think that being individualistic most of the time is good, but you need to negotiate in situations where negotiation is needed. Ms. Rand said that she believes that her philosophy is not widely known right now, but it will become more popular in the future.The character development and plot in this book are wonderful. My favorite characters are Roark, Dominique, Wynand, Mallory, and Mike. Peter Keating seems to be too unsure of himself and tends to stick to collectivism with Toohey. In this book's romance, due to her love of Roark, earlier in the story, Domonique tries to persuade Roark to quit the architecture career and go live where no one knew them. That is because she can't stand the society turning against Roark and can't bear anyone 'hurting' him by making harsh comments about his work. Maybe this is the reason why all the great-minded people disappeared in 'Atlas Shrugged', but I haven't reached that part yet so I don't want to conclude firmly yet. Despite Dominique's persuasions, Roark remains persistent and water wins the 'battle' against the society that is trying to push him down. This book ends with a happy ending, although it doesn't seem that complete. I wish there was a sequal to this book.Overall, I recommend this book to people who are interested in Ms. Rand's philosophy and want the concept to be introduced to them through good fiction."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;oh god it's worse than I thought&quot;, I thought holding a gun to my own head."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this when I was 17 and fell in love with it instantly...mainly because it echoed so many things I had always felt, but no one else seemed to share. I had always felt I was much less emotional than everyone else around me. I had always hated that my mother seemed to believe that I owed her something simply because she cared about me. I had always hated, in fact, all those people who felt that they &quot;deserved&quot; things, that they'd been given a &quot;raw deal,&quot; or felt the need to make excuses for themselves.So, in part, I found myself in this book, and I'll always remember it fondly for that.Unfortunately, the underlying philosophy just doesn't hold up. I don't know how Ayn Rand convinced herself that it did, nor do I understand why she called her philosophy Objectivism. Since its entire basis is upon the self, since right and wrong is whatever is best for ME, shouldn't it be called Subjectivism?Read it for what it is: a novel. A fable. A fairy tale. If you share her views, it will be an uplifting experience. But keep in mind that her philosophy is only one of the many lifestyle choices that you can make. It is NOT a moral code; it has no logical basis. Be inspired, but don't get carried away..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"_The Fountainhead_ is my favorite among Rand's novels; I used to have a very well-worn hardcover copy of it. But anybody who thinks Howard Roark is the \\"projection of an ideal man\\" is kidding himself. He's an interesting character -- one of Rand's most interesting, in fact -- and he serves well to make the one point she wanted him to make (that the ego is the fountainhead of human progress). But he's not an ideal man (even by Rand's own standards, but that's another issue).Rand's _Journals_ indicate that, like Danny Renahan (the \\"hero\\" of the unwritten work _The Little Street_), Roark was supposed to have been \\"born without the ability to consider other people.\\" In ordinary terms, he was a narcissist and a sociopath. And while a good deal of the melodrama in the novel is satisfying within the limited world of the novel itself, nevertheless in real life things would not have worked out this way for Roark. Nor would such a man have been able to design buildings suitable for human habitation.And don't make the mistake Rand encourages you to make (in _The Romantic Manifesto_): imagining what Roark would do as a model for your own behavior. This technique, like the novel itself, shows you only what things look like \\"from the inside\\" to Roark himself -- so it's no help if Roark's vision is limited in the first place.If you want to see such a character \\"from the outside,\\" I highly recommend Paul Theroux's fine novel _The Mosquito Coast_. His \\"protagonist\\" Allie Fox is every bit the genius Roark is, and also every bit as unable to consider other people. Watch what happens to him as seen through the eyes of one of his own children.And if you wouldn't ask yourself what Allie Fox would do, reconsider asking the same question about Roark."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is worth reading if you have spare time. Primarily because it provides an insight into the thought processes of self-adulating egomaniacs who think that they are a type of super-man. You will understand why many people refer to them as 'randroids'.You know the type. They condemn pretty much everyone else according to a bizarre set of standards that they've arbitrarily constructed, at the same time seeing themselves as the embodiment of rugged individualistic perfection. Generally, such people have never done anything of note and they annoy almost everyone who meets them. Whenever criticised, they just imagine that the critic is Ellsworth Toohey (yes, Rand's character names are all ridiculous), and ignore them because by the egomaniac's 'objective' standards, the critic is irrational and therefore evil.There are a handful of good ideas here, primarily about the value of self-esteem and sticking to principle. These could have been presented in a very short book, and in any case aren't original. Instead, Ayn Rand produced a ridiculous longwinded fantasy in which the characters are laughable metaphors, the plot is extremely contrived, and the outcomes ridiculous. People don't work like Rand thinks they do. Neither do groups of people. An old saying applies: \\"the book is both original and good; the good parts aren't original, and the original parts aren't good\\".A simple acid test for Rand's philosophy (this book is a philosophical rant, and a poorly constructed one at that) is to ask what those who ascribe to it would do with intellectually disabled orphans. The answer is self-evident.Finally, following this philosophy won't even benefit its followers. Ayn Rand died alone, childless, husbandless, and friendless except for a hired nurse. Many of her followers will meet the same fate."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A syrupy, unemotional but linear and sophomoric melodrama that parallels Ayn Rand's life (She once wrote scripts for 40s styled melodramas and was married to an architect). It highlights and punctuates one of her most sacred themes: that self-sacrifice ultimately is an anti-human impulse because it requires sacrifice of the only thing that makes us human, our integrity. Told through the life of Architect Howard Roak, who struggles to maintain his architectural integrity in the face of powerful and concerted societal attempts to corrupt and dilute it (for the benefit of society at large), the Fountainhead is Rand's most graphic defense of her philosophy of Objectivism.Roak's soliloquy at the trial in which he was charged for the bombing of a building that deviated from his explicit architectural specifications, is as good a summary of Rand's philosophy likely to be found in her fictional work. In its essential outline, the soliloquy reminds the jury that: Men of vision live for themselves, not for society. Truth is their only motive. Their brains are their only instruments for survival. Man the creator, the visionary, deals with ideas not with other men.I gave the book three stars because, even though it lacks any semblance of artistic merit, it is a clear, unambiguous statement of Rand's theory of society, and however flat, the story was still interesting."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When you assess Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, a lot has to be taken into consideration. First of all, this book was written in 1943. And though many authors from that era still are fresh and contemporary, the Fountainhead has definitely aged ungracefully. The characters of Roark, Toohey, Keeting, and others are both complicated and yet at the same time horribly two dimensional. The morals of feminism and the morals of the idealist are stilted in a pre-post-modernism fashion that is alien to our present culture.Aside from the surface level of this novel (what usually is 100% of a work of fiction), underneath all of the dry and difficult interactions of the characters is a philosophy that Rand expounds. It is that of the idealist and how that person must stand up against just about every one else in society who will be attempting to tear him or her down. That is sort of a simple read on Rands fascinating work, but essentially it is what the book is about. Rand is setting forth a philosophical agenda like Nietzsche, Freud, and all the other old fellows, only Rand is using a fictional vehicle to structure her ideas around.So in essence, Rands work is an amazing towering achievement that is worth reading due to the fact that every page hums with her ideas. On the other hand, her characters are so terrible and dead you really don't want to aspire to be these people. Roark, the subject of her treatise, is like a lobotomized Forrest Gump with a knack at architectuare. I wouldn't want to be him or know him. Yet this is Rand's ideal. Her characters also wander in an area of cultural entitlement that alienates just about every reader.While reading this book, I kept thinking of what kind of person Rand was. If she is like the characters and the ideas of her book, or is essentially the person who wrote the forward of her 25th anniversary reprint, she is one of the coldest, most unhappy people every to walk the face of the earth. Her ideas are those of superiority and snobbish to an extreme beyond those of anyone I have ever come across. Her husband, Frank O'Hara (a painter), was not a very good artist and seems to my eye to have represented Keeting, Roark's foil and the embodiment of everything wrong in her world view. Her ideals strip all that is soulful in an existence and yet she is expounding thoughts of the perfect creationist who might embody humanities very best. I could go on and on... but I think you get the idea, this book in contradictory to an extreme.Lastly, and this is just a personal aside... Ayn Rand has completely poured her soul out onto these pages. But what a soul it is. Rand has portrayed herself as the coldest, ugliest person I have ever come across. Its fascinating to see her warped world view that is devastatingly bleak and morbid.This is one of the more important books of the 20th century, it is also very enjoyable to read, though dated as I said. I would suggest this book to anyone as a book to put on a personal reading list and hope you decide to give it a try."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am a high school student. This is the most inspiring work I have ever read, and it has encouraged me to turn my life around.It is not meant to read like a novel. Rand means The Fountainhead to be a work of philosophy. The characters are unrealistic, but they are prototypes and help carry out her philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"the characters are too &quot;black or white&quot;, and are too extreme - each and every one of them... The philosophy behind this book - that not everything new is bad, and that any new idea should be inspected before being rejected on the basis of being new - is a very good one considering the fact that they were working in a very conservative environment. But again, the message is given in its most extreme version, and it seems that instead of rejecting new ideas and accepting only old ones, Ayn Rands wants us to accept new ideas and reject all old ones, which is just as wrong as the old fashioned way of looking at things...I don't see Roarke as a hero - in his extreme behavior, he almost missed his purpose, and maybe if he learned to be a little more flexible at times he would have had more chances of having people listening to him and would have had a much better chance and a much easier time spreading his message around - some people's objections were to him as a person, not to what he was trying to say. This may seem unfair, but that's the way life is...The other drawback of this book si the fact it's VERY old fashioned, and not that relevant to our modern society in many ways..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. Considering the length of it, this shows how interesting it was.There were 5 main characters, Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, Gail Wynand and Ellsworth Toohey. Each character was well developed in a sense that once you were in their head you knew what they were going to do next, with one exception. I felt Dominique Francon's character was frequently inconsistent and her motivations at times pretty muddy.The book takes you from before Howard and Peter finish college until about 20 years later. The story parallels these two men's careers as architects. They covered the architecture aspect just enough so you could see where the argument was but, not to the point where it would lose the readers. In this aspect, you are under no doubt that Howard is passionate about his craft and Peter is merely giving it lip service. Peter is into architecture as an end to a means. It has the pontential of making him popular. Most of the disputes in architecture center around the traditional versus modernistic view point. Traditional meaning keeping to the Greek Porticos and decorative features of the past versus a style more centered on function. Howard is dedicated to the fact that form should fit function.Mostly this book centers on the inner lives of the characters and the forces that affect their personal decisions.Howard is an end to himself, where Peter does not exist unless someone else is in the room. These two characters choices are about as opposite as can be found.Ellsworth Toohey, whom is mentioned in passing early on, gets further developed later in the book and provides a manipulating force in Peter's life &amp; that of many others. This character early in his life discovered the two extremes of personalities as Howard and Peter and has discovered the secret of using the &quot;Peter Keatings&quot; of the world.Gail Wynand is an even more complex character than Ellsworth in the sense that he at one point in time stood alone, but at some point due to some various situations in his youth, became power hungry and decided on a similar path as Ellsworth Toohey. However, he never quite consciously made this choice and really was almost unaware of the path he chose &amp; his dependency on the people he controlled.Dominique Francon, never really gets developed to the same point as the male characters. Early on as a co-worker to Ellsworth Toohey and the daughter of Peter's employer, she is shiftless and comes across as just spiteful. You are not sure if she is a Toohey disciple or worse. Later on in her dealing with Howard, Peter and Gail, her motives and logic are still a bit ill defined. I think Ayn Rand was negligent in giving her female character's the necessary development in the book for her to be understood. Considering that she wrote this in the 1930s and 40s and the fact that the character had 3 husbands, this may have been the furthest she dared to go, lest the reading audience would unnecessarily focus on that.Much of this book is dialogue between the characters, you have to follow it closely. Some of Ellsworth Toohey's one on ones with the various characters make you think of the many political speeches we hear every day. Then, when you consider the black heart of the character, it is frightening.I think a person in their teens and 20s would walk away from this book with a different take than one in their 40s, as I am. An idealistic 20 year old still believes there are these singular characters out there like Howard and Peter, etc. They would get quickly discouraged with others and themselves, when they walked away from this book. An older person would recognize that most people have of blend of characters and these change with time. Then, one can only hope that we have more Howard than Peter &amp; hope we are not deluding ourselves like Gail Wynand.An excellent book, I am under no doubt why it is a classic."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I really don't understand why so many people say that this book changed their lives. The philosophy presented within it is overly idealistic and completely impossible if you hope to survive in our society. The message of being a true individualist, not led by the mindless masses is GREAT. But to turn down jobs because you are unwilling to cooperate with others? That's not evil collectivism; it's a necessity, unless you think being supported by welfare possesses more integrity.The writing in this book was bad enough that it merited a one-star review, if not for the fact that there are so many worse-written books out there. The characters are hollow and their motivations often make no sense. Everyone knows that neither heroes nor villians are so one-dimensional. The dialogue is the worst part, though. The speeches the characters deliver (especially those of Dominque and Howard Roark) sound completely unlike natural conversation. Each scene seems to serve as a soapbox on which our protagonists can proclaim their own virtues. I admit that some of the scenes contain such bad, pretentious writing that I literally laughed aloud. What most confuses me is the men who've written reviews here before me that said Dominique is their ideal woman. Why? In my view, Dominique is an exceptionally POOR example of womanhood. Roark rapes her and she likes it. She marries Peter Keating and Gail Wynand for reasons I never really grasped. If she were such a noble individualist, why would she marry people she despised? Maybe I'm missing some deep philosophical subtext in that, but her character particularly annoyed me.The whole book, in summation, is just too heavy-handed and obvious. I don't see this as a thought-provoking book at all, except maybe for the fact that it provoked the thought that reading it wasted my time. Also that several friends I've really admired recommended it really disturbed me. There are some great philosophers out there who give you much more to ponder, and many more writers who can turn out an interesting story with complex, multi-faceted, BELIEVABLE characters."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead is a book everyone has an opinion on and you either hate it or love it, theres no in between - If your the kind of person who reads this book and loves it then join the club, cause everything you hear about it is true - It can change your life and the way you think, but to enter the club you gotta believe in the philosophy - Hats off to you madame Rand you have truly given us something to think about - theres no book I have read and dont think there will be one which will affect me like this book - After reading it dont be surprised if you start believing your Roark cause thats what happened to me."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"c'mon, people. the fountainhead is only about two things : sex and architecture. if you think you read any more into it, you need to set the book down and go play ball."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'll give this book one thing, it is very gripping.

The people who rated this book highly all spouted the same praises - &quot;this book changed my life,&quot; &quot;it will force you to look at yourself differently.&quot; etc. Those who did not like the book also said many of the same things - &quot;unrealistic&quot; &quot;boring&quot; &quot;too long.&quot; One thing which Rand states in her non-fiction writing is that each individual has the right to form their own opinion. I find it interesting that so many have the SAME opinions on this work.To address a few comments made in earlier reviews... Novels do not need to be about REAL characters, nor about REAL events, in a REAL world or have to do with anything considered REAL by current standards. A novel is a work of fiction. Nothing in it needs to be based in reality or in believability. Rand used her novels to bring the fundamentals of her philosophy to the public. This is an impossible task to do by using REAL characters. The only way to illustrate clearly is with charicatures... kind of like Nietchze's ideal man... these archetypes will never exist, they are there for inspiration and aspiration. As for realism in general as it relates to fiction... and this book... will anyone dare to say that George Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was REALISTIC? I mean, hey, it took place in a farmyard, with pigs being the governing officials. To me, this is more than unreal... it is absolutely crazy to expect that anyone will actually think that pigs could become such incredible politicians. Yet, we read it and learn various things from it. We can do the same with Rand's books. Admittedly, the writing is difficult. The things she says are in discord with many things we are taught from childhood. The biggest of these is the concept of the individual. The part of the book which I feel exeplifies that concept the best is the scene before Dominique leaves Rourke's apartment after she married Keating. The scene where they say that they love each other. Rourke says &quot;To say I love you, one must first be able to say the 'I'.&quot; For me, that means that before you can call any feeling or opinion you have valid or real, you must first acknowledge yourself. The way you think, the way you work. You need to discover your own self before you can actually feel anything with it. This applies to reviews of books as well. Rand said that she did not like reading Victor Hugo's work. She disagreed with what he had to say, but she can not say that he was a bad writer... she has acknowledged his tale! nt at what he did aside from the fact that she did not care for his works.If you are thinking of reading this book, please, decide for yourself if you want to expose yourself to something new which you may or may not like... which is essentially the case - the decision you must make - with everything in your life.And, as so many have stated, if you have any questions or comments which you would like to discuss, feel free to contact me."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The danger Ayn Rand warns of is not fascism, as the Amazon.com summary suggests, but statism and collectivism.

Adult readers who approach this flavor of unadorned enthusiasm with due skepticism will be abruptly put off. Hence, the lack of points in the 3 - 7 range. There is stuff worth thinking about in here, but the story takes place in a fantasyland, not in the real world, and of course its lessons don't apply as neatly here as they do there. But approached as an instance of human foibles and vulnerabilities (Rand, it appears, was herself a quite unhappy person) it has some poignance. Read it, but don't forget to read between the lines. If you decide to believe or disbelieve, you'll be intoxicated or exasperated. Read this book with skeptical ambivalence and you'll get something out of it.

OK? OK? I understand your goddamn point now could you please get on with it or stop passing off your fifty page novella as a 700-page plus work of fiction and please please please just allow something to happen more frequently than once every fifty or sixty pages? Also, one reviewer made a comment that I found rather amusing. Just think about what they said.

I gave nine because I'm currently reading Atlas Shrugged and I seems even better."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead describes a fundamental moral conflict, the choice to think for oneself or to live second hand by depending upon the minds of others. Thinking, in this context, means objectively identifying those values necessary for the life of a rational being. It doesn't, as some reviewers mistakenly apprehend, mean living the life of a hermit; or becoming a sadist; or repressing one's emotions; or acting on whim. To be selfish requires that one be objective.Howard Roark does not design buildings in the manner that he does because he feels like it; or to be different; or even to make piles of money. The form of his architecture is a result of his inventiveness in a context which is determined by actual requirements, beginning with the function which the building will serve. Site, material, cost -- all are real life determinants which serve as a basis for his designs.The same, Miss Rand points out in her brillantly written novel, can be said about the manner in which one designs one's life. Function, nature and means of survival are real life determinants of how one should live.Because man faces a basic choice -- life or death -- and because without life no values are possible, man's life must be his moral standard. Acting selfishly is not a matter of inclination -- a point so clearly made in the novel that one wonders how the reviewer from Mass. who gave it a 2 missed it. Selfishness is a matter of objectivity.A word about the so called rape scene, which offended the feminist sensibilities of one reviewer. If it was rape, honey, it was by engraved invitation. And if Dominique is a wimpering weakling, then Kipling was a Russian.The Fountainhead speaks to youth -- why much of it's praise comes from that quarter -- because it speaks of life. The young are ready to live, not give up and die. They need a basic architectural design in order to succeed, i.e., to be happy. The Fountainhead provides it; and in spades.I give the novel a rating of 11.E-mail responses welcomed."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As an archiecture student, I can feel the fire that drives Howard Roarke, and understand the cowardice of Peter Keating. In any art form, the artist must decide between the art for the soul, and the art for the masses. This book has inspired me to fight for the soul. My ideals on architecture, life, and love have been questioned by Ayn Rand, and now I know the answers. Individuality cannot be suppressed by family, friends, and the collectivism. That fire that is within all of us should burn without shame or fear. To live for one's art is noble, but to die for that art is far greater."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Yes, I too was once an insufferable teen-age Objectivist. As the &quot;Playboy&quot; Ayn Rand interview explains, the ideas of Ayn Rand exert a strong hold on the minds of intelligent adolescents because intelligent adolescents are especially open to compelling new ideas. It is very difficult to read Ayn Rand and remain impervious to her Weltanschauung, and teen-agers are particularly susceptible. I may have been better off not to have read it first as a teen-ager or I may have been worse off not to have; I can't quite decide. In any case, this is a well-written, imaginative, and cleverly plotted novel. Yes, some of the prose is flawed, but none of it is &quot;purple&quot;, as a reviewer below has suggested. It is certainly significantly different from any other novel I've ever encountered. I hold it in high regard but recommend it guardedly."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"this was an excellent book. it was very long but very worth the wait. it is a very deep book that made me think a lot. i really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rather than tell you about this wonderful book, I thought I'd show you with some quotes.The following quote is about Peter Keating, a famous architect whose self-concept is dependent upon other people's opinion of him:&quot;There were no questions and no doubts when he stood on a platform over a sea of faces; the air was heavy, compact, saturated with a single solvent--admiration; there was no room for anything else. He was great; great as the number of people who told him so. He was right; right as the number of people who believed it. He looked at the faces, the eyes; he saw himself born in them, he saw himself being granted the gift of life. That was Peter Keating, that, the reflection in those staring pupils, and his body was only its reflection.&quot;Part of Roark's courtroom speech:&quot;As poles of good and evil, [mankind] was offered two conceptions: egotism and altruism. Egotism was held to be the sacrifice of others to self. Altruism--the sacrifice of self to others. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self. When it was added that man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was closed. Man was forced to accept masochism as his ideal--under the threat that sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever perpetrated on mankind.&quot;More of Roark on altruism:&quot;Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistence. But to make that the highest test of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see others suffer--in order that he may be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism.&quot;And now for some short ones:&quot;In order to say 'I love you,' one must first be able to say the 'I.' &quot;&quot;I don't plan to build in order to have clients. I plan to have clients in order to build.&quot;&quot;You're casting pearls without getting even a porkchop in return.&quot;Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The story behind Ayn Rand's &quot;objectivism&quot; is wonderful. I was absorbed throughout by the characters. However, the right-wing underlying philosophy can grate at times, and the end is a bit on the strange side for me. Read it for the story and try to ignore the Limbaugh-style rantings and ravings that plague it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is very enjoyable, it's philosophic and psychological insights regarding the spiritual roots of collectivism and individualism are woven into a clear, rich texture. While a bit long, and Rand's narration can be a bit hammy and self-indulgent, the novel is clearly a wise investment of time and thought."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I enjoyed the first 2/3 of the novel until the long winded propaganda selling Rand's brand of philosophy began to wear thin. I forced myself through the last 1/3 and decided it wasn't so great a story, but it was a thoughtful experience.Ayn Rand did accomplish what she set out to do: she changed the way I, as reader, look at life (at least for a week or so). To look at it simply as a piece of fiction, to me it failed. I didn't buy the ending, either.One thing that amused me is that Rand's favorite word must have been \\"insolent.\\" It appeared at least once every two pages, sometimes once per page, sometimes twice, and once she used it twice in a single paragraph. It pulled my attention away from the story and to the words, which is not a good thing to do. Rand probably wouldn't have appreciated me laughing at her masterpiece like it was a Monty Python sketch.Here's a writer who's work screams \\"I need a Thesaurus!\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"this is simply the most amazing book i've ever read. theres no way to describe it other than that..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Doesn't it say something about a book that is as loved and loathed as this one.

Sometimes the inner voice could use a little confidence. The world of second handers, of people who would rather live unhappily ever after (and have society to blame because they did everything they were &quot;supposed to do&quot;) than strke out on their own, is clearly spelled out in this book. The Fountainhead put into words a feeling I always had and has given me the confidence to atleast &quot;attempt&quot; to listen to my own wants and needs. Is Roark fiction? Of course. Is that life attainable? Probably not. Is it a goal? It is for me."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Without boring you with paragraphs of details to let you how well read I am, I'll say I liked it. I read it about 2 years ago and it has stayed with me. However, it is definitely dated, expanding on concepts which, while acceptable in the 1940's were barely palatable now (eg. the rape of Dominique by Howard Roake and her subsequent inability to get him out of her system so to speak). I was particularly taken with the character of Ellsworth Toohey. I think Rand captured a character here that we are all aware of in our lives. A man given to power through manipulation. A man who knows that his power can only stand through the world's acceptance of mediocracy. She stated her point very well though him. He is the character that most affected me in this book and in my life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was the first novel about an architect's life I've found, so I'm giving it a rating of &quot;1&quot;, hoping to find many more excellent books in the genre. I did enjoy The Fountainhead. It's a good book. The neat story line was easy to follow, and the 700 pages of simplified philosophy about life of human being as a creator gave me long-lasting relief from reality. I recommend this novel to any artists/designers out there, who are seeking the most basic form of inspiration."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Probably spelled that wrong. Anyway, it is a great story. So many people around today that remind me of James Taggert. Heck, look at the Dem's and most Rep's. Anyway, I felt kinda sorry for Ayn. She was so close. She must of missed the parts in the Bible that stress a strong work ethic. Like if you don't work you don't eat. Being responsible for yourself, and if you lived your whole life refusing to ever lift a finger to help someone, well then, not even John Galt would of been successful at that. Look at the ones he helped. The ones he saved. Reminds of some other story that Ayn refused to believe. Her choice of course, and remember, we do live in a country where choice is just a little important.Would be awesome though to see someone stand and say some of the things the heroes in the story said."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I absolutely loved Atlas Shrugged, so when I merely liked this book, I was disappointed. Much of the dialogue seems like it was just there to continue the plot, not act as a philosophical allegory. Until the last hundred pages or so, it seemed like just an ordinary, decent book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is an engrossing and challenging literary/philosophical book.At one level, the novel is a simple story, following the life of Howard Roark, an architect with daring vision and uncompromising standards who battles psychologically (and occasionally physically) with the world around him. Roark dares to design buildings not for their aesthetic or functional purposes as defined by others, but rather for their prima facie, self-serving purposes--a goal which Roark (and Rand) believes is pure and perfect, for the human ego is the fountainhead of all progress. In opposition to Roark is seemingly the rest of the world--charlatan characters who merely imitate and debase the pure egotistical nature of man. Peter Keating and Ellsworth Toohey are the main antagonists, both of whom live parasitic, relativistic existences that run counter to Roark's objective philosophical purity.At the second and more important level, The Fountainhead is an introduction to Rand's philosophy of objectivism, which exalts man's place in the universe and actively promotes egoism, capitalism and objective reality as its virtues. Rand's characters are caricatures, as Rand exaggerates her perspective to drive home her philosophical points.Regardless of what one thinks about Rand's philosophy, The Fountainhead is an engrossing story that, despite its length, keeps the reader's attention throughout. Readers will really have to think throughout the novel and will be filled with many questions and doubts at the end of the book as Rand makes a forceful and often persuasive case against modern American society.While I found Rand's philosophy to be a bit obnoxious and oversimplified, it did not get in the way of me enjoying this book. Unfortunately, much of the debate about this book has been clouded by people's philosophical and political leanings. The people who enjoy this book the most are those who go in with an open mind. Whether you conclude the book in total agreement or utter disgust with Rand's philosophy is moot--readers will be better off for having read this intellectually challenging book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is favorite book of all time. I can read it over and over. It is always a pleasure to spend time with Howard Roark and the world &quot;as it can be and ought to be&quot;."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you're sifting through all of these reviews, wondering if this book will inspire you or depress you, the answer is simple. Neither. It will simply bore you. Your interest will not be held enough to be inspired or depressed. Others have said it best--the characters are unrealistic. Who could imagine such perfection and beauty? And oh, how boring to be intelligent, rational, self sufficient. You'd rather read books about characters that are less than you. You'd rather read about Todd's quivering loins, shake your head and tsk about Bridget's escapades. And who can blame you? If you got this review--congratulations. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is philosophically unsound, both in its arguments and in its source.Just as an example: Ayn Rand has the excellent suggestion that a building's style should be determined by its materials, and both should be determined by its purpose and its location.But if that is so, how can she think of building a temple for the human spirit out of stone (one of the central themes of the book)?What human spirit would be content in stone? What human spirit does not desire to create, to modify, to move? As such, the only proper temple can be living flesh and blood. Yet one of her central themes does seem to be that noble human spirits are best enshrined in steel and stone.She didn't carry her philosophy all the way through.This problem is repeated time and again. Thus, to those who find philosophical soundness to be important, I would advise them to go elsewhere. Even Atlas Shrugged is better on that scale."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Good grief, this book is awful. Not only are the characters made out of cardboard, the plot itself is cardboard, not to mention the childish philosophy it promotes. It can appeal only to those who, despite being uneducated and without talent, have an exalted opinion of themselves."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand takes nearly 700 pages to reach her climax. To avoid spoiling such an excruciating experience, I'll say only that it involves Howard Roark pontificating for a good ten pages in a courtroom showdown. What's even worse is that Rand, who toots the horn of individual genius louder than anyone, can't write her way out of a paper bag. Her plot is a rickety construction to prop up her cartoonish characters (the rugged individualist hero, the women who love him, the men who envy him). Rand also shows a fondness for borrowed expressions (the French &quot;par excellence&quot; seems to be a particular favorite of hers; Roark is continually described as the the this or that par excellence), a considerable irony given her dogmatic attacks on the nebulous hordes of &quot;second-handers&quot; who have plagued studly heros like Howard since the invention of the wheel. Like any perversion, this book might be entertaining, but...[it]just isn't my idea of a good time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" back to back, and man, am I glad I'm finally finished. I had to check them out to see what all the hype was about, and it's clear that many of the comments here about Rand being a bit mentally afflicted were definitely true. You actually feel dirty reading some of this stuff. It's that sick.What disturbs me most about Rand's novels is her twisted idea of romantic love. The heroines are frigid, emotionless robots who only enjoy sexual encounters if they're being treated like garbage the whole time. They're slapped, shoved and snatched around, their arms are being twisted, and they love it. They wouldn't have it any other way. It's disgusting. Dominique Francon seems to only enjoy it if she's lying completely still and unresponsive the whole time. The heros are also cold and robotic, except they enjoy knocking the women around. It's completely joyless. If Rand was trying to create erotic love scenes, she sure missed the mark. When the couples are just spending time together outside of the bedroom, they talk about how the woman enjoys being treated as the man's property because the man is just so perfect and godlike. Otherwise each one seems to just intuitively know what the other is thinking. There is no playfulness, no laughter, no anger or tenderness or any other genuine feeling involved, as you'd have in an actual relationship. They feel no actual need for each other, because that would be weak, so they drift in and out of each other's lives over periods of several years. This is Rand's idea of being in love? Obviously she never experienced the feeling. Because of this, you can't bring yourself to care whether the two \\"soulmates\\" get together in the end or not.The characters in this book are completely unlikeable, except for Gayle Wynand, and of course anyone who's read this knows how he ends up. I thought there was much more depth to his character then anyone else in the book. You got an idea of what made him the hard-nosed guy that he was, and you saw that he had genuine feeling for Dominique, even though the part where he builds a house in the country to keep her away from other people was a little much. I didn't understand the appeal of Roark at all. By the description given, he didn't seem all that physically attractive (not that that matters, but he IS supposed to be the perfect man, right?), and his so-called individualism didn't inspire me at all. It seemed like most of the time he was just doing completely illogical things in order to be difficult. He didn't strike me as very bright or charismatic, and I certainly don't understand why anyone would worship him. Dominique basically has no personality that I can tell, except that she also does silly and illogical things, like dumping a basically decent husband because he wouldn't let his business be run into the ground to save her hero Roark. As for Keating, one minute you loathe him, the next you feel sorry for him. But you never actually like him. Toohey is just ridiculous with his \\"I'm going to take over this newspaper...and RULE THE WORLD!!\\" speeches. He's not exactly a villain who strikes fear into the heart. I wasn't even sure he WAS the villain until halfway through the book. Not that I need to have it spelled out for me right away, but I do like to have some sense of who I'm supposed to be rooting for or booing, especially when I'm 400 pages in. The characters were just so flat for the most part that I really couldn't be sure. Oh, and Roark's big speech with the \\"not guilty\\" verdict at the end? Total cheese. Some of the dialogue throughout the entire novel is so cheesy that you can't help laughing (Like Roark saying the guy who discovered fire was put to death? How did he know that?).I feel sorry for Ayn Rand, because it seems she was just a massively insecure person, with no ability to connect with other people. So, to make herself feel better, she decided to throw together a so-called philosophy justifying her complete lack of love or empathy for anyone at all. Unfortunately, she attracted a lot of other miserable people who have decided to worship her as some sort of all-knowing sage. I also feel sorry for them. I'm no student of philosophy, as you can probably tell since I have focused on the novel aspect instead of the idealistic one. But it seems as if most people would be level-headed enough to see that the very principles that Rand constantly condemns, are in fact the principles that make life in a hard world bearable. They're an undeniable part of mankind's being. If you take away man's love for his fellow man, you take away the part of him that makes him man, and he becomes an animal. If every man (and woman) lived only for himself, it would not be a pretty world. If you don't realize that, you need to grow up. Or get some therapy and medication, quickly."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Given this new post 9.11 America, where it is considered \\"treasonous\\" (according to A.G.

Did you enjoy that? When was the last time you complimented someone for gain without truly believing what you said? How many times have you smiled when you weren't happy? Who hasn't stood aside and let their principles fly out the door? Does that feel good? My grandmother died when I was 11 and I didn't cry. Did I feel sad? No; so why should I compromise myself to make everyone believe I was hurt? Through my entire life I've fallen for the traps presented by those who wish to control me. As a teen I was embarrassed to ask girls out because when I was a child and teen I was ridiculed for being different since I was the new kid at a small school. I felt guilt when I felt good because I feared egotism! I carried a deep self-disdain because I was athletically and mentally skilled; I'd let others win when I could have easily bested them. They labeled me hyperactive and persecuted me for it and made me believe that I was the \\"wrong\\" one. My ego depended upon your acceptance, which was a weak foundation to begin with.When I read this book it was like looking into a mirror. I've always realized that I had to \\"let go\\" at some point but couldn't discern what I had to let go. Psychologists told me I had to listen and feel for others; they said that intellect shouldn't be a basis for friendship, less intelligent people could carry an emotional depth that would bring about a prosperous and rewarding relationship. What a lie! Dependence is that's called. They were a crutch that I used to create myself. This book revealed what everyone has effectively concealed from me: I could only rely upon myself. I feel guilt no longer. In some ways I'm now guided more so by my emotions than ever; these emotions aren't empty hunches but rational and logical reasoning. But, I guess, such things would be incomprehensible to those who base their lives around Ally McBeal, spiritual searching, and trends. I guess I should feel stupid because I had to discover this from a book. Well, I don't feel any such remorse. I've seen much in my short life; I've fallen for the best lies there are, ranging from self-sacrifice to spiritual enlightenment. None of these answered any questions or cleansed my soul in any way. The people who beat me down into a sniveling social worker are the collective minds of a hundred thousand years. I was bested by the best and have accepted the knowledge of my impotence. Everyone seems to believe that such a philosophy doesn't leave room for love, happiness, or emotions. Well, I disagree. I laugh when I'm happy and cry when sad (which isn't often). There are those I love, but I they aren't the foundation to my temple, only I take that honor. Others cannot hurt me anymore. This all came out of a single book, The Fountainhead. Laugh, flame, scorn, insult my grammar and organization, debase my intelligence, and attack my mistakes all you wish. You no long control me.Do I worship Ayn Rand? No. Unlike those of you who worship and dedicated yourselves to those who give you knowledge or freedom, I owe no debt to Ayn Rand. You describe those of us who subscribe (I like that term) to her philosophy as \\"drooling masses\\" and use that as a weapon to depersonalize my beliefs. Ayn Rand didn't create her philosophy any more than birds created air or chimps created bananas. There is truth in her writing and that is all that matters to me. Belief in your god or your neighbors and I will belief in my god, myself.I don't simple believe what Ayn Rand has to say. I've read the works of those who disagree with her such as R. Buckminster Fuller and still agree with Ayn. The Fountainhead wasn't meant to reflect reality but rather exists in a vacuum to prove a valid point. Maybe I enjoyed this book because I come from a fiction/sci-fi literature background and can easily accept the reality presented by the author.

This is akin to a Holocaust survivor marrying a member of the Nazi S.S. All fans of this book (mostly young White men) need to address the deep sexism and misogyny here.The plot is hackneyed and boring: a man pursues his dreams and ideals despite a world of cartoonish idiots around him. It's how teenage boys often feel. There is a hatefulness of weakness, gentleness, and calm: no wonder many right-wingers celebrate Rand.The goal is admirable: to think for oneself and be creative, but the novel is truly a piece of junk. Why not read true artists who urge you to think for yourself? Jack Kerouac, Emma Goldman, Ken Kesey, and John Steinbeck are some wonderful alternatives.After all, you don't have to hate the world, and hate women, to live a creative, independent life.

I've never heard of her philosophy before but after 700+ pages of her beating me over my head with it I don't think I'll forget about objectivism.I doubt that would I ever read another book by her, even though it was a relatively fast read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As a book, The Fountainhead can be an excellent fast-paced novel, fully of certain insights and provocative situations and themes.But as someone who flirted with Objectivism before coming to my senses early on, thankfully, it is very hard to separate the philosophical faults from the novel itself.Whether you care about the philosophy or not, it is a good book to read, even if for the simple reason that you may argue against Objectivism and know something about it. But the words in the novel, at times uplifting, ultimately become stilted because of the overbearing philosophical points Rand wants to make.Rand herself makes little distinction between her novels and the preaching of her philosophy itself. In the same way, this review is also a warning to those who might be inticed by Objectivism. There are excellent points to the philosophy, but for someone to extrapolate an absolute morality from the tenants of Objectivism is, in the same way religion has always been, out to control and convert. As someone studying to be a scientist, the merits of her philosophy simply do not coincide with how the world works, and the tenants pervert the Aristotilian concepts she so praises. The history of laissez faire capitalism is also wrought with evidence that \\"hands off\\" simply won't do.It is a great book to read, but don't become absorbed by Rand's persona. Please make it a point to dig up the sordid history behind Objectivism, Nathaniel Branden and Rand, and, most importantly, think for yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"From the first fifty pages of the book, it becomes obvious both what Rand's politics (regardless what you may think about them) and how she will promote them. Specifically with obsurd liberal/leftist sterotypes that allow her to push over. From the professor at the books start who promotes the absolute perfection of the &quot;classics&quot;, to a &quot;liberal&quot; populus who aparently accepts no deviation from the status quo, this book is an exercise in strawman politics."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As much as Ayn Rand is praised for her insight, I found this, as well as Atlas Shrugged, to be predictable and pat. Rand's use of language is nothing special (even simplistic) and her philosophy seems dogmatic and out-of-date. In the cold war society in which this work was first published, it may have held some relevance, but, in the 21st century, it seems dated and glib."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am a relatively tolerant person. I can read a book I disagree with and live. But this book was impossable. I threw it in the trash can halfway through. I don't have a problem with her characters, necissarily, but the way in which she portrayed the less perfect and heroic characters infuriated me. Those people are you and I, keep in mind. There is no Howard Roark; none of us can carry on a relationship with another person without speaking or contain the meaining of life in our art. It's jsut not possable. So if you want to read about how inferior and unaware you are, go right ahead and indulge yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Oh where to begin...A living, breathing Howard Roark-wannabe/fanboy recommended this book to me. At the time, he was much older and more educated than I was, which for some reason made me respect his opinion. I read the book, and slowly began to realize that this guy's life was so crappy because he thought he was so above everything...much like Roark. And Rand, for that matter (well I don't know if her life was crappy, but she did think she was above everything...anyway). I am at the point now where I cannot stand anyone who even has the slightest positive thing to say about this book or anything else Rand has ever written, or her pseudo-intellectual, slapped-together excuse for a \\"philosophy.\\"Before reading the book, I knew nothing about Ayn Rand, and I just dove right into it, and I'll admit that it started out interesting. I was expecting that powerful, classic novel that people raved about. But then I noticed how condescending her prose was, and then it began to get annoying. And then there were those PAINFULLY predictable and poorly developed characters that Rand's limited literary abilities created (but I guess that's what archetypes are meant to be). The plot itself was just as sorry as the characters. My initial expectation was that I would remember this book forever...and I certainly will, but not in the way that I had hoped.Honestly, trudging through this piece of crap was worse than reading one of those anecdotal examples from a sociology or philosophy textbook, as I've found that textbook authors can be better at developing characters than actual novelists. I am shocked, appalled, and disgusted that the Fountainhead has so many fans.In the past, I have been able to enjoy books without agreeing with the author's personal views or even liking the protagonist, as there are a lot of authors out there who can actually write. The plots were interesting, the prose was exemplary, and the characters weren't so one dimensional. Rand, on the other hand, spent her life telling herself that she was a genius whilst peddling the BS that so many refer to as \\"literature.\\" If you start this book, don't bother finishing it. The ending is a joke.Halfway through the book, something entered my mind: does this woman hate ANYTHING that remotely resembles a cohesive society, or just anything that might reek of socialism? Then I read her bio, and it made sense: she hated being in the Soviet Union, which is understandable, as many people did, and I suppose that sort of explains her obsession with individualism. And I'm all for individualism and achievement...but since when does disrespecting everyone around you and designing ugly buildings and refusing to coexist harmoniously with the world in general qualify as achievement? How is that noble? I mean, I suppose it's lovely to promote bettering oneself and setting goals and getting what you want out of life, but the whole \\"stick it to the man\\" thing is so overdone and unrealistic in most circumstances. Besides, many people can be individuals and achieve their goals without completely dismissing the society that allowed them to in the first place. Once again, if Rand was a more talented author, I could look past her philosophical views and get on with enjoying the book, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case.If you're interested in philosophy, read something else. Or a textbook. It'll be more fulfilling. Or read a comic book, so at least there will be pictures to look at every time you feel the need to roll your eyes at all the cliches. But if you STILL want to become acquainted with the Fountainhead, read the Wikipedia synopsis. The contributors to that page aren't necesarily much better writers than Ayn Rand, but you'll get the gist of the \\"story\\" within a few minutes.But if you're truly interested in Ayn Rand's self assured \\"brilliance,\\" go ahead and read the Fountainhead. You'll realize that anyone who openly celebrates it is a moron."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The recent financial crisis and government action-heavy response have resulted in a resurgence of interest in Ayn Rand. Given its focus on the economy, Atlas Shrugged has understandably received most of the attention. However, Rand's novel on art, The Fountainhead, remains relevant today as well and frankly is the better book.The Fountainhead follows two architects, Howard Roark and Peter Keating, over the course of their early careers (the novel spans approximately two decades). Dominique Francon serves as the love interest and stand-in for the author. Roark, Keating, Gail Wynand, and Ellsworth Toohey (the other two main male characters) are each intended to represent an archetype. Roark is the man who is, Keating is the man who could not be and did not know it, Wynand is the man who could have been and did not know it, and Toohey is the man who could not be and knew it.Rand's work shines when it stays character-driven and suffers when event-driven. The courtroom scenes in The Fountainhead are almost ludicrously bad. On the hand, Rand can make building a skyscraper and running a struggling architecture practice awfully interesting. Her prose is quite beautiful, if a bit on the ornate side. While her idealized protagonists (Roark) tend to be rather flat and dull, her less-than-perfect protagonists (Wynand) are much more interesting, and her antagonists can be downright terrifying (Toohey). For a female writer, Rand's female characters are curiously unsympathetic (Francon may be the most unsympathetic protagonist I have ever encountered)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead is a study of conflict certain to illicit varied responses from readers. Mainly a vehicle to present the self-aggrandized philosopies of the author, it is also a skillfully crafted and highly engaging novel.Characters who seem to be complex, fully rounded and realistic do not hold up well under close scrutiny. To me, they became one-dimensional inhuman monsters--ALL of them. Never before have I read a book in which my greatest desire was for all of the characters to be killed. I have nothing but pity for those people who may choose to admire and emulate any character in this novel. Despite this negative criticism of the characters themselves, there is much good to say about the central theme: Stand up for your beliefs and do not apologize for your differences.Rand offers evocative imagery with a minimum of words. Rand's dialog is extremely good even if can be overly contrived and unrealistic at times. Rand reserves a special contempt for her female characters and I cannot help but wonder if she was greatly disappointed with being born female.Read, enjoy and discuss Fountainhead but be wary of taking it too much to heart thus risking your own humanity."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Enjoyed reading it. Some sections of the book are very dramatic and engaging and gives goose bumps. The last 100 t0 200 pages is where philosophy kicks in and also the intense drama. Would definitely suggest anyone to read it. The reason for only four stars is because, there are some sections of the book which I did not feel gripping or may be its just me.Can't ever forget the last line of the book. Awesome ending!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Had to read this book in high school and enjoyed it then. Read it again just a few months ago for pleasure and had a much greater appreciation for it. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Seriously, though: while this book had some interesting ideas, a few great scenes, and good development of the more secondary characters, it mostly made me happy I did not live in Rand's world with these stilted people. I'm happy living in a world with shades of gray.I would give it 3 stars, because Ayn Rand obviously worked very hard on this book and creating the world within it, but it was too longwinded and repetitive.As for Howard Roark, as a character he is uneven at best. He had some nice moments, especially when he was kind to the un-appreciated sculptor. For most of the novel, Howard is boring but confident enough in his talents that he does not care if the world recognizes them. But that character bears no resemblence to the Howard who rapes Dominique (and yes, I know this has been debated, but the scene as written is rape and Dominique even states very late in the novel and matter-of-factly that \\"he raped me\\") and later goes on to commit another crime that seems driven by ego. Readers have twisted themselves into knots trying to explain Howard, but the reality is that Rand tried to pack all her ideals and fantasies into this one character, and ended up with a contradictory mess.Dominique is just disturbed in the head, quite frankly. Instead of using her wealth and writing skills to make herself happy, she wastes YEARS of her life being miserable because she believes most of the world is mediocre and conformist, and marries not one but two men that repulse her in some perverse protest against the world. She loves Howard (rape notwithstanding, or maybe even because of it - seriously, she needes help), but is on some quest to defeat him before the rest of the world can do so. She engages in a lot of self-nullifying behavior and I cannot see her as an ideal or a heroine."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've read this book in my teens, 20's, 30's, and now my 40's and I still think it's one of the best books i've ever read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead was published in 1943, the year I was born. So, with that in mind here is my review:Being a mystery and spy thriller reader mostly I committed myself a couple of years ago to reading a few classics along the way to broaden my literature horizen a bit. A friend suggested this novel by Ayn Rand. Of course I'd heard of Rand but wasn't particularly interested in mid-20th century East-Coast intellectualism but in view of my commitment I read and read and read. It is long.I must say that I enjoyed the book but probably not for the reasons many readers do. Rand's ability to describe scenes and characters gets an A from me. I could truely visualize the houses, buildings, clothes, the character's appearances and expressions. And from a psychological perspective, if you enjoy sorting those things out, it raised some interesting issues basic to our human nature. The story, on the other hand, developed too slowly and I admit I scanned a few pages just to get through a laborous chapter or two.If you are looking for a cozy mystery or a lite read to get your mind off of the daily grind The Fountainhead isn't what you are looking for. If on the other hand you want a challenge then go for it.Marvin Wiebener[...]The Moriah RuseThe Margin"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is one of those classics that ever reader needs to include in their library. Because the Fountainhead is sadly reliant solely on existential philosophy, the real gem in the story - the faithful expression of one's soul, is lost in a relativistic plot. Never the less, without much effort the reader can find a transcendent sense of self in the story's main character.Reviewed by, Dr. Jeffrey Wincel, author ofClimbing The Mountain of God, The Path to Mystical Discipleship,Surviving the Fall, America's Second Great DepressionandDefying the Trend: Business Ethics and Corporate Morality from a Faith Perspective."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Similarly to Atlas Shrugged, which is published by Dutton, the content being published is fantastic, as Ayn Rand intended. The general errors in printing, however, detract from the \\"Centennial Edition\\" printing. For instance, page 373 in 'The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition Hardcover)' the text is entirely bold. While Plume was better about the actual printing than Dutton (who publishes Atlas Shrugged Centennial Ed. HC Hardcover) it leaves something to be desired.It is unfortunate that one cannot rate the author, publisher, and the distributor separately. In such a system, Ayn Rand would be five stars, Plume would be one star, and Amazon.com would by five stars."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is one of those rare books that actually make one question one's own life. This intriguing novel by Ayn Rand is based on her life's philosophy of objectivism, the belief that the individual is more important than the whole, the antithesis of collectivism, objectivism holds that to be selfish is not bad, but in fact the best thing one can be.The plot of this book centers around a New York architect named Howard Roark who refuses to compromise on his work. He exemplifies, in Ayn Rand's point of view, the perfect man. In his struggle against the society that seeks to assimilate him into their unopinioned masses, Roark interacts with many other complex characters. Characters such as Peter Keating, who is the epitome of someone ruled by the masses; Dominique Francon, the female who tries to be the equal to Roark's Greatness; Ellsworth Toheey, the evil leader of the masses; and Gail Wynand, an individual who has the potential to be great but fails.The interactions of these well-developed characters sets an interesting background for a story that challenges the value of altruism and touts the value of the ego. All in all a very interesting, though quite lengthy, novel that is worth reading.-Casey C."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was a great book as far as the big picture goes. Not a fan of Ms. Rand's ridiculous \\"romantic\\" situations or some of the dialogue, but there is a serious moral to the story. I Read Atlas Shrugged first and I still can't decide if I should have read The Fountainhead first. I understood a lot more of The Fountainhead because I had read Atlas Shrugged already, but then again if I had read The Fountainhead first I could say the same thing. In whatever order they're read, both are well worth it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Of course, this is more than a novel. This is Ayn Rand's attempt to use the vehicle of fiction to present her philosophy of objectivism. In addition, she used another epic type novel, Atlas Shrugged.In terms of literary value, there is a lot to be desired in this novel. It is long. It rambles in places. It could have used a great deal of editing and rewriting to make it tight and the characters at times seem shallow and are revealed for the literary vehicles they obviously are to make her point.Why give it 4 stars then?Because this book has succeeded in what it set out to do. It has stood the test of recent time and grown in popularity. It has had a profound impact in philosophy, politics and simple human values and as such it can be said to truly be a classic.Lest you think that means that I'm a huge fan of the message of the book, I am not necessarily.You have to put the book into context however.Ayn Rand grew up in Soviet Russia and viewed the impact of collectivism and the impact that it had upon the individual when society's needs were elevated above opportunity for the individual to rise and shine. She chafed and wrestled against it.Introduced to the US and capitalism, she swung in rebellion to her upbringing and sought to elevate selfishness to a virtue which was to be encouraged and allowed with minimal restraint and influence from \\"Big Brother.\\"The Fountainhead, in my opinion is better than Atlas Shrugged, because here Rand achieves a more personable protagonist in which there is a sense of idenitification and sympathy. In that context, her philosophy takes on a rosier glow and seems more inviting and palatableOf course, ultimately, for me as well as many others, this philosophy breaks down. As others note, the presentation breaks down in many areas. There are no children, no dirty diapers, human emotions are kept in check to logic. This is what I have found with objectivism as well when I flirted with it. The constraints against abuse are artificial and rest too deeply in an idealism that itself doesn't pass the reality test for me.It does a wonderful job though of demonstrating the folly of the opposite extreme, that Rand saw in Russia and her evaluation of that system and its viability in the long term has been borne out by history.That's why I like and recommend the book. You don't have to agree with it to benefit from reading it. It has driven me more to the middle rejecting either extreme. That wasn't Rand's goal. But she did a good job presenting her case and I felt able to make some choices and evaluations. I was affected and that is the measure of a good book.The success of a book isn't necessarily in garnering your support and agreement. If it presents its case well enough that you can form an independent opinion and grow for the experience of reading it, then it is valuable whether you adopt objectivism or not.Read it. Enjoy it. Learn from it. Interact with it.It's a gripping read in the realm of thought, even if literarily it falls a little flat."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You may or may not be aware of the controversy surrounding this work. The Fountanhead is Rand's introduction to a bold philosophy called \\"Objectivism.\\" In short is values the will and ego of the individual over all, purporting that every action, every decision be given to a purpose solely in the interest of he who makes it.It is a novel about Howard Roark, an architect of Rand's perfect objectivist design. Roark will not, and perhaps cannot stray from the height of individual integrity; he acts for himself and one desire: to build.His character demands that he refuse to compromise on matters of his work. He pioneers a new and asthetically beautiful architecture, one that is mechanically efficient and devoid of visual fanfare. He also lives in a time where innovation is shunned in favor of variation on the old themes: roman, rennaisance, gothic. He is beaten and driven to poverty by those who wish to see him fail, those who play to the public's desire for vanity.In short it is a story of the genius of an individual against the insistence of the collective. It will challenge one's perception of the ego, of altruism, and of humanity itself--no matter what is made of it after all is said and done.The most persistent criticism of this monumental work is its lack of compassion. Many complain that the characters are cold. In fact, their compassion is subtle, but often more compelling than literature's most fabled heroes.If you plan to tear through this novel then do not bother--it requires time as does any type of digestion. It will force you wrench out any sliver of certainty you may have ever had about how to live one's life. The most egregarious mistake you could make interpreting this novel is to assume that it is cold, it teaches how to live."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"i usually read romantic books. i love them, but for some reason i heard about this book and bought it when i was down at the coast last summer. i instantly fell in love with the characters roark and dominique because of their secret relationship. I liked roark because he was independent and doesnt conform to what everyone else does. hes his own and does what he wants, regardless of the consequences. i dont like peter keating because he takes all of roark's hard work and talent and uses it for his own. that part made me mad. i wish dominique and roark would be together throughout the book. haha. overall i really liked reading it and i would read it again if my book hadn't of fallen apart."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I received this book as a present from a family member. With the little time that I have to spare I kept it on my bookcase unopened for half a year. As soon as I started reading The Fountainhead I was hooked. As an architecture student I can relate to the architecture themes and the characters presented in the novel. Not only could I relate to the characters, but I was enveloped on the personalities of the characters and the outcome of their actions. Ayn Rands descriptive way of writing is so specific that one can easily make a picture of the buildings and projects described. As I read all I thought about was flying to New York to see the buildings that were described, then I would realize that they aren't real and I think that such buildings should.I sincerely recommend this book to people who are interested in architecture. I know that architecture is very time consuming, but if you can spare a few minutes a day to read this book, you should."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead has, in one way or another, generally found its way into the hands of must [psuedo]intellectuals. While many people have qualms about the &quot;philosophy&quot; of objectivism, The Fountainhead is a shining example of Rand's &quot;real-world&quot; (albeit fictionalized) philosophy in action.The protagonist and center of the story is Howard Roark, an architecht. Throughout his career, he refuses to compromise his own integrity, creativity, or desires under the will of others. Such is the ideal of Rand, who, in objectivism, champions logic over emotion, rationality over irrationality. Roark embodies these traits, and as a result, is met with either applaud or with sneers. This book is many things to many people: To some, Roark is an uncompromising fool, a weak man. To others, (myself included), Roark is a pillar of strength and the definition of, quite literally, what it means to be a man.The Fountainhead, much like most of Rand's fiction (that is, Atlas Shrugged) is also an exercise in patience. While Rand's underlying ideas are most assuredly worth the time it takes to get through them (her tomes tend to stretch from 600 - 1000 pagse). This is, to be frank, the largest drawback to this book - a drawback severe enough to merit the dreaded four stars instead of five. Rand could have convincingly boiled down The Fountainhead to about one third of its original size. For whatever reason unbeknownst to me, she most evidently did not -- hence, you have either a remarkable testament to the triumph of man, or a doorstop.Your choice.If you are looking for a &quot;cheap and easy&quot; way to introduce yourself to Objectivism, then I suggest you look at the ARI's webpage or the various volumes on just objectivism. However, the most important service The Fountainhead provides is as an example of objectivism: It is the humanity of the story, which supports objectivism, which has the ability to convince a reader of the merits of objectivism. The intellectual searching for something to chew on will happily find it nestled in the pages of The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You might have heard people say, \\"The Fountainhead changed my life.\\" Its that kind of novel - it changes lives. After reading it, I saw things in a very different light. Objectivism is 'the' philosophy. Rand, however, should have conveyed her message solely through philosophical essays. Her novels are far from engrossing. The thing I disliked most about both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged is that her characters lack depth. They are either black or white - never shades of gray. In The Fountainhead, Roark and Dominique are perfect, flawless and one can clearly see the flaws in Keating and Toohey. It would have been interesting to see how normal Americans would behave in Rand's world, however, normal people do not exist in her novels. One can argue that our notion of a 'normal American' is not the same as her's. After all, she wrote the book decades ago.

When the egotist of Howard Roark is intermixed with the altruist of Peter Keating, the product attained from the mixture is amazingly singular; just as it is when she clashes Dominique with Peter, or Elseworth Toher with Howard. This amazing contrast created permits the reader to understand the benefits from selfishness and to rue the altruistic. The novel is also painfully long to finish, which is how it has to be: to defend and to be an integer with self is an arduous task, not because of what one feels for self, but because the masses will hate you for being singular and integrated--you shine upon their mediocrity.

His actions and comments seem similar to the guy we elected president. However we do not judge our new president as a \`villain' in this sense - Even though he and Toohey used the same methods to gain thoughts and minds of their followers.I now find myself classifying people as either Roarks or Tooheys.

It speaks of truth and independance, and passion for life. It depicts, in Rands words, &quot;man as he could and ought to be.&quot; Anyone who adheres to the pronciples of personal autonomy and responsibility, should read this book. It is an encouragement, and it changed my view of the world around me."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand, much like she did in the novellete &quot;Anthem&quot;, has said very much in very few words about many things. Other than the normal egotism and objectivism portrayed in her other works, the fountainead goes deeper into the realm of, at least I think, organized religion at its roots. More than that, but I think that Ellsworth, Keathing, Guy Francon and the majority represent the &quot;church&quot; of archietecture, and Howard Roark represents the new thinker, the &quot;agnostic&quot; in a sense. Remember, the Roman Catholic Church did not acknoledge that the geocentric view of the universe was correct until the 70s! Organized religion and groups as a whole will always be hate-filled about new ideas, they wish to maintain conformity. Ayn Rand says very much in this novel, and I dont see how anyone can see that this is bad writting, unless they just dont like Ayn Rand's philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As a junior in high school, a decade and a half ago, I read The Fountainhead nearly seven times. And although I wouldn't say that I was an Ayn Rand fanatic, I did read quite a bit of her work. At this point in my life The Fountainhead wouldn't have quite the same meaning that it did to me at age seventeen. However, I think that I still could appreciate aspects of the novel, which is certainly a modern classic, though some might say (and some might be really offended by this term), a cult classic. What comes to mind for me looking back is the strength of the protagonists and the really powerful way in which the author portrayed each character. For me as I read the book, the characters really came to life. Although I may not have understood it completely or caught nuances that might be apparent to me now, the characters were very well developed. Thinking back on the novel, what must have resonated strongly for me was the bravery, the belligerence, and the independent spirit embodied by Howard Roark and Dominique Francon. To my adolescent thinking these were really admirable and essential qualities, and even now I appreciate aspects of the integrity of their characters. Also I think that there is something in the novel that hooks into an environmental ethic. Though certainly the rape scene embodies an opposite spirit. If I were to recommend any of her work, it might be The Early Ayn Rand, because the stories seem to come from a less extreme and polar place than the later works that I have read, and they reveal an intelligent, articulate, tenacious, and developing author and artist."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Although Ms. Rand believed ATLAS SHRUGGED was her magum opus, THE FOUNTAINHEAD was her greatest piece of writing. Her characters at times do not ring true, but it is a book you cannot put down and for those who follow her intellectual teachings, this book is an superior introduction. I have read the parts she deleted, but had she kept them in the book, it would still be a good read, great story, fascinating by one of the most creative minds in 20th Century literature."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As time passes I see myself disagree with the philosophy of Ayn Rand more and more, yet her work has challenged me to think and question my own philosphy of life. I am not a hard core objectivist and I am actually a little amazed at how far hard-core objectivist go especial in their challenge of modern physics and quantum mechanics. But this book is a great book is worth examination and questioning.The Fountainheads characters are really amazing and interesting.Howard Roark the protagonist is a talented college drop out who struggles to become an architect. He refuses to design anything other than to his own design and will not be influenced by the whims of cleints or fads in design. His buildings are prefect in the book and Roark will pay out of his own pocket to fix his mistake in design. And he would rather see a building of his design destroyed than corrupted. Roark is driven by solving problems of design not by fame or fortune.He is contrasted by Peter Keating who unlike Roark always caves in to be popular opinon by catering to the whims of clients and critics. While Roark is almost uneffected by people, Keating is totally dependent on others for his ideas, dreams and sense of self.Dominique Frankon is Roarks lover who wants to see him destroyed and tries to destroy him herself. For she is tortured by the fact that everone gives in and compromises themselves. She tries to destroy Roark because see believes that he can not hold out forever against the world and she would rather see him destroyed than live a subservient life.Gail Wylan is Roarks best friend. Wylan is a newspaper owner who is a tyrant over his empire. He tries at first to control Roark and fails which is what starts there friendship. Wyland is forced to choose between public opinion and Roark in a court case. Wylan must choose bewteen power or intergity.Toohey is the devil in the form of a critic. He praises those who will give into society and attacks those who will show independence and integrety in their work. He wants to destroy indiviualism and replace it with a dull mediocracy. He wants to control mens minds by making them dependent on his evaluation of the world. He is facinated by Roark while Roark has little fasinatition with him. Toohey knows that he must at all cost destroy Roark.As I have said Rand will make you think. But challenge her ideas in your own mind. THE PASSION OF AYN RAND by Barbera Branden is an excellent biography for those who love or hate Ayn Rands views."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"...because I'd read somewhere that the hero committed an act of rape. I was convinced that if I read the book, I'd end up too disgusted by the hero to continue.One day, I opened the book at the middle, and started to read the story of Gail Wynand's life. I still didn't want to read about Howard Roark. But Wynand's story was and still is fascinating.Finally, in order to find out what happened to Gail Wynand, I had to sit down and read the book from the start. And that's when I discovered that I liked Howard Roark as a character. It's hard not to like someone who's faced with virtually every setback in education and in career, and who faces it all with the courage to endure and with an integrity that appears all the greater for the contrast to Peter Keating. I still don't like the fact that he raped Dominique, but I don't feel that this detracts from the plot or the unique character of Roark. The book says something very simple to me : be true to yourself and to your dreams, don't let anyone try to mold you into their idea of what you should be. By the way, Ayn Rand has a great writing style, too. I wouldn't call this the be-all end-all novel (Dominique is too irritating) but it's pretty damn good."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have not done a comparison of other books rated at this site, but a total of 195 customer comments thus far appears to indicate, at the very least, that this enduring work has had much influence, positive or otherwise. I read the book many years ago, and it impacted me personally in both positive and negative ways. All in all, I cannot say I'm worse off on account of it, but who can really say?From a literary perspective, you will find few books written with more eloquence or passion than this one. Ms. Rand was, in my view, a very talented woman, perhaps a flawed genius . . . The plot is intricate, fascinating and tightly woven. As a lawyer, I recall the courtroom scenes as being somewhat naive and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, but most people are not attorneys, so one can live with that minor discrepancy.Ms. Rand eventually became dogmatic, as did her philosophy and later novel; seeds or hints of this can be seen in the Foutainhead. The book is very appealing to the young--with its passionate idealism and black and white view of things; therein lies a material danger that young minds can be drawn in to the dogmatism and &quot;judgment&quot;-- against themselves and others--causing significant psychogical harm. By the same token, if not turned into a cult or inflexible system, if read with an instruction of caution (perhaps from a teacher or parent), the book can give some sense of insight, direction and meaning to the &quot;abyss&quot;, the world of an adolescent.I understand that Ms. Rand and her philosophy became so dogmatic so as to become almost a cult, or, at the very least, a religion. People who disagreed with her were even excommunicated, as though Ms. Rand was the Pope and her detractors were errant followers. This has happened with many influencial systems throughout history (e.g., Freud and his followers). Too bad. The book, and to a lesser extent, her philosophy, has many wonderful qualities.Depite the foregoing concerns and cautions, the book, all in all, is a classic.Give it to your children and students, but teach them to be strong and think on their own."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As someone that enjoyed the movie long before I read the book, I am now deeply disappointed. I read the Fountainhead after trying to read her philosophical book on Objectivism. Finding that text much too dry in style and content, I thought a novel would be a better first Ayn Rand book. The Fountainhead is extremely dull and boring at points with only brief stretches of interesting writing or thought. Developing and presenting her ideas should be done in far fewer pages. Fewer pages would make the lack of character development, lack of rationality and lack of realism of thought much less noticeable. In summary, a high school level philosophy with equally unrealistic love stories."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Philosophically, no other book could ever touched me. But Fountainhead did this. And atleast for me this is the bible of my life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The first time I read this book I loved it. It fed all the soap-opera ideals I had about myself and the individual, and I romanticized the comments someone else had told me about it. I bought it again a few years later, and couldn't finish it. The philosophy is obvious and self-serving, and the &quot;trial&quot; of the last few chapters was a simple way for the author to make sure even the most idiotic readers got her point. Blech.At the same time, it's important that you read this book and formulate your own judgment of it. Just don't accept it without question, which is what everyone seems to do. There are some serious flaws to the philosophy that's represented."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Understanding that Ayn Rand lived under Communism, I canaccept her radicalism. I would not, however, encourage anybody else towallow, or, perhaps more appropriately, exult in it.Perhaps the philosophical ideas presented in the work have some merit, but Rand's style makes this book into a literary atrocity. Rand takes seven hundred pages to build one theme, and to build it to lengths that might just drive a reader to insanity.It's a simple enough story; you have a hero, Howard Roark, the architect-genius who is, at his core, an artist who will not betray his artistic and individualistic credos (how swell), his romantic counterpart, a thin, knife-like woman (Rand sparing no time on subtlty) who, concurrently, seems to love Howard and want to destroy him. In the background revolve several characters who are, to varying degrees, sucked into evil through conformity. Not too bad. The problem? This book hits you like a hammer on the head."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There's no question that The Fountainhead presents some fascinating ideas. But the book is also infuriatingly inept: it's written in a tired melodramatic style, the characters are unbelievable (especially the love interest, Dominique), and worst of all it is way, way, WAY too long. This last fault is particularly unfortunate because many of the book's most interesting passages come in the final 200 pages.Having forced myself to wade through the entire thing, I have a recommendation for future readers. I suggest that you begin by reading the speech made by the book's hero, Howard Roark, to the jury in a climactic trial scene. (It takes up about 8 pages in Chapter 18 of Part 4.) Although the speech is put in Roark's mouth, it's clearly unfiltered Rand, and it lays out her philosophy and the book's point. The rest of the novel is simply an illustration of that speech. Once you've read the speech, you can go back and speed through the rest of the book, seeing how Rand envisioned her ideas in practice.The 2005 Centennial Edition of The Fountainhead contains as an appendix a useful small selection of Rand's notes for the novel (showing, for example, what she saw each character as representing). A second appendix provides an introduction to Rand's belief system (Objectivism), but Roark's speech covers much of the same ground more entertainingly.It should also be pointed out that the Centennial Edition is missing lines of text in at least two places (one being the end of Chapter 11 in Part 1). I guess it's a sign of Rand's repetitiveness that even the copy editors -- folks who are paid to be bored -- stopped paying attention after a while."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was supposed to be -if one believes the back cover- a book about two architects at war. But instead of focusing on such an interesting idea -Peter Keating, always leaning on crutches; and Howard Roark, always breaking free with new forms and materials- what we have here instead is a &quot;novel of ideas&quot; that attempts in one swoop to cover the media, altruism and selfishness, and a love story that reminds one of pulp fiction (not the movie, but the &quot;school&quot; of writing).I gave it two stars because, if you can suffer through all the cliches, there's some extremely thought provoking ideas that are inspiring. Stick to your guns, Rand tells us, and anything is possible. Don't compromise, and don't listen to others telling you you can't.But oh, the cliches! Every time Roark raises a building he walks through the skeleton, the girders lunging heavenward (as she might put it in her many variations on this same exact scene), with his hands clasped, with a cool, confident demeanor, languishuing in his own deftness and surety. And of course the kid on the bike, whom Roark gave &quot;the courage to go on living&quot;. I suppose some cliche usage is permissable, but after 700 pages it really gets on the nerves!Philosophically the book is very interesting, very foundation-shaking, but it's a NOVEL, of course, not a book on philosophy (of which she has several), and in examining &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; strictly as a novel, as a big story, I'm left feeling cold. Perhaps I'm just a product of my times, but way too much artifice and melodrama, and not nearly enough passion. Also: far too diffused, too many topics! Read it for the powerful philosophical ideas, but skip it if you want a good story!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is ironic that Rand's philosophy, that so strongly contests the possibility that people are in some way shaped by their environment, is itself in fact obviously the product of Rand's (understandable) reaction to the Bolshevist Revolution she experienced.Objectivism by itself is an internally consistent philosophy. However, it seems that most who call themselves \\"objectivists\\" are in fact, not. Take for example those who have written positive reviews of this book. The central aim of Objectivism is to seal yourself away from the concerns of others: objectivists should not care what other people think. Acts of charity are taboo, as they \\"degrade both the giver and recipient.\\" What then, is the goal of objectivists who need to express themselves in forums such as these? They should not need to seek approval for themselves or Rand according to their own philosophy, and \\"enlightening\\" others is something that one like Howard Roark would never concern himself with: it is too close to charity.I also take issue with Objectivism itself. Question the ends that such a philosophy implies. What is inherently wrong with a charitable act? Take for instance the following scenario:While about on a walk, one sees a child teetering on the brink of a well, about to fall in. One such as myself would naturally seize the child to prevent her from perishing. However, according to Objectivism, one should allow the child to fall to her death, both for fear of dirtying one's suit, and because the charity of such an act would be degrading to both involved.I give The Fountainhead two stars because I thank it for spurring my own thoughts, while recognizing such thoughts to be nothing other than the page-by-page attempt to keep from putting the book down. Read it so you can criticize it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"To begin, a review of this epochal novel: Tremendously well written, except in the area of dialogue(one of Rand's inherent flaws as a writer); brilliant characterization and description. Well(and tightly) plotted, with a memorable ending.To finish, some complaints for my fellow reviewers:1) the \\"Rape\\" scene- If any of you had actually bothered to READ the work, you would have noticed a convenient part:\\"They had been united in understanding beyond the violence, beyond the deliberate obscenity of his action; had she meant less to him, he wouldn't have taken her as he did; had he meant less to her, she would not have fought so desperately. The unrepeatable exaltation was in knowing that they both understood this.\\"It was, in the strict definition of the word, a rape: he did not ask her consent; however, in the true meaning of the word 'consent', she granted it in every way. That was how they both needed it to be done. Roark is not a vicious rapist.I have seen other reviewers complain that the novel did not give them the happy feeling they damn well have a right to expect in a novel; boo hoo. Go read some Pooh Bear if you want lovey-dovey nonsense--- you won't find it here. Roark, by his nature, is a cold(though not unfeeling) person. You complain about his lack of compassion; what is compassion? Feeling for others, for no reason other than they happen to be the others. Roark, as a perfect embodiment of individuality, does not grant his emotions frivolously; he considers them an intrinsic part of who he is---you don't share yourself with everybody.But I can't expect a group of quasi-intellectual plebians to understand such obviously complex ideas. What can you do when you deal with people...ah well, c'est la vie."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This overtly philosophical novel is about Howard Roarke. This book describes the career of a fiercely independent architect, who exemplifies Ayn Rand's objectivism. His career is juxtaposed with a colleague from college, Peter Keating, and is intertwined with other characters, including a unique woman named Dominique, a successful businessman name Wynand, and a famous \\"intellectual\\", Tooley.Rand thoroughly describes each individual's concept of humanity throughout the book. This is strength, and a flaw. The dialogues are very, very contrived, and at points insulting to the reader's intelligence. Keating and Roarke's rivalry was thoroughly enjoyable. To see such those two in tandem, though extremely overt, was stimulating. The inclusion of other characters, especially Dominique, bored me to death. Even though she provides a sort of bridge between two the two rival philosophies, her intrusion into the story is convoluted and serves little purpose than to occupy pages.This book contains a great message. It's almost hard to find anyone who doesn't relate to Howard Roarke's character. It's lack of subtlety, its super preachy and continuous dialogues, annoying other characters, all deter it from making it an enjoyable read. I found myself glued to some pages, while trudging through others. It's best to describe this as an essay containing fictional characters, rather than a classic novel.Some people say that this book changed their life. Fair enough, but all the philosophy and messages are presented throughout simple economic principles, historical affairs, and common sense. The only true insight I gained from this was the definition of objectivism. Not worth 700 pages of only mildly interesting reading.Would I recommend this book? Probably, it's not that bad, and you can decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Paraphrasing another reviewer: To rate with a star, or a hundredth of a star, what Rand has created, is like measuring interatomic distances with a ruler, but for this purpose, One Star must do.Some of this book's fans think that &quot;only a brilliant--free-thinking--mind might understand&quot; it, and take poor reviews as evidence of &quot;the corporate mentality that imbues America today.&quot;Horse puckey. Rand's style is melodramatic and stodgy, her characters wooden, and her plot contrived and pedantic despite her own contention that art did not exist to serve didactic purposes.Her central character, Howard Roark, whom some think &quot;is what all men should seek to become,&quot; is a creative enough fellow in architecture but has a peculiar blind spot where people are concerned (including himself). There isn't the slightest reason why a seeker of value can't seek, and find, value in the lives, health, and happiness of other people, nor any reason why a rational human being should deny his own emotional states; yet Rand's most die-hard fans mindlessly ape Roark's indifference to other human beings and his ruthless repression of his own feelings. Why? Probably because Rand herself had the same traits -- which she rationalized, and &quot;objectified&quot; as human &quot;ideals,&quot; in (and by means of) tripe novels like this one.As a projection of the ideal man, even of the ideal creator, Roark falls miserably short _even_ by the standards of rational egoism -- just as Rand herself did. Objectivists, wake up; this woman was the victim of numerous psychological disorders, and her philosophy shows their influence. Libertarians, beware; the ideals of liberty do _not_ depend on the ravings of this arrogant and megalomaniacal lunatic -- and whatever her lunatic admirers tell you, she was _not_ the first person in history to cobble together a philosophy of reason and liberty.Oscar Wilde's comment on someone else's work applies also to Rand's: it is both original and good; unfortunately, the good parts aren't original and the original parts aren't good."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There are two problems with this book: its architecture and its main character. I'll start with the second.The hero of The Fountainhead is autistic. Rand's description him proves this in abundance, even if this was not her intention. He is in the room but not in the room, he looks at you but not at you, he is committed to the projects in his mind but has no clue what goes on in the minds of others or what clients could possibly want. Look up autism, read this book, then tell me I'm wrong.Back to the first problem. The model of architecture in this book has proven itself unreliable over time, as Stewart Brand notes in How Buildings Learn. Modernist buildings leak, handle the weather terribly, and are generally hated by their occupants. Since, in theory, the artist began with his own idea of the function of the building rather than its actual, daily uses, this is no surprise. Since the celebrated idea in The Fountainhead is an autistic inability to understand the client and building dwellers, Roark's buildings would undoubtedly suffer the same fate as all other modernist buildings. Frank Lloyd Wright, the model for Roark, built flat-roofed houses in the snowy midwest, for example. Brilliant! Such buildings, though admired on the outside, are despised by the people who occupy them and the maintenance teams that take care of them. As Brand notes, though, over time, \\"function melts form.\\" Thank God. Thank God architectural time time itself has proven Rand's thesis on autistic, modernist genuis untenable!A final problem should be noted. The model of humanity in The Fountainhead isn't really all that rare. An uncommunicative, emotionally enclosed engineer? Wow. How novel. Sound like any husbands you know, Silicon Valley?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you consider yourself a conservative or even just a Republican (Independents are also welcome), this book and its &#34;sister&#34;, &#34;Atlas Shrugged&#34;, are required reading.

While this book isn't as cringe-worthy as Atlas Shrugged, still, there were many parts of it that were downright strange, you could even say lurid. First of all, the author's contempt for the human race practically sizzles off each page. Secondly, Howard Roark is nothing less than a sociopath. Thirdly, that whole rape scene and its meaning was just nasty on many levels. There are elegant moments in this book, certainly, but for the most part it's just a creepy product of a rather disturbed mind."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"We were shipped a different edition then was pictured.We needed it for a class and I had to buy another book because of it.VERY UNHAPPY!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You'll either get it, or you weren't meant to.

The novel is the story of architect Howard Roark and how he rejects the inferior, backwards- looking of the architecture of the past in order to be his own man and forge his own path. The book is well-written and engaging. I do not ultimately agree with the basic premise of the novel, namely that unfettered man is the greatest force in the universe. In one place this is disturbingly celebrated in the book through a rape scene, which is presented as positive because Roark is exerting his will. More often, it is represented through Roark's unwillingness to compromise professionally. The novel is highly overt in its atheism. (To put things into perspective: Rand mostly likes Nietzsche, but finds him a little too weak and religious, if one can believe it) Ultimately, I recommend the work--just keep in mind it's a text promoting a thesis and try not to get too riled up."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of the best novels I have ever read...

This book did not give me answers, but it did give me inspiration and hope, even if it makes one indulge in impractical dreaming. Howard Roark is not a concept i wasn't already familiar with because a fair number of other out there like me, were and are now still battling with the concept of expressing individuality and the yearning to be different in all aspects of so called acceptable society. The fountainhead isn't just about architecture, for the plot lends itself to the characters with whom we (in our social &quot;categories&quot;) should be able to identify with to some extent. The downside, or perhaps Rand was attempting to make her characters more intense, is the fact that Roark seems abit too extreme, but not to the point of disbelief. After scrolling down the exhausting of reviews on this page there is one review which i can vividly remember, and that is if you were never seeking individuality in the first place, it was best to leave this book alone. Nevertheless it is an interesting read and gives new insight to those who are starting out in the architectural field (they will probably find this more useful since the book uses alot of archi jargon) There won't be much point trying to analyze the characters in the book here for you, its a review after all and YOU should be making your own interpretations about it. so go read"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I could, if I so desired, refute every statement against Ms. Rand as a novelist, philosopher, or human being.

Life-changing for some I suppose it may be, but that is really ridiculous. &quot;A is A&quot;, therefore I know everything and am the most important person on Earth. Man, that's tough. So involved, in fact, that Rand needed to write over 700 pages of turgid proseYet in all of this thick volume, Rand never once refers to those evil &quot;other people&quot;, implying that her &quot;ideas&quot; were both: A. totally original; and B. the conclusive, final word in the philosophical tradition.It's true that most realists like Russell never claimed to prove the existance of the external world (though I'm sure the Objectivist cult doesn't feel it has to bother with the inferior ideas of other supposed philosophers), but Rand does, and takes it to its illogical extreme. Not only can one know Truth, but he can be so irrefutably sure in this knowledge that listening to other people (the &quot;drooling masses&quot; in Objectivist jargon) is an utter waste of time--indeed, an evil to be avoided at all costs.How does an Objectivist know he is right? Well, Reason (naturally with a capital 'R') of course! Simple as that! Wave the magic wand of Reason, and *poof!* in a blaze of blinding enlightenment enters Truth Infallible.

No, Rand does not paint a portrait of things as they SHOULD be, but instead a ludicrous picture of things as they SHOULDN'T be, in some sort of alternative world where nearly everybody is a mindless socialist parasite. Romantic my foot!In case you care (I didn't), the hero of this story is Howard Roark, a man who supposedly represents a perfect human specimen, but seems to me to have all the &quot;individulism&quot; of a graphing calculator. Roark is nothing more than a flat, emotionless talking head, who says very little (apparently Warhol-like silence is a virtue in Rand's mind), except to spew abstract philosophical silliness. Yawn.And you KNOW, for a book that suggests in every other paragraph that art should be more streamlined and functional, this is one EXCESSIVE novel. The story (slightly less substantial an issue of Teen Beat) is repetitive to the point of a headache, with the incredibly simplistic theme rammed into our brains like a jackhammer. It almost makes you wonder if a FEW of the &quot;evil&quot; editors who rejected this book when it was first written didn't do so simply because it had been edited so horribly.I'm certainly not going to get into Rand's philosophy here, but I DID find myself a bit offended by this novel's fallacious reasoning: either feed your own ego or join the collectivist whole. Whatever."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am a teenager, to whom Ayn Rand is supposed to appeal the most. However, Rand's books are some of the most badly written I have ever read, and they are based on an utterly irrational non-philosophy. I find that Rand's fiction in general is a propaganda tool, much like the &quot;socialist realist&quot; fiction of the Soviet Union under Stalin. Although I find the writing in The Fountainhead slightly more bearable than Atlas Shrugged, I give the same argument about the contradictions of objectivism for both books: In an objectivist world, most individuals would be prevented from realizing themselves. Those who sought material gain would for the most part ignore the world of ideas (the only lasting source of individual progress). In addition, people would start out on different economic strata (often intersecting with racial hierarchies, a central problem in society which Rand also completely ignores). Those on top, in the drive for material gain which does not take into consideration the lives of others, would probably prevent those on the bottom from ever taking individual responsibility. Rand's individualism is fatally flawed because it only applies to a few, who, in her model of society, can control the lives of the rest. Rand's laissez-faire capitalism, under the pretense of individualism (i.e. &quot;objectivism&quot;), may well be an example of economic totalitarianism. Her so-called philosophy is certainly not &quot;objective&quot; for the majority of the world. Also, as history has proven, laissez-faire capitalism has almost inevitably led to the rise of monopolies and the consolidation of economic and racial groups, which undermine individualism completely. Finally, Rand's objectivism would do away with beauty, friendship, love, and family, leading to hatred and violence on an enormous scale. The environment would be destroyed within a few decades, leading to the extinction of humanity. This concept should appeal only to those who hope for this kind of future. All the people who gave the book unconditional praise in their reviews have to look a lot deeper Don't waste your time with the work of a BS artist--albeit one of the most successful BS artists ever. Read real philosophers instead --like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Mill, etc. And for those of you who want a well-written novel with real philosophy in it, check out Schopenhauer, Camus, Sartre...NOT Rand"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If _The Fountainhead_ had been written as an exposition of Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy in non-fictional form, its message would be vastly more palatable today.An appreciation of this book is independent of whether the reader agrees with Rand's assessment of the highest goals to which humanity can strive. Unfortunately, by reading it one is forced to wade through a morass of patently contrived situations, involving characters so reminiscent of automata that one continually expects them to be unmasked by the sudden confession of the evil genius who programmed them. Alas, no such relief appears. By the time the denoument is reached _The Fountainhead_ requires the willing suspension not only of disbelief but of disgust.Perhaps it was the author's hope that sympathy toward other persons should be eliminated as an unethical, insufficiently selfish impulse. If so, the characterization in this novel will serve as a useful exercise in the quashing of benevolence. Any reader who feels for Howard Roark or Dominique Francon may well benefit from a modicum of psychological attention."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Those who have been critical of this book, simply did not get it. The critiques illustrate this more profoundly then anything I could possibly say. They accuse Rand of being guilty of the very thing she brilliantly denounced. Rand knows reality, and deals with it accordingly.This book speaks for itself only for those who care to listen. YOU either know what I mean or you don't."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I knew Ayn Rand first as the founder of Objectivism and later as a novelist. I think her capacity as the latter leaves a lot to be desired. Repetitively used is the &quot;tell-me&quot; (v.s. &quot;show-me&quot;) style of narrative: lacking in imaginative language both in the descriptive and intellectual context.It becomes obvious early on what the message is: &quot;individuality is great, blind conformity, not so great&quot;. It becomes more and more obvious in the next 20 times the point is iterated, to the point of tiring. Objectivism aside, I feel there could have been more eloquent,subtle and ultimately effective ways to write a novel as a work of (intellectual) fiction. As a reader, I didn't care much for the characters, and that's a Bad Thing(TM) in my judging of books."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As a Brit, I'd never even heard of Aryan Rant until I moved to the USA a couple of years ago.Once here, her name cropped up many times, especially when Alan Greenspan (a former disciple of hers) was mentioned, or I talked to some of my young American colleagues. They seemed to idolize Aryan Rant, and speak of her and her works with great reverence.So, with much anticipation I bought this monster of a book, fully prepared to read and enjoy a cult piece that had escaped my attention, or failing that, get a view of Architecture during the peak of the Modern Movement - the people responsible for all those huge concrete cubes in every city in the Western World.Months later, its sad to realise that at the age of 35, I came to this book at least 20 years too late. Its an immature, second rate novel, challenging only because of its great length and turgid writing style (forgivable perhaps, since English was Rant's second language).As for its philosophy; &quot;fascism with an adolescent face&quot; might summarise it in five words. The main character, Howard Roark clearly believes himself above all other men (and especially women). He never feels doubt or uncertainty, and acts towards everyone with humorless contempt. Amazingly we observe that he's bitter, isolated, and can't relate to anyone. He also feels desperately misunderstood and undervalued by an ignorant and cruel conformist society. Boo hoo! How cruel the world is to unrecognized genius!Which I suppose, explains this novel's enduring popularity among bright (mainly male) adolescents - this is a character they can REALLY relate too, although unlike Salinger's Holden Caulfield, he shares his creator's complete lack of wit and humour.Seldom have I struggled so hard to finish a novel, Moby Dick was a breeze compared to this weighty turgid lump. Occasionally there's an illuminating thought to be extracted like a piece of soap trapped deep in a sodden sponge. But mainly I felt disbelief; amazed at the extraordinary naivet&eacute; of the author, did she imagine any business, let alone architecture, functions in this way? I was stunned that someone held to be master philosopher and Literary (note the capital L) author could create so many two dimensional forgettable characters, and so many forgettable scenes, each to be dissected and explained for us idiots in the next 30+ pages, just in case we missed the point the 4th time it was made.In desperation, I read around the book a little and started making excuses; Rant's sole exposure to architecture was a six month stint (working for free mainly as an observer) in Frank Lloyd Wright's office. This is a philosophical novel, bravely expounding a fascist viewpoint when America (and the rest of the free world) was busy fighting Nazi Germany and its ally Japan. Rant, openly admitted (years later) that she knew nothing of psychology (quite an admission for a novelist, you might think).Eventually, I emerged from finishing &quot;The Fountain Head&quot; as bewildered as I had been by page 30. This is an adolescent book, written by an intelligent but deeply flawed author, who creates deeply flawed cardboard characters and overtly manipulates them to explain, at great length, a philosophy so unrealistic that it cannot apply to a world any of us recognises.The truth is The Fountain Head spouts bilge. Gallons and gallons of toxic bilge. Pity the poor adolescents who lap it up - sooner or later it will do them terrible harm."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished reading this book for the first time.As a novel, the characters are totally unbelievable. In fact, I found it hard to understand them as characters, since they were one dimensional to the point of it not bearing much relation to real people at all. The book is much too long. I could've gotten the same value out of reading a 50 page summary of the book.That said, I don't believe this book is the work of the devil, or of a vast right-wing conspiracy. I don't think it works as a manifesto of right-wing politics, like some people think it is. Anyone who believes that is operating at the same level as someone who believes that all cooperation and sacrifice is evil. In both cases, It shows a total lack of understanding of the other viewpoint.It's unfortunate that Ayn Rand is associated with Libertarianism. I'm a Libertarian, but I certainly don't believe in most of the Objectivist views. In an ideal Objectivist world, neither capitalism nor liberty could exist. IMO, cooperation and respect for the value of others is requisite for either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I couldn't put the book down and found myself thinking what a socialistic world people wanted back in those days.

This novel delves into the importance of the individual. I know Ayn Rand due to her life story is a radical. I also know that she has taken a fair amount of criticism over the years for her views, but I don't care about that.I think America is defined not by its mediocre minds. Ayn Rand displays the cogent and easily definable train of thought throughout this book. Howard Roark is a character that I would like to meet. He is vivid and his complexity is in his ability to withstand the pressures around him to adapt.I also highly recommend this work. I think all should give it a try. The novel is one that builds on the individualistic streak in our nation. What sets America apart is the ability of the individual to succeed or attemt to succeed despite the outside pressures of the larger group. This novel is a great piece of American fiction. While you do not have to agree with the story entirely, you have to respect the context and the verve with which she writes it.If we are concerned with how to handle bullying and peer pressure, have kids read this book, and see someone entirely impervious to such piddle paddle!You should read this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read a lot and Ayn Rand brought the characters & story to life as I have never read.

At first I was astounded that reviewers criticizing Rand could communicate intelligently and even, on a few occasions, with eloquence! It was after further consideration that I may have come to understand the emotionality behind their responses.The two major criticisms are that Rand preaches an unrealistic or incredibly simplistic philosophy. Let me address the perception of simplicity first. I agree with reviewers that experience some aversion to individuals spouting Objectivistic philosophy as the messiah that humankind has long awaited. I think Rand would also. Instead of saying that The Fountainhead is more appropiate for high schoolers or individuals in the prime of their lives, perhaps it's more fitting to say that Objectivism is a good foundational philosophy. Rand doesn't so much teach what values to hold sacred as she is presenting a framework for evaluating belief systems. Rand is espousing a modern rendition of Socrates' &quot;To thyself be true.&quot; How one is true is a subjective experience that should be analyzed objectively. To try and be Roark is not the answer. Rand articulates a model in which one can be themselves.Her philosophy as unrealistic? What philosophy is? Almost by definition, a philosophical system pertains to the ideal, not reality. It could be that we're witnessing such intensity of feeling because the framework she puts forth IS realistic and attainable by those willing to try. Those that may consciously or unconsciously consider themselves too weak to assimilate this system may be the ones shouting the loudest. To paraphrase: They're protesting WAY to loudly!A final comment: some have questioned the validity of her framework because of its incompatibility with the concept of altruism. Perhaps, as theorists in philosophy and psychology have been doing for eons, we should be questioning the validity of altruism?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The only thing that stopped me from rating this book at 10 is the hope that there might be something better out there. Truly well written book..both content wise and presentation wise. The characters are admirable, the philosophy even more.For those who consider this book childish, I would only say, it requires a real CHILD to make the world a better place!!Respecting tradition is fine, but if you dont enrich it from time to time, the world would never progress..and to enrich the world, you HAVE to go against the flow, and challenge its flaws..through your actions. This book shows just how..Its a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This novel is not a commentary upon society and the community. Rather, it serves as a means of disection by which we slowly peel away each layer of that very same society and community. In a sense, with each page, we slowly disect ourselves. With the sharpest of blades, the novel slowly slices away each layer, until we reveal the tender regions of what we trust, beleive and rely upon. This is why one can both praise (as helthgiving), or hate (as painful), and why many miss the point or refuse to see it(as one does when a serious matter involving their health arises.) Ayn Rand's skill with the knife makes her cuts almost undetectable. And that is the same reason why her novel is so wonderful and so cruel. She simply choses to cloak the instrument in the finer aspects of humanity so as to lessen the pain. For Ayn Rand, Art and Architecture are the novicaine of our culture and thereby a means to an end."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Have you ever wondered how we as a people could be so happily discarding good taste for bad? Has it ever occurred to you that there is a trend toward an ever lower common denominator in music, art, politics, ethics, morals, and virtues?

Read this book and think again!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading Atlas Shrugged (AS), I found it hard to believe that A.R. could out do herself. I must admit, however, that I found the Fountainhead to be far superior. What makes it better is the dialog and characterization, which are much more natural and deeper than in AS. In AS, it seemed as if all the characters are one dimensional actors, only there to illustate A.R.'s philosophical principles. Toohey's character is particularly outstanding. I have never encountered a character that more accurately embodies evil in its purest form. What makes Toohey especially frightening is that his evil is of the intellectual, rather than the physical, variety. His speech to Keating on the nature of power (at the end) is a classic!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished this book after reading it for the purpose of a contest. The first two sentences were enough to capture me: &quot;Howard Roark laughed. He stood naked at the edge of a cliff.&quot; This book is good for both shallow and philosophical thinkers. The contiuous struggle and dissection of human thought and action were depicted wonderfully. After finishing the book, I was left with the feeling my best-friend had moved. I missed the characters extremely, so I started it over. Today I bought &quot;We the Living&quot;, the first book written by Ayn Rand. I urge humans of every age to read this, especially independent thinkers."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is about creativity, rationality, individuality, and other such virtues.

This quality has made the novel both so admired and so despised. Is it too long? Probably. Is it merely Rand's soapbox from which she can dispense her thoroughly unrealistic expectations that she demands from humankind? Absolutely. And yet, in spite of this, the writing succeeds. It remains eloquent, but like Roark's buildings, it is not ornate. She writes simply and concisely, which sounds strange to say, in light of the fact that the novel is over 600 pages. True, many of the additional pages are repetitive, but no one can deny that her point was lost. This book has made me examine myself and my motives, and still continues to do so. I think it is a mistake to try to &quot;be&quot; Howard Roark, or worse, to measure yourself against him; some of the previous reviews seemed to be implying this in their unabashed praise. As readers, I think that it is our responsibility (if we defend what Rand writes about) to choose the path that most suits us, that allows us to take those steps toward self-actualization, and from there, we will come to understand the almost inhuman steadfastedness to principle that Roark exhibits. The book is brilliant. It is over fifty years old, and still gaining in popularity, but that is not why you should read it. You should read it to gain a new understanding of life - your own."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I randomly picked the book and first read it for a book report in the 11th grade. The concepts and principles in the book were mind opening and character forming to me at that time. Although I am not an Ayn Rand &quot;disciple&quot; so to speak, I do admire a good bit of her work and thoughts. The characters in the book became crystal clear to me and their traits and actions became eternally memorable throughout my early adulthood. I can still recall the enthusiasm with which I relayed character profiles and storylines to my classmates. After reading the book, it was indeed as if I had know the characters for years. I wished I could have told them about it the whole day. It is the only fiction book that has stayed with me from that time period.

Dramatizing the role and importance of integrity and independence of thought in one's life.The key to Dominique's confusing character is that she believes one's values cannot survive the rough and tumble of real life. Since she cannot ignore the value in which she holds Roark, she fights to shield him from that rough and tumble, in spite of his eagerness to embrace it. She cannot embrace a relationship with Roark because she cannot face its eventual destruction. Roark must demonstrate that values can be achieved, that life can be enjoyed, and wait for her to learn this.(Contrary to popular misreadings, there is no true rape scene, but a test, initiated by Dominique, of Roark's will and loyalty to values. It's complicated.)I've read this novel twice so far and found it exciting and thought provoking, with new insights each time. Howard Roark is the character that even Gary Cooper could not do justice to in the movie."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand's ideology dominates all of her work, and this is her masterwork. No one will ever accuse her of being Steinbeck, Hemingway or Hawthorne as far as her writing style, yet her charecters and storyline are among the best developed in modern literature.Her abject fear and loathing of Socialism/Communism is so palpable, that it gives you a real read and feel of the times in which she lived.I just wish she was a little less long winded."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"So the audio book is abridged, what can you do? I just recently finished listening to this, and I love this story. Ayn Rand develops some of the most bizarre and interesting characters I've ever encountered.

Not only is this a great story that I agree everyone should experience, I found that Edward Herrmann did an excellent job reading it.

Everyone should read this book, not because the philosophy it espouses will be one that will have unanimous consent; not because the story is realistic or plausible; not for any of the wrong reasons, or even for any of the right reasons. For example, this book is an extremely fast-paced read that manages to suck you in within the first 50 pages and not let go of you until the very end. This book is also interesting and worthy of thought. However, this book's greatest merit, and if this were its only merit, then it would suffice to make the book great just by it being there, is that this book will change you.After reading Ayn Rand, you will see things differently. You might not become a Howard Roark or a John Galt. You might not even become one of the lesser, but still virtuous characters. You might even have nothing but contempt for all of these supposedly virtuous characters who design their lives around self actualization through egotism and selfishness. But, you will see the world differently. You will suddenly see these traits of people. You will make comparisons. You will ask yourself the question \\"What would Ayn Rand think?\\" That is just how the book is written. It is written to create an indelible impression on every reader.I know this, (Actually, I think that Ayn Rand uses this expression constantly in her book.) because my life was changed by this book. Not only because I neglected to do a lot of things because I would rather have read another chapter of this long book, but in the sense that my current ideology is shaped by the philosophy that she espouses. I don't necessarilly agree with all of the precepts, but I certainly sympathize with many of the more overarching ideals.Sure, after reading this book you might become a jerk. Many people do, but at least as a jerk, you will be one that is somewhat well read. Any maybe, you will become quite the opposite, just to spite objectivism, but that's not too bad either.In this way, the book is a work of art. It is guarenteed to create an impression of some sort and afterall, I am dubious that this could be said about every book, or even most books. In this way, Ayn Rand is more than a self-obbsessed philosopher, but a legitimate artist, whose works should be read by everyone who thinks.

In the intervening twenty years I've read it a couple of other times and have become more aware of Rand's eccentricities and failings as a writer, but it is still a powerful story, one that expresses ideas one is unlikely to encounter anywhere else and that everyone should read in their late teens or early twenties. I do recommend reading Rand's \\"We The Living\\" before tackling \\"Fountainhead\\" (\\"We the Living\\" shows where Rand came from and why she became the extremist she did) and, if you're still motivated, read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" afterwards. It's the order her novels were written in and they all definitely make more sense if read in that order. Are there things to disagree with in the book? Of course. Was Rand an extremist screwball?

Seems that all people care about is pleasing those around them, not for the purpose of making the world a better place, but rather to adapt themselves to the collective of the misleaded and exploitive society (speaking of which, read &quot;Anthem&quot; and see what the consenquences may be).Read the first chapter of this book and you won't be able to put it down.

Upon reading Rand's epic, I was struck by its similarities to John Milton's PARADISE LOST. Like Milton, Rand has curiously allowed the novel's supposed villain, Ellsworth Toohey, to be the most fascinating character in the book.Unlike Milton's epic poem, however, Rand's novel has virtually no literary value whatsoever. The novel's value arises merely from the odious fact that her cult of devotees insist this trash is a classic of world literature and philosophy. As a philosopher, Ayn Rand is no novelist. And as a novelist, Ayn Rand is no philosopher.There is absolutely no believable dialogue or action in this novel -- the weak plot functions merely as a tool for philosophical harangues to spill out of the mouths of completely uninteresting characters. I know the defenders of THE FOUNTAINHEAD say that Rand purposefully created an ideal character in Howard Roark. Ideal? Perhaps. Unsurpassingly dull, without a doubt. Howard Roark is the most wooden, one dimensional literary character that I have ever encountered; he exists solely on the paper on which he is printed.The love scenes between Howard Roark and Dominique Francon are likewise laughable. Rand's idea of passion must be akin to a neanderthal clubbing his betrothed over the head and dragging her back to the cave. How ironic that Rand completely subverts her Objectivist philosophy by pandering to the lowest common denominator.Defenders of Rand say that THE FOUNTAINHEAD is actually the lessor of Rand's philosophical treatises, and that to fully appreciate Objectivism, you must read ATLAS SHRUGGED. Well, thanks but no thanks. After suffering through some 700 pages of THE FOUNTAINHEAD, I've served my time in hell.Jean Paul Sartre had it all wrong; hell isn't other people, its suffering through utterly boring books such as THE FOUNTAINHEAD.

He was the first to climb Mount Everst. Or was he? There was flag planted at the summit. And that flag belonged to Peter Cheating! Rock's attention was diverted by a growing whirlwind. The heavens parted and Rock hafl expected a repentant God to offer an explanation. Instead, he saw a helicopter. A rope ladder was lowered and he saw a shapely pair of legs desend. Rock would recognize those legs anywhere: he pried them open once before.l &quot;Hello, Rock,&quot; Domino said, now joining him at the summit. &quot;Too bad Peter was here first.&quot; Rock did not reply. &quot;If it means anything to you, Peter didn't climb Everst; he took a helicpoter. Rock smiled. He knew Cheating was no mountain climber. Cheating and his ilk would never be more than mere social climbers. &quot;But the credit will go to Peter,&quot; Domino said. Rock said not a word. What did her care for the recognition of fools and humanitarians? &quot;Anyway, Howard, I just wanted to let you know that I'm filing rape charges against you. I might have enjoyed it, but it was still rape.&quot; Rock said not a word. There was only one person who could have put such dangerous ideas in Domino's head, and it wasn't Susan Brownemiller. &quot;Fooey will represent me,&quot; Domino said. Of course, Hellsworth Fooey! Fooey, a humanitarian plotting to destroy the world through la ethal injection charity. Fooey would start with a soup kitchen and wouldn't stop until he had housed all the world's poor. &quot;You'll spend a few years in jail,&quot; Domino was saying. &quot;You can use the time to study and get a real job.&quot; Yes, that's exactly what he would do. Cheating had beaten him to the top of the highest mountain, but he - Rock - would build and scale the world's highest building. Chapter 2 Five years later, Rock's plans were complete. There was a knock on the door. Rock knew it was Domino. &quot;Hello, Howard,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm sorry I didn't visit, but the slammer is such a depressing place. Are these your plans? Why, I'm flattered, it looks just like a domino.&quot; &quot;It will be the world's tallest building,&quot; Rock said. At thirty thousand feet, it will be taller than any mountain. I'll be the first to climb it.&quot; &quot;But Peter will beat you; hel'll take the elevator.&quot; &quot;There will be no elevators.&quot; &quot;Then he'll take the stairs.&quot; &quot;There will be no stairs.&quot; Domino was struck with awe. She was in the presence of no mere ordinary date rapist; Rock was a man who could stick it to the world. &quot;But, Howard, don't you think it will be hard to get financial backing for a building without elevators and stairs?&quot; &quot;Fooey has arranged everything,&quot; Rock said. Chapter 3 Howard Rock looked skyward. His building, Mount Neverest, was complete. He, Rock, had refused to pander to softed-hearted philanthropists and hard-headed corporatists alike. Only true mountain climbers would scale his building. Let social climbers like Peter Cheating design buidling with stairs and elevators. Why word had it that Cheating had included wheel chair ramps in his last building! &quot;So, Howard, we've finally done it,&quot; Fooey said. &quot;Where is your climbing gear.?&quot; Rock looked at his feet. Fooey understood: Rock would pull himself by his own bootstraps. Chapter 4 Rock toiled for forty days and forty nights. Why mounting Domono hadn't caused him half so much trouble! Finally, he pulled himself to the top. And there, fluttering in the wind, as though laughing at him, was the flag of Peter Cheating. But how!? &quot;What's the matter, Howard?&quot; Rock turned. It was Hellsworth Fooey. &quot;I took the elevator,&quot; Fooey explained. He smiled and added, &quot;I'd like you to meet some of my friends. Fooey opened the door and a procession of wheel chair bound invalids rolled out onto the roof. Hellsworth was in his glory. &quot;Express elevators, local elevators, escalators, emergency stairwells. All the creature comforts a degenerate public and a unionized work force could ask for. Rock said not a word. He knew what he had to do. Chapter 5 &quot;The People rests,&quot; Fooey said. He had presented an ironclad case. Howard Rock had, with malice and forethought, firebombed Mount Neverest, killing three hundred children in the day care center. Rock did not deny the charges. &quot;If you wish to apply the letter of the law, I am guilty,&quot; he said. &quot;But I appeal to a higher authority. Mount Neverest was an affront to artistic integrity. Elevators and stairs and worst of all, priority parking for the handicapped!&quot; Rock continued on for another three hundred pages, after which he said not a word. Chapter 6 Has the jury reached a verdict?&quot; the judge asked. &quot;We have your honor. We find the author, Ayn Rand, guilty of wooden language, cardboard characters and contrived plotting. Worse, we find her guilty of foisting her infantile philosophy upon us. Any Rand said not a word, but fourteen years later replied with fifteen hundred pages of nonsense."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead, like any of Rand's works, fails on both the literary level and the philopsophical level. Sure, it is marginally less painful reading than the later Atlas Shrugged, mostly since it is more concise (no 50+ page speeches) and slightly better-developed in terms of storyline. Still, this is ANYTHING but exemplary reading to anyone with more than marginal gray matter between their ears. In fact, if you're over the age of 18 and not a self-absorbed Randian objectivist, I almost guarantee that you will despise this book.As a novel, it's awful. In any Rand book, characters can be divided into one of two broad catagories: Nietzschean \\"heroes\\" and narcissistic \\"men of vision\\" who subscribe wholecloth to Rand's half-assed excuse of a philosophy; or pathetic, sniveling \\"villians\\" (men of religion, believers in charity and goodwill, sane people, anyone who doesn't believe 100% in \\"rugged individualism\\" and the baggage that it implies). I've seen deeper characterization in an episode of Pokemon. No one is likeable, and most of the time there's nothing a reader can even remotely relate to in any of these characters. The writing and prose are amateurish and longwinded; watching the English language abused in the service of Rand's ad hominems and straw men was like taking a staple to the forehead for every page I read. Pure agony. The speeches could make one choke, or laugh hysterically with how overblown and unrealistic they are. I don't care if Rand wasn't a native English speaker--this inexcusable dialogue is more wooden than Keanu Reeves.As philosophy, it's even more horrendous, not to mention impractical and downright dangerous. The basic tenet of objectivism, when boiled down to its essence, is self-serving greed above all else. Howard Roark, the \\"hero\\" that Rand wishes her readers to idolize is a coldly intellectual, mysognistic sociopath and rapist with a superiority complex the size of Greenland. If THIS is the model objectivist, I can only conclude that Rand's philosophy is truly anti-human.Yes, self-interest to a certain extent is necessary and good, and it is noble to strive for excellence. But this sort of extreme ruthless greed (\\"every genius for himself\\") justifies Social Darwinism, fascism, lawlessness, exploitation, genocide and every other kind of social ill in the name of \\"utopia.\\" It's the stuff of Hitler's dreams. And there's no economic basis for Rand's philosophy either--capitalism succeeds in part due to a willingness to exchange ideas and goods. Rand's works betray a caricaturish concept of modern capitalism, where sheer avarice wins above all. Needless to say, this doesn't hold up in the real world (think Enron).In short, The Fountainhead is the nadir. Go read something of redeeming value to scratch that philosophical itch: Hobbes, Locke, Machiavelli, Nietzsche. All true philosophers who had their unique ideas swiped and distorted to feed Rand's foolish ramblings."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"How does protagonist Howard Roark - a man who, according to Ayn Rand's JOURNALS, was 'born without the ability to consider other people' (i.e. a congenital sociopath) - nevertheless manage to design houses and other buildings which (also according to Rand) are so well adapted to the needs of their occupants that said occupants can't imagine ever living or working anywhere else?Simple: it's fiction. This novel takes place in Randworld, where congenital sociopathy is a virtue and the best way to fulfill other people's needs is to give them no consideration whatsoever.This grand doorstop of a novel might deserve a second star for sheer heaving-shoulders melodrama if it hadn't driven so many fat, pimply, nerdy teenage boys into the field of architecture, where they thought they could lord it over their clients and finally get the girls who wouldn't give them the time of day in high school. Any architectural school or firm will tell you that the LAST thing they want is an architect who became an architect because of THE FOUNTAINHEAD.Of course the book isn't *literally* about architecture, as such 'concrete-bound' mentalities may have thought; it's *actually* about being a self-absorbed putz in ANY CREATIVE ENDEAVOUR AT ALL. (Self-absorbed putzes, you see, are the 'fountainhead' of human progress in ALL fields.)Nevertheless this consideration does not suffice to induce me to award two stars to Rand's delusional projections. I doubt the practitioners of those other fields are thanking her either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading this book, I am struck by the similarities between Hillary Clinton and Ellsworth Toohey.

In this novel, Miss Rand shows that there are two basic alternatives in life, i.e, in choosing how to make one's soul: individualism or collectivism.Roark, the intransigent architect, is the concretization of individualism. Despite countless obstacles, temptations, and misfortunes, Roark never compromises his virtues. He is a man of principle in the strictest meaning of the word. He is an ideal man and a hero in a world devoid of both.Almost every other character, in varying degree, has embodied the soul of the collectivist, commonly referred to throughout the novel as the &quot;parasite&quot; and the &quot;second-hander.&quot; This is done justifiably, and it is convincingly shown why.After the reader finishes this masterpiece, try Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Those puzzled, unimpressed, unmoved, undecided--reread.

First, If building on the discoveries and long held architectural (or philisophical) standards of thousands of previous geniuses is the greatest sacrilege and betrayal of one's own ability to create, then why are many of Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings prematurely decrepid and very high maintenence?Secondly, If somehow one were to reach the pinnacle of objectivist perfection, would all normal bodily functions like eating, and using the bathroom somehow become so unimportant that they would cease? Man cannot live on thought alone. The intensity of the book left no room for the characters to be identifiable. Howard Roark seemed to have been able to build buildings in his sleep!Also, I would ask Ms. Rand how a brutal and violent action like rape could innitiate a timeless, passionate, and fufilling love affair such as the one Howard and Dominique shared?

Often, good books require the reader to take the time to understand and absorb the meanings. The beauty of it is that you learn more as you mature in life. I have personally changed my views in reading the works of Ayn Rand over time. If human nature was easy to change, then books like &quot;10 things to improve your self-esteem&quot; need only be 10 lines long. But humans as humans tend to stay fixed within their comfort-zones, and believe me, there is so much more that you can get from reading this book!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's a long work, over 600 pages. You won't be able to put it down once you start, so be forewarned.

All he cares about is what makes him happy instead of what makes me happy.I suspect that is why others rail against the book soooo much: Roark does not bow to them and they hate it.

As a Rommance, the fountainhead is way better than Attlas Shrugged. The characters are much better constructed, the story is more interesting and plausible. I'm not saying that I don't like Attlas Shrugged: Actually its a great book too, but in a philosophical sense. Attlas Shrugged exposes Rand's Philosophy in a complete way, and maybe because of that, as a rommance, attlas shrugged is not so good as Fountainhead. Howard Roark is one of the most fantastic characters ever created, as well as Peter Keating, Gail Winnand(perhaps the most intriguing of all, a character which Victor Hugo would have liked)and Ellsworth Toohey. The psicological side of the protagonists are fantastic, and so is the story itself. For my personal taste, the best Rommance ever written is &quot;Le miserables&quot;, by Victor Hugo. The Fountainhead is not very far from this. A great Book!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Readers have labeled this book sublime, putrid, fascist, satanic, and excellent. I will not choose not to choose, for I have judged, and it is a complex judgment, indeed.The book qua book is substandard. Certainly, the story enthralled me, and I managed to read the hefty tome (builds stronger bones and muscles) in about two weeks. Let us face it, however: the book is no The Sound and the Fury, but then again, that is the comparision of a mere ubermensch to a god.I'm a fan of the ubermensch theory. I'm an elitist, a fascist, an anarch, a mystic, fully esoteric and completely iron fisted (That sounds like poetry). I have no qualms with Ayn Rand's philosophy as advocated by The Fountainhead, although I have found that the Any Rand Society has thouroughly sodomized the already bastardized when codified theory of Objectivism. The book's themes are palatable, even pleasurable: the individual, the artist, absolute narcissism, the ugliness of most architecture (one must look out for my wit, it's very sardonic), and so on.I find the presentation lacking, however. I have stated my enjoyment in the existence, and triumph, of Roark, although so heavy handed is The Fountainhead that the reader may discover slap-marks upon his face. Eventually, though, one becomes accustomed. I would suspect (for I am not sure) that a great author would not need such heavyhandedness to deliver a message. The tome itself is more didactic than anything Victorian, although the tale merely presents the self-made man who lives in the mountains, probably in the cave next door to certain prophet to whom Rand's philosophy owes much.I will also admit that I am a postmodernist; pseudo-Realist fiction does not appeal to me. I am the avant garde, hear my preformance art roar. Seriously, though, Rand's style is just, well, substandard. It lacks the innovation of Joyce and Paton, or the pregamesmanship and gamesmanship, respectively, of The Turn of the Screw and The Dictionary of the Khazars, although, I must state, that the story is well-crafted, and perhaps almost better (gasp!) than the first Realist novel ever, Madame Bovary; something, however, seems immature about the whole thing.And this may stem from the target audience being the high school crowd (interesting that the term crowd is chosen, and interesting that Rand wrote for a crowd, as this seems contradictory to the nature of her philosophy). The rebellion inherent to this story may be the attraction, and perhaps the moths merely find the flame, not the flame the moths (i'm hideously esoteric; i enjoy the arcane). I recant.As for the Church of Satan thing....The Church of Satan is a very commercial (more so than Objectivism in its Capitalist manifestation), very contradictory, but most imporatantly, confusedly Atheistic church. If you want to understand, read Le Vey's piece of sh*t titled The Satanic Bible. They don't worship anything, that's why they have rituals that invoke Cthulhu and Company. Le Vey claims that he choose the inverted pentagram and the name &quot;Satan&quot; only to aggravate the bourgeious and the Christian (often, the former only pretends to be the latter).Synopsis: I like the philosophy presented by the book, although Nietzsche is better; an excellent plot, but rather didactic narrative (fortunately, never does one encounter the abhorred &quot;dear readers&quot;); Ultimately, a decent, above the mean, rating.To sum up: One of the best philosophies to occur in the twentieth century, and one of the finest books of the nineteenth."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I loved and adored _Atlas Shrugged_. I didn't expect _The Fountainhead_ to be as wonderful. It was even better. The characters in this book are more real and accessible than those in Atlas.

I am studying Objectivism.

Her reach in the field of politics counts Alan Greenspan as one her apostles. She's probably better known for \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" a massive novel written in the 1950's. Before \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" came \\"The Fountainhead,\\" written in the 1940's. Rand was a screenwriter and a playwright as well. Ayn Rand died in 1982.This edition of the book is divided into three parts: an introduction with some explanatory notes written by Rand in the 1960's, the actual novel, and an afterword by Rand acolyte Leonard Peikoff, who is also Rand's legal executor.On the surface, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a deceptively simple tale about an architect struggling to make buildings on his own terms. There is much more here than this, however.Rand uses the novelistic style as a vehicle for her personal philosophy. This philosophy, known now as Objectivism, places man squarely at the center of the universe. It is man who creates, but only certain men. The man who creates is an egotist, a man who creates solely for his own sake and for the sake of the work, without any influence from others. He does not share his work or collaborate. The rest of humanity is \\"second-handers,\\" or parasites that feed off the misery of others. They do not create, but merely take from those who do to give to those who don't. These second-handers are usually found promoting a socialistic, or collective, society.In \\"The Fountainhead,\\" it is Howard Roark who is the creator. Roark is a genius that is guided by an inner force to build. His whole life is dedicated to creating monuments to man's greatness. While others resort to imitation, Roark creates and expresses new ideas. He refuses to change his plans to please others. He only respects others who share his worldview.Arrayed against Roark is Peter Keating, a fawning, inept architect who turns to Roark to bail him out of tough spots when he needs help, only to turn against Roark at the first opportunity. Keating accepts awards and positions he doesn't deserve, is vain beyond belief, and is also a momma's boy (Peter wants to become a painter, but his mother talks him into becoming an architect). He does what he thinks others want him to do. He is not his own man, but a man of the collective mentality.Ellsworth Toohey is the archenemy of the novel. Toohey is a pseudo-intellectual who works behind the scenes to create a \\"brotherhood of man\\" society. Toohey creates councils to debase literature, architecture, and theater. He writes a column in a newspaper and magazine promoting socialist values. His goal is the domination of the world with himself as a sort of \\"first citizen.\\"These are not the only main characters of the book, but they are the most important ones. There is Dominique Francon, a woman who shares Roark's outlook on life. She is so loyal to Roark that she works against him because she knows that if Roark succeeds, he'll be destroyed by society. Gail Wynand, a newspaper publisher with Roark's worldview, also emerges later in the novel. He too shares Roark's ideas, with an important exception revealed at the end of the story.For the most part, I liked the book. Rand systematizes some beliefs I've held for awhile, especially on socialism and communism. She's dead wrong about second-handers not creating anything, however. These people have made much progress in the fields of political murder, torture, and penal institutions. Just look at the Soviet gulag system!Her use of the novel format to express her ideas is good, and you can certainly tell Rand was a screenwriter. She creates believable social settings and atmosphere. My problems here are with the Dominique character; I just didn't like her. All too often, Dominique's presence led to over long dialogue and annoying situations. Be sure to pay attention to the first encounter between Roark and Dominique. It's an unusual take on sexual relations that I don't agree with.I'll probably read \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" at some point, although I would rather read one of Rand's purely philosophical books. I'd like to see Objectivism fleshed out a little bit more than is done in this book. I do recommend reading this book because Rand is considered an important figure, and you should have an opinion about her work and her philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"So, I'm your typical leftist student, three years into university with some vague philisophical ideas and a love of literature. One thing that I thought I knew was that I hated Ayn Rand (who I'd never read). So it goes.This opinion was not totally unfounded. She is often cited as the philosophical inspiration of such reactionary political figures as Reagan, W. Bush and Thatcher (amongst others). People whos Randian beliefs in \\"freedom\\", free markets and \\"small government\\" led them to dismantle state institutions (all around the world) that help the poor, the down and out.I still don't believe in those people or those policies, but this book changed my life. (I sound like a commercial for the Bible, but honestly this book had an incredible impact on my thinking). Throughout the book, Rand extends a metaphor equating the creation of architecture with the creation of the self (emphasizing strength, coherence, simplicity and stability) which I found insanely compelling. Her ideas on pressure and tension; production and value; freedom, charity and self-reliance are all worthy of study and reflection. They have influenced me and my values immensely.In her works, I found many of the aspects of Rousseau's Emile and Social Contract, of Marxist thought on materialism, of Nietzsche's individualist thought which had appealed to me for so long.As for the book itself (and its relation to the philosophy), Rand's writing style is only fair. Her plot and structure are simple, rational and coherent, reflecting her philosophy. Her characters are poor. While Roarke is a truly admirable hero, he would have been far more compelling as a tragic hero. His unrealistic success seeks to redeem (unnecessarily) her philosophy. Thus, in Rand's work (unlike life), the weak and (therefore) villainous are always punished by themselves and society; the strong and rational succeed and maintain their dignity. To this end, the other \\"bad\\" characters (Keating, Toohey, etc.) are unreasonably presented as completely self-aware of their flaws, and thus seem almost inhuman to the reader - a device employed to distance the reader's sympathy from other philosophies. For example, Toohey is consciously Rand's idea of the Communist Ideal: turning society into one large person, in order to control it. This simplistic stylization makes Toohey inhuman; and his defeat seems both just and symbolic of Communism's necessary defeat. Rand's philosophy, while compelling, is unrealistically presented in the plot and characters of The Fountainhead.However, overall, my point is this: do not dismiss Rand out of hand. Especially not based on ideology. Although she is quite biased in her writing, her work is clearly powerful, it is not merely the empty rhetoric employed by many who follow her philosophy. It deserves consideration."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you like James Bond movies, then you'll love The Fountainhead. Howard Roark can do everything. He is ALWAYS the best architect in the world. He ALWAYS has the highest taste in all matters of art. But he can do more than that. He rose from destitution. He is a master builder. He is unbelievably strong, he can seduce the most beautiful of women, he can charm tyrants, and he can give rousing speeches to get himself acquitted of a violent crime he already confessed to. He is always absolutely in the right, and has no flaw.Of course, those damn 'second-handers' can't appreciate him. They're all just sycophantic morons though. Except for the dastardly liberals, always scheming on how to fool the masses into appreciating their own terrible art and destroy what's good in the world once and for all. That's one reason why no great artists have ever been liberals, or collaborated with each other.Unlike Rand, I live in the real world, where artistic taste does have some degree of subjectivity to it, and it's not ok to rape a woman just because she really wanted it.I don't know about you, but I consider any world view that decides that everyone who doesn't agree with you is either a moron or a caricature of evil bent on world domination to be a pretty adolescent one. And considering the attempts to pass off long philosophical soliloquies as dialog, and the obvious political agendas of this book, it's hard not to judge it on it's world view. We can't laud it for the depth of its characters. Rand's notes laid out the themes of her character, and she'll be damned if any of them move an inch away from those and, god forbid, develop a little. It does deserve credit for crisp, engaging storytelling.If you don't mind narrow-minded stories with predictable characters and a predictable ending, and don't mind trudging through a philosophy allegedly based on rationalism but with more issues than Dominique Francon, then The Fountainhead is a fun read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is about Howard Roark and his struggles as an architect. Roark combats a successful rival architect, Peter Keating, and a newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. In the Fountainhead Rand addresses several issues: individual strength, good versus evil, and the threat of fascism. The combination of the underlying themes and Rand's amazing writing makes the book entertaining and influential.After being amazed by Ayn Rand's writing and storytelling from Atlas Shrugged I looked for more books from Rand. My search brought me to The Fountainhead. I was once again carried away by a brilliant story. I look forward to reading more from Ayn Rand. I highly recommend Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand takes every aspect of the human experience and personifies it in Howard Roard, Ellsworth Toohey, and the various other characters in her work. while I am not individualist and only read this work to see why Rand was such a famous author, the philosophical issues brought up require thorough examination adn thought - THIS IS NOT A FLUFF BOOK. You cannot read this book once and put it down, satisfied and ready to move on to other fiction. While some readers complain about the lack of &quot;romace&quot; in the relationship between Dominique and Roark, you must realize that the relationship is less about romance than about expanding the horizons of experience. Some of the reviewers here have decided that the innate violence of the interpersonal relationships is unnecessary, but it is a stark reminder by a woman who had first-hand experience in the Soviet system that humans are inherently dangerous animals. If you keep in mind that the book si not so much a story in and of itself as it is a commentary on teh human condition and teh different levels of self-actualization, I think you will find that this book is well worth the concentration and time invested. If you liked this one, and want a bigger taste of the dangers of communist idealism, try Atlas Shrugged, also by Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Being a young man (17) I think I have the bennifet of taking a more naive view of this book. It is, to put it simply, the best book Ive ever read, and I have a wide range of classic literature on my shelf. Many single &quot;star&quot;, critical reviews of this book seem to dwell on Rand's philosophy, not the book itself. I dont understand why I have had to read peoples rants about her personal life or Objectivism. That is not the point. I'll admit her philosopy and personal beliefs are being sold within the books covers, (quite well, might I add, even thought I disagree with them) but once you can get past that you will realize what a great piece of fiction this is. Another complaint is how unbelieveable the story and its characters are. Rand over does it this way to emphasise her Objectivism beliefs. Sort of like a characature, substatuting the person for an ideal. It's a bit over done at times, but, in my opinion, never really got in the way of the story. The length was yet another issue. I found it perfect. 600 would have been too short and 800 a little too long. I was actually a little sad when I finished. I had become so accoustomed to Roarks character it was like losing a friend when I was done. This proves Rand as a writer as far as Im concerned. Her characters, although sometimes utterly unlikable, are always interresting. She creates an entire world, then draws you in completely. I enjoyed the book immensly and could care less about her political ideas or her personal life. She gave me this amazing book that, for the duration I was reading it, made me smile, sneer, cringe, gag and feel passionatly about something. And isn't that what reading is supposed to be all about: Enjoyment?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Since every positive aspect of this book has been written about by the hundreds of others who reviewed it, my review will be in response to its critics. The one &quot;flaw&quot; that I read in the review over and over again was that &quot;it wouldn't work in real life.&quot; This is true, to a point. If one is to accept that the world is how it is generally perceived, and to live one's life in accordance with this perception, then yes, I suppose the book is flawed. But, the point of the book, which I believe its critics miss, is that the world is how you make it. If you choose to believe that Objectivism is fatally flawed and can never work, then Objectivism is fatally flawed and can never work. But, if one is to live one's life completely within the bounds of the philosophy, you would be surprised at how often it does indeed work. So, bottomline: read the book, take its lessons to your heart, live your life by them, and you will succeed in what you are going for. But, if you carry the defeatist attitude that it is impossible to do so, guess what, it will be."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is more than just a story, it goes beyond fiction. The story is rich in symbolism, and anyone who enjoys intellectual stimulation will get more out of this book than any review will tell. Rand gives quite the eye-opening account of humanity. A must read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I saw the movie years ago -- and was I floored. Man, what a movie.I ran to mom and told her the greatest old movie I just saw about an architect and his troubles and how he overcomes it all and becomes the greatest of all time. She said, \\"you think the movie is good, read the book.\\"Fast forward 30 years. I run to the store and pick up a copy. I sat down hoping to get past the first chapter. Before I got up, I was on page 150. The print was horrible, the size of the pica petite, and yet my old eyes could not get away from the richly textured and tremendously clever and seemingly contrarian dialogue.She is a master. The story is great (except the acceptance of an apparent date rape in the middle which by today's standards would not be forgiven). I rave about this book.Now, mother tells me to read ATLAS SHRUGGED. I will. But, this time I am going to the library and getting the hardback with better print."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is absolutely stunning. After being forced to read pointless novels for English classes, this is like a breath of fresh air. Ayn Rand's philosophy is definitely singular; I don't care what the previous reviewers say who think they are superior to every differing mind set there is - they ought to try to come up with such a bold view of life and man. Honestly! Be a little openminded. I don't fully agree with Rand's philosophy, but I have absorbed some of the ideas and thought about them. You see, I'm only 16 years old and I'm struggling to develop my own philosophy and opinion of mankind. No, it won't be anything like that of Ayn Rand; but her concepts have broadened my mind. It took me longer than normal to read &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; because after every chapter or two, I had to pause and reflect and consider the things which had been stated. There are at least five interesting ideas, concepts, even just a nice quote to underline, on every two pages. I find myself unconsciously using Dominique or Roark as a role model for myself; yes, this may seem silly to you, but every character in the book is extremely influential in his or her own way. Whether the influence is good or bad is really up to the reader. That's what I like so much about this book. Ayn Rand has no partialities, she isn't biased in regards to her characters. She presents them to the reader all in the same way, and lets you decide whether Peter Keating is successful or a mere fake; whether Roark is sincere, whether he's as strongminded as he thinks he is, or if he will eventually break down and submit to the conventional methods; whether Dominique has any typical feelings or is just a machine turned on by her contempt of Howard Roark; whose side Toohey is really on; if Catherine Halsey is submissive or defiant; and so on and so on. These are the things I thought about; you think about them too, and make your own decisions about the characters and the philosophy hiding under this rather strange plot. (How many authors use the profession of architecture as the main theme and passion of the book?) But don't judge the book and the concepts it offers unless you have your own definitive philosophy which you know could persuade and convince every person in this diverse little world."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is just as fresh and inspiring as the first time I read it when it was first puglished.

In as much as Altruism is condemned throughout, some of the main characters exhibit altruistic flaws (charitable inclinations etc.) in a sincere beneficent manner."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Follow your true want and work for that of yours, not of others.

Will definitely reread it in a couple of years again!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Extraordinary Talent, Unique and Powerful Creative WritingThe book being reviewed is entitled, \\"The Fountainhead\\", and its author is Ayn Rand. You could say that I am late to the party in finally reading this book. The author was born in 1905 and died in 1982, which shows that she was from my parent's generation. Moreover, the book was written in 1943 and so it has taken me a long time to get to it. I could use the excuse that I was only six years old when this book was first published, yet I have had decades to read it before now. Her other very popular book, \\" Atlas Shrugged\\", was one that I read in my early 20s and it had a memorable effect on me. It made me think about rugged individualism and a gifted elite, who make the major contributions to society.As I write this review, the nation's attention is focused on the presidential contest between incumbent president Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney. However, it is their running mates that finally tipped me over in favor of buying the book. Joe Biden is the current vice president. And not too long ago, Congressman Paul Ryan was selected to be the Republican vice presidential candidate. One of the stories told about him, is that Paul Ryan was so strongly influenced by Ayn Rand's elitist philosophy that he bought copies of her books, distributed them to his staff, and made them compulsory reading. When I learned this about Congressman Ryan, my curiosity was so piqued, that I took the plunge and bought the Fountainhead and began reading it. Many regard her philosophy as simplistic and extreme. I approached the book expecting to be somewhat disappointed. Within a few pages, she had won me over not to her philosophy, but to her masterful command of creative writing. I commented to those around me, \\"Wow! This author can really write.\\"The Fountainhead is a very long book and has a very complex composition to it. If you have not read it and would like to read it, do not let the great length of the book deter you. Rand has a writing style unique only to her. She can write beautiful descriptive prose when she has a mind to, but she can also write in a suspenseful style that makes you continue turning the pages. She has created both noble and despicable characters to play in her novel. The story of the novel will keep you spellbound on its own, but it is obvious that she is the grand puppeteer pulling the strings of these characters in an effort to persuade you to her moralistic points of view.Howard Roark is the hero of this novel and his integrity is the ideal that Rand wants the reader to value. Howard is an architect, who is unwilling to compromise his creative genius in order to survive in a world that no longer values great talent. Peter Keating is also an architect, but he embodies the opposite traits that Roark lives by. Keating has no originality, no creativity, and will do anything to win approval from the people around him. Dominique is the daughter of a famous architect and Rand has created her to be the ideal mate for Howard, but throws many frustrations in their path before they finally they can openly be with one another on the terms they both believe in. Ellsworth Toohey is a character that Rand created to epitomize that which she hates in society. He is a grand manipulator of people and he does not have their better interests in mind when he manipulates them. There are many other characters in the novel and each of them has been designed to help sell you on Rand's moralistic philosophy. As the author weaves her plot, these characters often behave very differently from the people that most of us have known. Because of this, the plot is unpredictable and that is a good thing because you just never know what is going to happen next.In my opinion, the Fountainhead is a great achievement in the world of creative writing. As you read the book, you realize that the author is in control and you the reader are being swept along wherever she wants to take you. It is amazing that such a complex plot could be conceived and so skillfully developed as a novel. On the other hand, Rand's morality is either black or white and there is no gray zone allowed by her. We all know that life is not like that and at times we feel like we are being pulled in many directions, by our employer, by our spouse, by our children, by our friends, and by what we personally would like to be doing with our time. Most of us do the best that we can and compromise is necessary to fulfill our obligations and goals. Being reasonable is not an admirable quality in Ayn Rand's world. If we look into the author's personal life, and consider that Russian communism and Nazi socialism were two growing malignant ideas in her time, her extremism is better understood. Her father's business in Russia was confiscated by the Communists. Capitalism remained the only fertile ground for her heroes.I would be remiss if I did not mention Ayn Rand's atheism and its influence in her novels. Although she does not specifically criticize religions, it is obvious that she has low regard for charity and self sacrifice, which are mainstays of Christianity. It is obvious in her writing that she has disdain for such concepts. Moreover, her favorite characters in her novels freely have sexual unions with no shame or embarrassment. Her heroes are entitled to do whatever they wish to do because they are the geniuses upon which society always advances.The Fountainhead is a very special book. It is rich in the questions and values that are important to us all. It would be an ideal book for a literature class to discuss. It is an intellectual book and should be required reading for people living in a world of ideas. It is a model for budding novelists to study because it has been done so skillfully and artistically. If this is the kind of book that attracts you, I highly recommend the Fountainhead to you.Ralph Hermansen, September 28, 2012"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Anthem, the fountainhead, and atlas shrugged are 3 great stories for the shelf.

It attacked religion, democracy, and so many of the pillars of our modern society. It had no respect whatsoever for the common man. It glorified those who had complete diregard for the values, thoughts, and feelings of others, while villifying those who were dedicated to creating a Christian sense of brotherhood among men and working to build a kinder, more humble society. Numerous people, including politicians, clergymen, and humanitarians, have rightfully denounced The Fountainhead for its glorification of selfishness, and it's arrogant diregard for societal norms.Needless to say, I loved The Fountainhead. It's one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Like all the rest of Rand's fiction, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; clonks along like a 1956 Chevy pickup with flat tires on a dirt road. It exhibits as much literary grace as a hippopotamus on waterskis, splashing didactic Objectivism in its wake and nearly drowning laughing observers in waves of pedantry.I first read this book at age 15 and at the time it certainly seemed brave and inspiring. I read it again at age 25 and was far less impressed, and the last time I tried to read it I couldn't finish it. The plotline is painfully simple. The dialogue has no trace of authenticity, or any of the rhythm of normal human speech. The characters are cardboard cutouts with little or no subtlety. The less said about the agonizing length of the book, the better. Nothing happens but talk for enormously long stretches, and then when something does happen, it seems anticlimactic, because the characters have already signaled what is going to happen. And afterwards they analyze each event in excruciating detail, never forgetting to put a nice Randian Objectivist spin on everything.Rand could have taken a lesson from Robert Heinlein. Heinlein was another objectionable, obnoxious person with a semipolitical/philosophical axe to grind, but Heinlein knew that you couldn't talk your reader to death. So he had the good grace to put in the occasional explosion, alien invasion, or sex scene in between his philosophical rants. He also had a sense of humor, which Ayn Rand's books completely and absolutely lack.This is primarily a very dull book. It appeals to misunderstood adolescents because it addresses their concerns: being misunderstood, wanting freedom, wanting to be the big hero who triumphs over all through sheer force of will, etc., etc.But those who have left adolescence behind, who are not as self-absorbed or as self-righteous as Rand and her characters are, will not find much to like in this book. The positive reviewers in the &quot;Synopsis&quot; section above harp on how much Rand's novels have sold, but if large sales guarantee high quality, then V.C. Andrews must be the new Shakespeare.I advise anyone with good sense to give this book a pass. There are thousands of other good books you could read, including the New York City Telephone Directory, before you try to tackle this unreadable, lumpy mess."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is a controversial author. She is a polarizing author; readers tend to love her or hate her. However, if you could undo the prejudices of her reputation and just read her work you would find that many of the naysayers would become fans. I had the opportunity to read The Fountainhead without knowing much about Rand and her politics. I fell in love with the ideas presented in the novel: creativity, individualism, and a rejection of the status quo. Having since read into her philosophy (objectivism) I could not read Atlas Shrugged with same eyes. Whether the trouble lies with the novel itself or my foreknowledge of an agenda, I did not enjoy Atlas Shrugged as much as The Fountainhead.Back to the book...The Fountainhead is a stunning novel that explores the nature of individuality through the unforgettable character of Howard Roark. Roark is an architect who desires to build something unlike what anyone else has. Though it costs him greatly he refuses to abide by tradition.The magnitude of this book is incredible. Though it was written over 60 years ago, it's just as vivid and relevant today. Ayn Rand created a genius tale full of intriguing characters, masterful plots, and ideas that really make one think. This is one of those rare books that haunts you and begs to be re-read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After having it suggested to me many times, I finally had a chance to read The Fountainhead. I was skeptical at first, and as far as Rand's philosophy, I still am kind of wonder, but the book was great. I couldn't put it down. I certainly don't feel that Objectivism and selfishness are the answer to the world's problems. Even still, I think Rand presents an interesting problem. How many people in this world are like Peter Keating! Doing what everybody else wants you to do, gaining success and social &quot;standing,&quot; and yet still unhappy. Although Roark could use some people skills, atleast he does what makes him happy. (Although we should avoid extreme measures like Roark's behavior towards the end of the book.) I think anyone who has tried to present a new idea to old bureaucrats, will understand the problems Roark ran into when trying to present new architecture. Sadly, most will give in to the set &quot;ideal&quot; that society has determined. I respect men and women who responsibly stick to their own ideals. (Note the word responsible, Roark wasn't always.) All-in-all a great book I think everyone should have a chance to read. Remember, Rand wrote these books to express her Philosophy. So don't be surprised like many are that there is a lot of philosophy in this book. Also, some may say that this philosophy is simple to understand and straightforward, so it isn't worth reading. I disagree. Unlike Kant, Hegel and countless other philosophers, Rand has had some writing training, which makes her philosophy a little eaiser to understand. Also, take some time to read Kant, Mill, Aristotle, Plato, James, Sarte, etc. before you decide Rand's philosophy is the answer."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It started out with great promise. The characters were very simplistic and the writing style was easy to pick up. After a long dry spell of not reading I was surprised at my own enthusiasm to read this book, and I found myself in Part II of the book in no time. Then everything went downhill.The story focused entirely on a woman named Dominique, who had thus far just been a secondary character. Her interest with the main protagonist was painful to read, and I felt like somehow I had picked up a tawdy romance novel, but I endured because I had suspected these two characters, by the respective non-conforming natures, would get together. At some point I just gave in and started to giggle at their impending romance, even if it was taking the oft-traveled \\"I hate him so much I must love him!\\" road.Then he raped her. Our main protagonist. The uncompromising underdog who you want to root for, who you know in the end is the guy who will end up on the top vindicated. Some people don't want to view this certain part of the text as rape because the author tries to explain it away in good old boy fashion that despite the violence \\"they had been united in an\\" unspoken \\"understanding... beyond the deliberated obscenity of his action\\". Isn't that the same old fictional line we've been fed over and over about rape? That even though the woman fought (and she did, left with bruises) the fact that she never explicitly said no means that she wanted it and enjoyed it? That she was glad of the fact that someone came along and took the option to abstain or indulge out of her hands and just \\"defiled\\" her because if the decision was left up to her she would never of had the great \\"sex\\" that she secretly wanted.I stopped reading the book at this point. I can't read a book where the main protagonist rapes and it's not seen as a great character flaw but seen as him asserting his rightful control over the world and whoever gets in his way. I wanted to enjoy this book, I did at first, and I wanted to educate myself about this woman's philosophy but if violence against women is part of that philosophy then she can just stuff it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ok this is a great book. Also a hilarious one. Ayn Rand manages to dump more personal baggage into this \\"novel of ideas\\" than a trailer dweller on Jerry Springer.Basic theme:Howard Roark is better than everyone. Damn it. ( subtext: Ayn Rand is better than everyone. Damn it.) The world just can't handle excellence and will resort to any low, underhanded, dirty tricks to take out its brightest lights like Howard (aka Ayn Rand, or at least the type of man she'd associate with). Why? Because the snivelling, disgusting mass that makes up humanity is jealous, that's right jealous, you're all jealous and Ayn Rand hates you!Luckily men of excellence all recognize and understand each other. No matter if one is an architect, and another is a newspaperman, they all have some mystical great-man bond allowing them to immediately identify one another and engage in tense melodramatic, backslapping exchanges. At least that's how it works out for Howard Roark, and his crew. They also get to pass around the same hot chick. Her superiority over the masses is never quite explained. She can't build offices, or publish papers, but she's super hot and boy does she know her excellent men.I love this book. Its completely unhuman, and coldly brilliant protagonists make for a quick, entertaining read. The writing is good, and you have to hand it to Rand for getting her point across.Did you know she is the first person to ever suggest that resentment of excellence is an important, but negative component of human experience. Honestly. She came up with that. No philosopher had ever written at legnth about that. It's all hers. She's brilliant. Like Roark. Actually, that's not true at all. But she obviously believed it.* Which makes for a highly entertaining read.*note: I'm not trying to diss Ms. Rand's 'lect.

I fell in love with it as soon as I finished. It is the portrayal of a moral ideal as an end in itself. Rand has placed 'man-worship' above all and has brought out the significance of the heroic in man. Man-worshippers are those who see man's highest potential and strive to actualize it. The Fountainhead has brought out the greatness of man - the capacity, the ability, the integrity and honesty in man - as an ideal to be achieved. It is based on the idea of romanticism which means that, \\"It is concerned not with things as they are but with things as they might be and ought to be.\\"The Fountainhead is the story of an architect, Howard Roark-, whose genius and integrity was as unyielding as granite and of his desperate battle waged against the conventional standards of society. It is a tale of hatred and a story about society and how it's against a man. Ayn Rand's daringly original philosophy of 'objectivism' is the base of The Fountainhead. The motive and purpose of her writing is to bring forward the most challenging ideas that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress. This piece of literature is great for anyone that is stepping into something new and unexplored lifestyle."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead illustrates the struggles of a young man who refuses to accept the mediocre opinions of experts or anyone else. Roark is uncompromising in that if one wishes to deal with him, one shall deal with him on his own terms within his extremely high standards. He refuses to perform less than his best and he refuses to discuss performing mediocre work even if a customer desires mediocre work.He is reduced almost to destitution at one point for refusing to take business from those who wish to dictate his style. Ultimately, he wins - his methodology is slowly accepted as superior as he refuses to give up on giving only his best.Gail Wynand illustrates a man who &quot;could have been.&quot; He panders to the crowd early on in his life, but somtime after meeting Roark he is inspired to be an individualist for a time. Eventually, he gives in to public pressure and lets Roark down.Ellsworth Toohey is the second-hander of ideas. He epitomizes the stupid ivory tower socialist intellectuals. He contributes much to the culture of mediocrity by his speeches and writings.Peter Keating is the man who is successful, but has never had an original idea of his own. He mooches off of history and, pitifully, Roark.Dominique Francon is the most unbelievable character in the novel. I am not sure Rand really knew what do so with such a character. She is surreal and, by any standard, a lunatic. I wish Rand would have given more thought to this character.Roark, however, should inspire anyone who has the will to take on the whole world and win. His dedication and effort are amazing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a good book. However, Ayn Rand goes way in too depth about what she is talking about. This book is really confusing due the fact that what she really wants to talk about, her philosophy of Objectivism, is buried so deep that you have to read it over and over again. On the other hand, she does really develop one good character. Howard Roark is someone who everyone would want to be, someone who realizes what he stands for and will not yield under any pressure. Even when he's in court, or when he is about to be put out of his apartment, Roark will not change his views. As a customer, you will either take what he gives you or he will leave. Even if its one minor detail, Roark will not let you change his work. It puts him apart from everyone else in the book, and he is the reason why this book is as good as it is. Unfortunatly, he is not enough, as Ayn Rand could not really do much with the others around Howard, and the book became slow and boring."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Full of vain characters with exaggerated personalities, used to express the author's vain and exaggerated philosophy. How many times can you use the word shrug or shrugged in a book without breaking a literary law somewhere? And then there is this bromide thing, what's with that?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is the novel that made Ayn Rand famous. It serves as an introduction to Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, and tells a decent story to boot. In an allegorical sense, it tells of the triumph of the individual talent, integrity, and persistence over mediocrity and the evils of collectivism. It is better written than her later work,Atlas Shrugged, but still suffers from Rand's heavy-handed philosophizing.The protagonist, Howard Roark, gets expelled from architectural school and can't find any commissions. He is young, talented, and a social pariah. His expulsion was effectively the result of being too far ahead of the curve. The Dean didn't understand his modern style, and he got the boot. Roark has all the talent he needs and has reached the point where school has nothing left to teach him. He is confident in himself and does not express much in the way of self-doubt.In contrast, we see the character of Peter Keating, a man who managed to reach the top of his class despite having little talent. By Rand's characterization, I wouldn't be surprised if a monkey with an Etch-a-Sketch could design a better building. There's also Gail Wynand, the head of a news company who could have been like Roark had he not sold out, and Ellsworth Toohey, a power-hungry columnist who holds great sway over the architectural community and enjoys elevating mediocrity. There's also Dominique Francon, Roarks love interest. He rapes her, but it's okay because he's the perfect hero and she secretly wanted it. She also has a bizarre fascination with causing Roark as much pain as possible. I did not manage to catch what was so great about her, but Rand tells us that she's the perfect woman.The plot follows Roark's career as he contends with leading architects who are actually mediocre and Toohey's attempts to sabotage him and curtail his genius. It's an interesting story, but gets dragged down by poor characterization and a heavy philosophical bent. Roark is more like a high-schooler's dream than an actual person. He is a bit too confident and lacks the self-doubt that affects everyone else. Not once did his resolve falter. His character arc is virtually non-existent. He has all the talent and architectural knowledge he needs and has seemingly answered life's big questions. In short, his character has no room to grow. All that's left is to land the girl and get the world to appreciate his talent. The trouble with using a man like Roark to showcase her philosophy is that it really doesn't show people how to apply it to their own lives. It's the same problem as overly strict, moralistic religions: they don't realize that it's impossible for people to live up to those values and the result is self-loathing on the part of its adherents.As for Rand's philosophy, she is very much pro-individual. Human achievement is to be valued, with selfishness and egotism numbered as virtues. The focus is on positive accomplishment. Rand likes people who reach the top through hard work and talent, not by undermining the opposition. She considers collectivism and altruism evil. Indeed, anything that questions whether the individual is the greatest thing in the universe is not good for Rand. Her preferred roles for man and nature are master and servant, respectively. Rand desires people to base everything on reason, hence the name \\"Objectivism\\". Curiously, her own philosophy was not to be questioned, the reason being that since it was all worked out logically, it is the truth, and questioning it shows an error on the part of the questioner.Part of the trouble with Rand's philosophy is its all-or-nothing approach. Any rational argument is based on certain axioms or premises which are assumed to be true; it is impossible to start with only the rules of logic and deduce anything meaningful. Thus, even if an argument is logically sound, the premises are always open to question. In the case of Rand's philosophy, we may choose to accept certain premises and reject others, leading to different conclusions. This does not even address the issue of whether her conclusions really were derived directly from the premises without any gaps or leaps.The second problem is an issue of human psychology. Rand has something of a one-size-fits-all approach, but we know today that temperament and personality are heavily influenced by genetics. Rand knew little psychology and gave it little consideration. To transition from showcasing the perfect man to creating a practical philosophy would require integrating knowledge about human behavior and human psychology.That said, Objectivism is an interesting philosophy and I would definitely recommend reading the Fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Well, I have to say that I was expecting more philosophizing and less drama here. But in the end, The Fountainhead is a drama. A drama with a message, but a drama nonetheless. This drama features characters unlike any I've ever met before, so I'm not sure that such personalities exist here in the real world. Perhaps the characters are meant to represent hypothetical extremes of pesonalities. But characters that I cannot relate to unfortunately make the message more difficult to relate to as well.Because it's a drama, the ~700 pages actually read fairly quickly. The language and style are quite pedestrian; a 5th grader should be able to get through the novel quite easily though the \\"message\\" would likely not be fully appreciated by one so young. The story is gripping and becomes a struggle of good against evil. Good is represented by the egoists, evil by the mundane and mediocre whose agenda is to stifle genius and promote collectivism. A bizarre love story is intertwined through the greater plot. The novel is set in early 20th century New York, which was the most modern city in the world at the time, so even now in the 21st century there's nothing really outdated about it. And the New York setting lends greater dynamism and pace to the plot.This is not, as you may often hear, a story about the field of architecture. It just so happens that the main characters work in that field, but the story (and message) could have been nearly the same if written about any other field. In fact, when reading the many architectural discussions throughout the book it became painfully obvious to me that Rand did not have an architectural background, and I'm not even an architect. Some of those discussions should have been omitted as they didn't really add value to the story or the message.The message seems to basically be that only people with great ambition for personal success or perfection generally advance technology or the arts and thereby our standard of living. By nurturing such \\"egoists\\" and not obstructing their way, we allow the fruits of their work to be integrated into our culture, and this ultimately betters society as a whole. The implication is that humanity would be much farther along after, say, 500 years of nurturing egoism than after 500 years of stifling it.It's a compelling theory and I will not speculate on the long-term benefits to society, but I seem to see an obvious and major downside to the theory: Because an egoist could easily be a power hungry madman with no good intentions, short-term trauma on a massive scale could be a possible outcome. Is theoretically faster progress worth that pain?I don't think it's as simple as Rand makes it out to be. Throughout history, egoists have arguably led the advance of technology and the arts. However, they have also started wars resulting in appalling levels of bloodshed, sponsored attempts at genocide, stolen peoples' retirement nest eggs through corporate crime & scandal, etc. The problem is, egoism does not necessarily connote genius and good intentions. Egoism could just as easily come with cunning and a thirst for money & power without regard for who is injured as a consequence.A good read. I would not call it brilliant as many have. In fact I did not find it particularly well written from the standpoint of style. However, I can see that if the message were to ring true for someone then the book could be seen as brilliant."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The novel The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is one of the best novels I have ever read. With Rand's objectivism principle, the characterization of Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey provides insight to the human characteristics. Consisting of Howard's selfishness as a mean to live as himself and Toohey's altruism philosophy to control human beings, Ayn Rand shows a struggle of a selfless man not conforming to society's demands in order to live as himself. On the other hand, a man wanting to control the human spirit is constantly working to prevent Roark to the chance to become successful.As the novel starts, Roark is expelled from Stanton University for his designs not befitting of his current society's architecture models. And so, Roark looks for Cameron, a once famous architect who designed buildings similar to Roark but eventually got cut from the architecture scene due to his unconformity to the society's usual gothic and renaissance structures. On the other hand, Peter Keating, a conformist to society's demands is seen to graduate with the highest degrees possible in the university and to be hired by Francon & Heyer, the country's most renowned architectural company; however, Keating didn't manage it all by himself. As a design for a popular competition which won the acknowledgement companies nationwide, Keating asks Roark for help. With Roark's ability to create masterpieces conforming to society's demands, but which he chooses not to do, Peter wins and throughout most of the novel, Roark is maltreated for his designs that he does as he sees fit for the buildingSeen in the novel, even with Roark's stubbornness to conform, in the end, he becomes the happiest with his achievements while leaving Keating broken due to unemployment. Overall, the novel is a masterpiece that features human characteristics in its simplest form."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read the Fountainhead for the first time 20 years ago after graduating from College. It was the most memorable and thought-provoking literary experience of my life and had a profound impact on my views of the world at the time. Within weeks of finishing The Fountainhead, I read Atlas Shrugged and was further captivated by the Randian philosophies of objectivism and individualism.For the past 20 years, I have retained much of what I learned from those books, but have also acquired 20 years of real-world adulthood and experience. With that backdrop, I recently decided that it was time to go back and reread the Fountainhead. I was curious whether the messages conveyed to a 21 year old graduate would still carry the same impact and resonance.I picked up the book 5 days ago and finished it last night. I was once again enraptured by the story and simply couldn't put the book down to go to sleep any night this week. The characters and dialog were still fascinating and entertaining and I was pleased that certain tenets of the Randian philosophy stayed true with me after all these years. That being said, with an adult's perspective, I also found the characters to be completely implausible and their relationships with each other to be borderline silly. While the dialogs were captivating, they weren't real. Whether it was Rourke and Wynand expounding on the yacht or Toohey spending 3 pages in a long-winded diatribe with Keating toward the end of the novel, there were simply too many instances where Rand unabashedly uses conversation to spout her philosophy with total disregard for how people actually converse with each other. Thus I had more of a sense this time around that The Fountainhead was a philosophy textbook disguised as a novel.The main thing that struck me this time around was that Rand can't seem to find a middle-ground with her characters . . . and this again makes them unreal. When I was 21, I misguidedly believed that adults could actually be as Rand describes. What did I know? Now I view these characters as unnaturally extreme, rigid and one and two dimensional. They are nothing more than cardboard representations of certain ideals, caricatured to the nth degree. Roark and Toohey are not real men . . . they are Randian fantasy creatures. For entertainment purposes, I enjoyed being reacquainted with them, but I have no illusions that they are based on actual human beings. Dominique. Puh-lease. Her storyline is so absurd that I could only laugh my way through it. Wynand . . . I'm still not sure what to make of him and I still don't really understand what Roark would see in a friendship with Wynand. Whatever.Long story short, with a grain of salt and a suspension of disbelief, this is still an entertaining and educational novel. Despite the extremes, there is much to be learned and applied from the Randian ideals: strive to achieve and excel, think for yourself, exist for yourself not for others or for some imaginary higher power, don't be dependent upon others, hold sacred and don't compromise your integrity, stick to your convictions."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand has a few great ideas about the course of history being influenced by great men and women. I happen to believe this is correct. 95% of the population add little to the advance of humankind. In the workforce I have seen key people out perform ten coworkers.What I have not seen is a woman who prefers rape as Dominique does or a capitalist too good to compromise to make a profit (Roark). Rands' hate of the little people, \\"the second handers\\", and their miserable little lives and her avoidance of empathy, humor and even children makes her a misanthrope of the first order.The \\" Virtue of Selfishnes \\" by Rand is a much cleaner and shorter approach to understanding her core belief that when we act in our own self interest its better for the individual and society."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The book was an excellent example of how society can be broken down into those that give and those that take with the illusion of giving. The characters are so well presented at times doing my reading I felt like an extension of the room and viewing the scene first hand. In the end, I had to ask myself I'm I a second-hander or a fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I decided to read The Fountainhead as I believe it was written before Atlas Shrugged. I like it as read at night after I am in bed and before I go to sleep. It is the kind of book I look forward to on my nightly visit and the plot is complicated enough that you get a good read in a couple of chapters a nd then can put it down and look forward to the next evenings read. It is long so you don't get tempted to just read on and finish it. It is perfect for me and my reading habits. I will hate it to end although then I do move on to Atlas."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"An entertaining novel but I have a problem with the vision propounded.I had read this 15 years ago as a young man straight out of college and it had made an impact on me. Now with the wisdom of passing years I thought to catch up by reading this again. And what a difference. The selfish vision propounded in this work has no place in our society. While it is fine to take the high road in a novel and say its my way or the highway , that is not how it works in real life. I am saying that one should compromise with mediocrity it is indeed possible to excel in your chosen field without being obnoxious."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is one of those people where either you like her or you don't. That said, I'll begin by stating that I have first read this book in 1974, at the age of 17, after \\"We The Living\\" and \\"Anthem\\" and before \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" I have just read this again after reading \\"Atlas Shrugged (for the fourth time) and just about Atlas Shrugged Part II is about to be released.I say this because while \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" deals with the lives of industrial titans and their dealings with the world, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is more on a personal level about one individual architect, and those in his circle. One can more identify with Howard Roark than with John Galt. (See my review on \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\")Note, this is a book about an architect, but it is not about architecture. It is about one man who is an architect, who loves his profession so much that he has new original ideas in his profession that the rest of society was not ready to accept. In a way, it is probably based on the life and creations of Frank Lloyd Wright. This is the opinion of an architect whom I know personally, and I know nothing about Wright. Rand, did, however, do research on this subject, and obtained information from professionals in this field.The book is divided into four sections, each focusing on one particular character, of which each section is titled: Peter Keating, Ellsworth M. Toohey, Gail Wynand, and Howard Roark, each in the order of this list.The protagonist is, of course, Howard Roark, who, as an architect, rejects the tradition Greek and Renaissance style of buildings, and comes up with a new style all his own. This is a style in which the building blend in with the landscape, the environment, and is also engineer-friendly (my phrase) where it would be easy to install the plumbing and electricity, and have repair mean have easy access to it. How these buildings look is left up to the reader's imagination.Society, however, was not ready to accept his new style. The book begins with Howard Roark get expelled from the Architectural School of the Stanton Institute of Technology, located in Stanton, Massachusetts. This was just as he was to graduate. Roark is called to see the Dean, on account of his works, not found to be acceptable, and his refusal to comply to the school's standards. Roark wouldn't budge, and he chose expulsion. Peter Keating, one of his \\"competitors\\" (note the quotes) graduates with honors, chosen most likely to succeed, and it snatched up by a prominent firm, Francon & Heyer. Roark moves to New York, is hired by a forgotten architect named Henry Cameron, and struggles for work.This is where the story begins. Peter Keating becomes prominent, wanted by builders, is promoted in his firm, and will trample on others in order for him to achieve promotion. He had only one fault-he couldn't design anything. Because of this, whenever he was commissioned to do a complex design for a skyscraper, he would panic, and run to Roark to have him design it for him, taking the credit for it-and Howard didn't seem to mind it. Keating received a lot of commendations, but the guilt of his living a lie continued to gnaw at him. The moral here was when Roark asked Keating, \\"Do you love what you are doing?\\" Keating didn't answer, but it seemed that he got into it either for the money and/or the prestige, and Howard Roark decided to become an architect from his childhood on, and his heart was into it. Here lies the secret of life. If one chooses a profession, he or she should do it out of the love for it, not the glory. Keating's lies do catch up with him.Other characters of whom Roark has to deal with focus on Ellsworth M. Toohey, a newspaper editor who lusts for power over people, and will stop at nothing to get it. Gail Wynand (a male despite his first name), who owns the tabloid paper, \\"The New York Banner,\\" who knows of Roark's talents and makes use of them for his own ends. Wynand knows the talents and value of Roark's works and can see in them what society at that time doesn't, but has also blended in with society and has enough power to get what he wants. He knows, but also knows how to go with the flow, all to his advantage.One last character worth mentioning is the daughter of another prominent architect, Dominique Francon, daughter of Guy Fraction, the boss who hired Keating in the first place. She is one person who loved Roark from the very beginning, yet, in order to protect him, prevents him from getting commissions. This is s very complex woman, very beautiful, who marries two people whom she despises, Peter Keating and then Gail Wynand, in order to help Roark. Talk about self sacrifice.A lot happens, and Roark always fights society, but this book does have a happy ending.There is a lot more to it, though, philosophy wise. Objectivism is the main point, standing up for oneself and what one believes. Selfishness is preached as a virtue, but in a sense of not only sticking with your beliefs, but, mainly, of learning how to say \\"no.\\" This can be a very hard work to say, having only two letters, but it is a necessity. This is selfishness versus self-less-ness, losing one's identity in trying to please everybody, which, in this book is the real villain: society expecting you to please them, versus hanging on to your own life, your beliefs, and your loves. If you try to please everyone, you will lose your own self.There is one point who Roark is asked what he thinks about somebody he doesn't like. His answer? \\"I don't think of him.\\" That's a good example to follow rather than to get angry.The villains are not only those who preach the concept of pleasing everyone, but also those who leech off of people like Peter Keating did with Roark. the power hungry, like Ellsworth Toohey, and the rich who feel that they can control others and get what they want at other people's expense, like Gail Wynand.Howard Roark is a stoic who takes it in stride, lives in New York and always returns, but goes to work in other towns in the meantime to support himself.The plot thickens at the very end of the book where Roark designs a housing unit for Keating, who panicked as usual, and Roark sketches it for him, and is willing to let Keating put his own name to it providing that nothing on the drawing is changed. Well, Keating tries to comply, but behind his back the commissioners do change the design, and Roark exerts his wrath. I won't say any more.All in all, the setting itself is not as big as \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" and the world goes on as usual, but in this small circle, the individual conflicts with society, and that is why many can identify with this book. The time is set in the early 1930s, during the Depression, but the story is timeless. You can imagine the scenery in today's settings as well. The dialogue is also more down to earth, some philosophy, but it mostly what you could hear in a real life conversation.As Rand said, \\"The Fountainhead,\\" serves as an overture to \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\" Her next novel, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is more massive, and involves the world!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After slogging thru Atlas Shrugged, this is a comparative walk in the park. The Fountainhead should be required viewing or reading for anyone in the creative trades. The movie, with Gary Cooper, is beautifully filmed and tightly edited. A must see."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is the first book I've read written by Ayn Rand and I plan to read Atlas Shrugged next. The reason I bought the book was to find out what all the fuss was about relating to Paul Ryan (perhaps our next VP) and his being influenced by her philosophy.Rand was a wonderful writer. I could 'see' the characters and she created scenic visuals on the page. I will reread this book several times over the next few years. There are so many layers, I feel I'll enjoy it even more each time I read it.Whether or not you agree with Rand's ideology, she weaves it throughout the book as an undercurrent--so rather than diminish the story--it enhances it. I highly recommend this book--again, and again, and again : )"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is not one of the pleasurable holiday reads.This book is the following:1) Profound and Thought Provoking2) Astoundingly relevant to Modern Day life since this was written in the 60's.3) Seems like a psychology Lesson4) Characters are very deep and intriguing.5) Sometimes you find yourself losing track of the chain of thought of the characters and being confusedWhy did I pick this book up? - Its a classic. And if you call yourself a reader, you have got to have read THE FOUNTAINHEAD.Would I recommend it? - Umm.. I'm not so sure."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Whether you agree or disagree with Ayn Rand's politics is not the issue. Her enthusiasm, her intelligence and zeal kept me interested into turning to the next page. A fast paced read with focus on making a point in the end.Two soliloquies in The Fountainhead kept me riveted with interest, absorbed in the thought processes of her mind. The first was from the villain of the story, Toohey who embodied all our author hated in a man. Toohey addressed one of his \\"puppets\\" and made him confront the truth he always knew but preferred to avoid. When you know the truth but deny it to make yourself seem better, it is an even worse sin. The last soliloquy was from our hero Rourke at the very end where he defends himself in court.Both men stood for very different morals. One for individuality while the other advocated crushing the individual for the benefit of the masses. Again whether you agree or disagree with Rand on one stand or the other, she expressed both sides of the coin with relish and with enthusiasm.An amazing writer, she kept me hooked form beginning to end. If you set aside political views and read the book as entertainment for its artistic value, you will derive enjoyment and pleasure from the fluidity of her style.One thing surprised me was her depiction of women. None of the women in this novel are admirable or people to be trusted. Even when she explained why one or the other did something, it seemed self serving and vengeful. I kept wondering if she hated women in general. I disliked all her female characters. Again, it was personal and did not deter from the story line, although it made me raise my eyebrows several times.I loved the book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is an excellent tale about a man who refuses to compromise his own professional beliefs despite the sheep of society telling him otherwise. There are a few other sub-main characters that are enjoyable to follow as well, including someone who just wants to have a societal significance, even if his impact is negative, and someone else who seems to refuse to follow his heart and make decisions he knows is right simply because he feels he has to follow some expected path (and watching his actions range from depressing to infuriating).This book is very entertaining and keeps you turning pages wanting to find out what happens next. It's a relatively long novel, but it doesn't feel that long as it keeps you engaged and prevents you from just wanting the book to be over.However, if you've read Atlas Shrugged, you can get by without reading this book, as it's basically a very simplified version of Atlas Shrugged in nearly every respect. There are fewer characters, the characters aren't as complex, the writing isn't as complex (however, that means it's a much easier read), the subplots are fewer, the background tangents are fewer and shorter, and the book is significantly shorter. For as much more complicated Fountainhead is than Anthem, Atlas Shrugged is just as more complicated, if not more, than Fountainhead. If you are deciding between this and Atlas Shrugged, I personally enjoyed Atlas Shrugged much more; however, I have a number of friends who enjoyed Fountainhead more - and the one common theme I found amongst people who prefer one over the other is that they always enjoy the one they read first more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There is really nothing to say about this book in the ways of discussing philosophy that hasn't been said before. In my opinion, it is one of the best books ever written, and if I had to choose, probably my personal favorite. But that doesn't matter to anyone but me. The Fountainhead is something that you read, and on the surface there will be a thousand different views or opinions about it. But as with most books, it is your private, personal response that matters.I think what is true about this book is that you are not just listening to Ayn Rand's own personal philosophy intertwined throughout, which she is trying to impose on you or get you to \\"subscribe\\" to. You are hearing only the voice of a very sane and courageous person. Some will balk at the existence of such largeness and find ways to cancel it out. Others may put the person on a pedestal and worship. But what she is really saying is that you are Howard Roark by nature and the only way this world can break you down is if you let it. Shame is such a deeply ingrained feeling within all of human culture.

The writing is brilliant (I know this is true when I - frequently - must return to a sentence or a passage and re-read it multiple times just to admire the beauty and perfection with which it was written); the characters are fully developed. It is incredible to think that Ayn Rand wrote this in the 1930/40's, yet the subject matter is so topical as it applies to society TODAY, in 2012. The condition of society (some may call it the human condition) today truly is one of collectivism, of that horrific brand of altruism; if a person is an individual....he or she can expect to be on the receiving end of something akin to the pointing scream in Invasion (or, Invasion of the Body Snatchers).Two things - 1) What many describe as \\"the rape scene\\" was not a rape scene. It was what had to happen, what was required of and for both characters. Exquisite pain and sacrifice. 2) With regard to any who might be critical of this novel - yes, we are aware that second-handers are members of the majority in our society; you are not expected to understand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"'The Fountainhead' was Ayn Rand's first major literary success, selling over 6.5 million copies to-date. It was written after Rand read a biography of Frank Lloyd Wright and worked in an architect's office. Its central character is an individualistic young architect who skips (collective) tradition to pursue his own ideas (modernity).Protagonist Howard Roark is an architecture student expelled for refusing to adhere to convention. Moving to New York, Roark his hired, and then fired for insubordination. Another opportunity, and firing follow.Eventually Roark receives a significant commission and accepts - on the grounds the building will be built per his design. Returning from a long yacht trip he finds the finished building deviates from his design, dynamites, it tried for the destruction, and the jury finds him 'Not guilty.'One final assignment - design a skyscraper depicting the supremacy of man.Bottom-Line: It is easy to understand why the manuscript was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted. The book also provides a good example of why fiction writing and reading can often be more trouble than it's worth - vs. a simple, succinct summary of ideas."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is much more preferable reading philosophy through a novel filled with realistic characters than through dry discourses and arguments from Ancient Greece. However, most realistic characters do not go off on long soliloquies that can span multiple pages. The portrayal of each character is used as a means of comparison and contrast through which various people live their lives. The exaggeration of each character's principles helps portray the contrast more starkly. Although Ayn Rand said in her introduction that the purpose of the book was only to portray characters and not to write a philosophy, her philosophy of objectivism subtly comes across through her characters. Very subtly.Despite the criticisms of objectivism, and of Ayn Rand's sneaky nature of introducing a philosophy to her audience, there is a reason this book is a classic. It portrays characters that could be real if they were more moderate in their beliefs. In a broader sense, it can be used to portray the people around us. The book is organized into four parts, with each part outlining the method of success of each character. In a way, the reader is shown four unique methods for becoming successful. I can understand why many people use this book as a guide to living their life, because there's a part of each character in all of us.There are times when we may feel like Peter Keating, borrowing someone's ideas and not giving them enough credit, or flattering a superior to win praise. We may feel successful because the results of our actions may have rewarded us in some way, but there's an empty feeling that we did not deserve the praise we received.Other times, we may feel like Ellsworth Toohey, spouting beliefs without full conviction, trying to influence public or peer opinion for the sake of proving we have influence. Even worse, we may make our peers feel bad for an unintentional fault of theirs. It may give us a sense of influence, until we realize these people are not self-sufficient, they need others' approval to temporarily relieve them of their unhappiness. And their unhappiness is contagious.Rarely, but often enough, we may play the part of Gail Wynand. We know exactly what people want us to say, and we say it. We may do it because it amuses us. We may do it because it gives us power. Yet, after doing it, we realize that it was only an act. That was not our real opinion, that was not what WE wanted to say. Eventually we may realize that this false sense of power only existed as long as we said and did what others wanted us to say and do.Then there is our hero, Howard Roark--hated by most who see him, yet incapable of hate for anyone. He is loved by himself and the few rare people who can see him for who he is--\\"a man totally innocent of fear.\\" This is the ideal that Rand portrays in a man. Although you do not have to be as egotistic as Roark to be great and successful, the important message is that as long as you have persistence and a self-sustaining belief in your own ideas, and the drive to constantly act on them and improve them, success will come and find you!- MR"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Length:: 9:59 MinsKimberly Baisley-Byers' review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Fall 2011 Honors Colloquium on Creative Destruction at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond.

This particular edition is very compact (appr 4X7 inches) which has its advantages but forces the use of very small type, too small for many people to comfortably read. My 4-star review is not 5-star solely because of the type size."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I loved this book from the first time I read it. I can't ever put it down once I start reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"*Includes some spoilers* This book can be divided into three parts:The beginning, where Roark and Keating are introduced and their differences are quickly established. This is perhaps the most interesting part of the novel as it is the part most driven by plot and dialogue.Then there is the middle, when the powers that be are impeding Roark's progress, which doesn't seem to affect him emotionally at all. This part is also still mainly driven by plot and dialogue but by this point the reader will most likely already be weary from all repetitive events of the story. Roark facing some sort of disappointment and Keating achieving increasingly greater status. This is mostly a repetition of events that portray Roark as a martyr. Other characters are developed including the main antagonist Ellsworth Toohey and the love interest Dominique Francon so this section is still somewhat interesting.The end is the main problem of the novel. The closer the story draws to its conclusion the more philosophical it becomes and it goes from repetitive events to repetitive speech. The three main protagonists Roark, Dominique, and Gail Wynand are all essentially one character. That is, they all seem to share the exact same thoughts and ideas and they each talk about them in length multiple times. The reader basically ends up reading the exact same speech over and over again from three differenct characters whose interactions are especially painful to read. This leaves the antagonists, Keating and Toohey, as the most interesting characters of the novel because they are the most dynamic and rounded. This is significant because the author isn't just trying to make good heroes and villains but is trying to make a statement about individualism. The hero is an \\"ideal man' does not compromise his ideals while one villain is a sycophant who has no ideals, and the other is a master manipulator trying to supress the greatness of man. Even for someone who agrees with objectivism, or just a Libertarian or free-thinker, the character of Roark can still be unlikeable and obnoxious.One wonders why the author even bothered to write a novel in the first place if it was just going to serve as a giant allegory for capitalism vs. socialism, right vs. left etc. It would've saved both the author and the reader a lot of time if she had just written an essay or a book about her philosophy. Her ideas are interesting and well thought out. She captures the essence of libertarianism and rational egoism better than any fiction writer and better than most philosophers and politicians ever have which leads you to wonder why she didn't just write some sort of essay or philosophy book instead of a massive, repetitive novel.Technically, the author is not a bad writer. Her prose is well-structured and easy to read and the plot and dialogue are engaging at times, mainly during the beginning. The problem lies in her beating the issue to death and leaving the reader exhausted and annoyed by the end of the novel. A novel should not have to be satisfying as long as the reader doesn't read the last 1/3 of it. The uneven pace is also a major flaw. Most of the novel is medium-paced and major events spaced out by character interactions. However in the last 1/3 of the novel the pace fluctuates between extremely long, drawn-out speeches about from Roark/Dominique/Wynand and very fast action. The end where Roark destroys the building, is taken to trial, and is found not guilty happens at a more rushed pace with less detail than the events in the first 2/3 of the novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you liked Atlas Shrugged you will love the Fountainhead! Her character interactions are very different but for me that kept it interesting I never knew where the story line was going to go. Very fast paced and exciting!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I started reading this book checked out from my local library. 1/3 through, I decided this is a book I must own - I want to read it over and over. While reading it, a thought keeps coming up in my head - do those people who are never introduced to Ayn Rand know what they miss?! Glad I am not one of them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In writing this book, Ayn Rand, is striving to articulate her philosophy of objectivism. Put loosely, this involves the maximum level of freedom for the individual as exemplified by laissez faire capitalism. Rand still has many adherents today some eighty years since the book was first published.The essence of the novel is the life of Howard Roark, an iconoclastic, highly motivated architect. Against all odds, Roark succeeds as an architect despite numerous set backs mainly related to the fact that he will brook no challenges to his designs. Once a design has been executed, no one can make a change. In other words, once given initial instructions, the rest is up to him. Roark holds a particular loathing for the work of \\"second handers\\"; those people who seek the approval of others without being original. These people are a drain on society.Despite his obvious unconventionality, Roark eventually succeeds. There are numerous disruptions along the way but Roark is not a man for changing. He is driven by the desire to be his own man.Is the book well written? Well, not particularly. The characters are mainly implausible but all grist for the mill as Rand pushes to espouse her philosophy. And, at times, for this reason, the book can be preachy. Long monologues about the virtue of the individual over the collective do begin to tire after a while.Would I recommend this book to others? Yes, but it depends on the person in question. To the general reader with no real interest in the philosophy of Ayn Rand, the book will probably fail to be finished. It is really best read by that person willing to work for at least a passing knowledge of Rand and her philosophy. Her impact upon society has been significant and it is works such as \\"The Fountainhead\\" that outlines her core rationale."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"One of her better ones perhaps because it's short. It's easy to get caught up in this story becuase of the unusual point of view of the characters. I strongly disliked the misogynist Fountainhead and didn't like Atlas Shrugged much better. I read this ond for a book group, nice departure from the longer dark and turgid ones we seem to read. It's worth the read and it is inexpensive."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is a novel which draws the reader in with an intriguing plot while at the same time using the lives of the twisted and complex characters to cause the reader to reflect on their own life philosophies. The Fountainhead tells the story of two young architects; Howard Roark, a struggling visionary who finds himself outcast from society for his unprecedented ideas on architecture and life, and Peter Keating, a success from a young age who struggles with insecurity among other inner demons despite his fame and fortune. Throughout the novel, the major characters deal with themes such as love, logic, and the clashing of the two. The readers will experience every same stab of anger, jealousy, insecurity, and betrayal, and will find themselves rooting for characters one minute and hating them the next. Rand masterfully blends different elements of style including tone, diction, and imagery to weave her storyline and add layers of meaning and symbolism to events as they occur. Each character has a unique voice which articulates different beliefs, worldviews, and self-perceptions that many can relate to. At the same time, they each individually reflect Rand's beliefs and experiences. For instance, Roark, the main character, lives his life the way the author believes it should be, and the talentless critic Ellsworth Toohey is reminiscent of Stalin, a figure prevalent in Rand's culture and background. The Banner along with the motif of journalism demonstrates Rand's disdain for the dictation of popular taste and mass public opinion. Architecture and journalism are constantly juxtaposed; one as the most pristine and admirable art form, the other as a threat and detriment to society as a whole. The means through which the author's personal ideals are conveyed will cause the reader to question how they live their own lives as well as their own beliefs on the topics addressed throughout the novel. Though it may deal with heavy topics and material, The Fountainhead is an engaging read which keeps readers on their toes. It truly is a timeless story with a lasting message that can be appreciated by all."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In 1943 Ayn Rand published, The Fountainhead. Her novel encompasses the principles of Objectivist philosophy, while winding a captivating narrative of two rival architects, namely Howard Roark and Peter Keating. The story is set primarily in New York City in the 1920s through 40s, creating a playing field bound for excitement.The plot itself is marked by myriad bombshells both figurative and literal, while the characters suffer turbulence, professionally and personally. Lives are threatened, purpose is lost and rediscovered, and confidence and pretenses are shattered with dreams.The characters come to life from the pages. In fact, it is as if the plot is written only as means to realize these characters. The relationships in the novel are complex. Friendships are made three dimensional and ulterior motives are perpetually revealed. The competitive nature of business, press, politics and industry force the characters to make choices that expose their true identities.Beneath the superficies of the story, Rand expresses her objectivist ideals. The novel sets out to prove the absolute nature of facts, exemplifying man's inability to change the inevitability of certain events. She glorifies selfishness. The concepts of feeding ego, and reaching personal goals at any costs reoccur throughout the text. Roark himself embodies the objectivist ideas of self governing and pulverizing conventional standards for the betterment of self.As a literary work, The Fountainhead is rich with stylistic qualities. Rand uses all the literary devices to her advantage. Buildings, statues, places and even characters are all symbols of greater things. Rand exemplifies the greatest use of a character foil. Keating's personal qualities so contrast to Roark's they become outstanding. Metaphors are present throughout the text. She uses motifs and descriptive language to force upon the reader the points of her writing.The Fountainhead is not a book to miss. Its powerful message invokes thought. The characters reveal crucial insight into human nature. Stylistically, Rand is virtuoso. The Fountainhead encompasses the true meaning of an expertly written novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead tells the story of architect Howard Roark, the quintessential \\"ideal man\\" according to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. Roark is ideal because he never settles for mediocrity, never compromises his artistic vision and never fears to break from tradition to forge his own path. These qualities bring difficulties to his career in architecture; his untraditional ideas and stoic nature are found unacceptable by architects and the general public alike. Roark's work is mostly panned, although a handful of people recognize his genius. Most of the novel deals with how the man and his work are perceived by others, with the main focus on his refusal to concede to the ideas or desires of other people or groups.Rand aids the reader in understanding Roark by giving him several foils, each of which is a reflection and/or corruption of the \\"ideal man,\\" and most of the novel's action revolves around each foil's connection to the protagonist. Roark's architecture classmate, Peter Keating, is the polar opposite of Roark: he has no passion, he adheres to tradition and he seeks the respect and acknowledgement of others. The art critic and journalist Ellsworth M. Toohey, cognizant of Roark's greatness (and perhaps his own lack of it), subtly manipulates the public through his articles and news connections to attempt to destroy Roark. Gail Wynand is the owner of the largest news organizations in the country. Like Roark, he is passionate and highly competent, but instead of creating great works, Wynand only strives to amass power and influence by pandering to the whims of a vile and fickle public. A quality that unites Roark's foils is their connection to public opinion: Keating relies on the whims and judgments of others (having no opinions of his own), Toohey tells people what their opinions should be and Wynand gives the public the sleazy tabloid pulp they want instead of the real news that they need.The novel opens with Roark being expelled from architecture school as Keating is being offered a coveted job at a prestigious architecture firm. Keating thrives in his new position at first, even winning awards for his designs (designs which he could not have completed without Roark's secret aid). Meanwhile, Roark works at a lowly firm and is ridiculed by the public for his strange designs (though beloved by those living in and using his structures). As Roark's fortunes begin to rise and Keating's fortunes fall, Toohey becomes aware of Roark and, recognizing the architect's individualistic spirit, plans his downfall. He convinces a businessman to hire Roark to design a temple, knowing the businessman will be appalled by Roark's design. Toohey nudges the businessman further, creating a public outcry and a well-publicized civic trial.Despite being forced to pay a settlement that bankrupts his business, Roark works on occasional commissions and eventually comes to the attention of Gail Wynand (who had been a great fan of Roark's designs for many years without knowing the identity of the architect). They strike up a friendship and Wynand feels, for the first time, that he has found a kindred spirit. Roark helps Keating with yet another design, this time for a housing project, on the condition of anonymity and strict adherence to his blueprints. After a committee of architects alters his designs, Rourke blows up the housing project before it can be finished. Wynand is glad for the opportunity to use his power to help his friend and attempts to wield his influence as a newspaper mogul to sway public opinion in Roark's favor. At this point, though, Toohey has managed to insinuate himself into many different levels of society, including Wynand's main newspaper, various journals and several artistic circles and worker's unions, revealing a level of influence no one suspected him of having. With public opinion heavily against him, Roark is brought to trial. He defends himself, making an impassioned speech about the necessity of ego and the glory of the individual, the creator-and the evil of second-handers, who create nothing except altruism, as a method to control the collective and impede the individual. The jury finds him not guilty.In addition to presenting the realized ideal man, the novel is also an examination of those who fall short and those who are diametrically opposite. Dominique Francon appears to be presented as an example of female greatness; being Roark's lover, there is an implication that she is an ideal woman. And yet, before meeting Roark, she lived the vapid lifestyle of a socialite: attending social functions, dressing up and generally being bored and critical of the world around her. But at least early in the story, she seems to be the cleverest person in the room; encountering Roark changes everything for Dominique. After being raped by Roark, and seemingly enjoying the experience, her independence and power are lost and she succumbs to typical female stereotypes: she falls hopelessly in love with Roark and subsumes her own desires into his. Then, the character takes a strange turn: Dominique, in perhaps her last insightful moment in the story, recognizes that the world will try to destroy Roark's greatness-and aids those forces by doing everything in her power to sabotage his commissions! In her confounding sexual deviance, Dominique desires Roark to physically/sexually overpower her, but only allows herself this pleasure after she has thwarted one of his commissions. And Roark seems perfectly content to allow her to do this! With the damage she does to Roark's works, she resembles the antagonistic Toohey much more than the ideal Roark.Although Dominique is personally responsible for withholding some of Roark's work from the world, she soon grows disenchanted with the world for not recognizing his greatness. She decides she wants no pleasure in a world like this and ends her trysts with Roark. Dominique's perplexing, self-destructive behavior doesn't end there; she seeks to make herself miserable by marrying someone who is the opposite of Roark, someone she despises: Peter Keating. When the opportunity arises to make herself more miserable by marrying someone even worse, she divorces Keating and marries the powerful and ruthless Gail Wynand. The mogul ends up being more similar to Roark than anyone could have guessed but it's her intention to punish herself that makes Dominique's actions so difficult to comprehend. She doesn't seem very much like an ideal person, let alone Roark's ideal mate.Ellsworth M. Toohey, in a quite obvious and heavy-handed way, is Rand's explanation for why altruism is evil. Toohey is a critic and lover of the arts, hero to and supporter of the common man, selfless, generous, religious and intelligent. He is a man known, respected and loved by the public. He preaches the suppression of the self in service to others and almost always presents himself in this way to others: he lives and dresses modestly, organizes meetings of artists and unions (never accepting pay for this work) and writes articles appealing to the traditional values of the public. But he is the villain of the story! As his aunt describes him, he is a maggot. He thrives on the despair of others and takes particular delight in crushing the spirits of those who have greatness in them. In his heart, Toohey is really a cynic. He doesn't believe in anything he preaches, only that his machinations will give him power. He sees the edifices of mankind: government, religion, civilization-as structures of control. And he wants to be the one to pull the lever that makes the gears of the world turn. In essence, Toohey aims to be a secret ruler of men and has realized that the easiest men to control are those who have no individuality; those who have suppressed the self and have submitted to a form of societal control.Though Rand's method of denouncing altruism is unsubtle and perhaps even sophomoric, it is certainly entertaining and provocative, especially in the example of Toohey's extended rant to Peter Keating about his vision of a subservient society. In one of the most memorable passages of the novel, Toohey describes the way to destroy greatness:\\"Don't set out to raze all shrines-you'll frighten men. Enshrine mediocrity-and the shrines are razed.\\"In other words, men can't be convinced that there aren't great things in the world, but if they can be fooled into believing that the banal is the ideal, they will lose the ability to create or even recognize greatness. One can't help but find an eerie analogue of this in today's media-saturated society: reality stars trump truly talented actors in popularity and recognition, consumer goods are sold based on endorsements instead of quality manufacturing and books and movies are judged more on sales figures than critical reception. A similar observation can be made about the apathy and indifference of the general population concerning politics, poverty, hunger, war, etc. Being inundated with these concerns from so many sources, it's no surprise that images of needless death and destruction don't horrify people as much as they should. Perhaps Rand had it right, from a certain perspective...On the whole, The Fountainhead isn't particularly well-written (it reads like a romance novel in some places) and the characters and situations aren't very realistic. However, this is a book of examples, of ideas in motion; each character is a representative for one of two ideas: a variant of the ideal spirit or a collectivist/second-hander. Rand's Objectivist ideas about the greatness of the individual are, admittedly, seductive; everyone believes on some level that their integrity and vision should never be compromised. Roark is an attractive exemplar because his work is described as being genuinely better than the work of the architects who cling to outdated tradition. One flaw that materializes, however, is that the \\"ideal man,\\" even in the world of the novel, appears to be an infrequent occurrence. Henry Cameron, for example, is crushed, physically and spiritually, for clinging to his own ideas on architecture, as is Stephen Mallory (until Roark comes along and gives the young sculptor purpose). Gail Wynand misuses his ego to acquire power. Dominique Francon has masochistic tendencies. Only the seemingly inhuman Roark is able to make his ego work for him.This brings up a larger question: if, in the context of a fictional novel, individuals cannot successfully maintain their integrity and do great things, what hope do people in the real world have? What about untalented people? How does a janitor or a cab driver or a waiter act with integrity? Taking Wynand as an example from the novel, it is not clear how he could have used his ideal nature to run his newspaper differently. Perhaps he could have published real news instead of tabloid fodder, but this most likely would have caused his newspaper to go bankrupt (in one passage, he describes an early experiment in trying to publish both kinds of news, with sales and profits favoring sleazy tabloid news). Sticking to his guns would have resulted in falling into obscurity like Cameron. Similarly, what could Dominique have done differently? She already spoke her mind in her art criticism and social interactions, yet she was miserable, inflicting new kinds of pain on herself to forget the troubles of the world. Cameron is perhaps the most interesting character to consider: he is just as stubbornly insistent on maintaining his integrity as Roark. His personality is similarly abrasive. In all the ways that count for Rand, Cameron is virtually identical to Roark, from talent to attitude to intelligence. However, Roark gains some semblance of public acceptance and personal fulfillment by the end of the novel while Cameron does not, and the novel does not explain why Roark succeeded and Cameron died dejected and bitter. If characters so similar to Roark cannot succeed in the same world he did, how much harder would it be for real people in our non-fictional world? These questions are not adequately addressed by Rand in The Fountainhead.Perhaps it is asking too much to have a book work well as a piece of literature and a philosophical treatise that applies to the real world. It's sometimes difficult to separate the Objectivist Philosophy from the content of the book, but Rand's case for the individual as being the prime mover of progress and the collective being the destroyer of progress is too simplistic. Wasn't it men coming together to form tribes in ancient times that allowed everyone to survive against savage beasts and hunt large game? Rand's attacks on altruism fall apart when applied to any place that isn't democratic: could Roark have achieved his greatness if he was born into a low caste in India? In a poor village in Uganda? In medieval England? Ancient Egypt? Living in a democracy provides initial conditions and opportunities to those living there and democracy is the product of a form of collectivism.Despite its inconsistencies and simplicity, The Fountainhead makes for a thought-provoking read; I spent a few months thinking about it before putting my thoughts down in this review. It's easy to see why so many young, impressionable teens latch onto this book, falling in love with the notions of breaking from tradition and walking your own path, as these ideas are so much a part of the teenage experience in the West. But it's also pretty clear why most (but not all) twenty-somethings discard and dismiss this book; it takes a certain level of maturity and distance from puberty to understand that ego is not always great and altruism does not always entail a loss of self to the collective.[This review also appears on [...], a site for review and discussion of creative works.]"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"What I love most about this book is the great plot and the very well developed characters. I find The Fountainhead is a bit easier to read and digest when compared to Atlas Shrugged (which I also love), and in my opinion, The Fountainhead also has a lighter touch when it comes to pushing objectivism.This book is a great story about a man against the world, a man with strength of character who believes in what he does, and does it to best of his ability no matter the obstacles put in his way. Howard Roarke is a solitary man who who excels at architecture, despite the fact that all of peers believe that his work is rubbish. The truth of the matter is that most of them know, but won't admit, that it's really their work that is rubbish, not Roarke's.It is well worth the read, and a great entry point before reading Atlas Shrugged, which is much longer, and delves more into the philosophy of objectivism."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is not a joy to read. It isn't fun, happy, or uplifting. Indeed, most of it is oppressively dark and disturbing. It is however, masterfully written and very rewarding. Not as captivating or inspiring asAtlas Shrugged, this book still ranks as one of my all time favorites. Definitely recommended to anyone and everyone.THE FOUNTAINHEAD follows a central cast of extremely memorable (but not generally likeable) characters through a story that's main purpose is to highlight and demonstrate Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophies. All of the characters represent extreme personalities (and are thus rather one-dimensional). The self-confidant, unreliant, productive man (Howard Roark) battles the worst of society's altruistic and self-sacrificing demands. The socialist progressive movement is the enemy, excusing weakness, stupidity, and laziness; while demagoguing production, achievement, and individualism. This book actually provides a mastermind antagonist in Ellsworth Toohey that knowingly strives for the downfall of civilization by promoting liberalism, and is one of the most intriguing, but unlikely, characters in Rand's novels. Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, and Gail Wynand all contribute to make this story truly unforgettable.IMO, Rand is one of the most ill-represented and misunderstood philosophers of all time. Rather than being radical, I believe that she would fit right in with current day Libertarians. She was not heartless or without compassion, she just understood that living for yourself is the way to peace. She didn't dislike charities, she disliked the government forcing people to give up their property for the benefit of others. Paying welfare taxes does not equate to kindness or charitable giving when it is done under coercion. Stating that no man has a right to others' property does not reflect selfishness, but an understanding of natural law.Rand was a huge believer in America, and its promise to the future. She wrote these books and developed her philosophies to combat what she saw as the liberalization of America and the world. Many of us today see and fear the same things even now. A couple of my favorite quotes demonstrating Rand's love of this country and nicely summarizing the theme of her two best books:\\".. built on the principle of individualism. This, our country. The noblest country in the history of men. The country of greatest achievement, greatest prosperity, greatest freedom. This country was not based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept of altruism. It was based on man's right to the pursuit of happiness. His own happiness. Not anyone else's. A private, personal, selfish motive.\\"-Howard Roark (The Fountainhead)\\".. for the first time in history, a country of money - and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man's mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being - the self-made man - the American industrialist.\\"-Francisco d'Anconia (Atlas Shrugged)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"At first sight, i never thought I would like this book or read it like i'm in that world; but, i did.

Seeing that it consisted of approximately 700 pages, the dreadful task of reading it came to mind. However, after my teacher shared with the class her views upon this book and how insightful it will be to us, I was a little interested but still put it off. How interesting could a book be that is 700 pages long (with the exception of Harry Potter)? To my surprise, within the first twenty-five pages, I was hooked to the lengthy novel. Ayn Rand is able to paint a vivid picture for the imagination of the characters, setting, emotions, and context. In the novel, she clearly states her opinion of the essence of an ego within an individual through her main character Howard Roark; he is the great architect who lives for no one but himself. Although he is intriguing, other characters interested me; Peter Keating, a parasitic human being whose creativity consists of nothing more than the copying of others for his \\"originality\\"; Dominique Francon, the beautiful woman whose will to love none is disbarred with her meeting of Roark; Ellsworth Toohey, the antagonist of the story who appears to be great with his \\"selfless\\" acts but only seeks power; and Gail Wynand, one who worked his way from the slums for control but loses himself along the way, until the very end. These characters keep me entertained throughout the story of Roark's perseverance as an architect and his ability to express his individualism. Even though this book is based upon the great work of an architect, when I looked deeper within Ayn Rand's words, I understand the philosophical statement behind the buildings and people. This book is enjoyable from beginning to end, and my teacher is right: this book is insightful and gives people a reason and hope as to why they should always be true to themselves. After reading 700 pages, I decided that I love Ayn Rand's philosophy within the words and the moral behind the story. The Fountainhead is one of brilliance and remembrance."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead really is a love it or hate it book. I liked a lot about it, but I definitely have large issues with the work. As simply a novel, I thought the story was fascinating but somewhat marred by and hard to relate to due to the absolutel ridiculousness of the characters. I can understand Rand wanted to exaggerate the characters to better illustrate her points, but let's be honest, these characters aren't human and never could be. Also, the end felt like it changed from a novel to a textbook as the characters \\"analogues\\" became monologues spouting Rand's objectivisim philosophy. Regardless, the story by itself is still an interesting read.The real reason I still liked the book, though, and gave it four stars is because I thought it was filled with some of the most thought-provoking and interesting ideas I've read. Her concept of what truly makes a man great caused me to reevaluate what I thought defined greatness and to a lesser extent, even the kind of achievements I wanted to make in life.

After I realized she really believed Ayn Rand's selfish drivel, I dropped her like a hot rock. For that, I owe Ayn Rand a debt of gratitude, for which I give two stars instead of one.If you're young and curious about why some people can be so selfishly righteous and blind, read this book. As a cautionary tale.As for the book itself, the stereotypes of the characters and the blatant attempt to insert a \\"philosophy\\" into fiction have been well-drawn by other reviewers. I am writing this now because America has been plunged into the Great Recession by people who tried hard to live their lives according to this dead Russian emigre's ideals.Those ideals are easily summed up: individualism is the height of human development, extreme selfishness is the way to achieve individualism, and anything that gets in the way of selfish people achieving their goals is an evil perpetrated by jealous, inferior people hellbent on keeping the geniuses among us down.Given Ayn Rand's background, a daughter of Czarist Russian nobility forced to flee their homeland by the Russian Revolution, her attitude is at least somewhat understandable. Unfortunately, it was seized upon by Americans who wanted to return to the Gilded Age of robber barons who railed against any regulation of their endeavors by those who believed in a common good for everyone who lived in our society. They basically scream: Government of the people, by the people, and for the people is EVIL!! It stifles individual creativity! It stifles the FREE MARKET, that great god who rewards the deserving if only given a free hand! Let us do whatever we want, whenever we want, to whomever we want, or we'll throw a tantrum!!Like the protagonist raping the woman in this book, but, according to my would-be girlfriend of long ago, a \\"good rape\\" because it set her free of her horrible collectivist and socially responsible convictions. Like the greedy traders of Wall Street and the fixers and flippers and mortgage lenders of the subprime real estate market, who raped our economy for their own short term benefit. Like the health insurance industry profiteers, who claim that any government run plan is inherently inferior on the one hand but is in fact so insidious on the other it would somehow drive them out of business if allowed to exist on a level playing field.Like the people who look down their noses at the less fortunate as \\"losers\\" who got where they were by their \\"choices,\\" never mind that most of the fortunate got their fortunes in one of the three old-fashioned ways: inheritance, luck, exploitation, or some combination of the three. Ayn Rand offers them convenient cover.What it all boils down to is that Ayn Rand and her followers believe that the ideal of the spoiled brat should reign supreme over any notion of the common good. Isn't that what the Czar was really all about in the first place? If Nicholas II and his ilk weren't spoiled brats with absolute power, what else were they? And look what happened to them, and deservedly so."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead chronicles (in third person) the saga of brilliant architect Howard Roark, the society that hates him and his violent romance with stunningly beautiful Dominique Francon. It's a wonderful story brought down only because Rand wrote this book only to prove her philosophy of Objectivism; therefore her characters aren't three dimensional at all, and the dialogue is rather rigid. It is also a tad unrealistic when characters rant for several pages about something. The storytelling also exhibits a heavy bias towards Roark and those who are his allies. The story is excellent though, filled with page-turners and bursting with excellent descriptions and thought sequences. I do not agree with all of Rand's philosophy however, shunning altruism, and spirituality of any kind.Included in the society that is against him, is the wildly adored, but greedy, power-hungry newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey. He believes in collectivism, where everything is simplified and watered down to the masses. I like how Ellsworth doesn't reveal that he is truly evil till the end of the book. Another one of the foes, although not seen until later into the novel, is Gail Wynand, the owner of a popular, newspaper that runs shallow stories about things such as poor pregnant young women. Peter Keating, Roark's rival since college, is widely adored, and experiences a quick rise to fame as opposed to Roark's sluggish one. However, he has no real talent as an architect, and is written as a sort of worm in the story.Dominique Francon is a socialite with a frivolous newspaper column. She is exquisitely beautiful, but she is very icy until she meets Roark. Then she becomes more proactive in the novel. She has a rather pessimistic view of society, and surrounds herself with things she hates so that she cannot witness society tearing apart the things she loves. She and Roark have a violent, psychological love affair lasting throughout the entire book and are thus smiled upon by Rand. Their relationship is in direct contrast to Keating's cutesy and insipid romance with his college sweetheart Katie.Rand's novel, although extremely one-sided, is an excellent read, a true contemporary classic, and very thought provoking."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is very good at situational descriptions and setting. In this book, the overbearing/awe-inspiring effect Dominique has on the people around her is carried off very well throughout the book, as are the portrayals of Howard Roark, particuarly in the opening scene.As a whole, though, it's boring and overwrought. Yes, it has an Important Message to get across, which it does (many times) as gracelessly as possible. Ayn Rand is quoted as having said that she always puts the story before the Message in her fiction, but she's mistaken, at least in this case.This book is a wonderful example of a novel whose ambition exceeds its content. The reader is being told that they shouldn't feel any sense of responsibility to anyone or anything other than their own creative urges. This is a little bit contradictory to Rand's other notion that the only worthwhile enterprise of the individual is to create in a manner beneficial to other people (doesn't that sound a bit like the spirit of altruism she demonizes?), but I'll leave that alone here. It really doesn't take all the proselytizing to get what she has to say across. The Fountainhead tries to be an epic, but there just isn't all that much there.Plus, we don't really have characters; we get Ideals. The walking, talking things in this book fail to be interesting because they are impossible as real humans. This would be okay if the book were much shorter, but after the first several hundred pages it wears thin. And then the illusion breaks down further when two of the characters break into a thinly-veiled Socratic dialogue, for the purpose of going through even more of the same dogmatism all over again. Ayn Rand just couldn't pull off, conceptually, the whole \\"ideas with legs\\" thing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Thought provoking and insightful, a look into what is still the american society. At times I was given over to deep sadness and meloncoly, other moments were like the sun shining through the clouds. A wel written emotional rollercoaster to pick and choose your moral from. I am happy to say that though it is not the reality we live in there is an ideal we could work with. In creativity and knowledge base Ayn Rand led me on a journey through the unthoughtof field of architecture into human greed, shame, and ultimit joy. Written in multifaceted and ever changing/growing perspectives, I dub this a look into the human spirit."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This review is written in response to the &quot;anti-objectivist&quot; review that you can find on this same page. I feel that &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; has many great things to offer the reader and I definately recommend it. I have read some extremely intelligient dissenting reviews of this book and had to bow to those reviewer's reasoning abilities. BUT - the &quot;anti-objectivist&quot; should not be allowed the status of monkey for his horrible pseudo-logical take on why he doesn't like &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this novel about 30 years ago, when I was, of all things, an architecture student. I was fascinated. As time passed, the details of the novel receded from my memory, but I had occassion to learn more about objectivism. I don't believe in it mayself, but I do understand it and respect it as a vital contribution to our intellectual history and an importamnt expression of principles underlying one school of thought inour ongoing political/economic debates.Recently, I found myself bumping into Ms. Rand's ideals, through TV specials, etc. I decided it would be a good time to refresh my understainding of The Fountainhead. Ouch. I guess I was a bit naive when I read it the first time. Coming back to it now, after years of adult life experience (and exposure to a lot more literature), I found the characters hopelesly one dimensional; not evil, as some critics claim. Just horrendously shallow. And it's a shame becasue Ms. Rand fully understands the setting of the novel; the issues that reeally did polarize architecture back at that time. But her characters come of like .... pod people is the only phrase that keeps coming to mind."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The continuing praise heaped upon &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; as well as Rand's other tired novels is proof that intellectual sophistication is an endangered character trait, rapidly being eroded by a myopic, self-righteous population.Ostensibly an anthem for humanists, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; tells the parallel tale of two men. The first, Howard Roark, is a strong-willed individualistic genius architect who avoids any semblance of success for fear of compromising his personal integrity by selling out. The other is a sniveling toad for whom success, fame, wealth and material things mean more than any amount of pride or self respect. As expected, the pure-of-heart hero suffers for both his art and beliefs, while his soiled and foul counterpart reaps huge rewards at the expense of his soul.Unfortunately, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was ponderous, overly pretentious, transparent, preachy, self-indulgent and hollow. It is little more than a puffed-up facade of integrity and individuality complete with a whole bunch of really big words.The &quot;valiant&quot; fight waged by Howard Roark against the phillistines and ignoramuses of the world (who are just too pig-ignorant to appreciate his un-spotted art and talent) in this constipation causing opus probably serves as justification for those who believe that their own worth is unappreciated by the rest of society as a whole."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There is something about \\"Fountainhead\\" that irritated and disappointed me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really, more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?The only character who I think is very interesting, Gail Waynad - the man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht \\"I Do\\" because he does rule places and has a right to say so.2.5/5"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Once upon a time, in what now seems like a previous lifetime, I had an industrial-strength crush on an Ohio gal named, Amy. To this day, I cannot hear the 1975 hit song, 'AMIE' by the Cincinnati-based Country-Rock group, Pure Prairie League, without thinking of her. Amy was nice, intelligent, creative, attractive, and had a good sense of humor. I don't have to tell you just what a rare combination THAT is!In 1985, she gave me a copy of THE FOUNTAINHEAD as a birthday gift. On the inside cover she inscribed it : \\"To Stephen -- This book reminds me of you! It is the story of a man who holds his values high; who will never sell out or compromise. -- Of course he was never offered stadiums. Enjoy! Love, your friend forever, Amy.\\" (Didja notice the correct use of the semicolon? I told you she was smart! The reference to \\"stadiums\\" was an inside joke about Bruce Springsteen.)Amy eventually moved to Hawaii and over the years, I kind of lost touch with her. But in 1998, I sent her a (rather awkward) letter with the hope of reestablishing our friendship. I'm still waiting for her reply. Well, you know how slow that darn Postal Service can be sometimes! Meanwhile, I just finished reading THE FOUNTAINHEAD, and I now present my book review. (OK, I'm a slow reader, so shoot me!)From a strictly literary viewpoint, THE FOUNTAINHEAD is well conceived and executed. There are three principal skills that the novelist employs in storytelling : plotting, characterization, and dialogue (with the the last actually being an extension or subdivision of the second.) Very rare is the novelist who is a master of all three of these elements : for every Twain or Dickens there are thousands of writers who have their strengths and weaknesses in these areas. Ayn Rand is one of the thousands. But anybody who can get me to turn nearly 700 pages addressing that most exciting of all characters, the architect, must be doing something right. (My apologies to all of you architects out there. Only 'avin' a bit o' sport, I was. Please don't 'old it agin me!)In terms of plotting, the story takes a number of surprising and intriguing turns and these conflicts do keep the reader interested enough to continue following the development of the narration. \\"Wynand's voice sounded clear and brittle, like the color of the sky above them, with the same quality of ice-green radiance,\\" Rand writes in Part IV. Make no mistake about it, only genuine writers create lines like that. I do respect her talent as an author. Despite what she would like us to embrace, there are no completely likable characters in this story, and although each is well drawn, they exist primarily as opposing viewpoints in philosophical discourse. They are all interesting in their own right, but none are entirely believable. It is 'dialogue' which is Rand's weakest skill within the three elements of storytelling. The dialogue primarily serves (as the characters do) to debate and define a variety of viewpoints and therefore it is frequently stilted and exaggerated. While it's true that each character inhabits the same geographical location and most exist within the same general economic strata, there is not sufficient diversification in their language. They all seem to employ a kind of cool and coy linguistic style and too many of them tote the word \\"bromide\\" in their vocabulary satchel. Rand's book scores points in arguing for the value of an individual's commitment to personal vision and for free market enterprise, while exposing the rotting underbelly of collectivism and the apathy of society's \\"second-handers.\\" While certainly not essential reading, if one can overlook the extremes in her surprisingly superficial \\"manifesto\\", THE FOUNTAINHEAD is by and large, quality literature and a worthwhile read.But to review THE FOUNTAINHEAD primarily on its literary merits is to miss the point entirely, because the book is not really about architects at all, and the story was born only as a vehicle by which Ayn Rand might disseminate her philosophy of 'OBJECTIVISM.' Evidently, Rand believed herself to be history's greatest philosopher after Aristotle, and her baby, 'Objectivism', posits that the individual exclusively is real, objective, and the sole source of pure ethics. From this can be extrapolated the premise that sacrificing the \\"selfish\\" or \\"egotisitical\\" vision and quest for happiness of the individual on behalf of altrusim is to relinquish reality, and is self-destructive, hence, immoral. Individualism, cultivated through the \\"virtue of selfishness\\" (as she described it), is the singular path to life. Man's destiny, she believed, was to be a \\"self-made soul.\\"Ayn Rand wrote that \\"progressively, as my idea developed, I had more and more a sense of loneliness.\\" According to her biographer, Barbara Branden, when Rand's life was over, she had barely a friend in the world. Buried in 1982, her coffin bore a six-foot replica of the dollar sign. Professor Donald DeMarco has observed that \\"it was inevitable...that a philosophy that centered on the self to the exclusion of all others would leave its practitioner in isolation and intensely lonely.\\"In the introduction to my edition of THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand makes much of the atheism shared by herself and Howard Roark, her protagonist. She charges religion with having \\"pre-empted the field of ethics, turning morality AGAINST man\\" and identifies \\"the sense of life dramatized in THE FOUNTAINHEAD as MAN-WORSHIP.\\" This explains Howard Roark's response of \\"because I've never believed in God\\" to the question \\"why did you decide to be an architect?\\"In likening the sublime style of his integrated architecture to the beauty of the human body, Roark concedes that it \\"hasn't a single muscle which doesn't serve its purpose; that there's not a line wasted; that every detail of it fits one idea, the idea of a man and the life of a man.\\" If someone asked Roark whether one of his ingeniously designed buildings could have come into existence apart from its \\"creator\\" - that being his mind which conceived it - I have to believe that he'd answer, \\"Nonsense.\\" And yet this artist would have us believe that the physiology of the human being - at least a trillion times more intricate and integrated than his most unified architetctural achievement - coalesced as a result of countless random mutations within a primordial ooze over several million years in the happy accident of an environment perfectly suited to \\"life.\\" Sorry, but I can't travel on this train-of-thought.When the celebrated naturalist and noble abolitionist, Henry David Thoreau was not splashing in clear crystal streams and sniffing dogwood blossoms, he was recording insightful details about human nature. He found common ground with Rand and her Roark in the humorous statement, \\"Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new.\\" But he eclipsed them both by an unfathomable scope when he advised, \\"Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory.\\"There was another Philosopher who espoused a world-view diametrically opposed to Rand's OBJECTIVISM. And coincidentally, He once referred to himself in architectural terminology : \\"The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone\\", meaning that He and His principles were someday destined to be recognized as the foundation of mankind's true and eternal happiness.This Philosopher, the \\"Cornerstone\\", considered Himself a servant, having subjugated His will to the preferences of His Father. The greatest among us, He said, would be a servant to all, and only in losing our PERCEIVED \\"life\\" would we find our REAL Life.What if the fundamental anthropological postulation of Howard Roark is faulty? What if each \\"ego\\" is not actually an individuated entity but a visible appendage of an unseen organism? The Cornerstone cautioned us against judging \\"according to appearance\\", because like visible fingers on an otherwise invisible spiritual Hand, ONENESS is the truth that undergirds our experiences. The Cornerstone taught that we are members of ONE Body. Consequently, a person could theoretically maintain that two fingers applying salve and a bandage to a wounded finger on the opposing hand practices not only altruism, but Roark's extolled \\"selfishness\\", because what benefits another appendage benefits the whole body and thus, ALL of its members!Unlike Ayn Rand, the Cornerstone was never lonely; He was constantly thronged by the masses, and still today His Life and philosophy is celebrated by millions of people the world over. And there was no dollar sign replicated on HIS casket, in fact, He has no grave for His followers to venerate because the truth is. . . .He didn't stay in it very long. Hopefully, you realized numerous sentences back that the \\"Philosopher\\" to whom I refer is Jesus.OK, so in the final analysis, what? Look, in a nutshell, all I'm really trying to say here is this : be skeptical of the woman who uses the word \\"forever\\" in professing her feelings of friendship and admiration for you. Whereas by \\"forever\\" you may think that she means \\"eternally\\", my experience shows that her definition of the word may be closer to \\"ten years.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Of this epic paean of meta-fiction on the fount of American genius so many captains of industry, former chairmen of the Fed (Greenspan), Supreme Court judges, past Presidents, bankers and narcissistic members of Congress perpetually and ardently sing unbounded praise of Ayn Rand, which leads me only to shrug. Her objectivism and philosophical diatribes about the heroic American individualist brought me back to college days and the philosophy of Nietzsche, so adored by Hitler, on the \\"exceptionalism\\" of the \\"higher man.\\" To Rand's credit there is much to admire in her penchant for \\"self-reliance\\" reminiscent of Emerson and Thoreau in her voluminous tome. I understand that Rand suffered in Russia as her father's business was nationalized for the socialist collective agenda, leaving her family destitute. Her arrival in America brought her global fame for her prolific and widely read novels, which vastly enriched her and, thereby, rendered her a wealthy member of America's elite. I understand that her worldview emerges confidently from the crucible of her personal experience that she defends so breathlessly over 726 pages. Rand believes that American capitalism is the last refuge of the self-interested genius, which brilliance is a fount leaving the rugged individual as exceptional and drives the engine of progress in America. She would ardently defend Gordon Gekko's \\"Greed is good.\\" She would defend the billionaire Koch brothers' invitation of Supreme Court Judge, Clarence Thomas, to a lavish retreat prior to the Supreme Court's decision to allow corporations to contribute anonymously and be treated like human beings to fund political action committees without limits to breed self-interest on the part of corporations and our wealthiest citizens. She would defend John Boehner and Mitch McConnell's commitment to extend tax breaks to the top 1% of America's wealthiest individuals on the backs of school lunch subsidies for children, heating oil support for the snowbound destitute during frigid winters, relief for homeowners undergoing unjust foreclosure and unemployment extensions for the jobless whose jobs have been outsourced offshore through corporate tax breaks for this practice. Rand believes firmly that altruism is truly a sucker's game. Why? Because exceptionalism brings entitlement and entitlement merits exceptional treatment, even sacrifice, by society. Heroic individuals should \\"tend their own gardens,\\" as Voltaire advised, and let the rest of humanity fend for itself. So here's my quandry: why in God's name is a genius American rugged individualist less heroic or diminished by one iota because of his or her altruism? Isn't Bill Gates even more heroic because, with all of his wealth and genius, he wants to eradicate malaria from the African continent to \\"second-handers\\"? Ditto for Bono. The list of wealthy and heroic American rugged individualists is long and distinguished. But Rand's philosophy is embraced by every lobbyist on K Street as well as egomaniacal past Presidents, their advisors and their colleagues in Washington's National Museum of Egomania. Does anyone who admires Rand's heroic narcissism remember the Messiah riding humbly into Jerusalem barefoot on the back of a donkey? Is humility not a reliable marker of real genius? How can so many wealthy Christians and Jews abandon the frequent calls of Scripture to help their fellow humanity so often downcast at the hands of exceptionalists? When Solomon prayed for what he wanted most, his response was to pray for wisdom rather than wealth. So Rand's objectivism begs this question: what responsibility does a wealthy exceptionalist owe to humanity less endowed with the gift of genius and grace of fortune? Do these Randy exceptionalists not understand that bad luck alone can leave anyone destitute at any time by virtue of lawsuit, market crashes and depressions, dread disease, acts of God, business reversal and a litany of other garden variety uncontrolled catastrophes? Business and history is replete with rugged individualists whose endowments have become suddenly bankrupt by tragic flaws acting upon epic bad luck. I eschew the model Rand has in mind for American capitalism because the exceptionalists render the rest of humanity mad, suffering and bewildered by the mind-numbing greed that is so prevalently promoted among exceptionalists in power in government and industry in our great nation. Let those who have eyes to see and ears to listen behold the vain self-interest and boundless greed run rampant among American government and business. Rand's brand of heroic, rugged individualism ultimately may well bring with its mindless proliferation the untimely demise of our great Republic."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of my favorite books, right up there with 1984 and Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The man, Howard Roark, is not just the hero of the book, but he is the embodiment of who we all are, probably, when we begin on life's journey. This is not just a statement of individualism. I could paint my hair green and carry a toaster with me everywhere I went if I wanted to be an individual. It is about integrity. It is about not being able to be moved, by anyone's might or power, not even your own. It is about doing what's right, regardless of who opposes.THIS BOOK IS NOT A LOVE STORY, though that aspect of the story makes it more bearable and interesting. Furthermore, to clarify the misjudgements about Dominique's character, she does not like masochism. She gives herself to these men she doesn't love as an act of punishment to herself and comtemptment spawned from her own acceptance of things she knows to be wrong. She has left her first and true love: integrity. That is why she enjoys being mistreated. That is also why she loves Howard Roark. It's also why she tries to destroy him, because his work is not fit to be viewed by a public who doesn't appreciate the majesty and perfection in it. His work is a glorification of life and the elements we are to sustain life with. Other people in the story try to pervert it, and destroy it with non-appreciation. This is what Dominique tries to protect him from by trying to destroy his career as an architect.Howard Roark is someone we all wish to be, and Gail Wynand is someone most of us have probably turned into. This book gives you courage to be who you want, but more importantly, who you CAN be. Roark was not crazy about eating in soup kitchens, but he did it in spite of a desire he might have had to be wealthy. He did it because he wanted to be Righteous more than he wanted a full stomach. Being righteous is just more glorified than being rich. (Wonderfully, he gets both as he deserves.) You could say that he exhibits the same personality trait of Joan of Arc. Living was not worth his life, if he wasn't true. What an ideal and beautiful way to exist! Which was also the reason he was so passionately hated, as some hate this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Truthfully, when I opened this book, I had no idea what toexpect. I had heard Ayn Rand and history of writing revolutionary and radical themes, but nothing can really prepareyou for what this story has to offer. The idea is some whatcontroversial and will either cause the reader to love it or hate it. Personally, I whink this book is masterpiece, otherwiseit wouldn't have lasted all these years without being forgotten like so many other empty and pointless pieces of literature. It is simply a Story of the Glory of Man and shouldn't be critized for any other reason.The pertinent characters, Howard Raork, Peter Keatings, Ellsworth Toohey and Domonique are like no characters you will ever read about. Despite there somewhat cold and strange mannertowards life, you can't help but feel fascination towards thesepeople. They are the extremes of the human nature portrayed insingle individuals and show the reader what human are truly capable of, whether beatiful or truly disgusting. Out of thesecharacters, one by the name of Howard Roark shines through.He is the one who symbolizes the glory of human acheivment and how we reached it. This is what the story attempts to and succeeds in portraying. I actually feel sorry for peoplewho criticize this book becasue they believe characters are cold or the portrayal of love is sick and inaccurate. First of all, Nothing is inaccurate about this book, it's human nature at it's darkest. Secondly this book wasn't written to please people butto portray a theme about society.All I say is give this book a try. If you make it throughthe first chapter, then you won't be able to put it down. If you don't without hating it, then don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The first thing I must say about the Fountainhead is I found it utterly brilliant. That said, I must tell future readers that it is one of the densest books I have ever read. This is a good thing though, and anyone who likes to think should read this book (I hope those of you looking to buy this book can actually think for yourself). The secret to the success of the Fountainhead is that it shows Howard Roark not as perfect, but as ideal in not being perfect. He is ultimately stubborn, unemotional, but driven by the desire to create, the desire to achieve greatness for the sake of its own creation, not for the artificial enjoyment of others.The Fountainhead is about the extremes of society. Everyone can picture a man like Ellsworth Toohey, but few have actually seen one. Howard Roark is a character that no one will comprehend, because his greatest strength is that he does not feel the need to make himself understandable. He is what he stands for, and that is all. Ayn Rand uses this book to champion the individual, to show that it is not the follower who achieves true success, but the creator who refuses to compromise his ideals. He expects nothing from anyone, but still works because his work is important to him. Ultimately, Ayn Rand is an extremist whose ideas are very controversial simply for that reason. She does not see the other side, and believes that her ideas are correct, and that the other side is ultimately wrong because of it. What you must understand with this book is that its extreme point of view leads to its power, but that you have to make sure and realize what it is that she is saying. It is something that no person can accomplish, and that is why Howard Roark is a model for mankind. No one can be Howard Roark, but we can encompass bits of his philosophy into ours.This book will confuse you, torture you, but ultimately leave you feeling fulfilled and full of ideas. That is all you can ask from it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I know it is against everything Ayn Rand stands for by writing this review, but I will do it anyway. Her works were written solely for her own sense of achievement and for no other reason. Thus, the theme of her writings is finding the greater good in the man who can throw all opinions and criticisms of his actions aside and achieve only for himslef in a completely selfish manner.This particular novel centers around the cultural arts, primarily architecture, and one man's struggle to break the mold of traditional designs. This man is Howard Roark. He is Rand's ideal man. He designs and builds only for his own ego and the satisfaction of having done it himself.But, the novel was so much more than that. It outlines Rand's overall lack of respect for compassion and selflessness. She, as do I, beleives in a world where all mankind must make do for themselves. Man is to survive solely on his entrepreneurial insticts and his inner spirit. All the obstacles that are thrown in front of man on his way to achievement must be overcome only by strict resolve and determination, not by conforming.I enjoyed this book. Yes, it was lengthy. Yes, it was difficult to stick with at times. I'd like to give no rating in honor of Ayn Rand and that it should not matter what I think, or write about the book, but since I have to, it's a Four Star.I would recommend Atlas Shrugged in addition to those who enjoyed this book, or in favor of The Fountainhead as an intro to readers who have not yet been blessed with the writings of Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Having read this book several times, I always enjoy the excellent writing, nuanced characters and great plot. All of the characters are very interesting, nuanced and complicated. You'll cheer for Howard Roark as he masters his art and his struggle to understand the world around him. You'll wonder if Dominque Francon will learn that the evil of the world isn't \\"Satan with a sword but a lout on a stool.\\" You'll watch in horror as Peter Keating as he sells off piece by piece of his soul and Gail Wyland, the powerful newspaper magnate, learns the price for all of his power. As courageously as Steve Mallory and Austin Heller try to save their world from evil, you'll be bewildered by Alvah Scralet's cluelessness. An lastly, the cunning, conniving Ellsworth Toohey - what a great villain. May look like a plucked chicken but he makes taking over the world seem as easy as signing your name. Watch how he destroys people, corrupts the government, levels great art work into dust and strives to take over Gail Wyland's empire but is he any match for Howard? You'll have to read the book to find out.Of course, there are Mrs. Rand's ideas. Agree with them or not this book will entertain as it provides food for thought and loads of topics for conversation."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When Ayn Rand wrote, her primary purpose was to depict her vision of the perfect human. She wanted to show a man who exhibited the ideals of her philosophy, Objectivism. In her beliefs, Ayn Rand stresses the importance of individualism, reason, integrity, and selfishness. To exemplify these traits, she created Howard Roark, her projection of the ideal man, in her novel The Fountainhead.Roark represents man as he should and ought to be. His depiction is something toward which I will strive every day. Fully independent, needing no reason other than his own, Howard is perfection incarnate. He lives his life exactly as he sees fit; he will not sacrifice himself for the cause of another, nor will he live by any moral code or standard other than his own. He does not compromise with evil, because it is only evil that can benefit from the sacrifice of the good. He is a man with ability, and uses it to produce great work in architecture. He does so with integrity; he refuses to build when customers demand that he change his design for the sake of pleasing traditionalists. I found myself excited as I read about this intransigent man who refuses to compromise, and I silently cheered as he won a trial with the world against him by using his own reason as his only defense. The novel itself illustrates man as a heroic being, and ends with Roark standing alone atop the world's tallest building, a building that he built. His triumph was mine, and I strive to live that life every day, a life where humanity exists as it was meant to exist.Read this book. If nothing else, it will at least present you with another view on how life ought to be. Rand's words and views are more popular today than they were more than fifty years ago when The Fountainhead was published. Politically, I am a libertarian. Nearly every other libertarian that I know finds a lot in common with Objectivism. I will end with my favorite quotation from the novel. The primary villain, Toohey, asks Howard one night for an honest opinion of him; he wants to know what Roark thinks of him. Howard simply says, \\"I don't think of you,\\" and walks away."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ms. Rand has created a wonderful novel in The Fountainhead. Its a beautiful symphony of a struggle of a man facing the beliefs of a modern world while still standing by his own ideals. Howard Roark is a man who mankind should take after. I really dont know how to put it, but he is everything that most people aren't.Throughout the book, Howard's strengths are enveloped with drastic comparison (if thats what you would call it) with his &quot;friend&quot; Peter Keating. Peter will do what ever his client wants from him as a young architect and he has done everything in his power to make sure that he succeeds, even at the price of others. Howard on the other hand will not sacrifice what be believes in, and thats what brings him down.Howard loved the work of the architect Henry Cameron, and when he was expelled from art school by not making traditional Gothic or Greek homes, he went strait to work for Henry Cameron. Cameron was a once famous architect who believed that whatever has been done in the past, should never be done again, so he designed totally modernistic structures. This came under much scrutiny and praise as he was called &quot;untraditional.&quot; He was eventually destroyed because &quot;Men hate passion, any great passion. Henry Cameron made a mistake: he loved his work. That was why he lost.&quot;When Howard applied the same principals, people werent sure what to think, and he reclined great comissions for the most wealthiest people. However, man didnt see his great line of ideals and he was labeled as an egotist, and people set out to destroy him.As the story progresses, we see Howard as a man who doesnt hate. He cant particularily, but he does have his beliefs. And that is what makes this book wonderful. The entire story is philosophical, and it becomes slightly overwhelming at times, but Ms. Rand makes a wonderful story of it. The story ends in a dramtic climax at a trial where Howard testifys everything he believes in. He brings up the case of Altruist vs. Egotist. An egotist is one who gives up others for self. He creates, and is a creator, he made the wheel and everything else that has allowed the others to succeed. An altruist is a person who gives up self for others. He is the parasite, and doesnt use his brain, he punishes the egotist for making that wheel, and then uses it himself for personal gain.Again, this book really broadened my outlook upon society. I have been quite interested in philosophy and this book really helped me see what man can be like. This is one of my favorite books of all time and i highly recommend it. The afterword is also quite interesting, before or after you start reading of the book. I loved this book and its highly recommended to all who can actually read the 700+ pages without being frightened."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There is so much in this book that will make you think in ways you have never thought. At first I didn't think I would make it, it's a long book, but once you're into it there is no turning back you are just overpowered by the strength of the characters and the ideas expressed so perfectly through them. I was constantly thinking about myself and those around me as I read this book. It's characters are so real and so awesome. And the dialogue is the best ever written in any book I've read. The dialogue is both smart, funny, brilliant and touching. By the end you are just exhausted and at the same time you feel free. I think that this book if for anyone who is looking for answers to life and looking for a way to live in this cruel world. This book will show you that it's possible to be creative and to survive and to win the greatest battles. This book is for the dreamer and I highly recommend it. But at the same time I understand why there are those who don't like it or understand it. This novel isn't for everyone, in fact it could be pretty painful for some people to read, because some people will find themselves in the worst characters in the book. This book is a harsh lesson in survival, that might be too much for some readers. But it's worth it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"you know those college essays that ask you to name the book/person/event that changed your life? i would honestly write that essay about this book. It forced me to reevaluate everything i knew: about me, my strength and worth as a person, my society, my values, and on and on. After reading the Fountainhead I felt i had a better sense of who i am and what's important- i strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in self discovery or just a thought provoking novel. in addition, it is superbly and cleverly written, and the least astute of readers will understand Rand's cry to take up the standard of independence and shun the falseness of society. read this book, it conveys the message so much better than i can."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"For starters: ignore the morons who call the characters too idealistic, too one sided, etc. That's the whole point. This novel is a clear cut expression of philosophy. Dont expect to find well balanced characters. The characters are purposely polar and exaggerated.Now...Despite the philosophical themes, I enjoyed this novel greatly. It has humor if you know where to look (for instance the check exchange between Keating and Roark). I cant stop reading it. The story is fast paced and contains very few boring bumps, unlike most novels. The story is almost entirely allegorical. I love finding a meaning behind almost every dialogue and description.5/5 Read this book!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"after finishing my M.A in Political Science and reading philosophycal essays by renowned Men (and Women) of wisdom from Plato to Rolles, from Checov to Kafka, I have never met such a well written, profound challenge to my point of view over a wide array of issues both on a global level and a personal one. The Main character, Ruark, is an unprecedented both in the character bulidup (amazing writing) and the encounters follwed by relationship he has with many of the other characters in the book. Moreover, he is THE symbol of individualism and makes you think twice of the negative manner withwhich the word &quot;selfish&quot; is often viewd by. In conclusion, the questions aroused by this brilliant novel are to be taken seriosly. Hence, read the book carefully and pay attention to every detail. I promise that if you'll do so, your name will be on the site as one of this books finest critiques, as it happened to me. P.S, this &quot;nutshell&quot; review can not even begin to describe the immense power of the Novel"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is one of the greatest novels in world literature, tells of the desperate battle waged by architect Howard Roark, whose genius and integrity were as unyielding as granite.... Of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately but married his worst enemy.... Of fanatic hatred and denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great innovator. It poses one of the most challenging ideas ever presented in a work of fiction- that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress. Nearly 60 years ago, the book created a public furor and a worldwide interest in its brilliant author. It is the story of a gifted young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive affair with a beautiful woman who struggled to defeat him. Ayn Rand's daringly original philosophy, Objectivism presented through this book is indeed most ingenious and radical ideas ever provided in modern literature. It tells the story of what an ideal man should be befittingly epitomized by Roark, who is dismissed from a premier college due to his non-conformist work, who has to face myriad barricades posed by the 'Moral Watch-Dogs' of the society, who conquers all odds and shows the world that second-hand knowledge is worthless- that a man should manifest some originality in his life so that unfathomable progress of mankind transpires, leading to a brave new world. The character of Peter Keating describes the man who borrows intelligence from repository, and wins people's hearts by his relentless sycophancy- only to lose his soul in the bargain. The novel explicates Gail Wynand the opulent &amp; omnipotent Newspaper Baron as the 'man who might have been'- who is in the fallacious belief that he controls the whole world, but realizes that he can manipulate men only as long he satisfies their desires. And finally the enduring character of Ellsworth Toohey as 'the man who can never be'-noted economist, noted social worker, noted-everything, who caters to the people's desideratum and exploits it to his advantage and nearly succeeds in becoming the undisputed ruler of the world. The novel tackles the interminable problem of the world's vilipend of an innovator's new creation- right from fire to the wheel. Against such Machiavellian actions, Rand advocates 'Selfishness' as the only weapon that can save originality from total destruction. By and large the best novel written to date! A celebration of human heroism and glory."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I too had to read this book for a scholarship. I'm saddened as to how other youths will probably buy into such a tragically flawed philosophy. Too many misunderstood young genuises will compare themselves to Roark. They will repress emotions because they are believed to be Reasonable. They're lives will end the same as Rand's: Tragic, pathetic, and alone. Nathaniel Branden said of the Fountainhead: &quot;Take the Fountainhead and the first chapter for example. Consider these facts: The hero has just been expelled from school, he is the victim of injustice, he is misunderstood by virtually everyone, and he himself tends to find other people puzzling and incomprehensible. He is alone; he has no friends. There is no one with whom he can share his inner life or values. So far, with the possible exception of being expelled from school, this could be a fairly accurate description of the state of the overwhelming majority of adolescents. There is one big difference: Howard Roark gives no indication of being bothered by any of it. He is serenely happy within himself. For average teenagers, this condition is agony.&quot; This is its youthful appeal. The objectivists philosophy is too simplistic and uncaring. So social Darwinistic. The characters are noble and true to their emotions because society is against them, but in a society in which everyone becomes an objectivists these heros will become the oppressors.The protagonists (Dominique &amp; Howard) are too ideological. The villans are strawmen. The message is conveyed in a substandard way, it is far too preachy.I love the way how the Rand institute is giving out college money to get converts. 59,000 dollars in prizes is a very small price to pay.I highly suggest reading all the reviews, about midway through someone does a great satire of the story."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I must admit, when a friend said I should read this book, I was a bit hesitant. The book was kind of on the thick side, the cover was uninspiring, the name The Fountainhead? What was that? And I've never heard of Ayn Rand before. I opened the book and expected to be bored, the first few paragraphs were full of descriptions and I wondered how the hell I was going to finish it. Boy, was I wrong. They say never judge a book by it's cover. Don't.. judge this one.This book is about a man called Howard Rouark, an architect by birth. A man with vision and a gift a world was not ready for. It is a story of a struggle of a man who knew what he was born for, and it is not only his struggle. It is a human struggle, all the good and bad elements that make us what we are and what we will become. I won't fool you and say it doesn't open a whole new world of thought, you have to discover and recognize that for yourself. But I guarantee that you can not finish this book and not see the world differently.Just make sure when you are through, you can get your hands on a copy of Atlas Shrugged"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Perhaps a few hundred years from now, critics , students and teachers of history and literature will recount this book with great passion and the effect that it had on the people of the 20th century who read it.The Book sets out to prove a single point and in the authors own words it is: &quot;Man's Ego is the Fountainhead of Human Progress&quot;.A Man who stands for himself and what he beleives in usually stands alone. That is the way to live, the reason for creation and the only human morality. Ayn Rand in this book defines the true meaning of human ego and what it takes to be a true egotist. A good thing &quot;ego&quot;, not a bad one.I for one is someone who has read the book and for the most part beleive in it's presentation, conclusion and application of the ideas presented in the book in real life.Whether or not you fully agree with the principles presented in the book, it is a must read if you fulfill one criteria.. you must be a human"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Why did Ayn Rand write this book? That's a fair question to pose of any author, but with this particular author and with this particular book, it's an essential question. Was the purpose of the book its entertainment value, which is substantial, or was it to serve as a platform for objectivism, the philosophy prevalent throughout the book?My personal feelings are it's probably about a 60/40 ratio with the bulk on the side of the philosophy. She makes such an effort to separate her main character, Howard Roark, from the rest of mankind and to show his lack of concern for anything outside of his own individual motivations, that he appears at times to be a little two dimensional. How else then could he hope to find happiness in his personal life except with a woman who is equally as unconcerned with rest of humanity as he is? While one bounces from one unfulfilling relationship to another, the other appears determined to destroy his own career in the pursuit of uncompromising ownership of the creative process. Still, you root for the hero and hold tight to the hope that substance and raw talent will win out over style and high society. But you're a cheering section of one, because not even the main character cares enough to join in.The Fountainhead has substantial entertainment value however. Ayn Rand is a master of the descriptive scene as she focuses your attention to the most minute details such as the arch of Dominique's back in order to portray an atmosphere in a scene. In many cases, you may feel as though you're viewing a performance on stage rather than reading a book.So, which is it? Entertainment or a thought-provoking examination? A little of both probably. I mean, isn't that what most great books offer?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead is excellent when it remains in the realm of fiction - however, you will find The Fountainhead is much more than a work of fiction. Rand does not seek to trick you at any point in the novel; this is clearly a vehicle demonstrating ideas found in her philosophy Objectivism.Consider the following conversation on page 22 with her self described \\"can do no wrong\\", \\"human as humans should be\\" messiah figure Howard Roark and the dean of Stanton university, whom has just expelled Roark for having refusing to create imitations of \\"classic\\" architechture.The dean says \\"You must learn to understand... everything beautiful in architechture has been done already. We can only treasure the past. Who are we to improve upon them? We can only attempt, respectfully, to repeat.\\" The entire conversation was so one-sided that you have no choice but to agree with Roark in denying the dean's statement. By page 22 half of Rands message (that will be emphasized countless times in the coming 700 pages) is delivered. Howard Roark does not compromise his ideals, and he listens to his own judgement, as everyone should.Although the message is easy to decipher, it is the writing in which it is conveyed which makes The Fountainhead such a great novel. The descriptions are vivid, the charecters interesting, and the plot surprisingly fast paced considering it spans two decades and 700 pages. If nothing else, Rand knows how to tell a story, and tell it well. The book is simply captivating, despite some unneccesary dialogue and a few rough patches in the plot. Whether you agree with the philosophy behind it or not, you will enjoy The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is my favorite book that I own. I bought it last year after I read Atlas Shrugged, which was originally for a paper in AP Lit, but I gave that up and read it out of interest. I prefer this one though, as is shown by its cover -- I have read it so many times the cover is bent and torn, something that rarely happens to my books.This book actually expresses alot of what I feel, and I think it is wonderfully written. I suggest everybody read it, it should be a requirement for adulthood, it is just that good. I am practically speechless when trying to explain how much this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead is a story about one man's (Howard Roark, architect) struggle to maintain the integrity of his work and self against a society that tries to destroy him and his accomplishments by subscribing to a collective mentality of so-called altruism and selflessness. Roark pays again and again for his unyielding honesty and refusal to compromise. In time, he is sided with two allies who struggle with Roark until he is vindicated by his courage and truth. Rand's strong command of the English language allows for a story with characters whose dialogs waste no words in conveying their points. In his final trial, Howard Roark stands true to his self against a community ready to convict. In the end, Roark prevails through his brilliant self-representation, which defines the heart of Roark's (and Rand's) basic philosophy about individualism, courage and freedom. Fountainhead is not just about Roark's struggle to maintain his integrity, rather it is Ayn Rand's implicit message about individualism versus collectivism and innovators versus second-handers.Fountainhead is a long read but interesting through-and-through. This is a gripping story well worth the time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"All right the first time I read this book I hated it. I loathed every stone that Ann Rand had ever walked on and this continued for some time. Thinking about it and eventualy reading again I realized why I hated the book. It was not something in its pages it was something in me. I laugh when I think about it now that this book which I so hated could have been such a fulcrum to change my view of the world. Any book that forces you to view the world with different eyes is worth 5 stars many times over."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is a book that has changed my life by changing the ways I view others. It's very hard not to categorize people as Howard Roark's and Peter Keating's after reading this book. I love all of the political ideologies, and her philosophy of Objectivism is very clear and unambiguous throughout the novel. I think it is much easier to understand what Objectivism really is after reading this book because it gives you real, human examples. I also love the \\"love story\\" between Roark and Monique and how their whole relationship is built on hurt and tension. Another thing I have also learned is that no one is really a true Howard Roark or Ellsworth Toohey, most people are just like Peter Keating. But, I think in our country today we need someone like Howard Roark to do what's best and stop caring what everyone thinks. I would recommend this book to anyone and it will definitely leave you thinking about the world and people once you are done reading it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a nice introduction to Rand's views I think for those who don't have the will to finish the significantly larger work of hers... Atlas Shrugged. It seems long enough that people should be able to fairly easily gain an understanding of what she's about, although I really think that if possible people should probably go for Atlas Shrugged first.Both are certainly classics and should be read by anyone seeking a greater understanding of life, philosophy, and politics. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In the Fountainhead, Ayn Rand presents her philosophy of objectivism told through the lives of her characters. The protagonist is architect Howard Roark who portrays the epitome of the heroic individual standing against mediocrity. The villain is media figure Ellsworth Toohey who is known for raising up what is insignificant and tearing down what is excellent. Don't be surprised if many of the events and dialogue in this book rings true in regard to current events.I read Atlas Shrugged before Fountainhead and found Atlas Shrugged to be much more compelling and a better presentation of Rand's philosophy. Fountainhead is still worth reading but is not quite as good."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My top 10 favorite books of all time... once you start, you can't put it down. It took me about 3 days to read it and there were times when I spent an hour just thinking about one paragraph... very eloquently written. It's one of those HAVE TO read books in your lifetime. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book felt thick at first and I was concerned that I would soon tire of it, as I did with Dickens' Pickwick Papers. But Rand proved to be successful at engaging my mind and heart. I felt anger at the way merit was disregarded and hollow, \\"shell\\" echoes of old ideas were taken up by the masses. After I put down the book one part still brings me to deep thought. A woman has thrown herself into the world of charity and humanitarian efforts. Rand asks however, what good are such efforts for the individual if that individual ends up denying the self? Such apparently altruistic actions might actually cause one to lose oneself, and such blindly selfless individuals risk missing one's calling in life. The ending didn't make sense to me, and I'm still puzzled by it. However, Rand somehow makes me more curious than confused about the way the book ended. In short, Rand was able to emotionally and intellectually engage the reviewer. This is the kind of book that is worth buying, because more intellectual insights remain to be uncovered in the second reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I had been meaning to read it for some time, and in the barracks I was staying in (I am a reservist called back to active duty in the army) I found it in a locker. I immediately read it and liked it so much I purchased several of Rand's other books.The premise of the story is one man's unwillingness to compromise his work for the tastes of the general public. He would not conform, and he would not waver in his beliefs, regardless of the personal and professional set backs they caused him. He was an architect and created buildings of a type that had never been seen before. The \\"masses\\" didn't know how to take the radical new design and they waited for the critics to tell them what to think. What results from this is actually the more interesting story, that of the antagonist Ellsworth Toohey, a very cunning, dignified man who undertook as his mission in life controlling the thought of the people.Unlike Atlas Shrugged, the characters here have a considerable amount of depth and complexities. Rand dedicates ample space defining the characters and giving you an insight into previous life changing events, which is something she neglected to do in Atlas Shrugged. No character is pure of either defects or attributes. This makes for very intriguing story.One draw back, as outlined by previous reviewers, is the unlikely conversations held between the characters, or \\"speeches\\" as one reviewer put it. But, as in all of Rand's fiction writing, the story is a mere means to the end, and in this case the end is a homage to the power and creativity of the individual. There may be a way to have expressed it in witty banter between characters, but I am not sure it would exhibit Rand's points more clearly.Overall, it was a very enjoyable book, both for the philosophies it expounded and for the story itself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is almost as interesting to absorb the responses of readers to this text as it is to absorb the text itself. Almost invariably, they fall into two camps: those for whom a weight is lifted and a hateful thing is explained, and those for whom the truth of the text is so unbearable that they feel compelled to somehow diminish its relevance. Therefore, though I think The Fountainhead is one of the most important works of fiction ever written in the English language, I do not necessarily recommend it to others. However, I will say that if you decide to read the text, you will almost certainly receive it with either the relief Ayn Rand writes about in her 25th anniversary introduction when she says that a rare few people will recognize Howard Roark and his struggle, and it is to them that she addresses her work, or you will receive it with the desperation of Peter Keating to justify his existence and his choices.If you are in the former camp, then I salute you. If you are in the latter, I invite you to read the rest of Ayn Rands aforementioned introduction and continue to freely offer your opinions about the text, so that I might recognize you by your words."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is Ayn Rand's greatest novel, and in my opinion the greatest American novel as well, surpassed only by the likes of Dumas' Count of Monte Cristo.It is the story of a man struggling to survive on his own terms, without compromise. Howard Roark, an architect, wishes only to design buildings that are beautifully functional. But he is thwarted at every turn by an establishment that views adherence to worn out traditions, and mediocrity by concensus, as the only acceptable course of action. He fights back with hard work and argument, and ultimately triumphs as a romantic hero should.The Fountainhead is also a philosophical justification of rational selfishness. Rand understood better than anyone how our culture has perverted the concept of selfishness until it was stripped of all real meaning. In the Fountainhead she will make you see this concept without the tainted lens that we are all taught to view it with. Agree with her philosophy or no, it is radically different than anything else forced down our throats via modern education.The only flaw in Rand's masterpiece is the character of Dominique. Dominique is too abstract, and her inner struggle is unrealistic. Dominique is more idea than character, and while she works as an idea, some of her actions are simply unbelievable. But read it for yourself, and see if you concur..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many people constantly compromise their most precious gifts in life in order to satisfy the wishes of the majority. In this story Rand reminds us that the only way one can come to greatness is if they first fight the masses. In order for something to be great, it must have at least a grain of originality. Forget the objective philosophy and see this book for what it is, a great story which recognizes the need for humanity to stand up for their beliefs and for their gifts. Many of Rand's philosophies are incorporated through this theme, but there are major flaws in my opinion with the belief that all greatness comes from pure egotists. No one is a pure egotist and no one is a pure altruist. Pure and simple, this is a great story that uses paradoxical characters who are so simple but appear very complex. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand has written a troubling, thought-provoking work. The novel is troubling in the sense that it skillfully and beautifully portrays the virtues of a philosophy of the self. Though I can't say that I subscribe to the notion that the great society is one dominated by individuals who are entirely (and exclusively) self-interested, I do believe that there is much truth to be found here.For instance, the novel invites the reader to consider the relationship between his state of mind, the society in which he lives, and his own self-knowledge. I wholeheartedly agree with Rand that one must be an individual, that one must be more than the thoughts, the expectations, and the opinions of others. Rand's illustration of the importance of self-knowledge is magnificent, and seems to be more relevant now than ever before.To those intereseted in additional readings on moral philosophy, I highly recommend Personal Destinies by David Norton."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"also the Koran, the New Testament and the Bhagavad Gita in one book"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After many years reading Ayn Rand's work -- both fictional and philosophical -- and sincerely trying to understand why so many people find her philosophy of selfishness to be &quot;the answer,&quot; I have finally come to believe that these people who claim to value &quot;reason&quot; are either seriously misguided, or just plain evil. Ms. Rand, quite clearly, falls into the latter camp. She promoted selfishness because she knew it would make her a goddess figure among people desparate to latch onto a philosophy to justify their pursuit of the most base impulses of self-indulgence, and to allow them to continue to avoid the genuinely human practice of compassion. I am not a religious person, but it seems unavoidably significant that every religious or moral system in the world recognizes the virtue of helping those in need, with one glaring exception: the moral system promoted in this book. That, to me, is pretty good evidence that this philosophy is evil.(Note: I am remaining anonymous not because I do not wish to engage in thoughtful dialogue over this book and philosophy, but to avoid hate mail from the many hateful people who espouse Objectivism.)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The &quot;To be Fairs&quot;- I was unable to bring myself to actually finish this book.- I don't know anything about architecture.- I don't know much about the general attitudes towards non-conformity at the time the book was written, as I was not yet born.That much said, I found this book to be dreadful.I feel that I can generally overlook my personal feelings on a given &quot;philosopy&quot; and appreciate the depth of thought that another person has put into his/her ideals. I simply found Ms. Rand to have a sophmoric lack of depth.The template Rand used to exemplify her philosophy was architecture. I found it insulting that Rand expects her readers to accept classical architecture as inherently evil simply because it is aestheticly pleasing to most people (popular). &quot;What's popular is not always right&quot;, but this is a bit extreme. I realize architecture is not the beginning and end of Rand's Objectivism; I think only that she could have used a basis for argument that is (ouch) a bit MORE controversial (after all, her philosophy is controversial in the extreme- why not go for the gusto??).The main character, Roark is repugnantly unlikeable (I won't hash into this subject as it has been well addressed in other reviews). Which makes the book difficult to read. Those who are obstinant for the sake of obstinance alone (teenagers mostly) may identify more with Roark and find this book to be &quot;profound&quot;. Well good for them, everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion ( : )Tee hee).My advice is this: If you want to read philosophy on individualism through thought and self-discovery, read Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. If you want to know what self-serving behavior REALLY is (objectively) read The Moral Animal: Evolutionary Psychology and Everyday Life by Robert Wright, you may be surprised."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Several years ago, Miss Ayn Rand wrote The Fountainhead. Despite a generally poor press, it is said to have sold some four hundred thousand copies. Thus, it became a wonder of the book trade of a kind that publishers dream about after taxes. So Atlas Shrugged (Random House, $6.95) had a first printing of one hundred thousand copies. It appears to be slowly climbing the best seller lists.The news about this book seems to me to be that any ordinarily sensible head could possibly take it seriously, and that apparently, a good many do. Somebody has called it: \\"Excruciatingly awful.\\" I find it a remarkably silly book. It is certainly a bumptious one. Its story is preposterous. It reports the final stages of a final conflict (locale: chiefly the United States, some indefinite years hence) between the harried ranks of free enterprise and the \\"looters.\\" These are proponents of proscriptive taxes. Government ownership, Labor, etc. etc. The mischief here is that the author, dodging into fiction, nevertheless counts on your reading it as political reality. \\"This,\\" she is saying in effect, \\"is how things really are. These are the real issues, the real sides. Only your blindness keeps you from seeing it, which, happily, I have come to rescue you from.\\"Since a great many of us dislike much that Miss Rand dislikes, quite as heartily as she does, many incline to take her at her word. It is the more persuasive, in some quarters, because the author deals wholly in the blackest blacks and the whitest whites. In this fiction everything, everybody, is either all good or all bad, without any of those intermediate shades which, in life, complicate reality and perplex the eye that seeks to probe it truly. This kind of simplifying pattern, of course, gives charm to most primitive story-telling. And, in fact, the somewhat ferro-concrete fairy tale the author pours here is, basically, the old one known as: The War between the Children of Light and the Children of Darkness. In modern dress, it is a class war. Both sides of it are caricatures.The Children of Light are largely operatic caricatures. In so far as any of them suggests anything known to the business community, they resemble the occasional curmudgeon millionaire, tales about whose outrageously crude and shrewd eccentricities sometimes provide the lighter moments in Board rooms. Otherwise, the Children of Light are geniuses. One of them is named (the only smile you see will be your own): Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Antonio. This electrifying youth is the world's biggest copper tycoon. Another, no less electrifying, is named: Ragnar Danesjold. He becomes a twentieth-century pirate. All Miss Rand's chief heroes are also breathtakingly beautiful. So is her heroine (she is rather fetchingly vice-president in charge of management of a transcontinental railroad). So much radiant energy might seem to serve an eugenic purpose. For, in this story as in Mark Twain's, \\"all the knights marry the princess\\"- though without benefit of clergy. Yet from the impromptu and surprisingly gymnastic matings of heroine and three of the heroes, no children- it suddenly strikes you- ever result. The possibility is never entertained. And indeed, the strenuously sterile world of Atlas Shrugged is scarcely a place for children. You speculate that, in life, children probably irk the author and may make her uneasy. How could it be otherwise when she admiringly names a banker character (by what seems to me a humorless master-stroke): Midas Mulligan? You may fool some adults, you can't fool little boys and girls with such stuff- not for long. They may not know just what is out of line, but they stir uneasily.The Children of Darkness are caricatures, too; and they are really oozy. But at least they are caricatures of something identifiable. Their archetypes are Left Liberals, New Dealers, Welfare Statists, One Worlders, or, at any rate, such ogreish semblances of these as may stalk the nightmares of those who think little about people as people, but tend to think a great deal in labels and effigies. (And neither Right nor Left, be it noted in passing, has a monopoly of such dreamers, though the horrors in their nightmares wear radically different masks and labels.)In Atlas Shrugged, all this debased inhuman riffraff is lumped as \\"looters.\\" This is a fairly inspired epithet. It enables the author to skewer on one invective word everything and everybody that she fears and hates. This spares here the plaguy business of performing one service that her fiction might have performed. Namely: that of examining in human depth how so feeble a lot came to exist at all, let alone be powerful enough to be worth hating and fearing. Instead, she bundles them into one undifferentiated damnation.\\"Looters\\" loot because they believe in Robin Hood, and have a lot of other people believing in him, too. Robin Hood is the author's image of absolute evil- robbing the strong (and hence good) to give to the weak (and hence no good). All \\"looters\\" are base, envious, twisted, malignant minds, motivated wholly by greed for power, combined with the lust of the weak to tear down the strong, out of a deep-seated hatred of life and secret longing for destruction and death. There happens to be a tiny (repeat: tiny) seed of truth in this. The full clinical diagnosis can be read into the pages of Friedich Nietzsche. (Here I must break in with an aside. Miss Rand acknowledges a grudging debt to one, and only one, earlier philosopher: Aristotle. I submit that she is indebted, and much more heavily, to Nietzche. Just as her operatic businessmen are, in fact, Nietzschean supermen, so her ulcerous Leftists are Nietzsche's \\"last men,\\" both deformed in a way to sicken the fastidious recluse of Sils Maria. And much else comes, consciously on not, from the same source.) Happily, in Atlas Shrugged (though not in life), all the children of Darkness are utterly incompetent.So the Children of Light win handily by declaring a general strike of brains, of which they have a monopoly, letting the world go, literally, to smash. In the end, they troop out of their Rocky Mountain hideaway to repossess the ruins. It is then, in the book's last line, that a character traces in the air, \\"over the desolate earth,\\" the Sign of the Dollar, in lieu of the Sign of the Cross, and in token that a suitably prostrate mankind is at last ready, for its sins, to be redeemed from the related evils of religion and social reform (the \\"mysticism of mind\\" and the \\"mysticism of muscle\\").That Dollar Sign is not merely provocative, though we sense a sophomoric intent to raise the pious hair on susceptible heads. More importantly, it is meant to seal the fact that mankind is ready to submit abjectly to an elite of technocrats, and their accessories, in a New Order, enlightened and instructed by Miss Rand's ideas that the good life is one which \\"has resolved personal worth into exchange value,\\" \\"has left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.'\\" The author is explicit, in fact deafening, about these prerequisites. Lest you should be in any doubt after 1168 pages, she assures you with a final stamp of the foot in a postscript: \\"and I mean it.\\" But the words quoted above are those of Karl Marx. He, too, admired \\"naked self-interest\\" (in its time and place), and for much of the same reasons as Miss Rand: because, he believed, it cleared away the cobwebs of religion and led to prodigies of industrial and cognate accomplishment.The overlap is not as incongruous as it looks. Atlas Shrugged can be called a novel only by devaluing the term. It is a massive tract for the times. Its story merely serves Miss Rand to get the customers inside the tent. And as a soapbox for delivering her Message. The Message is the thing. It is a sum, a forthright philosophic materialism. Upperclassmen might incline to sniff and say that the author has, with vast effort, contrived a simple materialist system, one, intellectually, at about the state of the oxcart, though without mastering the principle of the wheel. Like any consistent materialism, this one begins by rejecting God, religion, original sin, etc. etc. (This book's aggressive atheism and rather unbuttoned \\"higher morality,\\" which chiefly outrage some readers, are, in fact, secondary ripples, and result inevitably from its underpinning premises.) Thus, Randian Man, like Marxian Man, is made the center of a godless world.At that point, in any materialism, the main possibilities open up to Man. 1) His tragic fate becomes, without God, more tragic and much lonelier. In general, the tragedy deepens according to the degree of pessimism or stoicism with which he conducts his \\"hopeless encounter between human questioning and the silent universe.\\" Or, 2) Man's fate ceases to be tragic at all. Tragedy is bypassed by the pursuit of happiness. Tragedy is henceforth pointless. Henceforth man's fate, without God, is up to him. And to him alone. His happiness, is strict materialist terms, lies with his own workaday hands and ingenious brain. His happiness becomes, in Miss Rand's words, \\"the moral purpose of his life.\\" Here occurs a little rub whose effects are just as observable in a free enterprise system, which is in practice materialist (whatever else it claims or supposes itself to be), as they would be under an atheist Socialism, if one were ever to deliver that material abundance that all promise. The rub is that the pursuit of happiness, as an end in itself, tends automatically, and widely, to be replaced by the pursuit of pleasure with a consequent general softening of the fibers of will, intelligence on \\"man as a heroic being\\" \\"with productive achievement as his noblest activity.\\" For, if man's \\"heroism\\" (some will prefer to say: \\"human dignity\\") no longer derives from God, or is not a function of that godless integrity which was a root of Nietzsche's anguish, then Man becomes merely the most consuming of animals, with glut as the condition of his happiness. And this, of course, suits the author's economics and the politics that must arise from them.For politics, of course, arise, though the author of Atlas Shrugged stares stonily past them, as if this book were not what, in fact it is, essentially- a political book. And here begins mischief. Systems of philosophic materialism, so long as they merely circle outside this world's atmosphere, matter little to most of us. The trouble is that they keep coming down to earth. It is when a system of materialist ideas presumes to give positive answers to real problems of our real life that mischief starts. In a age like ours, in which a highly complex technological society is everywhere in a high state of instability, such answers however philosophic, translate quickly into political realities. And in the degree to which problems of complexity and instability are most bewildering to masses of men, a temptation sets in to let some species of Big Brother solve and supervise them.One Big Brother is of course, a socializing elite (as we know, several cut-rate brands are on the shelves). Miss Rand, as the enemy of any socializing force, calls in a Big Brother of her own contriving to do battle with the other. In the name of free enterprise, therefore, she plumps for a technocratic elite (I find no more inclusive word than technocratic to bracket the industrial-financial-engineering caste she seems to have in mind). When she calls \\"productive achievement\\" man's \\"noblest activity,\\" she means, almost exclusively, technological achievement, supervised by such a managerial political bureau. She might object that she means much, much more; and we can freely entertain her objections. But in sum, that is just what she means. For that is what, in reality, it works out to. And in reality, too, by contrast, with fiction, this can only head into a dictatorship, however benign, living and acting beyond good and evil, a law unto itself (as Miss Rand believes it should be), and feeling any restraint on itself as, in practice, criminal, and, in morals, vicious- as Miss Rand clearly feels it to be. Of course, Miss Rand nowhere calls for a dictatorship. I take her to be calling for an aristocracy of talents. We cannot labor here why, in the modern world, the pre-conditions for aristocracy, an organic growth, no longer exist, so that impulse toward aristocracy always emerges now in the form of dictatorship.Nor has the author, apparently, brooded on the degree to which, in a wicked world, a materialism of the Right and a materialism of the Left, first surprisingly resemble, then in action tend to blend each with each, because, while differing at the top in avowed purposed, and possibly in conflict there, at bottom they are much the same thing. The embarrassing similarities between Hitler's National Socialism and Stalin's brand of Communism are familiar. For the world, as seen in materialist view from the Left. The question becomes chiefly: who is to run that world in whose interests, or perhaps, at best, who can run it more efficiently?Something of this implication is fixed in the book's dictatorial tone, which is much its most striking feature. Out of a lifetime of reading, I can recall no other book in which a tone of overriding arrogance was so implacably sustained. Its shrillness is without reprieve. Its dogmatism is without appeal. In addition, the mind, which finds this one natural to it, shares other characteristics of its type. 1) It consistently mistakes raw force for strength, and the rawer the force, the more reverent the posture of the mind before it. 2) It supposes itself to be the bringer of a final revelation. Therefore, resistance to the Message cannot be tolerated because disagreement can never be merely honest, prudent or just humanly fallible. Dissent from revelation so final (because, the author would say, so reasonable) can only be willfully wicked. There are ways of dealing with such wickedness, and, in fact, right reason itself enjoins them. From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: \\" To the gas chambers- go!\\" The same inflexibly self-righteous stance results, too (in the total absence of any saving humor), in odd extravagances of inflection and gesture- that Dollar Sign, for example. At first, we try to tell ourselves that these are just lapses, that this mind has, somehow, mislaid the discriminating knack that most of us pray will warn us in time of the differences between what is effective and firm, and what is wildly grotesque and excessive. Soon we suspect something worse. We suspect that this mind finds, precisely in extravagance, some exalting merit; feels a surging release of power and passion precisely in smashing up the house. A tornado might feel this way, or Carrie Nation.We struggle to be just. For we cannot help feel at least a sympathetic pain before the sheer labor, discipline and patient craftsmanship that went to making this mountain of words. But the words keep shouting us down. In the end that tone dominates. But it should be its own antidote, warning us that anything it shouts is best taken with the usual reservations with which we might sip a patent medicine. Some may like the flavor. In any case, the brew is probably without lasting ill effects. But it is not a cure for anything. Nor would we, ordinarily, place much confidence in the diagnosis of a doctor who supposes that the Hippocratic Oath is a kind of curse.Whittaker Chambers"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand has a single idea-- and she pounds it into your head with a two-by-four. Seriously, Ms. Rand-- you don't have to spend 400 pages telling us that we need to chase our dreams no matter what. A single episode of the Care Bears will do that nicely.Also, characterizing Mr. Roarke as an uncompromising, empathy-less ogre does not make him endearing. Blowing up a building just so people who aren't as smart as you can't see it is pretty arrogant-- I'd say that's falling into the realm of being an all-out tool.While, admittedly, Rand's idea was probably revolutionary when it came out-- especially considering the Soviet Union was foaming at the mouth and running rampant all over Eastern Europe at the time-- it hasn't aged well at all.

Even worse, Rand made her fortune out of book sales in the six figures, and I wonder how many of the poor fools who read it fit Rand's definition of a worthy man. In case you're planning to buy it, the book is about an architect who blows a housing project for the poor because, er, he does not like the facade ornaments.

If anyone was to act the way her characters do (at work) they would be pounding the pavement looking for a new job. Of course one should stand true to their convictions and should be honest with others- but the ways in which her characters talk and act are often rude, wooden, stilted, childish and fake. Sometimes they sound brilliant and other times they are way way out.One thing I noticed is that none of her characters ever lighten up, have a good time, enjoy life or ever have much fun. They are all so heavy, boring, philosophical and dry. The sexual escapades in which Rand's women find themsleves are absolutely pathetic- never any guilt, pregnancies or doubt. Rand was married and must have been a tyrant to live with (I've never seen a photo of her smiling).There are interesting portions of the book but do not try to emulate the life of Roark- you'll be penneiless, hated and shunned.Her obvious atheism (man is the center of her universe and she never mentions God except in swearing) is troubling to me also. Man's chief end is not to worship his work and career but it is much more profound than that. I mention the religious aspect of man because Rand's philosophy (Objectivism) professes to be the true way men should live while on earth. She never considers the spiritual side of men except that they worship each other, work and money. Her philosophy (she justifies being totally self centered) has been weighed in the balance and found terribly wanting. Man is meant for eternity and Rand only concerns herself with this life on earth and materialism. The chief end of man (according to the old Westminster Confession of Faith) is to \\"glorify God and enjoy Him forever\\". In this aspect Rand hasn't a clue."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is neither brilliant nor well-written. It is overly long (but not as disasterously as Atlas Shrugged) and the characters are stock-issue that exist to forcefully move along Rand's &quot;point&quot;.

It resonates with cold-war hysteria that fails to take into account the base needs of others and the very concept of interpersonal relationships.

She is a vicious shrew, and this comes across quite clearly in this book and her others."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"ayn rand is dumb. objectivism is dumb. the fountainhead is dumb. i fail to understand, to empathize with the dimwitted people who fall for this crap. the lady obviously thinks she is moving a mountain with every worthless word that she writes. her characters are exaggerated, her dialogue is melodramatic. i couldn't find a plot. everything seemed to be leading to a point that she never really got to. this book can only appeal to weak spirits that are easily lead. shouldn't have even given her that one star.if anyone wants to challenge me on this..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is unnecessarily long.

At worst they are repeated batterings of a wild worldview. Anyway I can't recommend spending money on this. Afterall, there are tons of legitimate philosophical works out there, and most self-help books are probably more effective than this for motivating. But don't take my word for it.

What he does with her and her goofy thinking is good fun.To me the most interesting and fun part of this is the way in which the Ayn Rand followers, like all non-conformists, end up being conformists of the highest order (think of all of those ladies in red dresses and purple hats that you see on tour buses -- this is who I'm talking about). Rand rails against the masses and the bad taste of the public and, ironically, it's this public who embrace her work. Additionally, if she really feels that none of us should care what anyone else thinks, why did she bother to write a novel to impose her thinking on the rest of us?My advice is, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was a phenomenal salesperson. If you had a dollar in your pocket, this woman could convince you it was really hers, and make you feel guilty for stealing from her poor orphan mouth. She employs the magic of literature -- by which the reader identifies with the hero and trustingly enters the author's make-believe universe -- to manipulate, confuse, and recondition her unsuspecting victims. You will walk away from this book a bloodthirsty, heartless vampire -- and think that the world, not you, is warped.The title comes from a line in the book that &quot;man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.&quot; Rand's agenda is to convince you that man, not God, is responsible for human greatness. Furthermore, she stresses that any authority which does not recognize the supremacy of the individual's ego is an evil tyrrany (God being the unidentified exemplar of this dictatorial regime).Howard Roark is an architect. He likes to build really tall towers. The Man has it in for him, wants to oppress his revolutionary genius and prevent him from becoming rich and happy. So Roark thumbs his nose at the System, and blazes his own trail...This is the Satanic Bible that Anton LaVey only wishes he could write.

That mentioned The Fountainhead, which I read first, then Atlas Shrugged. The full book tree is available at my blog (The real estate investors blog at bloglines). The Fountainhead was less focused on the economy and more on the individual and how the group consciousness, collectivism and the expectancy to live ones life for others affects society, whereas Atlas Shrugged takes it a bit deeper to show the effects on an economic level.Both approaches clearly and convincingly point out the dangers of irrational thoughts, beliefs and actions. Ayn Rand, both in this book and her others rejects the belief that man is or can be a victim of forces beyond his control, such as God, fate, upbringing, genes or economic conditions. She shows through the beliefs and actions of the lead character Howard Roark how rationality is man's basic virtue and his main fundamental values are: reason, purpose and self esteem. She illustrates that man must live for himself, not for anyone else and to live for one self takes self esteem to believe in ones own ideas, dreams and visions.I applaud her strong burning belief in a hands off Government and laissez-faire capitalism. I read someplace that Alan Greenspan is a big Ayn Rand fan as can be seen by his hands off approach and reluctance to interfere with capital markets and security market regulations.The book illustrates that thinking for one self is of the utmost importance in life and how not thinking for one self turns you into a helpless victim of the thoughts and plans of others.The books theme, be true to one self is a biblical concept mixed with a modern day society to illustrate as clear as day the difference between self thinkers and those that live for others.

Be warned, however, that Rand's philosophy (which she introduces in this book) while brilliant and original, is extremist and close-minded. To put it another way, Rand believed in The One Truth, and she thought that this was The Only Truth, and held it above all other truths. Moral issues like abortion, religion, gay marriage, etc... they all fade against the background of the objectivist philosophy. It's a philosophy about one thing, really: man and his right to be free, as an original, individual being. Therefore, this book preaches selflessness. Many people find it offensive, so be warned.I myself found objectivism to be refreshing at first because I had never read anything like it. Whatever else you say about Rand, it took guts to stand up and preach as moral something that for centuries upon centuries had been considered immoral. And while I wouldn't opt for going as far as Howard Roark did in a few instances in this book (which I won't mention because the ones I think of would spoil it for you), I will say that it made me reconsider my own life, and this reconsideration yielded instances that were ultimately liberating, not having to always consider other people, or feel guilty about doing things for myself.Well, enough about objectivism, and on to the book itself. If you find you can tolerate/sometimes like the philosophy (some people say it makes them gag) then you will likely enjoy the fiction. This stands on its own as a work of ficiton. Rand's descriptions are vivid, and her use of language is simply remarkable. I couldn't believe it when I first discovered that English wasn't her first language.As for the characters, they are unconventional, and act in unconventional ways, based upon Rand's odd view of the world. It's all epic struggle, disguised and re-disguised into everyday life. The smallest action has philisophical meaning. When you get down to it, you really can't get away from the philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand weaves her philosophy of objectivism into this novel. The philosophy rejects (as being incompatible with man's greatness) mercy, altruism, charity, sacrifice, and service. These proclaimed virtues are portrayed as either weaknesses or as tools of subjugation. Consequently, objectivism must likewise reject all of the world's religions, as well as the possibility of the existence of a God.Altruism, Rand argues, forces men to keep others subservient, so that they may make themselves feel righteous; it has been the root of the greatest evils in the world (Communism, Nazism, etc.); but egoism has resulted in creations which have alleviated the sufferings of man for generations to come. Her philosophy is most succinctly expressed by her architect hero Howard Roark, who says, \\"All that which proceeds from man's independent ego is good. All that which proceeds form man's dependence upon men is evil.\\" He argues that \\"only by living for himself\\" is man \\"able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind\\" and that \\"no man can live for another . . . The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves.\\"And yet Roark is himself the quintessential intellectual, who shares the same failing of the intellectuals who created Communism, Nazism, and the other \\"altruistic evils\\"; that is, he is capable of loving man in the abstract but incapable of loving him in the particular: \\"One can't love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name.\\"\\"The Fountainhead\\" expresses an individualism that is uniquely American, and it is therefore surprising that it, as far as I know, has never been in the running for the title of \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Of course, although it emphasizes that individualism has made our nation great (and it has), it must of necessity ignore and dismiss another progressive force in our nation's history-American Christianity. Rand's philosophy stands in stark contrast to the collectivism which was then sweeping the world in an ocean of blood. \\"It has reached,\\" says Roark, \\"a scale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind. It has swallowed most of Europe. It is engulfing our country.\\"So what about the story? Despite the copious philosophical dialogue, the story is not sacrificed to create an ethical treatise. The characters are fascinating, very well-developed, and the story is at times gripping. However, the relationship between our hero and heroine is never fully convincing to me, and I find it highly disturbing that Rand felt it necessary to make rape an essential and positive element of their union. The story drew me in at first, and then began to lose me for several chapters, as Rand breaks one of the rules of good structure and does not begin developing a main character until over half way through the novel. By then, I did not feel invested enough in the character of Gail Wynand to learn in detail about his past life...but as Wynand was more fully developed and his life tied into that of the hero's, he became to me the most interesting character.\\"The Fountainhead\\" is a tale of both defeat and triumph. It is depressing and exalting, inviting and repugnant. And its philosophy, like all great lies, contains an enormous amount of truth."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"this is quite possibly the best novel i've become involved in - and i use the phrase wholeheartedly. it is impossible to come to the last page of the novel without acknowledging at LEAST some amount of self-involvement. i definitely would not say it's a book by which one models his/her life; roark is referred to as a hero. if a hero is someone whom one aspires to be, roark is not that. if a hero is someone whom one admires, roark is that. if other critics consider this the flaw of the novel, they haven't considered the loose definition of a &quot;hero&quot; anyway. this novel could result in self-improvement only in the reader acknowledging the pedestal which humanity too often ignores, too often dismisses as too distant a reach for his piddly self. the wistful beauty of this book is that hopefully, the reader will gain full awareness that roark's integrity cannot be matched. as other critics stated, he is basically untouchable, unmarred by his surroundings - well, the breathing types of surroundings in actuality. whether the reader hopes or not to match this, the fact remains that his character does not dictate the human heart - just its stifled cry for wings. however, the entirety of the novel may provide inspiration and a much-needed mirror. excellent piece of literature. great for any beginner on the concept of objectivism."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand's view that our own creations breathe some form of ourselves underlies the story in The Fountainhead. When others cannot create in the same way, they look to squelch it. A novel of true creativity and individualism. Worth a good, long read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"as you can see from this review page, people either hate this book or love it. I love it. to those who say that Ayn Rand is into communism or socialism or some other collectivist thing, let me say YOU STUPID FOOLS, READ THE BOOK AGAIN! there is no such reference in this book, in fact, there are many references against it. all of my friends told me not to read this book. if I had listened to them, I would have been deprived of the best expirience of my life.

I agree 100% with most of Ms. Rand's ideas. Her defense of selfishness is very well based and she proves her case. The characters are amazing and make you realize what the &quot;modern&quot; ideas are really about. As revolutionary and important today as it was when first published, especially for people living in countries such as mine, where populist and colectivist propositions still fool the majority and where freedom is not praised by many; a country where individuals are left no good options when it comes to choosing authorities. A book for people who have principals and stick to them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In a macroscopic sense, The Fountainhead is about the struggle of the exceptional mind (innovators and geniuses) versus the mediocre mind (intellectual leeches and society-at-large). In a microscopic sense, this novel is about the relationship of Howard Roark (the exceptional) with his contemporary, Peter Keating (the mediocre), and his nemesis, Ellsworth M. Toohey and the rest of society (the unthinking herd).The Exceptional: Howard Roark is an architect who has not only pushed the envelope, but has broken the mold. Reviled and undermined by his architectural peers, Roark, despite being the most brilliant, innovative, and cost effective architect of the time, is left to scrounge for any work he can get. Since his work IS his happiness and highest ideal, this doesn't bother him, because he knows the day will come when superlative achievement and action, not masks of prestige and back-room deals, rule the day.The Mediocre: Peter Keating is loved by all and is called the greatest architect of his time. Yet he has attained his celebrity and prestige not by standing on the shoulders of giants, but by stealing the shoulders himself. Peter is a shell of a man and has no talent. He is actually reliant on Roark for his architectural renderings. Peter is a product of what OTHER people want, and his life and subsequent downfall represents the travesty of complete sacrifice of self.The Rat: Actively working against what Roark stands for is Ellsworth M. Toohey. Toohey is a \\"meek\\" man, but he doesn't want to inherit the earth, he wants to drain it of the superlative, and replace the void with the ordinary, the mundane, and the mediocre. Why? Because these are the easiest people to control. Toohey endorses the \\"average\\" and promulgates self-sacrifice for the betterment of others. These are his tools he uses to gain immense social power; Toohey is an up-and-coming dictator.Roark represents the highest virtue of man: unadulterated, egotistical achievement. It is through the self-centered, egotistical achievements of men and women, like him, that society prospers through laissez faire economics, though \\"altruistic\\" power mongers (Ellsworth M. Toohey) want to usurp those thinking, reasoning minds in order to corral society into the grips of a collectivist dictatorship, all in the name of the \\"social good.\\"This book is easier to digest in that the storyline utilizes more plausible occurrences as opposed to Atlas Shrugged; the Fountainhead is easier to believe. The Fountainhead is also more of a scary parallel of what is beginning to emerge in the United States as well.The overall \\"take-home\\" message of the novel is simple: the combination of multiple individuals acting in their own self-interest (NOT self-sacrifice) add up to create the social good (good ole' Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading Atlas Shrugged I was a bit hesitant about reading The Fountainhead. I should have not hesitated. I literally could not put this book down. While the language is somewhat stillted and archaic, the characters are interesting, well developed, complex and conflicted. All the elements needed to produce an interesting story.The story concerns several people:Howard Roark: A man of absolute principles. A genius at his work, and unbending in his desire to do it &quot;HIS WAY.&quot;Peter Keating: Just the opposite. No scruples, and a third rate architect.Dominique: A Puzzle. Always seems to do the opposite of what she really wants.Ellsworth Twohey: An intellectual snob. Out to rule the world because the &quot;masses&quot; need him.Gail Wayland: Publisher. A tortured confused man. In many ways more the center of the story.The story is basically about the triumph of genius against the lowest common denominator of society and the battle against mediocrity and committee rule.Each character is explored in depth and made interesting.If you were put off by Atlas Shrugged, you should read this, they are very different.I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this book as a philosophy student and was immediately ostracized by student and faculty alike when I attempted to ask questions about why Ayn Rand was not included in discussions about modern philosophers or American philosophers.I remember the puzzled look on the face of my philosopher teacher in our American Philosophers course when I brought up her name. He completely ignored me and pretended as though I were a ghost for the rest of the term. And I was previously one of his favorite students. I am not sure if they fear her, misunderstand her, or simply despise her, but I think that a scholarly examination of her body of work is long overdue. And this book is the beginning of Ayn Rand as a serious thinker with an important message.I fell in love with this book from the first page and did not stop reading it unless I was eating, sleeping or in class. The characters overwhelmed me, the writing blew me away and the ideas gave me hope. I had first heard about Rand from Rush Limbaugh's radio show, where he talked about disagreeing with Rand because of her atheism and her pro-choice stance. I knew I had to read this author because I hated the religious elements of Rush's show.&quot;Howard Roark laughed.&quot; From those words I was literally hooked. I had no idea what was coming next, but i knew that these were just the ideas and words I needed to hear. I had been thinking them for so long already, it was about time I finally felt someone I could relate to, and who had something intelligent to say in philosophy that was completely incoherent.Read this book and try to remember the hope you had as a teenager, when the world was clean and open to any possibility. That is the world these characters live in every day. I re-read this book often just to enjoy the sense of life that she created. It permeates every page and nuance of this book. Its a sense of life where you are the master of your own destiny, where anything is possible. The climax is powerful and the conclusion uplifting, just like life shoudl be."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'll start right off by saying this: if you can't accept some shocking, startling, controversial ideas (I fully believe that that is the only reason many of the previous reviewers of this book gave it one star), DON'T READ THIS BOOK! It is completely essential for the reader of Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; to accept ideas that are different and - in the case of some - differing from one's own. That is what this book is: a differing idea.The only bad point of this book (though not bad enough to detract any stars) is the length. It's amazingly long - not only in length (my copy had 700-something pages) - but in content, if that makes sense. However, it doesn't ever FEEL long. I remember the point where I reached Part Three (at page 502 in my copy). It didn't feel like I'd read 500 pages. However, the length does become an issue when you realize you've been sitting alone for hours.Third I need to mention the characters. Most of them are one-sided. Both female characters - Dominique and Katie - have relationship problems, but this only adds to their character. There is no hero in this book - Roark is ANYTHING but a hero. The characters, I think, are unlike anything put into a book before. However, they're really amazing - GREAT - characters.In closing, I want to stress the fact that you CANNOT read this book if you're not willing to be exposed to differing ideas. This book is perfectly written - amazing style and characters. Read with an open mind!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When I first read this book in my younger years, I thought that it was magnificient.Looking back, I realize that it has taught me that it is indeed possible to say a great deal and simultaneously assert nothing.

I found the struggle of Howard Roark fascinating, the characters intensely developed, and the massive, epic sweep of the novel astounding........Later on through......ouch, this book is flawed, on some kind of basic level. First off, the whole Objectivist philosophy is pretty abhorrent, unless you think that the planet would be better off if everyone was totally self serving. Howard Roark is a Fascist, refusing to see anything but what he wants to see. Which isn't a problem, except the book makes a hero out of him, wants us to realize that being just like Howard Roark is the highest standard one can acheive to be. But that's just philosophic differences. The book itself, is pretty pathetic. Everything in it, the plot, the characters, are just tinsel and paint that cover up Rand's manifesto. The characters are deeply developed, but come off feeling like one dimensional caricatures, their dialogue pathetic, their motives worthless. Howard Roark moves through the book like a walking Deux ex Machina, all at once omnipotent and always functioning with total flawlessness of actions. Still, I'm glad I read it, just to realize how far I wanted to set myself away from it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Not to be unkind, dear reviewers, but I find it ironic that Rynd's &quot;drooling masses&quot; appear to be the same lemmings rabidly rating her books 5 stars.

You cannot expect someone with no writing experience to produce great work. They must learn to do so in reference to other great writers and thinkers. Ayn Rand did not do this. She created objectivism instead. Objectivism, beyond all the words, is merely a blanket that protects people from criticism--\\"I don't have to listen to him because I have my own voice.\\" As a result, The Fountainhead comes to life as the work of a novice so thoroughly convinced in its brilliance.If you really want to know Ayn Rand, read her philosophical works. They're still a trap for cultists, but the portrayal of humanity will be less embarrassing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Sorry to be the lone philistine.

If I break down pros and cons, which I will do in a moment, the latter far outweighs the former. This review assumes the reader has read the book and thus will give away some aspects of the novel's plot.Pros:Ellsworth Toohey. Masterfully written, marvelously scheming, and a wonderful villain. His picture of the future was as ominous as the one espoused by Orwell's O'Brien, and his obsession with power fascinating.Peter Keating. Despite being a fairly unsympathetic character he is by far the most beleiveable and his fall from grace has true pathos.Gail Wynand. Something of a cross between Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey, Wynand represented one of the most interesting of the book's characters: the man who could have been. His obsession with power (I Do) was quite intersting to read, especially when he finds out how little he has--a man who has become popular by lying can't suddenly begin telling the truth.The First Act. Almost a story in and of itself, Part 1 (\\"Peter Keating\\") juxtaposes two men who are completely driven to success in their own ways, and ends with the amoral one succeeding fabulously while the principled one fails miserably. The most complete part of the book.Cons:Unbelieveable Characters. Wynand/Toohey/Howard Roark/Dominique Francon are too smart. They always seem to know exactly what the other is thinking despite their roundabout, baffling ways of thinking. The relationship between the latter two never makes sense to anyone but Ayn Rand.Idealism vs. reality. Roark and Dominique presented as hero and heroine, the ideal people, but they're stubborn, cold people who can be exceptionally cruel at times.Rape Scene. Roark, as set up by Rand, would never have raped DominiquePretentious Last Act. During the final 200 pages or so all the characters seem to become mouthpieces for particular viewpoints and get exceptionally preachy. While Toohey's \\"I will take over the world\\" speech is at times chilling, Roark's courtroom grandstanding is so transparently Ayn Rand talking through him.Mike. The steelworker who only exists to prove that Roark is in touch with the common man.Hollywood Ending. Dominique going up to see Roark on top of the skyscraper he's designing and getting buffeted by the sun's rays isn't becoming to the spirit of the novel.Anti-Socialism. While there's nothing wrong (and indeed often many things right) with social or political criticism, the heavy-handed way Rand attacks socialism is so overt as to insult the reader's intelligence.So how did i like this book? I'm not entirely sure, but it's well-written and enjoyable despite its 694-page length. I won't call it a fast read, but it wasn't thick either and has enough ideas to keep the reader intellecutally engaged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books! It is really a unique book in that Rand not only develops theoretical yet realistic storylines and characters but also creates this completely unique philosphy. It allows the readers to really question true human intentions and goals. With all this, it is still a really enjoyable read!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it can become tiresome because it is so long."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In terming Howard Roark the ideal man, Ayn Rand signified that he is meant to be taken literally. In this regard, the book is something of a failure; Roark seems somewhat empty, full of integrity and wisdom but lacking in those human qualities of laughter and love. This is remedied somewhat in the second half of the book, as he settles into joyful relationships and begins to defrost a bit, but for the majority of the novel he is distant and unrealistic.However, if the reader steps back and takes Roark, as well as the other characters, as microcosms of various personality types that can be applied to a spectrum, he or she will spot no end of truth in The Fountainhead, which is basically a platform from which Rand can explain and justify her own philosophy, Objectivism (\\"rational selfishness\\"). Rand rails against any number of societal norms or ideals here, including altruism, collectivism, selling out, and the celebration of mediocrity (I often wonder what Rand would say if she were alive today, an age when stupidity is openly praised).Like any philosophy, objectivism can be dangerous if misinterpreted; it's easy to believe Rand is justifying self-preservation at the expense of others. This is hardly the case; while Rand does advocate success and the amassment of wealth and material goods, she never sponsors greed. I suspect this is why Roark spends a significant portion of the novel in poverty.Apart from the philosophical edge, the novel is enjoyable because Rand is just a damn good writer. Her imagery is poetic in a way that most poems can't match. Her characters are multi-faceted, psychologically complex creatures that have believable motivations for every action. The plot is logical, if not entirely realistic.The main flaw of the book takes place at Roark's trial in the last chapter or so. Rand apparently thinks the reader has been sleeping for the past 700 pages, so she bombards him with an extremely long speech that pretty much condenses the entire novel into ten or twenty pages. Since the information is nothing more than new phrasing for old ideas, the speech is redundant and becomes tedious fairly quickly (though I imagine it's a goldmine for students trying to cite the novel in a thesis). There are other minor flaws, mainly little details Rand doesn't address--like how to create a harmony with the environment after pillaging it to remold society to man's desires--but this book is by no means the end-all be-all of philosophic thought; that being the case, I urge you to read other contrary viewpoints that will help you form a synthesis from which to cultivate your own beliefs.But be sure to read this book, whatever else you do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Analyzing &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is like dissecting a frog. Very few people are interested and it kills the frog.Regardless of what you think of Ayn Rand's then breakthrough ideas of capitalism, selfishness, etc., you must pick up this indubitable powerhouse of a novel.The protagonist, Howard Roark, is quite conveniently a total orphan with no social moorings or responsibilities. This allows the author a great deal of liberty in weaving philosophical tropes around him.The presentation of the ideas though is simply delicious, couched in some riveting writing, and will keep your thought mills running for a good while. I underline my books and The Fountainhead is almost entirely colored.A must-read. Period."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I suspect it took a certain amount of guts to write a book like this in the 1940s, with Hitler recently disposed of and the literary trend for kitchen sinks and bedpans just getting underway - a trend which is still very much with us, as the popularity of cute little writers like Kingsley Amis clearly demonstrates. The Fountainhead deals with large, roughly drawn, simpler-than-life characters - a visionary architect, his compromising colleague, a press baron, a woman who at one time or another marries all three of them, and a slimy newspaper pundit - all of them engaged in a battle which (Rand makes it very very obvious indeed) is nothing less than the war for Truth against Lies, for Freedom against Oppression, for the very Soul of Man against those Forces which would drag it down into the mire. Until the very end, when the architect starts spouting, for ten straight pages, the very same morals which have been pounded into us with exemplary force over the preceding seven hundred, it works remarkably well, thanks to Rand's vivid and mercifully unpretentious prose and her evident conviction. People have complained that the hero is inhuman, but that's precisely the point - heroes aren't supposed to have the petty failings of the rest of us, and until the nineteenth century they generally didn't. Howard Roark is an optimistic, present-day, &quot;realist&quot; revision of the old dragon-slaying Beowulf/Siegfried type; the casting of Gary Cooper in the equally interesting and equally bombastic film version was an inspiration. Where the book fails is in Rand's inability to find a plausible way for Roark to win through against the odds she has so convincingly shown to be stacked against him. She uses a deus ex machina in the form of a newspaper tycoon - imagine Rupert Murdoch throwing his weight behind Frank Lloyd Wright or Antonio Gaudi - and, later, that good old standby the Great American Jury. Laissez-faire capitalism, and the democracy Rand has so beautifully satirised and demolished in the person of columnist Ellsworth Toohey, join hands and become twin fairy godmothers magicking the hero to his wedding and a great career. It's a disappointingly cowardly ending to a largely well-written and uncompromisingly epic work that is also, and not least importantly, one hell of a page-turner."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is about an architect who is such a genius that the world tries to suppress him. Now, you'd think that someone would be smart enough to try to exploit and capitalize on his genius, but no, that's not what happens. Why? Because his architecture is so terrific that it mocks everyone else's mediocrity. I'm neither exaggerating nor joking. And no, this novel is not a satire -- It's really that pretentious.However, THE FOUNTAINHEAD does have one thing going for it: it's unintentionally ironic. Although Ayn Rand seems to take herself too seriously to consciously incorporate irony into her work, the book's irony lies in the fact that Rand has written an elitist manifesto for the masses.Let's use novelists as an example: In my experience, great writing is most often readily apparent. On the other hand, I know some unsuccessful writers who think highly of their own writing and rail against mediocrity and \\"the herd\\" in direct response to their failed careers. Naturally, the problem couldn't be that their novels are pointless unentertaining drivel. Like the comedian who badgers his audience because it doesn't find him funny, according to Rand, the truly brilliant novel gets rejected because no one but geniuses possess the vision to see how brilliant the novel is. This novelist and comedian are the people who love Ayn Rand, because her philosophy of Objectivism allows them so sit in aloof condescension of others yet places no burden on them to reach any level of achievement or recognition in their given field. After all, true genius gets suppressed by the herd, lest the masses be shamed by the existence of such magnificence. Therefore, only mediocre writers get published, sell books and win Nobel Prizes, right? Audiences don't laugh at TRULY funny jokes... ad nauseum.Ironically, of course, THE FOUNTAINHEAD has enjoyed lots of commercial success. Therefore by Rand's own reasoning, the popularity of The Fountainhead would seem to contradict the ideas it espouses. Or perhaps Rand doesn't presume her own work to be genius. Perhaps Rand isn't the pompous, self-congratulatory, pretentious twit that the tone of The Fountainhead might suggest. Perhaps Rand possesses the humility not to suggest herself to be one of the persecuted geniuses of whom she's so fond of writing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"First of all, I'd like to warn that this is a review focusing not only on the book: the only reason it got so high in stars from me is because it has a good story. I'd like to focus a moment on the philosophy, because as Rand states this book is her one epitome of her philosophy.Think about it. Rand wants a world where people listen to reason, for reasons sake, because reason is God and there is one mode of reasoning that is the all-encompassing truth: and that is hers.Rand herself describes the book as philosophy put into form of a thriller. The fact is, if a person were to begin learning Rand's philosophy in its driest form with all the facts, and fewer immensely valorized events and characters, it would hardly hold the widespread appeal it holds to readers today. If she wanted to appeal solely to reason, Rand would not be openly resentful and effectively say \\"nobody's happy without my way of life\\".Rand belittles, indirectly, those who refuse to patronize Roark's art, but what if his art doesn't make them happy? Does this make them horrible people not to bend to his will? He refuses to give any ground himself. It seems to me like he is trying to force his will on everyone else JUST as much as he perceives all the \\"evil\\" people doing to each other in likewise fashion.The Fountainhead is an extremely biased book, and claims I try to force my values on everyone because I am occasionally kind to people without having purpose in doing so, and am unhappy because I act on my emotions once in awhile. If you think about it, why do these characters do what they do? Because being unfailing \\"reasonable\\", seeing themselves at war with the world, and whatnot else MAKES THEM HAPPY.I'm not Rand's printed heroes, so I know their actions and thinking would never make me happy; trust me, I've been down the road of zealotry toward objectivism for a long while, following my first reading of the Fountainhead at 17. My happiness outside Rand's thoughtbox wouldn't fit in the objectivist point of view because all her ideas are absolute and irrevocable. Kinda like God's decrees. However, I'm sure people are happy in this way and I won't stop you.In my opinion, this is has all the signs of a religious text, complete with all the zealotry, valorized characters and events, even absolute answers to the meaning of life. It's like a godless Bible. Religion for the atheist. Something vernacular one can believe in. Yet Rand says we should have heroes we can live up to: I challenge anyone to find anybody in real life that can be as completely Roark as Roark.This review is not to say Ayn Rand is a horrible author. She presents ideas that open my eyes to a different point of view, and certain points made I agree with in earnest. Also, philosophy aside the book is quite original (though, based very loosely on the life of the esteemed architect Frank Lloyd Wright), well written, and presented in a method that engages me quite well. I think Rand is a good author. But overall as a philosopher, I cannot take her seriously."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'm always amazed when anybody over the age of Twenty Five seems to think that THE FOUNTAINHEAD is a great book or that Ayn Rand was a serious philosopher. And I have read all of Rand's major works, fiction and non-fiction both, a number of times.Back in my early Twenties I attended a seminar where Her Nibs was speaking. If there is anything that will convince you that Ayn Rand is full of $&!%, it is listening to Rand berate her critics and belittle her supporters in equal measure. I came away from the experience realizing that Rand was an amoral huckster who made millions conning people into thinking she had something profound to say. She was also a woman who apparently sublimated her sex drive into sadistic humiliation. She practically glowed every time she uttered an insult, and they were constant. Her critics she dismissed as meaningless, and her fans she derided as being unable to think for themselves. But beyond a reflexive contrarianism she didn't seem to have much to say, other than to repeat all the stock phrases of Objectivism. In short, she was a very, very boring person to waste my time upon. (Spoken like a true Randian.)And so we come to THE FOUNTAINHEAD, a ponderous tome about a ponderous psychopath who lacks any kind of empathy or compassion. Howard Roark is a machine---albeit a flawless one---and the \\"villains\\" in this book all seem to be made out of banana pudding, a mass of subhumanity dedicated to feeding on each others' slowly necrotizing flesh. And those are the fun parts. Other than that, THE FOUNTAINHEAD just rambles colorlessly on and on like its creator, telling you it knows something you don't know.Objectivism isn't a philosophy, it's a structural framework for the justification of selfishness. Cold hard science has swept away Rand's idea of an objective reality separate from the observer. Her conceptualization of \\"rational self-interest\\" fails to go far enough to blossom into \\"enlightened self-interest,\\" an idea which includes the consideration of others' needs as well as one's own as part of creating one's existence as a complete whole. \\"Individualism\\" and \\"Egoism\\" are poorly developed concepts, suitable for a Piagetian manual on toilet training, but not applicable to the best that the human race can offer. Disagreeing with Rand does not, as she believed, make one an blithering idiot and agreeing with her does not make one a bootlicker.In sum, Rand tragically misunderstood human nature. Human beings such as Christ, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and others of their ilk, were neither Howard Roark nor banana pudding. They were people whose individuation had progressed so far that they transcended their egos. They were willing to make sacrifices OF THEMSELVES for the benefit of others; Rand simply disbelieves this is truly possible. She just hates people. And so, it certainly isn't possible in THE FOUNTAINHEAD. Rand, a Russian-Jewish refugee emigre from early Soviet Russia, should have known better. She didn't, and that's a clue to her immense self-absorption.The twin tragedies of THE FOUNTAINHEAD as representative of Rand's work are that it could have presented a real philosophy had she ever gotten out of her own way, and that, just because this is simplistic, it is easy for those of little moral acumen to hijack it for their own purposes.Need to read a lengthy book by a Russian author in order to learn how to live a complete life?

However, Ayn Rand's books deserve such an exception. I was completely taken aback by the subject matter and how profoundly it has affected me. The reason why I will not give away any description about the subject matter is because not only is it readily available but also because I think everyone should purchase this book and discover for themselves why her books are still in print. Rand's books should be read often and more than once. Universities should have all her books as required reading for freshmen; better yet they should have a specific Ayn Rand course where her books would be read and discussed for their meanings. This is my first read of any of Rand's books. I have also purchased ATLAS SHRUGGED and I am in the process of reading it. Just as impressed with this one as I was with THE FOUNTAINHEAD. What I did not realized is that these books are prolific so expect to handle about 2 lbs. of book. I guess for anyone who might want to go the easy way, the Kindle versions would be much easier to handle. However, I love to still turn the pages of an actual book in my hands and also enrich my library with great books."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I think this is one of those books you either love or hate.

So when I heard that Marc Cuban swore by Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" I ran here to Amazon to get it.Written in the mid 30's, this is a VERY wordy book. Don't misunderstand...I like to read and am not put off by words...but far too much time was spent describing one's dress or the shape of one's face or the color brick of a building or...Further, and more importantly, this is a book about unhappy people trying to find fulfillment in life without giving up their values and morals. On teh surface, that sounds Inspiring. However, 90% of the characters in this book are unscrupulous and immoral. The lone purvveyor of integrity goes thru life struggling to stay employed, and ultimately commits a crime so dangerous that you simply cannot understand how he's a 'good guy'.And speaking to THAT last point: when you read his Courtroom monolouge, and then see how the jury voted, you will laugh OUT LOUD. No, it's not meant to be funny. It's implausable. In fact, it's improbable.Perhaps in 1938 this was a motivational, inspirational tome.I think I'll stick to Brian Tracy and Tony Robbins."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand cracks me up a bit. I am a Senior studying philosophy and yet I have never heard her mentioned as an important philosopher, never seen her mentioned in contemporary philosophy or even seen any professor feel a need to respond to her. And yet she, and her followers claim they being the true gospel, the gospel of egoism. They claim to be a very influential philosophy.Howard Roark, the hero of the book (which is very well written and enjoyable as literature) is a sad, overly independent man who we are suppossed to love because of his fierce authenticity. But his unlikable independence comes across as an unrealistic, overly ascetic and uncaring egoist. He doesn't depend on anyone and feels only strongly when forcing himself on the world. He is the epitomie of Heidegger's technologically minded man, and as such an example of a most undesirable and dangerous mindset.Niezsche portrays a better ubermensch.Either way, this ignorance to the needs of others and the lack of any ethical duty (see Levinas) towards the other, results in the greedy (...)caste that run around screaming for less government intervention so they don't have to help anybody but themselves. As Pearl Jam would say: That's evolution baby!So feel free to read the book, enjoy it. But please don't think \\"objectivism\\" is coherent. And don't go around raping people because you think you are a Roark."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"That was easily the worst 704 leaves of book I have ever read. If that passes as entertainment in this country then I must be deluded. Never have I seen such bad writing. There wasn't a laugh to be found amid insipid, corny dialogue proving yet again that what is popular is rarely the most deserving. The book is never been more than a vehicle for the author to overwrite and make silly political proncouncements. It is all the infuriating that this untalented person should make such money. Of course I'm jealous, I'd love to make millions out of nothing. Who reads this rubbish?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It took me a long freakin time to read this book, but it has really changed my life and stuff.

I feel like I've been WAY too nice to women. Thanks, Ayn Rand!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Her philosophy doesn't make any sense to me. It's not logical and it's not human.

I can only say that it is the summary of the thousands of years' war of existence of the &quot;pure&quot; and individual human intelligence and desire. It is so special because it gives you a full source of stimulus that are passage ways to various flights inside yourself and your perceptions of outer world. Don't ever read it if you are not ready for a very big challenge."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Why add a review to a list of more than 130 reviews? Just to point out the very fact that unnervingly many people are so deeply touched by this book that they have to share their thoughts of it with others. Not only that, if you scan the list of reviews, you'll find that most reviewers either gave the book a five star score, or one very small star.This is to be expected. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a book of ideas, and very black-and-white ideas at that. The book agitates against commonly accepted philosophies in our society, against the ideals of altruism, spirituality and humility as opposed to egotism, rationalism and pride. A lot of people loathe these ideas, while others find they loathe the society that extolls them.Personally, I think this is one of the best books ever written. Part of that is that I think the prose and plot are magnificent (although I should add that these elements are very abstract and not everyone will like that). But what makes the book exceptional for me is the philosophy it expresses. The ideas Ayn Rand puts forth are ideas society tries to discourage because they are considered anti-social and therefore a-moral. Rand shows that, based on a philosophy which holds the rights of the individual as sacred, exactly the ideas which are generally considered to be social are a-moral.Beware, however, that the book is constructed to convince you of Ayn Rand's ideas, not to fairly express ideas that oppose it. For instance, you will find that almost every character that is an incarnation of one of the ideas Rand abhors, is an uncritisizing, sad, weasely, snivelling little creature, while the heroes are invariably shining stars. It's not that Rand cannot defend her ideas objectively, it's just that she has left that for her non-fiction work.If you are a rationalist, an individualist, or if you feel that society seems to award underachievement and punish productivity, you may very well find that &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is one of the books you will close in your heart. If not, you should probably leave it alone."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"But since then I have read some of the other reviews. Those who complained, I can not beleive the crap they came up with. One person said &quot;The Fountainhead was about two things, sex and architecture and if you see anything more to it you need to go play ball&quot;. A lot of them complained that it was too long, so I am sorry if this book was not as short and compact as your coloring books. I would like to tell anyone who plans to read this, or is thinking about it, that this book is NOT about architecture, and it is not about the number of pages, and it is not about pure entertainment (if you want that, get a romance novel and stop whining). It is about Howard Roark against the world. The characters are not supposed to be realistic, they are the extremes, but the ideas are by no means unrealistic. And it is also about great philosophy. So with THAT in mind, read it! - Comments are welcomed, this book DESERVES a good discussion."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have already written a review saying how much I liked this book. But I have now read a lot of the other reviews. This book is kind of like Howrd Roark, you love him (because you understand him), or hate him and wished to see him destroyed. I hope the irony is not lost on haters of this book. Most people who don't like this book don't say, &quot;I just didn't like this book&quot;. But they have something really violent sounding that makes it almost seems that they are yelling. Rand isn't telling people what to think or how to act, the fact that some people have become so negatively emotional about it says (to me) that it got it's message across. If you think this book is telling you what to think or how to act, (whether you liked it or not), I think you missed the point. Howard is not the model citizen and everyone should not act like that. My God I hope that everyone would not act like him. He chose to neither lead or follow and that made others hostile and threatened. I loved this book but I would never want to be Howard or anyone else in this book. I would only hope to be myself and no one else. If Peter just accepted himself and didn't worry about what other people thought and didn't need other people's acceptance he might have been happy. But he wouldn't have been a Roark clone by any means. But for those of you who hate this book so much, don't you think that you kind of resemble Ellsworth and how he wrote of Roark?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"are you prepared to have your beliefs stirred and shaken and jolted and electrified? if you are, it is time to be saturated with the power of the fountainhead. go on, pick it up, and you will never be the same again. you will learn about the kind of person you were not so sure ever really existed. he does exist, and your initial goosebumps will remain as you absorb the character of howard roark. he thrives in the fountainhead. this novel is pure exhilaration to read. once you complete it, howard roark will remain in you, whether you like it or not. the final step is up to you - do you choose to learn from howard roark? or do you choose to remain the same - the same as you have always been, and the same as everyone else is? again, i ask, are you ready?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"An individual fighting for survival in a society that refuses to accept him.

For those who haven't read Ayn Rand before, or if you forgot a bit like I had, a little refresher is in order. Ayn Rand considered herself quite a philosopher. Another reviewer had commented that she was a better story teller than a philosopher. Judging the book on the basis of either fiction or philosophy I would say it has not stood the test of time and therefor it's not a classic.The sign of a good story is that it quickly establishes an emotional link with the reader. That generally requires hitting on central human themes. The hero and heroine in the Fountainhead are so out of touch with normal human feelings and values as to make that connection imposible for me; they were mere stick people. The villan actually has more human characteristics but they are not enviable traits, he's a real sleaze. Without feeling some connection with the hero and/or the heroine there's very little to keep you turning the page.This was Ayn Rand first major work as a philosopher. In the days before MTV when attention spans were somewhat longer I still remember having trouble plowing through the long, rambling speeches that the main characters deliver while laying out Rand's philosophy. Today I simply have no patience for her pages-long sermons. Where Hemingway was known for short, concise sentences it seems Ayn Rand was seeking to expand her prose as though she was paid by the word."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have read this book three times and each time I am more disappointed. I really want to enjoy this novel, but, the writing is so dry, unimaginative and repetitive that I find it distracting. Yes, I get her ideas on objectivism, but do I need to be told about them 700 times? This is a bit like reading Mien Kampf in that I understand everything I need to know about the author's viewpoint in a 100 pages.Now, if the novel had beautiful prose, inspiring characters or an interesting story I might find it more enjoyable, but, the book is a didactic sledgehammer that makes me think of the worst aspects of propaganda. Maybe some people need that type of repitition to understand something. Perhaps this book should have been an essay instead of a weak attempt at a novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There were 3 instances in which I'd heard about \\"The Fountainhead\\". I decided to purchase the 3rd time. Although the characters were well developed I found myself skipping and or skimming large portions of the book. The long conversations were not holding my interest at all and 3/4 through the book I found myself wondering what was the purpose. As far as I'm concerned, this book is seriously overrated."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is an intriguing story about an amazing man whose individualistic ideas are unheard of. His struggles are well deserved due to his unmoving philosophy. However, I found myself sympathising with him. I recommend reading this novel because once you start you won't stop."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand saw art, including literature, as &quot;a selective re-creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value judgements&quot;. She was incapable of writing a &quot;day in the life&quot; story, warts and all. She wrote about &quot;how man ought to be&quot;, not how they are. She chose to highlight the contrast between good and evil, so that the reader would not be left guessing which character trait she endorsed. She was an eternal optimist, although one often wonders why.&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; achieves all of this in spades. Howard Roark is the most uncompromising Rand character IMHO. Through him, the message of Objectivism is in all honesty, rammed down the readers throat. It is difficult to escape, short of putting down the book. It is not a gentle introduction, but I'll wager her message was not lost on anyone who bothered to read the book in its entirety. To make a point, she gets in your face regardless of how you squirm, and lets you have it from several angles, just so there is no doubt.This book is not charming, it will not make you feel all warm and fuzzy, it does not attempt to boost your self esteem. Do we really need any more of those kinds of books? What it will do, if you read it through, is dare you to justify any actions you undertake other than for the sake of rational self interest. And before you write her off as a greedy ***** who couldn't give a damn about anyone but herself, ask yourself why she chose to publish her work in the face of a world conditioned to view such ideas as poison. I think she saw people as naturally rational, and refused to treat them as idiots, incapable of understanding her ideas. Ask yourself how many philosophers you can say that of today.Ayn Rand communicated her ideas in a second language ( English ) better than most do in there native tongue. Certainly better than any of her whiny collectivist critics. Give this book a read. It's definately worth the effort."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'll tell you, reading this book made me laugh several times and shake my head just as many. I loved it... for the first time I realized why so many people hated me... it was for being confident and self-fullfilled. Though I do not agree with much of what she says, this book truly did open my eyes to that fact. Though, to many people this book can be a life saver and a great help, it also has the potential of being a book who inspires a mad man. What I feel Rand did not understand was that njot everyone has the mental ability to grasp what she says, and these &quot;individuals&quot; need to be accepted and helped (altruism). She would rather leave them in the gutter than teach them to do their best (God forbid it is not THE best). Her views on male dominence are shocking to say the least (she is a woman?!?!). Though I am sure you will love her book and be persuaded by it, try to realize that it was written like the bible, with that purpose in mind and must be tak! en that way (though I believe so should the bible, atleast saying this about Rand is acceptable). Go out, buy the book... you will enjoy it, if not the philosophy and the message, than the story. It is also a great love story."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is a must for anyone who agrees or disagrees with tenants of capitalism. But this book goes much farther than that. This novel is an eye-opener today despite the fact that it was written decades ago. This is a book for the spirited realists among us who are rare yet crucial to our society. Some will hate this novel, but that is part of the greatness of it. This novel does not compromise or sell its soul."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this novel when I was 16 and wassn't able to put it down. I would try to read as a drove to school, during Physics class, and just about everywhere else. Rand has the ability to tell a story in such stark beauty, persision, and deatil, that one wants to not only read but become one with the novel. In the next four years I have read The Fountainhead numerous times. It has not only chnaged the way that I view literature, but the way that I view life, writing, and society. This is a book that all of society should be required to read, that is if there is a society....."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The first half of the book (as far as the Stoddard Temple episde) I'd have given five stars. Three reasons:Firstly you save yourself 300 pages of well below par material. It's unnecessary, rambles on and contradicts some aspects of the hero that were excellent in the first half. For example he goes from being completely innocent / naive / disinterested in what motivates others, to being somehow able to read people like a book.Secondly the philosophy of Objectivism is largely absent in the first half except as it appears through the characters. If you want to read the philosophical bit in plain words skip right to the end where there are two speaches (part 4 ch. 14 &amp; part 4 ch.18) about it. I warn you that after reading them you probably won't want to bother reading the book. I would suggest reading the first half and then stopping. If you should feel the pressure to finish the book, skipping ahead to the speaches should cure you of it. Objectivism, in my view! , and from only this book, is best appreciated when it is thought about least. Examining it in any detail you see it as absurd.Thirdly - and this is difficult to say clearly without giving away the ending/s - the book has so much more &quot;integrity&quot; if you stop at the end of part 2. Integrity is what the hero is about, and the book is about the hero."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ann Rand captures the true spirit of Western Civilization. Her timeless classic holds the individual above the sightless masses. It is a celebration of the human spirit that still remains very meaningful in today's chaotic world. (The 1949 movie does the story a great disservice.)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead, above all things, is a brutal vision of the world. I was torn by this book. Introduced to me by a bitter English teacher who had taken objectivism to his heart and soul, this novel kept me reading, without food or sleep, for two days. I cannot say that it is the greatest book I have ever read, for I have read better, but I can say that after reading The Fountainhead I could not help but think about the world, about my friends, and, most frightening of all, about myself, in a whole new light. Ayn Rand will make of the most torpid idiot, with a single brilliant, vicious stroke, a philosopher. I suggest you read Atlas Shrugged, and look for the description of Atlas, shoulders dripping blood, tears streaming from his eyes, bearing the world upon his shoulders. Rand believes, above all, in the ultimate greatness of man. A few hundred pages is a small prize to pay to share in her belief."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have read The Fountainhead several times, not surprisingly, everytime I understand it differently. The language is just fantastic and if one enjoys prose, I strongly recommend it. I mention this in part to respond to some of the rather less experienced reviewers who strangely found the book too long. The philosophy of Objectivism by no means a new concept, is portrayed in a great novel. A treat!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Must great literature be boring and tedious, filled with effeminate and exasperating despcriptions of household objects, completely void of plot, and concerned exclusively with the depths of human anxiety, paranoia, and depravity? Are Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison, Edith Wharton, and Thomas Mann the exclusive representatives of serious literature? NO! Ayn Rand's fabulous novel is everything... it is the overture to a philosophical system which few intelligent people fully appreciate, it is a thrilling page-turner, it is a delightfully sarcastic and witty parody of Modernism of the Joycean variety, and it is a steak driven mercilessly into the heart of weapy welfare statist &quot;love everyone!&quot; fools.*It's a long book, but we're all grown-ups and should make time to explore serious ideas.*It doesn't conform to the literary standards you're used to - intentionally! Don't try to judge it as you would &quot;Beloved&quot; or &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;! You will b! e as foolish as a man who tries to judge Shakespeare by the aesthetical standards of the beat writers! Take it for what it's worth, because Ayn Rand has deliberately and consciously created something unique.*Make up your own mind, don't take my word for it!

Think for your self!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've read this book in a Dutch translation. It was the first time I heard of Ayn Rand.This book was marvellous to read. The story of Roark is one of the victory of the individual over the mass. It is about a person's integrity, so difficult to keep in a society like ours. It was a great surprise to me to discover that this book was written in the first half of the century and moreover by a woman. Nor the subject, nor the style of writing can indicate this. The subject is timeless. I can understand some don't like this book very much because in this real world we don't often meet people like Roark. He belongs to a novel. We don't have to compare ourselves or others with such an ideal character. It didn't spoil my reading and I can only recommend this novel very much."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Amazing how most reviews either award five or one star. Its been five years since I read The Fountainhead as a senior in high school. Like many other impressionable youths, I was lured hook-line-and-sinker into her simplistic world of Roarks and Keatings. Of course, her philosophy, in its uncompromising form, is unworkable (indeed undesirable) in the real world. But that by no means suggests that we should discard it entirely. Rand has a lot to say about the strength and nobility of the human spirit and the independence of the human mind. The world would be a better (and more interesting) place were more people to follow some of her initiatives. Of course, her novel was meant as thinly-veiled philosophical propaganda. For that very reason, it is presented as black-and-white, like a checklist of rules for a happy life. To follow her philosophy blindly would be silly and immature. Philosophy exists only in the human mind. When one tries to apply it to real life, the smart person will always do so with a grain of salt.When it comes down to it, Rand wrote an important book, developed original characters, and a told strong, compelling story. Whether or not one agrees with her philosophy, these are good enough reasons to award it at least four stars."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Shows most of us the goals we should set for ourselves..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead was Ayn Rand's first of two powerful fiction works. The other being Atlas Shrugged. She tells a story about a man who lived his life for the embetterment of himself and his ideals. A great man. This book is life changing, no question about that. You will love every participle of her work or hate Ayn Rand's very existance. I believe it will be the prior than the latter."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I give this book five stars for many reasons. I developed deep respect for Howard Roark's profound intelligence and insights. Peter Keating keeps me on my toes throughout the book. I found myself leading a quest for his integrity. What I liked best about the book was the appreciation it gave me for the world concept of charity and gift giving. The world cannot afford for each individual to believe as Howard does. In the real world man requires more assistance from man than he acknowledges. Five stars for Ayn Rand's wisdom and insights. Perhaps the book is less about self and more about the importance of charity."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I haven't read the book. The funny thing is the readers' comment goes extreme... Hate the book or love it... Hummm.... I better check it out in the bookstore first..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is one of the greatest novels in world literature, tells of the desperate battle waged by architect Howard Roark, whose genius and integrity were as unyielding as granite.... Of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately but married his worst enemy.... Of fanatic hatred and denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great innovator. It poses one of the most challenging ideas ever presented in a work of fiction- that man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress. Nearly 60 years ago, the book created a public furor and a worldwide interest in its brilliant author. It is the story of a gifted young architect, his violent battle against conventional standards, and his explosive affair with a beautiful woman who struggled to defeat him. Ayn Rand's daringly original philosophy, Objectivism presented through this book is indeed most ingenious and radical ideas ever provided in modern literature. It tells the story of what an ideal man should be befittingly epitomized by Roark, who is dismissed from a premier college due to his non-conformist work, who has to face myriad barricades posed by the 'Moral Watch-Dogs' of the society, who conquers all odds and shows the world that second-hand knowledge is worthless- that a man should manifest some originality in his life so that unfathomable progress of mankind transpires, leading to a brave new world. The character of Peter Keating describes the man who borrows intelligence from repository, and wins people's hearts by his relentless sycophancy- only to lose his soul in the bargain. The novel explicates Gail Wynand the opulent &amp; omnipotent Newspaper Baron as the 'man who might have been'- who is in the fallacious belief that he controls the whole world, but realizes that he can manipulate men only as long he satisfies their desires. And finally the enduring character of Ellsworth Toohey as 'the man who can never be'-noted economist, noted social worker, noted-everything, who caters to the people's desideratum and exploits it to his advantage and nearly succeeds in becoming the undisputed ruler of the world. The novel tackles the interminable problem of the world's vilipend of an innovator's new creation- right from fire to the wheel. Against such Machiavellian actions, Rand advocates 'Selfishness' as the only weapon that can save originality from total destruction. By and large the best novel written to date! A celebration of human heroism and glory."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When I first read &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; after incessant raves by a friend, I was in awe. (I was and still am young.) I am no longer so impressed by this book. I once heard fans usually say they first read Rand in their late adolescence. This would explain why people become so enamored with her. People find this idealistic author during idealistic youth. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is divided into four parts: &quot;Peter Keating,&quot; &quot;Ellsworth M. Toohey,&quot; &quot;Gail Wynand,&quot; and &quot;Howard Roark.&quot; It is a story about those four men and the woman they all love, Dominique Francon. The thing about it is is that she only reciprocates the love for one of them, the architect Roark. Each section focuses primarily on its title subject, but once Dominique is introduced she takes over the protagonist role of the story. The problem with Rand in this book and &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; even more so, is she bludgeons you as with a blunt object with her &quot;message.&quot; This has not stopped me from reading more Rand, as I am currently reading &quot;We the Livng.&quot; &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is not as good as my friend and other Randians say it is, but it is not the pretentious drivel others say it is either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I think that this book has a lot of information on the independence of an odd person, in a society that has a straight approach one way to life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"in her representation of the world and its cruelties toward true human nature, any rand reveals her philosophy (objectivism) in an easy to read saga.

It appealed to me strongly at the age of 19 before I encountered middle age, chronic illness, child and elder care, and so on. The Fountainhead does make a good point that dependency is not to be cultivated and admired. There is far too much dependency in able-bodied adults in our society--gold brickers on workman's comp and disability, poor performers who blame a bad childhood, and so on. However, to suggest that the 5 or 6 billion people on the planet can operate as free agents is preposterous. The book also ignores the fact that humans are necessarily dependent on others from age 0 to 18 and after age 65 or 70 for most folks. Even those in the middle age ranges need others far more than they know or care to admit. A good read for the prime of life, but not much wisdom in this one."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's masterpiece uses fascinating, unforgettable characters and a well-researched treatise in architecture as a vehicle to prove up her philosophy of the individual vs. the &quot;collective&quot;. The unflinching determination of Howard Roark to stick by his ideals, despite constant rejection and failure, provides inspiration to the individualist in us all. We may lack his courage but we all share his dream of living life on our own terms. A must-read for anybody who has ever felt constrained by people in power that know less than they do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Absolutely the most eye opening book I have ever read!

My first thoughts were of Cliffs notes (there are none). Eventually, I read it. It has changed my life. I no longer look at people the same. I can't describe what it has done to my life and my soul."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am disturbed by the negative statements of those who didn't quite get this book. I was overwhelmed when I read the reviews. You either love the book or you hate it, which certainly ranks it right on top in controversial books. I enjoyed this book every step of the (granted long but rewarding) way. Howard and Dominique are very interesting, thought-provoking characters that can literally change your views about life. It contains revolutionary ideas or free thought that are very important in our forever changing world. Imagine, for a minute, what the world would be like if no one spoke out against the communist philosophy. If you were forced to live under communism, you wouldn't have the choice to read this book, but you would certainly have a real understanding of its meaning. This book is about the most precious thing that we have...LIFE and Rand's philosophy of getting the most out of it! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead does not need to be the basis of your life philosophy to be inspiring. I don't believe Ayn Rand meant Howard Roark to be someone you would meet on the street. He epitimised her goal in life, not her best friend or herself. The goal of her theories is to instill selfcenteredness in ones life. You can't be all you can be unless you pulled it from deep within yourself. I reread this book after many years and found myself assuming her ideas were a little extreme. I felt is was unlikely that society today wouldn't recognise genius when it presented itself. I then remembered how in the late 70's a young lady was selected to design a mounument. Her design was inspired and oh so simple. The design was blasted from all sides as being unamerican. The design was built anyway. This amazing piece of landscape architecture is the Vietnam War Memorial. I wonder what Ayn Rand thought at the time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ok, I'll admit it; I first picked up The Fountainhead because I needed to read it for a scholarship program. But, as I got further into the book, I realized that I really enjoyed it. This book is one of the most philosophical I have ever read; the reader really has to think about what Ayn Rand is really trying to say. Her message, among others, is: Don't conform. After reading The Fountainhead, I reassessed my life and I have now completely changed my goals. This book helped me to realize what I really wanted from life, not what society wants me to have. A great read!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Wow. Set aside the philosophical arguments. Please. Hands down, this novel was one of the best I've read. Not because of any literary prowess or commanding plot. This book really made me think. It is rare that one can sit down, for pleasure, read a book, for pleasure, and accidentally fumble upon a set of views that challenge those previously held. While The Fountainhead made me consider my ethics, it also altered them. I shall not delve into how. This is what the book is all about. This is why I give it such a high rating. Miss Rand succeeded in telling an idealistic story of the ideal man.While he may not change us fully, Howard Roark makes us look in the mirror a tad more closely."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a book meant for the intellectual. Ayn Rand expresses her philosophy of Objectivism through Howard Roark marvelously. Even the most devout altruist may reconsider his beliefs after reading this novel. Egoism as the fountainhead of human existance is an idea that can not be challenged easily."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book elicited so much passion from me, that I have to say it might be the greatest novel I have ever read. The philosophy Ms Rand presents is wholly horrifying - and absolutely captivating. I found myself hating her in one thought and filled with pure admiration for her talent the next. She drags the reader through a whirlwind emotions not the least of which is disgust. In the midst of a philosophy that holds selfishness as the highest good, one is forced to admit that when presented as Ayn Rand presents it, it makes a scary kind of sense. It is the only book I have ever read that made me agree and disagree with equal measure. It is truly a literary masterpiece, and even if you cannot agree with her (which you most likely won't) you are forced to admit the novel fully accomplishes that which it was intended - to challenge every standard that Americans hold dear."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is a wonderful novel--don't be put off by its length, every page is worth reading! Although, beginning Randians may want to start out with &quot;Anthem&quot; before reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. This novel is perfect for anyone interested in politics, philosophy, architecture, or the freedom of the human spirit. Compare the novel to its pathetic movie adaptation--Rand really sold out by letting her seminal work be butchered the way it was by the film industry. Anyone interested in reading other works about freedom of thought (and freedom from the enslavement of orthodox religion) should read WILLIAM BLAKE--particularly &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, &quot;Milton&quot; and &quot;The Four Zoas&quot;.

I have re-read it four times and still believe it is one of the most important pieces of modern literature ever written. It is only eclipsed by her masterpiece, Atlas Shrugged.P.S.

The plot is decent, though nothing to rave about as others do; for an explication of it I point you to the plot summary above. My biggest complaint with Rand's literature is her characters.Here, as elsewhere in her corpus of writings, characters serve merely as mouthpieces for philosophical ideals. Out with psychological realism, out with any sort of compelling, human elements--here we see \\"ideal men\\" who be either pinnacles of perfection, or paradigms of evil. Some proclaim the originality of this, but I can point out myriad cases in which other authors have attempted to create archetypes of various ideals; none of them are very compelling, despite being far better framed and in the hands of far more skilled writers than Rand.Take, for example, Alyosha from Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky is a phenomenal writer, yet even he could not save his \\"hero\\" from failure as a compelling character; Mitya and, especially, Ivan, steal the book and redeem it. Some will debate me, and say Rand's characters ARE in fact compelling; I ask them to read a play of Shakespeare, or look at Satan in Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\", or Prince Andrei and Pierre in Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace,\\" (the peaks of great characters), and still try to tell me Rand's characters are interesting. They are flat, two-dimensional, and boring; they are not human. Her language, too, is flat; her ideas are nothing original; and by no measure of literary greatness does THE FOUNTAINHEAD stand strong.THE FOUNTAINHEAD as Philosophy:I must admit that seeing Rand's \\"Objectivism\\" accepted in many philosophy departments (including my own university's) as genuine pains me greatly. I will not attack her philosophy point-by-point; that belongs more appropriately in a review of her main philosophical work, \\"The Virtue of Selfishness.\\" Instead, I dispute the originality and \\"freshness\\" of her philosophy, two qualities many claim on Rand's behalf. A deeper study of her ideas shows one that the philosophy expressed in THE FOUNTAINHEAD and in her other works, is little more than a gleaning of ideas from Stoicism, Nietzsche, and, ironically, Kant (she railed against Kant, probably in an attempt to disguise his influence upon her; much in the same way T.S. Eliot decried Whitman to hide his debt). Randianism is an amalgam of these other philosophers' ideas, and nothing new or fresh. Her presentation isn't even fresh; the philosophical novel is not a new idea, and has been done better elsewhere: look to Voltaire's \\"Candide,\\" Dr. Johnson's \\"Rasselas,\\" Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace.\\"If you like Randianism, fine. I can do little to change that. My only wish is that Randians would admit her debt to truly great philosophers like the Stoics, and, most especially, Immanuel Kant. I expect that the Randians, who often act in a sheepish cult-like manner (ironic for a group that preaches \\"individualism\\"), will rate this review, as they rate every negative review of Rand, quite lowly. So be it..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Clumsy prose, laughable characterizations, ludicrous dialogue and offensive philosophical underpinnings--truly the most irritating, poorly written book I've ever (almost) finished reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My dislike for the book is based on her message. It was well written and to-the-point. The dividing line between loving the book and not is far simpler, however. Capitalists love it; socialists do not. One-size-fits-all folks like it; the compassionate do not. Competitive enjoy it; the communal/cooperative do not.And for many, particularly Americans, both Rand and the reader will often confuse socialism for communism. Vaguely 'speaking,' socialism is the Marxist-Lenin system between capitalism and communism. Whereas capitalism is primarily an economic construct and democracy a political one, socialism is somewhat of a mix. Each of these constructs can be mutually exclusive as Sweden is a social democracy.Rand touts the virtues of capitalism, which it surely has. On the other hand, we can travel to countries like Sweden and The Netherlands and see a well-off culture with plenty of freedoms... and no homeless to be found. There's still a range of not-so-well-off and wealthy, but not billionaires in the face of the homeless.If we allow ourselves to look at our fellow country folk as we do our family - us, perhaps we can have more compassion and understand that medical coverage for all, for example, is for the best for the society at large. Similarly, thanks to taxes, we share lots of common pleasantries like roads.What American capitalists fail to realize is that pure capitalism doesn't work around the world the way it does for the U.S. For the U.S. to maintain its power and standard of living, we change the rules and subsidize our farmers when we compete with New Zealand. We impose tariffs on countries like New Zealand that can produce our same goods for a fraction. These actions admit capitalism's faults.What's more, a successful capitalist democracy requires that value be invented upon. Value is based on demand instead of actual cost to produce. Not only is value based on demand, but also on availability - even if a good's availability if artificially controlled as are diamonds. Communism, on the other hand, while fraught with other issues, requires that value reflect the cost to produce.As if this isn't enough, capitalism turns us into consumer addicts. How many times have we heard Bush suggest we go out and spend to support our economy? With an affluent European Union touting a larger population than the U.S., it's imperative that we out-spend them, so we're advertised to, over fed, and are encouraged to assume far larger sums of debt. Americans have become consuming robots and they're taught it will make them happy all for the sake of remaining the most powerful.This is the kind of competition and beastliness capitalism breeds. We're not talking about the controlled society of the former Soviet Union. The controlled society was a victim of communism.If socialists are at the mercy of government, capitalists are at the mercy of CEOs they didn't even elect. CEOs that when their businesses make large profits, do not have to pass it on, but can get together w/ the competition and keep prices where they like. Instead of passing profits on to the little people, the ones without medical coverage, for example, they can simply Ritz Carlton around the world and no one can remove them from power.Finally, what's moral isn't black and white. There is a world beyond our homes, surprisingly enough. Our realities are not universal. Our daily expectations aren't carbon copied around the world. Indeed, within the same day one can sacredly sacrifice an animal, fly north and be locked up for doing the same thing.I disagree with Rand mostly because I see my fellow country folk as I do a family. If my sister is struggling, I help her with whatever it is I have to offer. I don't sit back, hoarding what I rightfully learned or amassed and preach that if I can do it, she can. I help and I expect the same in return when/if I should need it. That is a communal, collective, compassionate lifestyle where everyone wins because help extends far beyond money; time can even be 'socialized' in exchange for other commodities. It's much bigger than the dollar.In the end, Rand simply has a bone to pick with her place of birth, the Soviet Union. Don't let her play on your indoctrinated fears of that which was associated with the U.S.S.R. Think for yourselves.If you're a die-hard fiscal conservative, you can be a Rand fan and still consider yourself an intellect. If you believe the well-connected, affluent and most disciplined CEOs should lead you and not well-connected, affluent and most disciplines people of your choosing, Rand is for you.My beef is with Rand's belief, not the presentation. We simply have differing beliefs and therefore differing arguments. Aside from that, the book is pretty well-written and held my interest.When you understand each of Rand's characters represent ideologies, you'll realize it's as much propaganda as this review is."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Just like the cut-line says. Forget all of the slams and adoration. If you want to be challenged, to be forced to look at yourself and society around you and then, make comparisons with the America of the late '90s, you must read this book.

Before I read this book, I didn't know books like this existed. Greatly written, Ayn Rand, a champion of intellect portrays one who will not break for what he knows as wrong. One of the best books I have read, all 727 pages of it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A bit long, but a fulfilling read in the end. The Objectivism theory certainly has its good points, though taken to the extreme it would make the world populated by insensitive, uncaring bastards like Roark.There doesn't have to be an absolute choice, altuism or selfishness: you can practice both and still be true to your soul. But woe to those who become second-handers - they are the mesmerized zombies of society.There is not a likable character in this book, but it's still oddly compelling to read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"i mean i"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As far as summer reading goes, I think this has been my favorite.. but my opinion may be biased as Moby Dick was last summer. I don't object to Rand's philosophy in the novel. What I liked was that it was interesting, enjoyable, and I didn't feel like I was reading fluff. I personally read books for pure enjoyment (except when the school requires it) and I found that surprisingly _The Fountainhead_ was a good book. While I don't agree with Rand's philosophy, I definitely found it an interesting theory. So I would recommend to anyone to read this book. :)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand might not have eloquent prose or the same writing method as Michael Ondaatje. She might, at times, even write poorly and less than adequate. No matter what is said about how this book is written, no matter how many critiques are made about her style, her message still remains strong and clear. Her message still remains truthful and honest. There is no other novel that displays so concisely the life of someone who defeats the odds by his individuality. I realize that this novel brings controversy along with it because Ayn Rand did not believe in God. Well this book is not about God; it is about the triumph of the human spirit. It is about the true meaning of life. It is about living as an individual and not compromising by conforming. I was captivated by this book. I could not put it down. It made so much sense to me. I could see what Rand was writing about all over the place- Hollywood, Washington, in the media. It is rampant. I see mediocrity being crowned as brilliance. I see power hungry individuals who have sold their soul to domination. There is no evil in this novel. It is the refutation of all evil. It teaches that one must activate their potential and not sell it, not waste it, not give it away to the causes of another person. One must live life their way- or there is no reason to live in the first place. I disagree with the so-called intelligentsias who claim that Rand is copying other people's ideas. Her ideas are methodical indeed, and she does build upon other thoughts. (See Howard Roark's testimony on the evolution of mankind). Ayn Rand makes a statement to the world loudly and clearly. It is essential to learn your past, to utilize your past, but not to copy it. The future is a time when the past must be built upon, not copied. Her philosophy follows the same train of thought. I highly recommend this book to any person with an open mind. It will forever change your life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you want to be inpired, I highly recommend to you this book. It is simply amazing. This book has changed my life and opened my eyes to many things in life. And after you've read this one, read Atlas Shrugged, it's just as great."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The people who have slagged off this book in these reviews have really missed the point. They fear a world where they have to actually take responsibility for their own lives and their own actions. The book perfectly explains how to get your life in order by establishing the importance of personal integrity. If you want to understand why the insecure people put down the magnificence of this novel, then read it. Then you'll understand that like basically everyone, they saw similarities between themselves and some of the characters. As the novel goes on, they realise that what they thought were qualities in themselves were actually negatives and realised that they themselves try to force their opinion on everyone - explaining their need to come here and try to destroy other peoples' chance at true happiness. Howard Roark is an example of what we should always strive for - look after yourself, stand up for yourself, and never really care what others think of you as long as you're not interfering in their lives. In the spirit of the book and keeping in line with its core message - read it and decide for yourself. People who truly understand the book won't try and make you read it, but those who were scared to admit to themselves that they lack integrity and are obsessed with trying to control everyone (ie. those who make negative comments about this novel) will try and influence you not to read it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I cannot believe it has taken me so long to discover Ayn Rand! The Fountainhead was an excellent introduction to her and her objective philosophy. Poetic writing, expertly weaved plot, and unforgettable characters...what's not to love?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I had always heard of Ayn Rand and I had seen her large major works at the book store, and I had even done a little research on her to see what all the hooplah was about her philosophy of objectivism. So I really didn't know what to think when I began this book. Would it read like a super-long essay with a thin plot spread over the top? Would it be a \\"preachy\\" novel? or would it just be boring? I was prepared for almost anything except what I got which was a nicely developed story with wonderfully complex characters.On the surface, this is a story about architecture and the men and women of that industry in early 20th century New York. But really it's about a handful of characters who represent certain archetypes that Ms Rand uses to codify her objectivism philosophy. Howard Roark is the perfect man in her philosphy, unwilling to compromise one iota for his art even if it means near starvation as an architect. He is indifferent to the opinions of others and therefore \\"the one who is as man should be.\\" Peter Keating is \\"the man who couldn't be successful but doesn't know it.\\" Unlike Roark, he patterns his art after others, rationalizing that if he does the same thing then he will also be successful. Ultimately he is passed by because he just doesn't understand the neccessity of originality. Ellsworth Toohey knows he will never be successful in the same vein and so becomes successful at destroying others. He is the \\"man who couldn't be and knows it.\\" And then Gail Wynand is the \\"one that could have been.\\" Rising from poverty to be a powerful media mogul, he chooses to try to control others rather than create for himself. I'll leave it to others to debate the relative merits of Ms Rand's philosophy but for me, the characters and how they interact are prime; a great novel is a great novel because of the writing, the setting, the characters, the style, the plot, etc. And this is a great novel.Is it perfect? No, I don't think so, even if one ignores the underlying phiosophy and only looks at it from a novel writing perspective. There are long passages where one character spews forth their point of view, detailing their particular philosophy on the nature of what makes for a good society, or a good relationship, or even on the very nature of good and evil, etc. Some people say this is \\"stilted\\" dialogue and I concur. It just wasn't realistic.The novel is broken down into four parts, one for each of the main characters. That section tends to have more of the story presented from that person's point of view but the overall plot is consistent and chronological. The plot itself is masterful and includes elements of revenge, intrigue, power plays, romance, and courtroom drama. The pacing is spot on, driving the plot towards its powerful conclusion. I highly recommend this novel, whether reading for sheer pleasure or for a launching platform for philosophical discussions."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I found the Fountainhead to be amazingly insightful. Its story of manipulation for the purposes of achieving power and advancing social agendas gives the readers an inside look at the problems facing our society even today."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"One of my favorites. Have read it twice. A must read for today's world."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead, a book that is worshipped for its creator's ideals, is often put forth as a great collection of philosophy. Its general idea is that only through the greatness of the singular human spirit can greatness be accomplished. Collective knowledge fails, and if everyone is given freedom the world would be perfect.The book is long, the characters are unreal, and the story deteriorates as the character's become less of themselves and more as vectors for Rand's philosophy. She forgets that they have specific characteristics and they become dull and flat throughout. She condemns any person believing in helping their fellow man as Collectivists, portraying them as evil through the story.Rand's philosophy comes more to the front than the characters do. Unlike Anthem, where her ideals were acting on the characters, The Fountainhead's characters are acting on the philosophy. They act on nothing but extremes: either following her rules or blatantly deny everything she believes. She twists the quotes she uses to make the antagonists unlikeable. They have no souls.The main character, Howard Roark, was her idea of the perfect man. The book was written about, and for, him. He isn't human, he is her philosophy. It seems as if the whole world is against him: a very typical stance.All in all, this isn't a book I would read again. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Ayn Rand's philosophies, but not as a pleasurable read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In \\"The Fountainhead,\\" Ayn Rand discusses the philosophy which was most important to her and should be most important to you. The power of the inividual and the independent nature of him, she argues, is the base of all subsequent motions one will make in life.She argues very eloquently, through characters that entice you, disgust you, and enamour you, that reason is the only thing that man can rely on. Often, she says, men are just a shell containing the opinions of others.More to the point than \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this novel is the foundation for Rand's other theories and is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand out-did herself on this book. Though usually overshadowed by Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is arguably Rand's greatest piece. It is the true story of a hero with his back against the wall, in a struggle to fight for what is right. For all of you socialists out there, pay close attention to Ellsworth Toohey- it might be like looking in the mirror."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand has the uncanny ability to bring to life heroes of epic proportions. In The Fountainhead her theme is the role of an independant mind in shaping one's life as opposed to living as a second-hander who conforms to the mob and acts selflessly. Through the progression of the hero's career, Rand demonstrates the practicallity of principled action based on self-interest. It is amazing how simple this idea is yet even more amazing how few people have fully appreciated its power.If you have never read Rand, this is a good book to start with. take your time and enjoy it, and when you are done get Atlas Shrugged as soon as you can. Then prepare yourself to really start living!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is an astonishing work of major philosophical importance as Ayn Rand presents Objectivism to the world. In my opinion it isn't as good as Atlas Shrugged, but that's not to say this book is bad. On the contrary, it is quite good and many authors would be lucky to do as well as Rand did with this one.The novel is about, as Rand later stated, \\"individualism and collectivism in man's soul.\\" Roark represents Rand's heroic man (the ideal we should all strive for). He is the ultimate creator. In his profession, architecture, he is second to none. The antagonists are many, but the main villian in the novel is represtented by Toohey, the penultimate second-hander.Throughout the novel these two characters are competing against one another, although sometimes Roark isn't aware of the fact that Toohey is the cause of most of his problems. As a matter of fact, Roark doesn't care. He continues to stick to his principles and struggles on.The interesting thing is that Roark is the mover, Toohey the destroyer and Keating (a fellow architect if you want to see him as that) is the ultimate leech. Keating depends on Roark to get him through college, through his early days at the firm, through almost everything and yet hates him for it. Toohey is the master manipulator of public opinion (I often think of people like Bill Clinton when I think of Toohey) while Keating reminds me of the environmental-Nazi's and their total dependence upon (and hatred of) technology.The only problem I had with the book was the language. Oftentimes the characters speak in a stilted, wooden way. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose or due to the fact that Ms. Rand's first language was Russian. I must say that it wasn't really a distraction and almost not worth mentioning.Finally, as with Atlas Shrugged, is that you can take the themes and characters and see them in our modern everyday life. There are plenty of people like Keating, Toohey and even Roark. This is a timeless novel and certainly one of my favorites. If you've never read any of Ms. Rand's works this is a good place to start. Just remeber the character's aren't meant to be believable and real, but arch-types of various themes/ideas."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was an entertaining read. The characters were well developed and the story very engaging. I found Peter Keating the most interesting character of them all. This book does take some time to get going and the end was a letdown.

Forget all the arguments by supporters and detractors of &#8220;Objectivism&#8221; and just read it for the pleasure of a well-written story.

Kids who read The Fountainhead have seldom ever read or have a clear understanding of politics, philosophy, and sociology. After reading The Fountainhead kids will come away parroting Ayn Rand's polemics. Kids who read The Fountainhead remind me of kids who used to study the works of Karl Marx in the 60s and 70s: they put down the book thinking they now have all the answers to life. Most kids abandon objectivism (like kids in the 60s and 70s abandoned socialism) after they experience life. But, oh, how annoying they can be until then!

The author's thoughts emanate throughout all characters and are apparent in all the pages. Upon reading this novel be prepared for this one person's controversial thoughts, (with holes in her philosophy), on politics, ideals and livelihood for the long 700 plus pages.Taken as a novel, the book is far from being brilliant. Lacking realistic characters, lacking character development and change, this novel simply lacks. The two dimensional characters are set out to be a certain way and that is the way they remain. This stagnation in my opinion makes poor novels. Good novelists create real people experiencing a wide range of believable emotions and a deep penetration into their psychosis. Great novelists can create these characters and document a change throughout the course of the novel keeping to the deep penetration into the psychological insights of the characters.The weakest part of the novel was the melodramatic dialogue and unbelievable character interactions. What were Roark and Dominique doing to each other? Their relationship went beyond even the ideals of romanticism to the ideals of nonsensical. It was not hot or passionate or seeking the highest concepts of love but rather was over the top, unrealistic and just plain weird.The writing has no aesthetic value, no beautiful use of words or combination of word, no mood enhancing sentence rhythms, no flow from sentence to sentence or chapter to chapter. The primary purpose of the writing was to get the point across, similar to an averagely written article.Setting the book as a novel and the writing style aside, I think Rand's intention was to express her philosophy. This can explain why she creates the characters as they are and as I described them, not as real people but rather as ideals, and notions. This fact that the characters are unreal is not only the flaw in the novel but the flaw in the philosophy.It fails because she creates a human being that is perfect. No one can create a building as good as Roark. He is never wrong and it is taken for granted anything he touches is perfection. In real life no one is perfect. People can be great at what they do but not perfect. Therefore, it is possible that a real person who is a genius, (but not perfect) might miss something or make a mistake. Therefore, it is necessary that other people are needed to create things as close to perfection as possible. Getting many minds together working COOPERATIVELY is more powerful and greater than one. Rand confuses creating works of art, where the one artist makes his/her personal expression versus a thing of practicality and necessity such as buildings.Rand promotes the idea of working only for yourself and having selfish goals. While working or caring for others is the most horrid, base premise only for the weak or the corrupt. She contrives to make the one who helps other, (Toohey) the epitomy of corruption and I would even go as far as to say Diabolically evil (which is also stupid, characters like that should only be in stories like star wars or lord of the rings).I would like to ask Rand, can you create and work for yourself and yet for others. Can it be possible that a human being can have a heart, likes people and gets the greatest personal reward (or selfish goal) from seeing other peoples lives improved or alleviating suffering or hardship? Can the only reward someone gets is producing/creating some inanimate object such as a building? Maybe people make you happy. An individual can have a selfish goal to make people happy, it is what makes this individual happy, and it has an affect of making people better off as well.Her philosophy promotes the creator or the genius. How many people in society does this encompass? In other words, it is a philosophy for the elite. It makes sense and sounds good on paper, similar to her antithesis (Marx and Lenin); however these are philosophies not for this world. A combination of the philosophies or a meeting in the middle is the most realistic. It seems at times like the purpose of this novel was to put down a theory of government she was against.The books greatest achievement is the creation of a character we can all try to emulate. Roark's intense individualistic spirit is something we can all strive for. He knows what he wants and asserts himself one hundred percent never compromising who he is no matter what circumstances befall him or who attempts to manipulate him.Her philosophy on livelihood is also displayed in the book. All actions, words and movement have the most vital dramatic purposes creating a very heavy tone and being devoid of all humor. I believe she promotes this intense profoundness in life. I on the other hand believe living this way can lead to unhappiness. I'd be curious to know if Rand was a happy person. It is important to be able to laugh at life and even yourself and take things some what light heartedly since there are so many unforeseen circumstances completely out of ones control.Despite all of this the philosophy was obviously thought provoking, has substance and really is saying something. It is controversial material and I thought I saw a tremendous amount of holes in her reasoning which further reinforced my own beliefs. However Howard Roark's individualism and integrity is something that all can look to strive towards and I thank the person for bringing this book to my attention for all the thought derived from it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you love listening to Orly Taitz for hours on end, you'll love Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I was incredibly engaged in this book when I first started it. 70 pages in I was excited about where this story was going.

There is no gray in this book. Every aspect of it is hardcore extreme in its stance. I never finished the book.

The diverse, yet familiar, characters captivate the reader in a tale of love, lust, power, and fame. With twists and surprises that always keep the audience guessing, this book is one that you won't be able to put down.Howard Roark and Peter Keating are two architects with contrasting moral values. With the help of Ellsworth Toohey, a very influential critic and advocate of collectivism and aitruism, Keating gets fame and money, but quickly realizes that he only achieved success with help from others and can not stand on his own when deserted. Roark does not depend on others and is not motivated by fame or money. He relies on only himself and the integrity of his work to get him places.Dominique Francon refuses to share things she loves with the world that she deems unworthy. She loves Roark but cannot allow herself to be with him. Instead, she marries Peter Keating and then Gail Wynand, a wealthy newspaper tycoon who sacrificed his soul for power and control.This novel depicts the complex relationships of these characters and their views of society and the world. Their morals and emotions make them come alive and the way they change and grow throughout the story makes them so real! This book really is a must-read that is entertaining as well as thought-provoking. Pick one up as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand tells the story of Howard Roark, an architect who struggles in his career in New York City. Roark is a strong believer in creating for oneself, which is basically the theme of the book: stay true to oneself and do not submit to collectivism. For example, he refuses to design buildings modeled after historical buildings such as the Parthenon. However, this historical style is greatly desired, and Roark meets hardships that come along with refusing to conform to society's norms.In the book, Howard Roark is expelled from architectural school because he designs are so unorthodox. He moves to New York City, where he finds work in an architecture firm with a man whose buildings are similar to his. Roark's companion, Peter Keating, also moves to New York to be an architect. However, he builds buildings that are well-liked and popular. Roark struggles for a long time, trying to give his creations to the world, but they are rejected by most people.Peter Keating is a popular guy, and everyone is drawn to him. He uses people to get ahead, which is kind of a not nice thing. He even uses Roark's talent to win a contest designing a building. Peter befriends a journalist named Ellsworth Toohey, who hates Roark and all forms of egoism. Toohey believes in being completely unselfish because that is the only way to be happy. But I think that's really stupid. Anyway, Roark goes to work at a granite quarry because he needs money. He meets there a woman named Dominique. She is really attracted to Roark, but he leaves before she knows his name.Keating really wants Dominique because she's beautiful, but she is pretty much disgusted by him. Then Dominique and Roark meet again at a party in New York, and they fall in love all over again. But Dominique doesn't like that she submitted to love, so she punishes herself by marrying Keating. Roark is sad.Gail Wynand is a crazy powerful man. He owns a newspaper called The Banner, for which Toohey writes. Gail is all about power and making money. He likes things to be efficient. He meets Dominique and wants her too. So he trades Peter for Dominique by offering him a lot of money. Dominique and Gail get married. Gail Wynand befriends Roark because they are both very similar. Roark builds a building for Gail, and they go on his yacht a lot.Keating goes to Toohey because no one wants his buildings anymore. Toohey tells him to design an efficient housing project called Cortlandt Homes. Keating is a failure, and he can't do it. He goes to Roark for help. Roark agrees to build the homes, but he requires that they not be altered in any way. Keating agrees. The plans are changed by fellow developers, and Roark is upset because the contract was broken. He goes and blows up the construction site.At the trial, Roark explains that he did so because he gave the world a gift, and by changing it, the gift was no longer his and it must be destroyed by its creator. He gives a really long speech about being true to oneself and that altruism is not a good thing. Toohey really hates Roark because of this belief. To see if he is proclaimed guilty or not-guilty, you'll have to read the book.I really enjoyed The Fountainhead for the most part, but toward the end I had a hard time motivating myself to finish because I already knew the ending. A daunting thing is the fact that it is about 700 pages, but it is well worth the read. I highly recommend this for anyone if they like a challenge and really want to think about Ayn Rand's philosophy, objectivism. It really opens one's eyes."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"amazing work of philosophy wrapped in a novel. ayn rand is standard reading for any new intellectual or objectivist. The book is a great read for those looking to branch into something new. I came from Dellilo, Vonnegut, Palahniuk, and most recently ayn rand's Anthem. This was the next step, followed by Atlas Shrugged. I recommend it to anyone looking to expand their horizons on what it is to be an individual living in such a large, homogenized world."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Based on recommendations of several friends, I picked up Atlas Shrugged - but also Ayn Rand's earlier book, The Fountainhead. In the interest of easing into these large books, I picked the shorter, earlier work. A few weeks after finishing the book, I am still turning the ideas over in the back of my mind. As The Fountainhead is a novel written by Rand to explain her philosophy of objectivism, it is both entertaining and thought-provoking. All the while one reads this book, it helps to remember the historical setting. Published in 1943, socialism/collectivism as a philosophy of government and society were ascendant; capitalism/individualism was unfashionable in the aftermath of the Great Depression and World War I, and in the turmoil the ongoing Second World War. To those without the experience of collectivism and seeking to make sense of the tumultuous 20th century, this new philosophy had a broad appeal. Rand had a first hand taste of collectivism when her family's St. Petersburg pharmacy was confiscated by the Bolsheviks around 1920. She arrived in New York in 1926, having already developed a lifelong hatred of collectivism in all its forms.The Fountainhead was written by Rand to explain her philosophy of objectivism. So while it is a good story, it is also (primarily) a book of ideas. The story centers around four main characters: Howard Roark & Peter Keating who travel dramatically different roads to grow from architecture students to become very different men; Ellsworth Toohey, a cynical and scheming leader/manipulater of men whose life goal is to further the cause of socialism/collectivism in the United States with himself as leader; Gail Wynand, a seedy newspaper mogul who possesses a surprisingly strong conscience and intellect in contrast to his flagship tabloid publication.Roark is Rand's ideal: a man equally unbending in his principles in the face of vicious public criticism or lavish support, moreover he is almost entirely unaffected by his detractors. Keating is precisely the opposite, a man who only lives to beg, borrow or steal the affections and praise of others. Keating manages to be highly successful in a leading architectural firm, while secretly turning to Roark for help on his greatest projects. The inner conflict that naturally arises from his double life makes him a lackey (friend in Keating's mind) of Toohey. Toohey makes Keating feel good about himself while lavishly praising his mediocre architectural achievements in an influential column that Toohey writes in Wynand's newspaper. Toohey purposely supports the mediocrity of Keating and others because he aims to deny - even destroy - the existence of surpassing individual achievements that are the antithesis of a collectivist society. Toohey masterfully uses Wynand's newspaper as a platform for his views, yet in such a manner that few realize the eventual implications before it's too late - least of all Wynand. Finally, Dominique Francon is a singularly beautiful and brilliant woman who plays her own critical role in the lives of each of these men. Dominique's character experiences the most changes of any of the characters in the story. Her complicated relationships with each of them are variously based on love and hate, principle and expediency.All aspects of The Fountainhead serve to illuminate ideas; as a result, readers may note the lack of change and growth in main characters whose largely static identities are necessary to the story. Further, these ideas are presented forcefully in black and white, leaving little room for real world shades of gray. The treatment of love and sex in the story will strike many readers as cynical or even offensive, while Rand's atheism is particularly strong. Readers who can set aside personal differences (such as they exist) with the author, however, will enjoy a book that inspires through its praise of achievement over mediocrity, and will also have an opportunity to reexamine their own beliefs on relationships, culture and society. The Fountainhead is an American literary classic, as relevant to our lives today as it was almost 65 years ago."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In the introduction to the 25th Anniversary Edition, Ayn Rand suggests that she meant for her book to deal with the notion of the \\"ideal man.\\"I do not think Rand was successful. Howard Roark is not the ideal. His relationships with other humans are, in my estimation, far too unhealthy. Further, his egoism seems, at times, a bit outrageous.Still, despite the fact that Rand didn't meet her goal, she did write a truly inspiring book. After reading it, I felt powerful, as if humans can be truly remarkable, heroic creatures. Further, the book can help us gain the strength necessary to maintain our integrity and create good, quality work, even when social expectations drive us to do otherwise.Shortly after reading this book, I spoke to one of my good friends. He sounded troubled and he told me that most of his goals and major life choices had been decided for him by other people. He didn't know what he, himself, really wanted, or if he wanted anything. This sentiment resembled one of the character's thoughts to such an extent that I immediately ordered a copy of The Fountainhead and mailed it to the friend. If any book could help him sort out his thinking, and discover that there is some value to selfishness, THIS IS THE BOOK.Ayn Rand doesn't provide a true philosophy. She doesn't tell us to what we should really aspire or what the ideal man really is. Still, she does write one heck of an inspiring book, which, as other reviews have suggested, can have the ability to deeply affect our lives and thought.---I just realized that this review doesn't, as most of my fiction reviews do, address the author's literary merit. I should say that, while the writing seems, at times, dry and stilted, and while the dialogue often doesn't sound \\"real,\\" Ayn Rand's prose serve her purpose. She has written a great, philosophical novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand wrote a fascinating albeit melodramatic novel in 1943 about an idealistic architect named Howard Roark and how he epitomized the concepts of individualism and objectivism in spite of the consternation it caused in others. In using architecture as the vehicle for her ideals, she concocted a hero whose ego reigns supreme and whose selfishness marks him as a true success in his field. This is bold thinking and probably quite antithetical to wartime sentiments, yet this book has understandably built a following over the years thanks to her near-Baroque style of defining her characters and their predicaments. In fact, it is really just the Baroque elements that Hollywood could understand in the well-remembered 1949 film adaptation starring Patricia Neal, Raymond Massey and Gary Cooper as Roark.The novel really follows the lives of five distinct characters who represent contrasting archetypes in Rand's philosophy. First, there is Roark, a supremely talented, uncompromising architect whose creative visions are at odds with those around him. On the opposite side is Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic who values mediocrity as a means to subdue the masses and allow Communism to infiltrate the country. In between Roark and Toohey is newspaper mogul Gail Wynand, whose rags-to-riches background has given him an unprecedented power to influence the masses. While he is Toohey's boss, Wynand gradually comes to admire Roark's individualism. A romantic triangle develops among Roark, Wynand and Dominique Francon, the headstrong daughter of a successful architect, whose attraction to Roark is mixed with self-loathing over what she envisions as his doomed visions. The fifth character is Roark's former classmate and rival architect Peter Keating, who is presented as a man devoid of ideals, more than willing to accommodate the masses to ensure his livelihood. While others may find the weak-willed Keating beneath contempt, he is also the most human of the quintet.The characters inevitably clash throughout, but Rand produces an exciting if rather far-fetched climax where Roark clandestinely designs a housing project for Keating under the condition that nothing change in his design. Of course, the design is significantly changed, and Roark takes matters into his own hands. It's irresistible fiction with a philosophical core that makes it seem more important than it is. Many Republicans claim the book is about one of their own, but such self-referential adoration misses the novel's main point, that Roark is a man who stands outside any recognized group. Rand deserves kudos for making such an arrogant character completely arresting throughout the book's marathon 752 pages."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I started the book a few years ago and put it down because Ayn has a way of being what the editor calls overly descriptive. However, I picked the book back up. Beyond the description, what I found was a pretty good work of literature that entailed many things, a few of which that interested me was the battle between the free-thinker and the thinker that is easily molded by the opinions of others, the difference between a conformist and non-conformist. Although I don't agree with some of the pros, I believe Ayn gives her readers something to think about, especially those that have never been exposed to the idea of architecture (the book focuses on architecture). And without Howard Roark, one of the central characters in the book, the story would have never gained its popularity. Ayn Rand also has a seasoned sense of humor. If you would like to learn more about architecture, read the book. If you would like to get away from fast-moving thriller plots and move over to the literary world, read the book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As far as the philosophy in this book is concerned I don't think it teaches us anything we didn't know already but it does so very well and entertainingly.I found the book very sad at times because,all the way through it,I was reminded of life and the people and situations I've experienced at work and socially.I would find it hard to understand a reader who ,while reading,was not put in mind of many people in their own lives.I even thought of the LLoyds building in London which got a slating from the critics but I thought is fantastic.It's a compulsive read.I've a couple of gripes-one with the romantic side which just didn't do it for me and the didactisisms liberally spread through the book.I found also that the only character I really cared about in the end was G.Wynand.I read another review on this site by a reader slagging the book off and he reminded me of E.Toohey!I've given the book four stars because all the way through the book little things are striking a cord with me again and again."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fabulous book, absolutely fabulous.Ayn Rand hits you hard with her philosophy of Objectivism in this thrilling classic.

Rand's writing style is so brilliant, so perfect, so dashing and in-your-face, so daringly, startlingly blunt.

I suggest that if you decide to read the Fountainhead, skim through the speeches and extra information which is not pertinent to the plot, so that you will not become bored. Then, after you have finished the book, go back and read the parts you didnt give your full attention.

Honestly speaking, i knew that much, much of what it had to say was beyond my grasp. I read The Fountainhead with much trepidition last year, at 20, and what I found most absorbing was the fact that I need not be afraid to be alone. If ever a book gives moral strength, it was this one. Maybe it is too much to read into from a piece of first class literature, but at an age when one is bound by social constraints and yet one is desperate to break free, when one hates oneself because one wants to be different, but is terrified of being shirked as different, one sees hope in a the people as the protagonists in this book.

However, the genius is not Ms. Rand alone, who is famously known from her homeland of Russia to the United States of America for her writing ability that places you right next to the characters in several astonishing stories.Howard Roark is a man whose entire being has been devoted to architecture from his early childhood. The devotion, indescribable intellect, or both, have enthralled his mind in a way that has let temptations, jealousy, and competition dwindle like dust from his headstrong future. His mastermind provides him with more than an acute sense of perfection, and almost wild and scary blueprints. The impeccable accuracy of Rand to detail of both plot and character develops Roark and Peter Keating, his old friend into men you feel you know. Not only is the story one with a passion for individual integrity shown by Roark, but also of love from Dominique Francon, a uniquely beautiful woman, who didn't always have the courage or heart to be there for the man she truly loved... The story delves equally into human temperament and into the separate worlds of men, all striving for an equal goal of seeing their mapped future unfold before them.The unwavering perfection to detail and insight of intricate and multipart characters, mainly grown men, have left me with a feeling of enlightenment and a creepy feeling of human knowledge. \\"The Fountainhead\\" tells the story of a lonely genius' reach for his love, the obstacles that come up in any businessman or businesswomen's career, and discusses what makes and breaks any man or woman; the ability to follow one's own dream."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book contains incredible psychological insights into the motivations and basic premises that produce a variety of character traits. It is essential for discovering how to think for yourself rather than going through life as a people pleaser."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've read so many reviews for this book it makes me sick. Some say its the worst book ever written while others acclaim its genius. I would agree that Dominique's character could be seen as a little bit demeaning, and Roark is a selfish (selfish is probably not the right word because Roark never wanted money or power, he just wanted to work - his way) jerk. But I think what Ayn Rand is trying to say is that we need people like Roark to help the human race evolve. And it's people like Toohey who hold us back not for humanitarian reasons but for power.This book blew me away and made me take a step back and accept what Ms. Rand's point was, not necessarily agreeing with everything she says but at least accepting it and respecting it. Also, she talks about Altruism and how (she)Roark thinks that it is holding society back, but that it's okay to give and be equal because we've been bread to do so, but there are going to be people out there who would rather give in another way, by inventions and ideas. Roark was very clear from the beginning that he works for himself only, and his work is a gift to society.I loved Toohey's rants too. Hearing the evil badguy preach what we've all been taught since the beginning like: &quot;make man feel small and insignificant&quot;, &quot;make man associate pleasure with guilt&quot; and we all know and believe that. The only thing I didn't like about him was that everything always went how he planned--he was too smart and manipulative to be human.Love it or hate it - You should read it. You might learn something about yourself and other people. Her (Rand)ideas will never be outdated and in that way she'll live forever."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is a gifted storyteller. This is apparent in the first twenty pages. It is an extremely engaging book with phenomenal characterization and it weaves an interconnected plot which rivets the attention of the reader like few other books can do. However---the enjoyment of the book is contingent upon the reader's philosophical leanings. It is, at heart, a philosophical novel, but perhaps one of the best (with the exception of Tolstoy) to erect a philosophical system while keeping the reader fascinated with the characterization. The final question remains at the end of the book---did I like what Rand said? For me the answer was unequivocally &quot;no.&quot; Often downright polemical, the book extolls the virtues of the individual will to power. I am with Rand all the way on the individual will to power, as, like her, I believe it accounts for the evolutionary progress of mankind. However, the characters representing her philosophies sometimes take on the qualities of caricatures, almost surreal in their embodiment of the ideas Rand has designated them to symbolize. The Fountainhead reveals Rand's fear of the mob, the herds of humanity and their petty desires and motivations. It champions the spirit of egotism, the rigorous adherence to one's own drives. But it does so in a way which leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone who has ever felt a sense of connection with their fellow human beings. Unfortunately, it is Rand's political ideology which has put the US in the current position it is in. 1% of the population controls the majority of its wealth. And hand in hand with the domination of capital come the other &quot;isms&quot; which are cancerous: sexism, racism, classism. Rand's characters are such patently sexist archetypes, one almost gets the sense that Rand herself has a little self-contempt for being female. Dominique Francon desires her rape, longs to be dominated and crushed into a subhuman existence. Even the male heroes of the book, despite being the only characters to have &quot;ideals&quot;, are driven underneath it all by the sexual urge. The book, like capitalist philosophy, essentially takes the low road in terms of its measurement of overall human character. The worst thing I could say about it is that is essentially a document embodying all the darker elements of capitalist ideology and I sincerely believe that it is a justification of all the unfortunate (or fortunate depending upon your power position) conditions that arise from a nation guided by these principles. The best thing I could say about it is that it is an extremely well-written character drama."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Read this book! I found it amazingly well-written. Ayn Rand is known for being too wordy and hard to stay with, but I found it an easy and satisfying read. Ayn Rand's philosophy, obejectivism, is evident throughout this book. I thought that it was a philosophical masterpiece. The writing was impeccable and the plot and character development was immaculate. Ayn Rand has done it again. I am now going to order all of her other books and immerse myself in the wonderful world of Rand!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As I read some of the most recent reviews of this book, I was surprised at the degree of intellectual midgetry and literary obstinacy displayed. Do not confuse Rand's stern optimism for some mystical and cynical &quot;overman&quot; dream. It is futile to argue this book's philosophy: you either accept it, or you don't (which dooms it to these negative criticisms in a big way). To those naive enough to question the realism of the characters or Rand's view of people in the book, look up the definition of romance literature. To those trying to reduce this work to a pile of dust with a few short and condescending words, I say (not without a hint of drama) you are all a bunch of Ellsworth Tooheys."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"One of the only books I've ever reread.

The Fountainhead is a modern classic and a must-read for independents with thier own beliefs and views. This novel changed my outlook on life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;~I enjoyed this book immensely. However, most of the reviews for this book focus on Roark. I think Ellsworth M. Toohey was a more incredible character. Roark and Toohey were both two independent people, but I envy the way Toohey used people to give himself more power. Just knowing the fact that he is &quot;smaller&quot; than them is just what they need to survive. They all used him. They could care less about him. I'm sure they all could've easily lived without Keating. They took advantage of Keating's weakness...but hey, who wouldn't?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If I could wish one thing for everyone in the world, I would give each and every person their own Monadnock Valley. I couldn't quite put to words how this book has moved me until I got to the chapter on Howard Roark. Within the first few pages when the young man is staring down at what Roark has created I felt as if I was there. Ayn Rand writes about Roark, &quot;He did not know that he had given someone the courage to face a lifetime.&quot; Aren't we all at some point in our lives searching for a reason to go on something to truly live for...? I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever struggled with trying to understand the good and evil of society. This book inspires anger and tranquility within a mere exchange of a simple dialouge."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's hard to know what else to say about a book like this because The Fountainhead has been praised, analyzed, discussed and criticized from all points of view by so many people.I will simply say that I think this book is terrific on every level. The characters are unique and interesting and what they stand for ties them into Rand's personal philosophy of objectivism. And although I think Rand's beliefs are extreme, I admire Roark's unwillingness to compromise his designs. Rand's ability to develop these characters, weave them into a complex and interesting story and keep the reader going through all 700+ pages is a genius accomplishment that stands the test of time.My favorite part of the book is the friendship that develops between Roark and Wynand because they both let down their guard and become human beings. If you have to read this for school, be patient. It is worth the effort and it will keep you thinking!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I don't agree with 100% of what Ayn says about selfishness and capitalism--as we've seen recently in today's economy, there are always improprietous egomaniacs who hold their own gain higher than unspoken moral values of the planet. But the light of integrity that Ayn shines on every human being's potential is enough to get you off your couch, pursuing your own happiness through productive achievement. Her command of the English language is remarkable; just reading a few pages will get your hair standing on end.To the critics that say Ayn should be more benevolent are missing the point. To me, Ayn's point is that if everyone taps into their own productive achievement as a means of fulfillment, and took full responsibility for their lives instead of expecting the System to provide for them, then happiness would be widespread and we would all live in a healthy productive society. And those that worked the hardest, would be justly rewarded proportionately.But for the record, in my opinion, the corporate tycoons that have been polluting the environment and being disrespectful to Mother Earth in favor of shareholder profits have also missed the point. Despite Ayn's aversion to any kind of mystic reality, I do believe those corporate decision makers will reap what they sow and the Mother will pay them back for the disrespect they have displayed.So it is a delicate dance between motivation, reward, action and integrity."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's work seems to be synonymous with political debates, and warring of the philosophical. And with good reason. She was a champion of absolute capitalism, having fled from the Communist hellhole of Soviet Union, she had great appreciation for personal freedom: simple yet powerful idea of being able to pursue our own dream. This was evident in her odd insistence on vilifying the word, 'altruism'; she believed it to be the dulling to the soul of a man, thus to the society. What mattered is our duty to be 'selfish', to have the fortitude to reject the mass and transcend to the idea of self-sufficiency. And the end product of her ideal was her fictional birthchild: Howard Roark.Howard Roark is a caricature example of what Ayn Rand believed a Man should be: stoic, self-sufficient, and objective. He was at the cause, never the effect, of his life. Even as the world hated him and denied him, in his heart he knew that only thing that mattered in his reality is the respect he had for himself and his craft. He felt the pain of solitude and his talents not being recognized; however, he posited that our purpose in life isn't to bend to will of the mass, but to find our own brand of happiness. He was an embodiment of genuine self-esteem, the kind that was internally generated and could not be taken away by the world.There are many valuable lessons here to be taken, especially for the modern man. But mainly it's meant to serve as a guidepost to where we should try to steer our lives. I see lots of readers arguing against his anti-social values; condemning the hypothetical world filled with Howard Roarks. Truth is we cannot be Howard Roark; we are human beings: we err, make egoist strides, and shamelessly re-commit the same mistakes. Howard Roark is an idea, a place where we want to be. The idea that is noble enough to at least consider, if not worship. His commitment to eradicate all his egos is something to be admired for, and has application in all aspects of life, including business and relationship. Forget the political implications of the book - and you will get a lot out of this story than any other fiction books you ever read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've heard so many things, both good and bad, about Ayn Rand over the years, that it took me many years to approach any of her works. As other reviewers have noted, it seems that people tend to idolize her. After reading this novel, that seems highly ironic to me.I enjoyed the novel. I found Wynand to be a fascinating character, fairly nuanced and complex. Roark, Dominique, and Toohey were perhaps too archetypical to be entirely believable, but to a good extent they had to be portrayed as they were in order for the novel to work. The struggle between Roark and Toohey and the ideas they represented were, after all, pretty much the whole thrust of the novel. And though Keating was entirely un-sympathetic, if we were to be honest, he acts in ways that many of us can probably identify with.Rarely do I find a novel that contains \\"realistic\\" dialogue, and this was no exception, but I actually thought it worked better than what one finds in many novels, because it caught so much of the non-verbal communication that takes place between people--all the gestures, expressions, starts and stops, glances. So much of \\"real\\" dialogue is unspoken, especially between people who know each other quite well, and I thought Rand did a great job of conveying that. So I found the dialogue \\"believable\\" in many places, if not exactly \\"realistic\\".The plot was compelling, as there were times when I had trouble putting the book down. And I very much enjoyed the fact that I couldn't always see where the plot was going. Yes, there were times when the plot and/or the dialogue slowed down so Rand could make a philosophical point. But that comes with the material.As for the philosophy of objectivism, I don't really agree with it at all; however, I do think Rand makes a number of interesting points in the novel regarding individualism and independence. Except for a few places towards the end, I didn't feel that the philosophical statements got in the way of the novel. I could read it as a novel and put the philosophy to the side.Knowing that I didn't agree with the philosophy, I went into this read thinking that it would be a chore, but in the end, I am happy to have read it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The individualist has always had an ambivalent relationship with the market. On the one hand, the market is an inevitable consequence of the individual right to own and trade property. On the other hand, the market is the physical embodiment of the opinions of other persons about how artifacts and activities are to be valued, and the individualist insists upon deciding these values for himself.Ayn Rand's education in Soviet Russia made her intimately familiar with Marx's writings, including his theory of alienation. Her response to this theory is represented by the character Howard Roark in _The Fountainhead_, who insists upon maintaining a non-alienated relationship to his work as an architect. Roark is unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity and independence, even when his tenacity leads to dire hardship.The joy of owning material things is small in comparison to the joy of genuinely self-directed creative work, of forming and developing one's own vision and bringing it to realization. To sacrifice the joy of self-directed work for the joy of ownership is a very imprudent--and yet also very common--decision. This sort of imprudence is represented in _The Fountainhead_ by the character Peter Keating. Keating recognizes the market as the highest arbiter of value. He does whatever it takes to bring in client revenue. The consequence is that he becomes extravagantly wealthy--and miserably unhappy.In a world populated only by men like Peter Keating, free market capitalism might still be the most just way to organize society, but it would still be an aesthetically repulsive and psychologically disastrous way to organize society. It is the possibility of an uncompromisingly self-directed man like Howard Roark that vindicates capitalism in the aesthetic and psychological realm as well as in the realm of justice.Ayn Rand is able to make an unequivocal recommendation for a universal free market because she believes she has solved the problem of alienation. It would seem, however, that although her recommendations for government policies of laissez-faire capitalism have had a not entirely insignificant political influence, the ethic of non-alienated work upon which this recommendation is predicated has had comparatively little influence. The leaders of contemporary commercial enterprises are unabashed in their insistence upon recognizing the market as the ultimate arbiter and director of all their decisions and activities. What should be recognized as a vice--spineless submission to public opinion as it is embodied in the marketplace--comes to be thought of as a virtue: to call an enterprise \\"market driven\\" is almost universally recognized as unequivocal praise.The principle which Roark puts into practice is summarized in his maxim, \\"I don't build in order to have clients. I have clients in order to build.\\" In other words, Roark's practice is not \\"market-driven.\\" It is driven by his own need to realize his artistic vision.One might question whether it would be possible for an individual employee in a contemporary commercial enterprise to adopt a self-realization-centered approach to his work when the primary goal of his employer is to fulfill market needs, which will certainly not always coincide with the employee's needs for self-realization. The inevitable conflicts might in the end make the employee who insists upon self-realization unemployable, consigning him to work in the rock quarry. But it also just might be the case that a tenacious perseverance and insistence upon doing his work in a manner that is fulfilling could eventually pay off--as it does for Roark in _The Fountainhead_."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book of all places in Moscow while on a year abroad in Russia. I did not realize when I packed it that it could have gotten me in trouble there in 1987. I knew nothing about the book when I bought it, only that someone (I forgot who) had recommended it to me and I bought it in a second hand book store in Iowa City at some point in my college life. I read this in about 3 nights. It ensnared me from the first sentence. Ayn Rand became one of my favorite authors. This book is about two architects, one a \\"genius\\" of his own individual creativity and style, one a genius of collaborative style, and about a woman who is akin to the devil. When I read this book at age 20, I felt like it had extracted my view of the world and society from my brain. It worships godlike talent and condemns the power and mediocrity of the collective. An old friend once dubbed me a fascist for loving this book. It's ideal of \\"love\\" is rape. A more mature view of the content would find this a disturbing philosophy (compare to servant leadership and \\"The Wisdom of Teams\\").

After reading \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" I expected a book that was a slow starter and that would be difficult (but worth it) to finish. But \\"The Fountainhead\\" became interesting in the first few pages, and stayed that way with few exceptions, throughout the book.The thing I like most about Ayn Rand's books is that you can read them at several different levels, and correspondingly, get out what you put in. If you want entertainment, it's there in \\"The Fountainhead.\\" It's a very good story. If you want philosphy or intellectualism, you can read about the characters and think about or discuss the symbolism - good vs. evil, capitalism vs. socialism, individualism vs. collectivism, etc. Or you can read the book from a historical perspective, comparing Ms. Rand's philosophy with the prevaling views of the times and get a better sense on what the world was like back then.At times it's still a difficult read. But when you finish the book, you feel as though you've accomplished something, learned something, and are proud of yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you've been thinking of reading a book by Ayn Rand but think that Atlas Shrugged is a little to mountainous to tackle right off, The Fountainhead is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the method of writing by Ayn Rand. Rand is a wonderful writer--all of her stories are excellently writen, have a very well defined plot, her characters are extremely well thought out, and she is able to weave a strong purpose into the story. Ayn Rand is my favorite writers because the plots and storylines in her books are very well thought out. I hate reading a book that leaves gaps and loop holes in the story and where the characters are whish-washy at best. If you're tired of books that leave you feeling empty and that your time was wasted, then pick up this book. This book is a worthy investment!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A lot of people who die hard \\"collective responsibility\\" types are threatened by Rand's ideas in her masterwork The Fountainhead.Some fools actually are naive enough to believe Ayn Rand would have been a fan of America's new batch of hard right conservative commentators and talk radio and TV news pundits. Are you guys high? Here's a quote from Ayn on an old Donahue interview, \\"I'm not a conservative, today's conservatives are worse than today's liberals\\". Amen.Howard Roark is the ultimate individualist. Strong, content, creative, very much alive, and with a deep love for his flawed America. The latter trait is something that eternally baffles the majority of the collectivists. Many of them passionately despise America and can't tolerate anyone who believes otherwise.The book seems to have a love affair with the way the world was before FDR's Great Society programs and his skyrocketing of American tax rates. A time where you had to sink or swim on your own merits without government help. And if you sunk it was your responsibility and your alone to get back up again. There's a certain appeal in this. The tough individualist, living under a bare bones government, no government programs, having a government flat tax where everybody pays the same, etcetera, where government doesn't interfere in your pocketbook or your private life. But, sadly, many who espouse this view such as the Christian Reich are simply a kindler, gentler version of the Taliban. Ayn Rand would point out that today's conservatives are all in favor of big government programs such as faith based initatives, idiotic government witch hunts to root out homosexuals in the Armed Forces, tell people who they can sleep with, what movies they can see, what books they can read, what music they can listen to, what drugs they can put in their body, and on and on.But I digress. The Fountainhead is marvelous book. I liked Atlas Shrugged but found it about 200 pages too long, John Galt also needed more characterization.

The characters are ficticious, but you feel as if they live next door. You laugh with them, cry with them, get angry when they make silly decisions.Say what you want about Miss Rand's Objectivist theories, this story provokes the reader to think about questions that go relatively unasked in this society. Why do we feel the need to hold others back to make ourselves look better? Why do we have empty feelings of accomplishment? Why aren't we happy?To push yourself emotionally, intellectually, to understand the drive of mankind, one should read this book. If you just want a great story, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"One reviewer, from &quot;Virginia USA&quot;, seemed to sum up his screeching dislike for the book with the following comments which I've dissected and responded to.&quot;Poorly Written, Obvious Plot This is a typical Ayn Rand novel. If you are part of the school of Objectivism, take a second to read back through this book. I find it ironic that the woman who started an 'intellectual' movement can write in such an obvious (and poor) manner. With no subtlety in style and little suprises to the plot, this novel truly reflects the shallow depths of American intellectualism. I'm baffled at it's long standing popularity.&quot;Poorly written and unimaginatively plotted. Really? The concept of a bold architect, Roark, pursuing his career with integrity despite the incredible public loathing of his work which is driven by the actions of the woman he loves, Dominique, and his best friend, Gail, is not imaginative, original, and creative? Perhaps I have forgotten about the vast canon of literature celebrating the accomplishments of architects who choose a life of integrity, overcome hardship, and risk disdain, prison, and even life itself to achieve their goals.Regarding the claim the book had no sublety, I must simply admit that perhaps the author of that review had a greater mind than mine. In fact, he must have a greater mind than almost all of Rand's readers. After all, we dolts who read her novels again and again are always finding new and insidiously well-hidden hints as to the characters' nature, personality, or motive.As far as the claim the the novel reflects the utter shallowness of American intellectualism, I must agree. Unlike the novels of Sartre or Camus (the critic's more refined, Continental, sophisticated preference, apparently), Rand's novels are not so deep that their bottoms are hidden from sight. Sadly, there are no angst-filled miscreants, men who turn into cockroaches, or anti-heroes. Only plain, honest, shallow, men and women with their petty, uncool values of integrity, career, passion, and pride.In the final analysis, it's probably a good idea to read these novels with a grain of honesty, not salt. If you disagree her ideas, fine. But do not attempt to slander Rand's writing skills unless you are prepared to do so with original criticisms that arise from an actual reading of the book in question."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was, at one point, a novelist; I'm convinced that she was half decent at it, too. However, at some point in her life, Rand decided that she was the most important philosopher in history. This came after her first novel, We the Living. Now, I would say that you should read Rand because she's a half-decent novelist, and in addition her philosophy is a fascinating view into the Narcissistic Personality Disorder she suffered from (Howard Roark, in this book, is a Narcissist and a sociopath to boot).Fountainhead is interesting in that it does try to work in architectural ideas, and when Rand's not busy slamming you with her aesthetic tastes (or her philosophy) it does have a point about originality, and how a work should really be composed as a whole. Now, Rand never finished her thought, and Roark really just seems to do it through sheer instinct, but it's a good thought nonetheless.The characters of the Fountainhead are what set it above Atlas Shrugged. Howard Roark and Dominique Francon are party line Objectivists, whose ideas flow from the mouth of Rand. However, there's more of a spread in the rest: Peter Keating is really just a man with no self-worth (Rand's Narcissism stopped her from seeing a middle between no self-worth and selfishness), Gail Wynand is a failed idealist (more interesting than Roark), and Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is a standard Objectivist villain (he would get the award for worst name in English literature if not for Balph Eubank in Atlas Shrugged; yes, BALPH). Since the non-Roark/Toohey characters don't just spout Randisms (Roark is Objectivist; Toohey is the evil Anti-Objectivist that Rand set up as a strawman to knock down), they get to have some philosophical doubts and worries, and are just more interesting than the Producers and Looters of Atlas Shrugged.Don't get suckered in by Rand's philosophy. It's not that good, especially when you consider that it doesn't reflect upon reality. Egoism is a false and evil ethics. Don't believe me? Okay...one, Rand's defense is based in the false assumption that rational people have no conflict of interest. This is obviously not true--if you and I are each trying to sell a car to a potential buyer, who will not buy more than one car, isn't it in both of our interests to sell him the car? So don't our interests conflict, even if we're rational people? Two, one is incapable of ensuring the survival of the human race. Ever notice that Rand isn't concerned with kids, of which she had none? Well, under an egoist ethics, there's no reason to have them. Indeed, it may be considered &quot;irrational&quot; to desire children in the first place, and hence evil. Three, selfishness is considered bad because it is too much concern for the self with no regard to others. There is nothing wrong with caring for one's own needs, but this does not have to be at the expense of caring about other human beings as well. It's one of the things that makes a society possible.Rand, because of her psychological disorders, saw only hard dichotomies and was a master of the false dilemma. Self-sacrifice is not the giving up of a greater value for a lesser one, it is the giving up of a lesser value for a greater one. Unlike in Rand-world, other people and society DO matter. Her altruism is a false strawman made so that her evil egoism could seem rational by comparison. I suggest the Christian ethic: LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF. Think about the two things that this implies: one, love your neighbor; two, love yourself. The command is not one or the other. It is both. This is the error Rand makes in her ethics, and which is perpetuated by her followers (I was in an introductory philosophy course taught by Allan Gotthelf, who wrote a book called On Ayn Rand, and he specifically used these false dichotomies to argue in favor of Rand's position on almost all accounts).Ultimately false is Rand's account of love. There is no such thing as real conditional love. That is a projection of certain values one has upon another person, and the idealization of those values, never of the actual person &quot;loved.&quot; Real love is unconditional, stemming from emotional bonds that Rand herself was incapable of growing. That's why Rand's romance seems depressingly...unromantic. (The way it happens in the Fountainhead is called rape.)As I said at the beginning, I'm convinced that Ayn Rand was a half-decent novelist. I'm giving this book 2 stars because its philosophy, not its story or characters, is bad. If this seems contradictory to my prior post, it's because I've reconsidered Rand as an author since. I think a bit better of her, but without accepting her philosophy. If you read this book, be sure to ask yourself not only: does this follow logically? but also: does this reflect on the world I live in, or simply on a fantasy world created by the author? I think that the answer, frankly, is the latter."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was probably the 20th century's most profound American philosopher, and the best female philosopher who has ever lived. Her ideas are startling and powerful. However, chances are many people go through their entire life without ever hearing her name. Strange, isn't it?The reason is because Ayn Rand has a philosophy of individualism. She believes people should think for themselves independently. Doesn't sound like anything scary, does it?Pre-Internet, you probably never even heard the name Ayn Rand. That's because the media establishment controlled everything - television, magazines, radio - you name it. Ideas were in the hands of a few. Do yourself a favor and read \\"The Fountainhead\\". It's a manual for being a real human being."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If Amazon allowed it, I'd give this book a 3.5 out of 5 stars.This work serves as a fantastic introduction to Rand's inane philosophy - Objectivism (more about this in bit). Extremely gripping and never trite, The Fountainhead is a heady mixture of Rand's simplistic psychological and philosophical insights. The characters are, without exception, fascinating: Howard Roark - the unconventional architect who lives for and in his work, Dominique Francon - the yet more unconventional and passionate lover, Peter Keating - the seeker after all that is conventional, and hence (in Rand's mind) worthless, and (my favorite) Ellsworth Toohey - the Evil, brilliant, and power-hungry schemer. These (and other) well-etched characters, paradigms of what they stand for, become Rand's vehicles for expressing her take on the nature of the ideal man, the purpose and summum bonum of life, and other such important things that Rand seems singularly unqualified to expound on. Her story-telling skills and style of writing are undoubtedly distinguished; however, philosophy is not Ms.Rand's forte. In any case, this book was an interesting, thought-provoking read, even if one perusal of it was adequate for me to become all-round mocker of Objectivism.Now to the philosophy behind this work. Ms.Rand seems to deify rationality without offering a reasonable explanation. Why are individuality and rationality the greatest and most glorious things? Ms.Rand says so; perhaps it \\"feels right\\" to her. Why, and based on what proof or rigor, does no god exist (Objectivism is an atheistic philosophy)? Ms.Rand says so; perhaps she conducted all kinds of scientific experiments and came up with the definitive answer to this quintessential philosophical problem. Just like in the case of her denunciation of homosexuality: \\"Because it involves psychological flaws, corruptions, errors, or unfortunate premises, but there is a psychological immorality at the root of homosexuality. Therefore I regard it as immoral... Morally it is immoral, and more than that, if you want my really sincere opinion, it is disgusting.\\" Such sophistication of reasoning and opinion would do George Bush proud. To cut this potentially loong tirade short, I have no respect for Ayn Rand's pseudo-rational philosophy. While I like a few ideas here and there - her support of Capitalism and the individual's rights -, on the whole, I think it's a wannabe rational but actually shallow philosophy that, from the viewpoint of rational content, might as well be consigned to flames."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Was raised on her stuff and even as a young person being confused in the world I could see this woman was far more confused than I was. Rape and inflicted pain on each other as lust and love? Not my idea of appropriate ways to show \\"love\\". Selfishness as the epitome of human existence? I disgree. Give me Gandhi please."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Almost as entertaining as Atlas Shrugged, but all of Ayn Rand's books should be required reading for all high school students."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"At first, this book's size was intimadating but it flowed wonderfully. The story is incredibly deep and if you're not in the mood to read something that will make you think then you definitely need to look elsewhere.The characters are incredibly well thought out and possess such strong presence that it's easy to get a clear visual of everyone of them. I often found myself smiling at the constant mental acrobatics that took place between them and their fervent need to one-up each other. If people truly spent this much time analyzing one another, I don't think we'd actually get anything accomplished.At the heart of this novel is Rand's theory of objectivism which completely asks us to redefine what we believe to be \\"selfish\\". Often many people who are considered selfish are those who seek money/power/recognition from others, but if your concern is primarily based around the preception of others then you're not really focused on yourself and so how can you truly be \\"selfish\\"? All drive and motivation needs to come from within and stay there.I found myself reevaluating some of my past (and current) decisions throughout the entire time I was reading this book. I was completely enthralled in Rand's world and will definitely pick up Atlas Shrugged to see where she went next."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I found this book great because it basically shows how and why one should value its own life. All through the book she tries to make us understand through the different characters that one should only use their own mind to judge things, never to subordinate their mind to others. She explains that humans being most important characteristic is thinking. If one does not think, he is a living dead. We see in the book what happens to the ones that don't think, who are not rational, logic. I have met both categories of people she depicts. Reading the book made me understand my mistakes, and also made me value my work more and by doing that value myself more. She believes that the highest purpose of a man should be his achievement. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead is a classic book in its own right. But as someone said in these reviews that you don't have to buy a philosophy completely in order to like it. I love the ideas of Ayn Rand but I don't buy them all like any 'second hander' would. For this reason my review contains criticism of Objectivism ( That has the tendency to become crypto- Nazism). It is just my opinion and I'm just using my freedom of expression for the sake of discussion as it is impossible for many to read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and not dream up political parties!Ayn Rand's brilliance shines and grips the reader from page 1. You're wildly engrossed by the mystique of this young Howard Roark. You Wonder, What he's upto? And you start your journey into the ideal of Individualism and the trend of the Crowd/ The herd/ The Collectivist/ The Second-hander.Mind you, this book is dangerous in the sense you may end up buying more than you would like to bargain! Ayn Rand is hauntingly convincing. It hits your mind and the soul. It agitates, stimulates and provokes you to think... question... think again.But I was delighted to read this book because I already held most of the ideals of the book very high in my heart and they were only confirmed as I read Fountainhead. It is exhilarating to discover that someone somewhere in this Universe not only shares your deepest thoughts but has profoundly manifested them in beautiful writing.CRITICISM- Of course few months after the reading you will be able to shake off your initial mania ( If you passively buy Rand's Objectivism) and you would see the holes in the philosophy of Objectivism. It is OK to disagree with Rand on some points as Objectivism requires us to be objective and listen to our OWN conscience/ Reason!For start, why must one disbelieve the existence of God to subscribe to Objectivism/ Individualism? Objectivism and Atheism must come together, because God DOES NOT EXIST, so says the Objectivist. Hmmm.. No one has seen black holes either but many believe in their existence, same is true with the dark matter and many other phenomena etc.. I think Agnosticism (on the question of God) would not be too irrational, better still... let it be a matter of one's conscience.Second, I question Howard Roark's morality and fairness. His first love- making with Dominique is a sort of consensual rape (???). Then he forgets her. Then he starts the sexual relationship again and continues it without any compunctions even when Dominique is married. Maybe he considers that the ethical issue regarding committing adultery is a religious diktat, a selfish, rational man is above that moral [...] ? I am not sure. I found it a behavior that undermines his integrity. It might sound harsh but for the sake of truth it is important to mention (in this review) that there is a very firm evidence that Ms. Rand herself carried on a long term/ intimate affair with much younger married man while she was still married to her husband. Both their spouses knew about it but were not allowed to interfere.Same UNAPOLOGETIC/ NONCHALANT adultery is portrayed in Atlas Shrugged between Mr. Reardon (who is a married man with a beautiful, devout-mostly- wife) and Miss Taggart. I found their first sex act to be a very funny scene where Mr. Reardon declares he has always lusted after Miss Taggart and that he is a sex animal of some sort who would not mind giving up his every ambition, dream and industrial empire just to have Miss Taggart as his bonk buddy. What in the Dickens was that???? I still crack up when I think of that fall of superman and superwoman for a night of nookie. Hilarious and UNNOTICED BY Randmaniacs.And what about Howard Roark being the poster boy for Cigarette companies. Our hero is a chain smoker of sorts and the picture is supposed to become romantic when Roark and Dominique smoke together. hmmmm... Why must a rational man smoke? Incidentally, Ms. Rand herself was a smoker and was diagnosed with lung cancer later in life...Another small thing that kind of confuses me, is Ms. Rand's consistent portrayal of THE IDEAL MAN or WOMAN as someone with Blond/ Red hair. What is with the hair colour? If only Anglo Saxon race is the ideal human race then rest of the planet is screwed and that's a lot of screwed people stuck in eternal doom because they are not the right race. Ayn Rand happened to be Jewish to thicken the plot...Coming back to the mind of Roark, I find, Roark's most striking statement that contradicted all his other statements was his admission to Dominique, ''I LOVE YOU.'' I found it so glaring an expression coming from him. Love and submission is exactly against his militant beliefs about his selfishness, ego. Love = sacrifing yourSELF to other Self, that is anti- Self. But anyhow, Roark lets Dominique be the sexual plaything for two other men (She even marries both of them!) One more inconsistency in his integrity.His reverence, deep respect and submission to his mentor Architect in the beginning of the book is another notable example that shows Roark got a very soft, caring, humane and even EMOTIONAL nature. He is not cold, selfish and rational all times as the book seems to suggest in some parts.Great Novel from a great author--- But don't get me wrong because of above points. I had to mention them as - though I absolutely love this book- I cannot understand why some poeple want to make religion out of couple of novels. It seems some sort of 'Inerrancy of Ayn Rand, transliteration of Objectivism as personified in very entertaining novels'. It's just too much hype and mawkishness really.Such idol worship aside, DO READ Fountainhead whenever you get a chance. Most possibly, it will be one of the greatest AND VERY ENTERTAINING books you will ever read. This book has a great plot, very interesting characters; Toohey's character has been developed terrifically. Even I was duped in the beginning of the book that Toohey was a good man! His character is an enigma really. Though he is the promoter of second handers he himself is a genius and a devilish manipulator. Rand presents him as a diabolical communist of sorts as she herself had strong hatred of communist ideology, mostly because of her experiences/impressions of Soviet Union.And surely, there is a great inspirational theme that boils down to: BE YOURSELF/ NEVER IMITATE other human beings/ NEVER BORROW SOMEONE ELSE'S IDEAS/ NEVER SEEK ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS... in words of Rand There is absolutely no need to SACRIFICE SELF TO OTHERS AND VICE VERSA. And if you manage to do EXACTLY all that you might be Tarzan in Brazilian rainforest.. hang on... it got to be Sweedish woods because otherwise there is a chance of getting the race wrong... ;-)A CLASSIC- But as some reviewer (maybe on Atlas Shrugged page) said we don't have to fully buy a philosophy in order to appreciate it, very much unlike religious texts. And philosophy aside, I found this book very enjoyable, gripping, suspenceful, profoundly inspiring and stimulating. It's a great read for sure. Certainly in my top 10 list. Despite above critism I love the book because it is so beautiful and so unique. Dialogues between Characters can be very profound, really meaningful and thought provoking. Fountainhead is the sort of book you have to read several times and question your existence and that of this world."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"i love the fact that this book is so long b/c i wish it'd never end. i love ayn rand's writing and philosophy. this book kept me up for hours at a time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I think people often miss the point of reading an Ayn Rand novel like 'The Fountainhead' - drop the defensiveness of your own belief system or personal philosophy and realize that in reading her novel you don't have to fall in love with her philosophy and adopt it as your own, but rather, you can come away from the read with multitudes of questions and ideas and thoughts running through your under-exercised brain - about philosophy generally or the state of mankind or any number of other topics. That's a good thing. It's a wonderful starter of philosophical conversations and I do think the woman was a very good writer with a great command of the English language - especially as she was not native to it. Don't let the idealogies Ayn Rand embraced turn you away simply because you do not share her views...tolerance is the path to understanding and learning. Take the time to open your mind to some deep thinking and an overall interesting story.Bottom line - the woman was an intellect who at least had the tenacity to stick to her guns and could argue her point using some historical basis. This is unlike so many of my peers these days who dare not spend time learning or thinking for themselves too much about anything. Do I agree wholeheartedly with her views? Not at all. What I do agree with is her spirit of quest for personal truth and a neverending desire for knowledge."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Russian-born atheist Ayn Rand became an influential Western philosopher by a most unusual means: writing novels. It's incredible to think that this woman, writing in a language other than her native tongue, wrote two books that consistently rank in the top ten \\"most influential\\" books by well-read Americans!THE FOUNTAINHEAD is the story of Howard Roark, Rand's idealization of the \\"perfect\\" individual. Whereas most characters in novels are in conflict with society, Roark simply exists in the same space as society, striving to follow out his passion of creating architecture - a field that typically caters to the desires of civilization - oblivious to civilization's approval or disapproval of his work. Yes, Roark comes across as rude, and yes, Roark probably isn't someone with whom I'd hang out on a regular basis, but by golly, Roark is a man of principles: he stands up for what he believes, even if it means financial hardship or career suicide. So what if those principles are not the same as mine?Rand challenges our perception of individuality. From our first view of Roark, poised on top of a cliff, to our last glimpse of him, standing atop a skyscraper, he is triumphant, confident, and completely self-sufficient. Can any of us - especially those of us who consider ourselves independent of and unswayed by society's opinion - truly, consistently live that kind of lifestyle?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read fountainhead for the first time when i was 16. At the time, although I had a high interest in architecture and urbanism, i was generally ignorant in both areas. Since then I have become very learned in architecture, urban design, and urbanism. Correspondingly my opinion of the Fountainhead has moved from one of my favorite books to mediocre at best. This has happened even though my political, economical and moral views have remained the same. When Rand wrote fountainhead the modernist movement in architecture was in full swing. The modernists were a group of architects who applied the philosophical views of communism to architecture. They thought that any structure on a building that didnt have some sort of untilitarian purpose (these communists embraced utiliarianism, but they must have never heard of John Mill who was the founder of utilitarianism and was a libretarian), was the &quot;expression of the elite&quot;. So, because in their ideal communist world, people would all have equal incomes they would also live in equal places, and capital that would have been spent on expressions of the elite(things such as balconies, overhangs, columns etc.) could be directed to more &quot;useful purposes&quot;. The end result of their thought was an architectural movement that built such things as the housing projects along the Dan Ryan expressway and other such cubes. This movement was never liked by the general public. But since it was avant-garde it found its expression in housing projects in cities all across the country and other projects done by beaurocrats. This was the architectural view that Ayn Rand expounded which shows the absurdity of the book.In fact she even lived in a house constructed by Frank Lloyed Wright who was one of the founders of modernism and was a socialist. She advocated individualism yet any architect who put their individualistic touches on buildings was not individualistic. Or any architect who built what people wanted ( i.e. supply and demand. A person supplies what another person wants which is a central tenet of capatilism was rejected by Howard Roark)was not individualistic. According to Ayn Rand,in order to be an architect and be individualistic one must build cubes, but because all cubes are alike how is it possible for an architect to be individualistic since they would be all building the same thing. This is just one of many contradictions in the Fountainhead and Ayn Rand's philosophy. Anyone interested in libertarianism and wants to read people who are philosophically sound I suggest Hayek, Von Mises and Nozick. They do not contradict themselves and they contribute far more to libertarianism than Ayn Rand ever did. All Ayn Rand did was rehash ideas that have been around for along time in a dogmatic way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The title for this review is from that other favorite book of mine, Oswald Spengler's &quot;The Decline Of The West&quot;. I do not myself profess to be an Objectivist. I'm too much of a selfish individualist to follow anybody, even Ayn Rand -- and I largely have &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; to thank for that. This book shows why you and I must think for ourselves, hold our own values as sacred. And it expresses this idea in the concrete form of a splendidly stylized architecture, reminding me of the stylized art of Kandinsky and Mondrian. Read the book for yourself. Read what kind of a thing Roark says: &quot;That was the most selfish thing you'll ever see a man do.&quot; (Could as easily have been a woman.) The true meaning of &quot;selfish&quot;. Far from the conventional meaning. As another character says later, to do what you want is the hardest thing in the world, takes the greatest courage. Quite so. I also love one of the sex scenes in which Ms. Rand describes the tremendous intensity of the passion between Roark and Dominique, like electricity. The paradox of ecstasy so violent it's like agony. My feeling exactly. I like &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; better than &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. The characters, particularly Dominique and Wynand, are more complex. A powerful book. When I read it, I felt like I was looking at a city at night, in all its glory. &quot;Ego&quot;: _not_ a &quot;dirty word&quot;, but &quot;the fountainhead&quot; of our noblest values."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand was a talented writer, whether or not you agree with her philosphy. Alas, the Rand purists are offended by all reviews that are not uncritical praise, and the anti-Rand socialists are outraged by any that do not paint the author as unspeakably evil. Whatever happened to the idea of an open mind?In light of the foregoing, it is easy to lose sight of the fact that &quot;the Fountainhead&quot; is a great book for someone just looking for good fiction. It is a tale of competing schools of architecture in New York during the 1920s and 1930s, when capitalism was increasingly opposed by dialectical materialism and socialism.Howard Roark, the main protagonist, is a lone eagle who desires to achieve on his own, applying his own modernistic style to architecture, to erect buildings that inspire a sense of joy while being a testament to the greatness of man.Roark is opposed in his efforts by an assortment of traditionalist-architects, who oppose modernism in favor of the baroque styles of Roman and Greek architecture, and who heap scorn on any architect who steps outside this box. The traditionalists are supported by a socialist-journalist named Elsworth Toohey, who writes a column in the New York Banner, praising or criticizing the work of architects. Toohey has great influence on public opinion, and few architects or builders wish to risk his wrath and public humiliation, and so &quot;go along to get along,&quot; much in the same way that political correctness works today.Howard Roark refuses to be swayed by these strong commercial and societal pressures, and continues to design office buildings, homes and other structures in a way that pleases him. He suffers terrible adversity because of his principles and his vision, but over time emerges victorious.I loved Ayn Rand's prose, her descriptions of New York and its skyscrapers. Her writing flows smoothly through the mind, painting pictures in the imagination, and is fresh and inspiring. I found her sentences expertly constructed and a joy to read.The motivations of some of the characters, however, is not always easy to understand. Dominique Francon, for instance, loves Roark but feels compelled to destroy him; and when she no longer wishes to destroy him, marries someone lesser than Roark in an inexplicable act of self-contempt. The novel has other aspects that also strain credulity, such as Roark's long and preachy opening statement in his second jury trial, where he is little more than a talking-head for Ayn Rand's philosophy. (In fiction, this is called &quot;author intrusion,&quot; and is to be avoided.)I like Ayn Rand, and sympathize strongly with her support of individualism over group-think statism. Rand's philosophy jives closely with the writings of 18th Century British economist Adam Smith, who taught that every individual in pursuing his or her own good is led, as if by an invisible hand, to achieve the best good for all. Therefore any interference with free competition by government is almost certain to be injurious. I agree.Having said that, I do not believe that individual action (the &quot;lone eagle&quot; Roark approach) is always the most effective means of achieving success in every endeavor. There is the concept of synergy, where two or more individuals can produce more or create more than any one of them can do alone. This is the concept wherein &quot;the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.&quot; The Beatles achieved more as a group than any one of them ever did alone. The value of teamwork is illustrated by professional sports, and the concepts translate well to the business world, as most creative, productive endeavors require cooperative effort. Individualism is the engine of creativity and capitalism, but a volunatary association of individuals united in a common purpose can often accomplish more than an individual acting alone. This is not a contradiction of either Ayn Rand or Adam Smith.Howard Roark suffered much in his ascent to the top, but much of his suffering was avoidable or at least could have been mitigated by a better strategy, perhaps by seeking the assistance of a good publicist or marketer, the alliance of a competing journalist to Ellsworth Toohey, and by establishing a business network of professional association and cooperation with others who shared his modernist vision.Ayn Rand's novel makes you think, and helps you determine where your own personal philosophy fits into the cacophony of competing ideals. But first and foremost, the Fountainhead is just good fiction. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's easy to lose sight of why we read fiction. When you're young and full of hope-for whatever it is that you will want out of life-or if you're older but still hanging on to that youthful optimism some of us once had, The Fountainhead may be just the book for you. It's a little dated now; no one is that certain anymore-as was the author, and her main character, Howard Roark. But if we could, many of us would still like to be like him, or at least we would like to try.This is a novel about Rand's ideal man, (and some other characters who are almost, but not quite, ideal, and some who are bad). She paints a portrait of what he must look like, and you the reader will see it very clearly. You may hate him, or love him, or simply &quot;shrug.&quot; But you will get to know him; he will live for you. What you decide, Rand says, will be a judgment of you, and to this I agree. It will tell what kind of person you are. Rand's portrait of Roark is like Michelangelo's sculptures and painting. It's that good.That doesn't mean that a rational adult has to agree with every word of this novel-or with Rand's Philosophy in toto. This book, like every great work of art, has to be judged as a whole. This is Rand's best. Even if you end up coming down against her philosophy in its main points, you can still love this book.In a nutshell-it's about &quot;the best within us.&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is Ayn Rand's gift to the world, and to any person, young or old, who strives to live an individual and independent life free of the societal forces that want to crush the bold and spirited energy of the creative mind. This is the book that has changed so many lives, and it does so because it provides a vision of an uncorrupted life: a life based on love of living, and the joy in experiencing one's ability in the face of the corruption and conformity that are so much a part of modern life.I first read this book when I was in Vietnam, and it was love at first sight. It gave words to all the adolescent dreams I aspired to, but had no ability to explain. More than anything, this is a book of liberation, a guide to living in a, many times, confusing and hard to understand world. Here, one gets a vision of the unfettered individual spirit soaring through life, so in love with his work and his vision of what he wants to create, that he is blind to the world of The Banner, the New York newspaper that caters to the lowest common denominator: the gossip; sexual fears and guilts of Mr. and Mrs. Jones; and the hatred of the free and the noble found amongst those whose lives have tumbled into oblivion.If you are a timid conformist, worried about the crowd and what others may think about your behavior, this is not the book for you.But if you are fresh of mind, curious about life, interested in going beyond the stagnant views of everyday life, then \\"The Fountainhead,\\" is your book. It was written with you in mind, and probably is everything you are seeking for your journey here on earth."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Its such a positive book I thoroughly recommend it. The characterisations are brilliant, no muddled mixed grey areas, Rand unashamedly creates extremes to illustrate the book. It made me want to go to America in the 1920's and be an architect! The fresh, forward looking joy of life is genuinely uplifting.The lead character, Howard Roark, with his abrupt, polite conversation with the various people who attempt to sway him provides amusing, cutting but innocent one liners you'll want to use. His independence, demanding nothing from others, was so refreshing. I particularly love the part when Keating rushes up to Roark and demands to know what he really thinks of him. &quot;I never think of you&quot; Replies Roark, with un-contrived honesty. A more enjoyable read, in many ways, than the broader &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; which I would recommend as follow on to this book, after a couple of months rest!And you'll never meet a more vile man than Ellsworth Tooh! ey, nor a more broken man than Gail Wynand. To detract from the book, saying its nazi-ism or social darwinism is ridiculous, I can see no connection! There is scene of the greatest benevolence involving Roark in the book. The infamous \`rape' scene, that many find objectionable, comes over as a private fantasy of Ayn Rand. Its hardly a shocker, it seems nothing like real accounts of rape. Don't let that cloud you.The story is rather \`black and white', but I feel that's deliberate. It is a fictional story, Rand was a novelist first, then a philosopher. It may be currently a favourite with younger people, but its a book that gets richer as you get wiser. I think suggestions that the book is naive are a non-criticism by people who cannot consider a constructive criticism, its the &quot;I'm, older and wiser therefore you wont understand, but I'm right&quot; argument. Incidentally, I'm not that young!. Rand did not write it with a specific demographic audience in m! ind!My advice? Go for it, but only if you're going to ! read it closely and thoroughly, you may as well get as much from the novel as possible."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" sent my world spinning. Though, I was never into reading novels, just reading 5 pages of the book made me crazy to read it in one sit. Howard Roark is my idol.

I learnt lots of things from the book and am very grateful to Ayn Rand for bringing the book to light.There cannot be another book like this in this world for the time to come."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you are interested at all in art, creativity, individualism, the masses vs. the individual, etc., you should read this book. You would find it very intriguing. Ignore what other people have said regarding Rand's philosophy...just read the book and make your own decision. I thought it was quite interesting (and also very satisfyingly fast-paced), but now that you've read my review, you should read the book yourself. That's it, really."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I write here a review of The Fountainhead and also refer to the review I am writing online of Atlas Shrugged. It is no secret that Ayn Rand intended to challenge Judeo-Christian ethics by her writings and philosophy. Most of her followers have interpreted this to mean than she was anti-religious. but this is not so. Her books are actually intensely religious but not at all Judeo-Christian in emphasis or perspective. In the Biblical Garden of Eden story, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was in fact not a Tree of information or of any useful knowledge but rather of Judgment, and as such could only work for its rightful Owner who also created and owned the Garden. Judeo-Christianity emphasizes only that Adam and Eve disobeyed and therefore sinned. In fact they violated a Divine Property Right. The Fountainhead emphasizes this. In The Fountainhead, Roark can be juxtaposed as having the same Divine Right in regard to his own intellectual property and work. with Toohey as the Serpent who instigated the violation, etc. In the end, we have Ayn Rand elevating all mankind, with the exception of Toohey et al, completely out of the confines of the &quot;sin&quot; which Judeo-Christianity still levies upon the descendants of Adam and Eve, through a thoughtful and philosophic appreciation of property rights rather than through some mystifying emphasis on mere obedience. This is a book which should be read before one reads Atlas Shrugged, which takes this philosophic approach to religion even further. The reader should also notice that, in both of these books, Ayn Rand refers to the Garden of Eden &quot;Tree of Knowledge&quot; incorrectly ... as if it is in fact a tree of information ... and therefore herself always defended &quot;disobedience&quot; by advocating that it was always intended to be eaten. This was not a ploy on her part. Despite all of her intense philosophic precision inclusive of religious study, Ayn Rand misread the clear meaning of the forbidden Tree ... thus proving she never ate of &quot;it&quot; herself! So, rather than waste time reading hearsay regarding her alleged &quot;instability&quot; or wondering why a woman who would not keep a dime she did not earn and who would therefore have had to invent an empathy test-tube &quot;affair&quot; and take transcription notes to be of real help to the myriad of broken hearted divorcees who flocked to the Branden Institute for paid counselling, we can all instead think of Ayn Rand as a provable Immaculate Evolution ... and completely above the suspicions currently being implied. There is even a Biblical analogy appropriate for this brilliant and honorable writer which i will refer to more precisely in my review of Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand, was about Howard Roark, who based his reality on reason and thought, rather than siding with the majority. He is an architect, struggling to sell his &quot;modern&quot; designs. His buildings exhibit flawless efficiency and beautiful style. Nevertheless, the masses, choked by the intellectual stranglehold of the tyrannical Ellsworth Toohey, columnist for the most powerful newspaper in New York, refuse to accept his designs and force him into poverty and hopelessness. Will Roark overcome the masses and become a successful architect? Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. I was pulled in by its fast paced dialog and sharply detailed characters. It never moved slowly. I never got bored with it- it had deep meaning and it kept my mind busy with all of the details that made Ayn Rand's vision of a perfect world interesting and original.

Howard Roark was like no one I could possibly imagine, he was a manifestation of everything I wanted to do and be. I finished this book very late the night before I threw the shot put at the state meet in Denver as I tasted the best years of my life drift into nothingness.

The characters remain entrenched in your thoughts. They may not shape your beliefs, but they set you thinking on profound topics such as triumph of individualism, integrity, deep abiding love, and passion for your work. The book meanders into murky waters when dealing with the love-hate relationship between Howard and Dominique, but always steers back to clear waters in time to take you on the ride of your life. I would recommend this book for the discerning reader, it sets you thinking. And Rand's philosophy is true in that constant thought transfers into ideas, which precedes greatness."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is an uplifting and inspirational work that tells the story of Howard Roark, a brilliantly original architect who pursues his dream of creating beautiful and useful buildings. Roark's integrity and rationality are pitted against the establishment's efforts to prevent him from succeeding. Along the way he encounters high and low society, explosions, victories and love.I found the novel gripping, and the first time I read it I could scarcely put it down to enjoy my vacation. In addition to the excellent plot, the philosophical ideas were provocative, inspiring and clearly laid out.Ayn Rand's works often elicit strong opinions from their readers. Nevertheless, people posting reviews here are a self-selecting group and probably hold abnormally passionate opinions, whether pro or con. I suspect that the silent majority of The Fountainhead's readers found much food for thought in its pages, gained a new perspective on themselves and others, and also enjoyed the read. Check it out for yourself and evaluate it on its merits. That's what Howard Roark would likely suggest!I would especially recommend this book to entrepreneurs and readers who value meritocracies, achievement or individual freedom."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A classic. Literature in the true sense. Mandatory reading for aspiring architects and impossible to put back down by anyone else who cracks it's cover. That &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is often ridiculed by today's architectural press for portraying an architect who stubornly stands alone rather than being a &quot;team player&quot; is of little importance to this architect reviewer. The plot, characters, and undercurrents of intellectual ideology are more than enough to induce fascination. This book remains relevant in any era. Even better as a reread, &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; when revisited after several intervening years will awaken new understanding and meaning. To enhance this understanding read noted pshchologist Nathaniel Branden's biography of Ayn (ryhmes with &quot;mine&quot;) Rand, &quot;Jugement Day&quot;, written around 1990. More fascinating than the novel itself, her life story provides a sure footed foundation upon which to build an understanding of this author and her writings. Learn the part that such noted architects as Richard Neutra and Frank Lloyd Wright, not to mention present day economist Norman Greenspan each played in her literary career. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of the fastest paced books I have ever read. Ayn Rand's characters come to life as she paints very clear pictures of who they are and what they represent. She does this in spite of the fact that the dialogue is sometimes a bit wooden and stilted. In this novel, she sets forth her philosophy of &quot;objectivism.&quot; She exposes those, such as a character named Peter Keating, an architect, who seemingly achieve greatness by copying others but somehow give the illusion of originality and creativity. In order to achieve &quot;greatness,&quot; Keating was literally willing to sell anything, including his wife. Thus despite wealth and apparant achievement, his life was empty. Rand begins to formulate her values that altruism is an evil because a society which seeks to achieve this must do so at someone's expense and therefore leads to collectivism. In the person of Ellsworth Toohey, a flamboyant newspaper columnist, she shows how the power hungry manipulate the masses by setting a standard of mediocrity which fosters collectivism.This book is full of passion, including a flaming, complex romantic affair between individualist architect Howard Roarke and socialite Dominique Francon. Their relationship develops from one in which they each seek to assert power over the other while achieving sexual release to one of true love between genuine soul mates. Roarke also has a passion for his work and is uncompromising in his creativity in accomplishing his professional goals. He will not ever compromise these goals despite enormous pressures to do so. Rand believed that there is only black and white in moral issues; there is no gray. Therefore, giving in a little is not compromise but rather, selling out your values and giving in to evil. Roarke was not a man to sell out, he had the courage of his convictions.While setting forth her philosophy, Rand has also given us a novel which has a well developed plot. I found the novel to be gripping and I couldn't put it down. Following the career of Howard Roarke and the machinations of his enemies was fascinating. The plot had enough twists to provide surprises and to hold the reader's interest. This book is both an enjoyable novel as well as a challenging philosophical statement. I like Rand's philosophy and I love this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Read just about any four or five star customer review and you have a fine summary of this book. It is not necessary for me to repeat what has already been said. I myself would like to talk about the individual characters which keep me rereading this book as much as the philosophy does. Roark, Keating, Toohey (shudder), Dominique, etc., all represent facets of humanity, good and evil. But characters like Keating and Wynand are more complex than the characters in Atlas Shrugged. Yes, they are Randian archetypes but they have taught me much about human nature.Keating, had he a little more backbone, might have actually been able to make something of himself. Unlike the villains of AS, he was somewhat sympathetic. He was in love with Catherine, a woman who may not have possessed the glamor and poise of Dominique but who was right for him simply because they were happy when they were together. Fool that he was, he instead opted for what he thought he was supposed to, just as he chose architecture over his true calling, painting. His story is a lesson for all of us. To detractors of the book who call it contemptuous of people I say you don't HAVE to be this way. Don't be a Peter Keating. It is up to you.Ellsworth Toohey is a villain for the ages, somebody you just love to hate. I won't even describe him as a man. I relish the creepy, slimy feeling I get rereading the passages about him. Every patronizing, smarmy sentence that comes out of his mouth is designed to make one cringe. The fact that he DOESN'T seek out wealth, or even happiness, makes him all the worse.It is through him and this book that I learned what is evil: holding society and &quot;the greater good&quot; over the individual. Now, whenever I read or watch the news, I am acutely aware of the malice in people who would say they are trying to protect society when their actions result in harm to an individual, or worse, equate society with an individual as I recently heard from a prominent proponent of the death penalty. Again, he is a lesson to all of us: beware the Ellsworth Tooheys of the world. They are out there.Rand wrote Roark as the ideal man. He certainly is that. I could never expect to be as he is but I firmly believe that he is something to strive for. He had the courage of his convictions. He did not care what other people thought, except those whose opinions mattered to him, such as his mentor, Cameron. Such is the lesson I learned from him. If I find myself jealous or resentful of somebody, I asked myself what my weakness is because fear of one's own shortcomings is from whence hatred and jealousy arise.If it is difficult to relate to a man who does not even see you, as he is frequently described, consider for a moment why it is important for him to see you and why you feel your own worth is based on how others see you. Then consider the friends that he makes in the book, competent and intelligent people who feel about the world as he does. And finally consider what true friendship is. It is not alms to be doled out in the name of compassion. It is respect and love for those whom we enjoy having around us.Dominique Francon is a strange bird (Rand said that Dominique was her in a bad mood). Her motivations are complex but when I think about them, they make sense to me. I see her as somebody who has so much contempt for the world that she doesn't think it deserves a man like Roark (or a woman like her). Hence the reason she works against Roark, not to deprive Roark of a living but to deprive the world of Roark. Clarifying the reasons behind her actions also clarifies that controversial rape scene. It is the ideal man saying to the ideal but obstinate woman that the world cannot destroy him. They spar violently to show how strong they are.Gail Wynand is less interesting to me but an intriguing character nonethless, the man who could have been. He had the drive and the intelligence but, like Dominique, too much contempt. His contempt for humanity at least was purer and cleaner than Toohey's love for humanity. I wonder if, had his childhood not been so brutal, he might have gone a different direction. But then I think that had Roark had a brutal childhood, he still would have come out the same. Such is Wynand's weakness. A sad waste, really.Atlas Shrugged is THE definitive Rand book. I myself certainly feel this way. Nevertheless, The Fountainhead has virtues that one does not find in that mighty tome. As in AS the characters are largely archetypes but interesting in different ways. Even though Atlas Shrugged is several hundred pages longer than The Fountainhead, it also feels more streamlined. The characters are more complex in the latter (except, admittedly, for Roark), maybe because where Atlas Shrugged deals in the steel and railroad industries, The Fountainhead deals in the more aestetic field of architecture which, incidentally, Rand describes beautifully."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Funny how most of the reviews are either unqualified adulation from Rand worshipers or slams from Rand haters. IMO, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is neither a prophetic work of great genius nor a piece of evil tripe. It is a brilliant work, perhaps even with flashes of genius -- but as flawed as its author.I think Rand had the potential to be a great novelist, which she largely ruined when she decided she was the world's greatest philosopher since Aristotle. Any dogma is the enemy of art. If you read Rand's three major novels -- \\"We the Living\\", \\"The Fountainhead\\", and \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" -- you can see her dogma becoming more and more rigid, and her characters less and less human. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a novel you can still appreciate even if you don't agree with the philosophy (and I think the philosophy has some excellent points, just taken to an absurd extreme).Unlike some reviewers here, I don't find Howard Roark to be completely inhuman. He does feel pain -- not only the pain of his own struggle but of his mentor Henry Cameron and his friend Steve Mallory, the sculptor. It's just that, as Rand says, the pain \\"only goes down to a certain point\\" because it can't touch the core of his independent soul. But consider this passage when Dominique tells Roark she has married Peter Keating: \\"It would have been easy, if she had seen a man distorting his mouth to bite off sound, closing his fists and twisting them in defense against himself. But it was not easy, because she did not see him doing this, yet knew that this was being done, without the relief of a physical gesture.\\" Clearly this is a man who feels and suffers. He can feel sympathy as well: for Gail Wynand, even for Peter Keating.At that stage, Rand herself was still capable of sympathy for less-than-perfect characters. Guy Francon, Dominique's father, is an opportunist -- but ultimately still more a good than a bad guy. His relationship with his daughter, sparsely depicted, is nonetheless very \\"real\\" and touching. Even Keating, the ultimate \\"second-hander\\" and in many ways a despicable man, is to some extent sympathetic and is shown as having some good in him. His failed romance with his true love, Katie, is very poignant -- and the scene near the end where he meets her years after dumping her, when she has \\"gotten over\\" him and lost her humanity, is truly heartbreaking. (Though her loss of humanity and selfhood is a little too complete.)Gail Wynand is a fascinating, tragic character throughout -- and in a way, his relationship with Dominique is more interesting than the Howard/Dominique romance. The story of his childhood and his rise in the newspaper industry is absorbing and very well-written.Some reviewers mention stilted dialogue. I don't agree. Yes, there are long passages where the characters preach/philosophize instead of talking, and become nothing but vehicles for Rand's ideas. But apart from that, the dialogue is mostly dynamic, crisp, and quite believable (e.g. the first meeting between Wynand and Dominique).Rand also has a terrific descriptive style. Take this passage describing the aftermath of rain: \\"The pavements glistened, there were dark blotches on the walls of buildings, and since it did not come from the sky, it looked as if the city were bathed in cold sweat. The air was heavy with untimely darkness, disquieting like premature old age, and there were yellow puddles of light in the windows.\\"And there are wonderful, memorable lines; one of my favorites is, \\"All love is exception-making.\\"Now the flaws. The character of Dominique, particularly in the first half of the book, is not very plausible. I don't \\"get\\" her masochism, the wallowing in her degradation at Roark's hands in their first encounter. (And yes, it was definitely rape -- Dominique herself repeatedly describes it as such.) Her motives for trying to destroy Roark's career when she has already realized she loves him never feel \\"real,\\" no matter how Rand tries to rationalize them. I enjoy twisted love-hate relationships as much as the next gal (one of my favorite books is \\"Wuthering Heights\\") but this is twisted beyond plausibility. (Dominique becomes much more believable in the second half of the book, though; the scene where she finally comes back to Roark is great.)Ellsworth Toohey with his grandiose plans for world power is even more implausible. And the idea that the dumbing down of culture is some sort of deliberate plot to pass off mediocre works as great ones in order to debase cultural standards ... puh-leeze.Rand has an annoying tendency to restate every idea a dozen times and hammer the reader over the head with it. Eventually you just want to shout, \\"All right, Ayn -- I got the point!\\"As for the philosophy -- yes, the occasional super-individualist like Howard Roark is great. A lot of great geniuses, including apparently Leonardo da Vinci, didn't have the \\"people\\" gene. But if everyone behaved like that ... I'm not sure it would be such a great world to live in. No matter how much Rand might pretend otherwise, her worship of the great man does have a flip side of contempt for the mass of humanity. See Wynand's comment to Dominique, \\"One can't love man without hating most of the creatures who pretend to bear his name.\\" That's scary. So is Rand's palpable disgust for the imperfections of unheroic human (and particularly female) flesh.A readable, thought-provoking book, but hardly a guide to life. Read it -- but with a critical mind."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'm 38 years old and just read The Fountainhead for the first time. That probably gives me a little more life experience than others who have read it, so here's my two cents.The characters in this book are somewhat exaggerated, but nonetheless are very, very real, in that they have counterparts in the world we live in. Roark is cut from the same cloth that Socrates, Jesus, Luther, Edison, Thomas Jefferson, the Wright Brothers, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton, etc., were. They all had a burning passion for one field of human endeavor. They held revolutionary ideas that were met with scorn by the status quo and the chronically insecure. They struggled against overwhelming odds to see their visions become reality. And, in the end, the proved to be benefactors of all mankind.Keating, Toohey, and Wynand are all parasites to one degree or another. Keating has no real talent, but is a master of back-stabbing and rear-end kissing. In short, he would be a huge success on \\"Survivor.\\" However, his lack of talent and integrity ultimately destroy his career, and his desire to please everyone but himself destroys his soul. Anyone who has ever dealt with office politics has met a Peter Keating.Toohey cripples the very people he says he wants to \\"help.\\" He puts them down in subtle ways and loads them with pathological guilt. He uses people's dependence on him to hold up his faltering self esteem, so he dares not allow them to become truly whole and independent human beings. I have met ministers, teachers, social workers and \\"advocates\\" of various causes who mirror Toohey quite nicely. Jim Jones is a well known real world example. Tony Soprano's mother on the HBO show is a fictional type of Toohey. The atrocious Disney movie \\"Pocohontas\\" was shot full of Tooheyisms.Wynand is a pimp. He makes money off of society's shortcomings, all the while making those shortcomings worse. He's like the executives who produce bilge like \\"gangsta rap\\" CDs,publish rags like The Enquirer, make stars of people like Britney Spears, and create shows like Jerry Springer.Roark is hated and feared by them and people like them, because they would rather cling to the trash at hand than reach up and snatch a pearl.I've dealt with Keatings, Tooheys, and Wynands all my adult life. You can find them in business meetings, on church boards, working for government agncies and participating in civic groups. They are real, they are numerous, and they really are a threat to the progress of the human race.Ms. Rand felt that the world was full of lazy idiots, and that it is kept going by the blood, sweat and tears of a handful of people with intelligence, passion and integrity. If you read the past reviews, you'll realize she was right. So many of them must have been written by people who didn't give the book the careful reading it deserves, if they actually read it at all.If you decide to read this book, be warned now that it's no walk in the park. I spent the first half of it thinking \\"Roark, chill, dude, it's just a damn building!\\" It's only later that you understand how architecture is used as a metaphor for all fields of human pursuit. Also, it is subtly revealed towards the end that Roark's real beef with historical architecture is not that it is deficient or worthless, but that nothing has been added to it since its development. The architects of his day paid homage to the past, but did not seek to develop new and improved techniques of their own. In this way, they were living \\"second hand\\" off the genius of others.Journeying through the Fountainhead is like walking through a field of diamonds that are buried just beneath the surface. There are innumerable treasures waiting to be found, but you must be observant and careful to find them. Be assured, the reward is worth the effort.I give the book four stars because it does have some significant flaws. Ms. Rand exercises poor word choice. For example she speaks of the folly of \\"living for others\\" when she really means \\"living for the approval of others.\\" This, plus her use of words like \\"selfishness\\" versus \\"altruism\\" to describe things like self confidence versus neurotic co-dependency are major problems. It's almost as if she wanted to blur what she was saying just enough to force the reader to think deeply about what they were reading. Or perhaps the fact that English wasn't her first language was a hindrance - I don't know.Warning: the initial, violent love scene between Roark and Dominique is probably an extension of her own sex fantasies, which apparently had a strong sado-masochistic element. It is detrimental to the message of the book, and is it's greatest shortcoming. Also, she seems unneccessarily antagonistic towards religion. There is much in the Bible, ex. the parable of the talents, as well as Jesus' admonition to not cast pearls to swine, that dovetails nicely with the book's message. I believe that she over reacted to what she saw happening in her native Soviet Union, throwing out all notions of collective effort and responsibility in favor of an absolute emphasis on the individual.Nonetheless, it is extremely well written, especially in its descriptive power. Ms. Rand knew and loved New York City intimately, and that comes forth strongly. Also, its message, if you take the time to properly understand it, is profoundly true, and applicable to the human condition as a whole. All in all, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I feel the purpose of reading is to be challenged: ideologically, philosophically, politically, etc. Either those challenges will cause one to rethink one's beliefs or strengthen one's existing convictions. Either of these outcomes will produce, I believe, a better person - a thinker who is willing to encounter more than one argument, one side to any issue, and still retain opinions of one's own.I would also like to counter some of the comments that the book is simply a thinly veiled treatise on Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. If anyone read the introduction written by Rand she answers a fundamental question:&quot;Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? ... This is the motive and purpose of my writing; the projection of the ideal man ... My purpose, first cause and prime motive is the portrayal of Howard Roark as an end in himself.&quot;What I understood from Rand's statement is that her ultimate goal is to present her characters - showing, through their actions and inactions, attitudes and convictions - and the good and bad points of their diverse perspectives on life. In interpreting the book, I feel one should focus on how one perceives the characters, not on what the afterward by Leonard Peikoff or any other outside source espouses.Form your own opinion of the philosophical ideas expressed in the book - do not rely on Piekoff's interpretation or the interpretation of this review or others. Read the book and analyze the characters on your own - pull from them what grabs at you - what relates to any of your life experiences. To me, that is the most effective way to think and read. Think critically and scrutinize closely and you will not fail to learn from most every part of life.This is how I approached the novel and I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Wow. Where to start with a book of this size, scope, and complexity?Well, first, Ayn Rand is not a goddess. The sheer number of quasi-disciples ranting on this website (and others) about how she changed their lives are not only frightening, they're missing the point. Of course, their blind adherence to her philosophy will allow them to brand me a \\"second-hander\\" or something of the sort and write off my comments as frightened or jealous. Go Googling for \\"Ayn Rand cult\\" sometime, and you'll see just how far the tentacles of this beast can stretch.With that said, this is actually a very enjoyable book. Not often can I find myself pulled ahead from page to page by the writing style of a Harlequin Romance series novelist, while simultaneously being forced to pause and ponder some of the complex motivations of her characters or the ideas they (sometimes unconvincingly) exchanged during lengthy monologues. Rand has some very original ideas (or at least cobbles together an original synthesis of these ideas from other philosophies/ers). Her ideas on individuality, while carried here to an extreme, could stand to be applied in moderation to a culture that seems to now be run by masses of simpering Keatings who refuse to accept responsibility.The character of Gail Wynand is, to me, the most interesting in the whole book. Though all of the characters, at various times, make decisions that seem strange based on complex motives dealing with unusual ideas of pleasure, pain, and need, Wynand does this almost constantly. He grants the people power over him by convincing himself he owns them; he befriends Roark, tries to save him, and then abandons him after Roark saves himself; the list goes on and on. Despite the woodenness and archetypicality of most of the other characters, in Wynand Rand managed to create someone genuine and believable.And for those claiming that Roark rapes Dominique, to my recollection she does not fight back. That would make it rape. Sex can be violent, and often is, without the actual act of rape taking place. Considering how messed-up Dominique's ideas of power and pleasure are, she might just be a textbook masochist, in which case causing her sexual pain would be the highest pleasure Howard could give her.Now for the caveats:First, this novel displays an astounding naivete about human nature and socioeconomic theory. Especially in the wake of corporate accountability scandals, is there anyone left who actually believes that the Roarks of the world will triumph over those who are willing to sleaze around and take whatever they can whenever they can from whomever they can? The current climate in America is a strange one: Tooheys abound, but they are in Roarkian positions in society. Rand's assumptions about the nature of power and of the masses have proven not to be quite as accurate as they first seem.I would also recommend finding out a bit about Rand's life before either slamming or idolizing this book, or any of her others. For instance, knowing that her family's store was taken over by the state in Russia, forcing her family into poverty when she was still a child, can help put into perspective her near-hysterical insistence that collectivism can never work, EVER, IN ANY FORM!!!(etc...). And knowing a bit about her circle of devotees and their practices, such as a modified process of expulsion and banishment for members that Rand disagreed with, can show what the world would be like populated with megalomaniacs like Roark, or Rand herself.Overall, this is a very thought-provoking, enjoyable read, to be read by anyone frustrated with the vapidity and self-conscious posturing of most modern novels. Just don't get sucked one way or the other by the raging controversies and you'll come out of it enriched and (possibly) more understanding of the mindset of anyone you know who may seem to behave like Roark at times.And to those who whine that Roark's ending speech is too long, pick up Atlas Shrugged. If memory serves, John Galt's ending speech is at least four times as long."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"\\"The Fountainhead\\" is a great rarity; a well-written and successful philosophical novel. Though Ayn Rand becomes occasionally too didactic, I realize that she was concerned that some readers would be unable to see the points she was making. I did find this novel humorous at points, as Rand placed Howard Roarke, her protagonist, in contrast to his environment so that Roarke appeared to be in control of his environment. Those who understand this novel will find humor in many places. I am unsure of how much of the humor was intentional and how much was unintentional.There are several principal characters in this 700+ page book. Howard Roarke is an architect. Roarke believes in himself and is a creator. Rand uses Roarke as her example of the \\"perfect\\" man. Rand contrasts Roarke primarily with Peter Keaton. Keaton is an adapter of technology. He \\"borrows\\" his architectural concepts from historic styles rather than focusing on the practical and having form follow function. Keaton panders to popular styles. Roarke designs plans that are functional and fit within their environment. The beauty of Roarke's designs is in their functionality and how each design fits its environment. Unfortunately, repetitive design is valued, and creativity is not.There are several other significant characters in this book. Ellsworth Toohey is a newspaper columnist. Toohey exemplifies mediocrity. Toohey is manipulative and power hungry, but is so subtle in his machinations that few people recognize Toohey for what he is. I was fascinated that Toohey seemed to want a worthy opponent and lamented that his opponents were unable to see what Toohey was doing. Toohey's comments and actions imply that Toohey seeks socialism or communism, but he wants to be the absolute dictator. Toohey seems to have all the worst characteristics of communism and fascism.Gail Wynand is the owner of a chain of newspapers. Wynand is a self made man. Wynand is quite similar to Roarke in many ways, though it takes us a long time to discover the similarities. Both men eventually come to admire each other.Dominique Francon is very important to the novel. She appears cold-hearted, though she is not. She becomes a connection between Keating, Wynand and Roarke. However, Dominique realizes that she will likely destroy nearly everyone she contacts. Rand uses Dominique as a tool for continuity throughout the novel and to aid in contrasting the characteristics of the three men in Dominique's life.What is \\"The Fountainhead\\" about? It is about one man pursuing his quest for what he believes to be right, regardless of what most of the world thinks. Rand hypothesizes that if that man is correct, and has an objective ideal as his goal, that eventually the rest of the world will recognize the validity of that man's (or woman's) viewpoint and follow along. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is against the average, against mediocrity, against collectivism, against rule by committee, and against the manipulation of people by those whose only purpose is to seek power over other men. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is for individualism, for creativity, for following your own path and for objective truth.Ayn Rand tried to keep her explanations relatively simple. She characterized people as those who lived through others and those who lived for themselves. However, I think there could be a third category, which Rand likely classified as the second category. As we know, not every person is highly creative. But, an average person may well recognize the creativity of a person such as Roarke, and admiring such creativity, does what they can to bring that creativity to realization. I would call this third category a person who facilitates the creator.The first time I read \\"The Fountainhead,\\" I considered the book profound. I looked at the world, and myself, in a different perspective. This book is easy to read, but it is not light reading. The book requires a lot of thought, and you may find that you disagree with Rand or you may be disappointed. If you are a potential Howard Roarke, it is unlikely that you will read this book at all. For the rest of us, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a great work of fiction that embodies what many of us like to believe is the basis of the United States. While there may be a little cowboy in us, there is a lot of pioneer spirit, which was founded on a strong sense of individualism. We can only hope that these ideals remain with us in the future.I hope you find this book as incredible as I did. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Only thing that was keeping me from ever reading The Fountainhead were the dozen number of people who recommended it to me. It is a certified guaranteed winner as per most people (most of whom cannot frame a sentence without using words such as \\"nice\\" , \\"intelligent\\" ,\\"sweet\\" etc.)The Fountainhead is impactful,precise,gigantic in it's scope, the work of a mastermind. Ayn Rand shocked me(again) with her control over character definitions and flabbergasting logic. After I had finished reading Atlas Shrugged, I felt a bit cheated and robbed of my time. Don't get me wrong, \\"A.S\\" has my favourite book character of all time in Fransisco but it is the \\"giving in\\" nature of most characters in Atlas Shrugged that made it seem a bit too harsh to me.There is a certain preachiness in the words of John Galt that didn't really sell consequence. Moving on, about Fountainhead I'd like to say that it has the best and most well conceived perception of a human brain I've read. Some of my favourite characters in the book are Peter Keating, Gail Wynand (the best), Ellsworth Toohey (never has a character been this interesting in his villain own self) and the hero, Howard Roark. One very tactful and intentional foreplay of characters is the fact that they are all unique. You will never once in the book find a flaw or loophole in any of the characters. What I'm trying so hard to say will be better explained by examples.Howard Roark never says more than he thinks he must in this book and often says nothing when you'd expect him to talk. Gail Wynand doesn't ever give away his self respect into the hands of another and never begs anyone. Ellsworth Toohey never gets himself into trouble despite the mind riots he causes most lesser people in the book.Ayn Rand has an astounding quantity of mind. She shocks me repeatedly in this book by adding a shape to certain thoughts every 20 something year old guy goes through. I do not like the part where there is raw love between Howard Roark and Dominique because it seems a bit too barbaric and unrealistic for me to swallow. It's surprising how boring and dull the book became for a few pages when Roark and Dominique Francon meet. There is a certain sarcasm that the book displays in paragraphs containing comments made by the local people. Fountainhead was extremely funny in it's own silent subtle way at times.WHY IS IT BETTER THAN ATLAS SHRUGGED(to me)?I hope I do not offend anyone by comparing the two but like many readers have pointed out, most characters of The Fountainhead grow on you and towards the last few pages your pace of reading declines(intentionally). Gail Wynand with his practicality and adaptation skills makes more of a hero than any of the much exaggerated Atlas Shrugged Characters. Atlas Shrugged is an epic in itself but it doesn't manage to grip you like The Fountainhead does. Most books ignore the character details of the villains but in Fountainhead, Ellsworth Toohey gets a whole lot of pages dedicated to him.Gail Wynand with his \\"I Do\\" yacht was easily the most eyebrow raising thing in the book. Wynand fought a life against all odds. For him to believe in his own individual existence came as a shocker to me. Wynand is very inspiring. I won't say much because the more I talk of Gail Wynand, the more I feel I'm depriving him of a quality summary.Ellsworth Toohey made me smile with how well knew the people around him. His attention to detail and \\"liquid cement memory\\" were both very well jotted down. Dominique Francon was a bit of a mixed bag which is why I don't mention her very often. She was almost half as bad as Dagny Taggart from Atlas Shrugged.To end what I had to say, The Fountainhead is the best book I have read in my life. It's reassuring, almost magical touch of brilliant storywriting , flawless character defintions and the much loved irony brings me down to my knees. I do not suggest this book to everyone maybe because I do not think everyone will quite understand it. In any case, Enjoy whatever works.I loved all reviews on this book because even the negative ones make a lot of sense come to think of it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is almost un-critiqueable due to its uniqueness and the awe with which it is held by the late Miss Rand's more devoted followers. But I'll try! The plot spans the years 1922 to about 1938 and traces the career arc of two rival architects, Howard Roark and Peter Keating. Roark's approach to design and function in architecture is roughly based on Frank Lloyd Wright's; Keating is a meretricious copyist incapable of an original idea whose main function seems to be to look good in a tuxedo while entertaining clients. Roark's fatal flaw is that he accepts no client changes to his architectural plans - none whatsoever, not even the most conservative Greek column on the ground floor of a bank building. Of Roark and Keating, whom do you think has the more successful career? By the late-1920s Keating has become the toast of Manhattan while Roark is reduced to poverty. Yet it is Roark to whom Keating slinks when he has trouble designing an ultramodern skyscraper for a prestigious competition. Roark is allegedly the egomaniacal one, yet he helps Keating without asking for recognition or payment of any kind.Things get even more perverse on the love front. Not to give too much of the plot away, but a sensous, emotionally distant woman who is just Roark's type takes up with exactly the kind of men who hurt Roark the most. It's utterly appalling and yet, in Rand's equation, somehow convincingly human, which makes it all the more appalling. The path to heroism in an Ayn Rand novel is never easy.There's a lot more going on, including a sleazy gazillionaire publisher with the seeds of greatness, an urbane man of letters who should have been murdered in the crib, and a public housing project that didn't survive to see the light of day. But probably the most salient feature of THE FOUNTAINHEAD is that it is a philosophical novel about the nature of human progress, how it is achieved, by whom and at what cost. (Lucky for us, the speechifying is relayed mostly through dialog and doesn't clutter the plot.)So is THE FOUNTAINHEAD a good book? I'm not sure that Miss Rand would agree with the tenets of &quot;vox populi, vox dei,&quot; but suffice it to say that the book hasn't been out of print since it was first published in 1943 and the New American Library still derives a significant amount of its income from Rand's writings. Read this book, and if you like it go on to the more challenging ATLAS SHRUGGED. You don't have to adopt any kind of political agenda to enjoy THE FOUNTAINHEAD."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many of those who read the Fountainhead have tried to classify it -- the shallow saw it as a book about architecture, the cynical, a book about extremism, and the more respectful and intelligent majority saw it as a book about identity and not falling to the will of the consensus. But I think this last statement is as trivializing the work as the formal two. Many lost, seeking individuals these days try to &quot;find oneself&quot;, and seek identity for its sake. There is nothign noble or great about this. What makes this work then so noble and heroic is the unbreaking integrity of the main character, Howard Roark. Roark was not so lost or so unsure of himself. He had no identity to find. Instead, throughout this 700 page work, all he tries to do is bring out the thing in himself to the world without making it impure by inteference or unwelcome influences. The idea seems to simple, but Ayn Rand writes in such a way as to move you through Roark's single-minded integrity. In the end, one gets the feeling that this &quot;integrity&quot; for one's work was not unreasonable obsession, or stupid extremism, seeking identity, or just about building pretty buildings. It was integrity.In short, what the author says is this: In our lives we are forced to make so many compromises which conflict with out basic beliefs. But in soem things there shoudl be no compromises at all, no matter what society will say or do, because in the end your integrity is more important then the judgement of strangers.Read this work. It will stir you like no other.."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"i read this book in two days. could not put it down after i finished it i read atlas shrugged another great book"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a great piece of literature.

Ayn considers her characters far more interesting than they actually are with all kinds of worthless side-stories. The main thrust of the book is interesting, but not critically examined.

A novel which possesses a modern edge that exploits the vices and struggles of humanity--especially the conflict of the individual with the outside world. It emphasizes the grip society has on a person, making her inadequate of recognizing herself as the god of her own destiny in the face of her oppressors. Probably one of the most startling and revealing works of the twentieth century. In fact, by reading this reveiw you have already become a victim to the devices Rand stoically warns her readers about.

Altriusm doesn't necessarily mean you will sell your soul... because of the way she distorts the true definition of altriusm and self-sacrifice, she garners a lot more attention.... perhaps it was deliberate, I don't know.Even though I have such strong disagreements at the foundation level, the secondary issues of her philosophy are valuable.The part I enjoyed the most about the book were the conversations amongst the characters. The characters are psychologically developed to the utmost... in one sense, it's almost ridiculous at how correct their judgments on one another are, but it is still within the realm of feasibility."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Amazing, how a book written so long ago can be written about some people today.

You can't avoid understanding and analyzing their actions, as the author intended you to do. This book is so well written, and did not come into it's own until well after the death of the author. Compelling listening that would be a terrifc addition to your library of classics."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is a very explorative book, and probably would have been controversial in the era that Ayn Rand wrote it.

I still pick it up occasionally now (20 years later) and read a chapter or two. Rand's presentation of man as a heroic being is still very uplifting, particularly in a culture laden with religious ideas such as original sin, guilt, etc. I also think Rand's use of metaphors is among the best of any novelist. Her passionate, attacking style is also quite exciting and in stark contrast to most novels that are just simply boring. How many novelists really push the envelope and cause you to think? I haven't come across many. Of all Rand's novels, this is my favorite and I highly recommend it.

Objectivism would be such a valuable paradigm for people to embrace, especially in the 'modern' world where 'second-handism' seems to tbe the coin of the realm.Do yourself and the rest of us a favor, and get this book as well as Atlas Shrugged.Read, Reflect, Repeat"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"According to Ayn Rand, there are two kinds of people: the creative individualist who discovers new ideas, who does not go along with what is considered popular, and the altruist, who is a mediocrity, and goes along with concensus opinion. Ms. Rand says that government leaders and especially dictators, carry out policies thought to be for the good of the many, but. instead wind up causing mass destruction.Rand's supreme individualist in _The Fountainhead_ is Howard Roark, a unique architect who is creative and eschews architectural designs accepted, for many years, by the public and other architects. Roark, as an architectural student, bucks the curriculum so much, that he is expelled from school. Given a commission to build a temple, Roark, his creativity in high gear, is sued by his client for \\"perverting\\" the final project into nothing at all his client had in mind.Peter Keating, Roark's architectural rival, is the typical Rand collectivist: he goes along with what is accepted in building design, has no imagination and is more concerned with making money than with creating a work of art. Keating endeavors so much to become a partner in his architectual firm that he harasses an old and infirm partner until the partner dies and Keating gets his wish.Another major character in this book is Gail Wynand, the extraordinarily successful publisher of the Banner, a scandal mongering tabloid. Wynand's enemy is Ellsworth Toohey, who writes a very popular column in the Banner and is considered the devil incarnate in the book. Wynand, the individualist backs Roark, whom the former considers a genius. Keating is given an assignment by Roark to build Courtland, a school for severely disadvantaged children, as long as Keating promises not change anything in the design. Courtland is going to be erected to satisfy the need of a certain segment of society, which, naturally goes against the grain of Rand's anti-altruistic philosophy.What happens to Courtland is quite shocking and Roark goes to trial for it. Wynand initially supports Roark and is then forced to abandon Roark when Wynand's employees are so incensed by Wynand's policy that they strike. Wynand must compromise some of his ideals, including rehiring certain hated collectivist and altruistic individuals. Wynand, who thoroughly dislikes Roark by this time, asks the latter to build a monument to Wynand, who knew that he does not have the courage and imagination of Roark to accomplish all that Wynand honored.This is a very powerfully written novel, with lots of interesting and well developed characterizations. I do not necessarily agree with Rand's philosophy and believe that she saw the world too much in all or nothing, black and white terms. The book deservedly has become a huge best seller throughout the years since it was published, and will continue to engender heated debate on both sides of the issue."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In my book, Ayn Rand still stands as one of the most powerful fictional writers capable of imbuing her work with philosophical ideals, and The Fountainhead is no let down. Yes, her characters can be a little one-sided, with unbending ideals they seem capable of upholding in the midst of the greatest strife. However, just being able to imagine and describe these kinds of intellectual pariahs and support their personas with such thorough background is a significant accomplishment.The only point at which this became unwieldy to me was during one of the final scenes, when court dialog is used as a thin disguise for Rand to rail on about her ideals through her protagonist and to tie some of the final plot knots. Normally, this would have been fine to me, except this diatribe goes on for quite a few pages. I considered lowering my rating to 4 stars in light of this grueling scene, but in the end, even this faux pas is excellently written and well-supported.Overall, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of self, individualism, and motivation. The only book in Rand's arsenal that tops this is Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"An excellent book. Though some of Rand's beliefs may seem a bit extreme, think of the book as a guide, not a bible. It's changed the way I view life and my place in society. It's changed my priorities and goals very much as well. Also a must read: Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many of the reviewers have commented on how reading this book has changed their lives. I can see that, but I can't say I fall into that category.I certainly found the book and Rand's philosophy interesting. The book is about 700 pages of character development. Personally, I think Rand could have written 400 pages and still been as effective at explaining her philosophy. Roark (the main Objective?) and the other main characters are meant to represent extremes and are therefore not particularly likable. The story moves quickly and has some interesting, unexpected twists.Overall, I recommend reading this book. I wasn't stunned by the philosophy but it's worth the read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand brings to light a side of humanity that is often overlooked. America is a stage for countless players described as second - handers. Thank God for those people with passion and convictions. You could be a Roark. This book is a capitalist's survival tool. It is your responsibility to yourself to use it and benefit from the insights it contains. Learn from the mistakes of the villains. This book could have used a better editor (typos, missing words, etc.), however in essence it contains many perceivable truths. After you're done, you'll realize you could have spent all that time creating something instead of loafing around and reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The depth and inner conflicts of rand's characters creates a fluidly readable and purposeful novel. The philos of the characters and the plot weaves into a intricate tapestry of chalenging interactions, between the ego of the architect and public opinion. A subtle contrast is also created between the depth and scale of domonique's persona ans the relative complex simplicity of howard roark. this book is an icon of publishing and has inspired many young architects and thinkers alike."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was my first Ayn Rand book to read, a easy, understandable read because its in the form of a fictional novel. The main reason I like this book and felt angry sometimes is because Howard(the main character) gets [bothered] alot but he doesn't care, he is too pure. I was getting mad at him for not getting upset. It was fairly easy to understand Ayn Rands philosophies on life because they were portrayed through the characters. I think if you read this book you will be surprised at how it will affect the way you feel about yourself and your ego."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Hi ...I read this book almost 5 times and came to buy this time through Amazon as lost my previous copy ..just got the chance to write a review .you can imagine i am a die heart fan of this book ..just remember quoting one sentence from the same .\\"To say somebody I LOVE YOU first you need to learn how to say I\\"amazing .. a superb book .."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend who said I should read it before I read Atlas Shrugged, not because it was related to it but because it would make AS a better read.

I highly recommend this book as it should be a required read for all college students."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD or ATLAS SHRUGGED, you feel as though you've been spoiled forever, because you realize that, henceforth, few authors are likely to afford you the sense of rapturous enjoyment you've come to expect from a literary masterpiece. And the reason I ardently recommend Rand's novels -- even go out of my way to purchase them gratuitously for friends or acquaintances whom I suspect have the mind and soul to appreciate them -- is because it gives me the vicarious pleasure to re-experience through these first-time readers the powerful writing and deep-probing insight into human nature contained in both these outstanding works.One of the most startlingly dramatic paragraphs from THE FOUNTAINHEAD appears when the brilliant, but villainous, Ellsworth Toohey (disingenuous champion of the \\"common man\\"...ridiculing denouncer of human intelligence...unrepentant hater of human ability and achievement) eagerly reveals the true nature of his iniquitous soul to an equally brilliant adversary (Dominique Francon), whom he realizes has the intellectual capacity to understand his evil...and the moral integrity to despise him precisely for it. Looking out over the radiant lights of New York City, Toohey softly utters to her the following:\\"Look at it. A sublime achievement, isn't it? A heroic achievement. Think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the millions who profit by it. And it is said that but for the spirit of a dozen men, here and there down the ages, but for a dozen men - less, perhaps - none of this would have been possible. And that might be true. If so, there are - again - two possible attitudes to take. We can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are all fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit, and that we are glad to accept it in gratitude and brotherhood. Or, we can say that by the splendor of their achievement which we can neither equal nor keep, these twelve have shown us what we are, that we do not want the free gifts of their grandeur, that a cave by an oozing swamp and a fire of sticks rubbed together are preferable to skyscrapers and neon lights - if the cave and the sticks are the limit of our own creative capacities. Of the two attitudes, Dominique, which would you call the truly humanitarian one? Because, you see, I'm a humanitarian.\\"Only Ayn Rand could have captured with such incisive subtlety the essence of human evil."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Being an original thinker, I can relate to Howard Roark in a lot of ways; for one, I was asked to transfer departments when new management was hired, wanting nothing more than obsequious yes-men at their disposal. Myself notwithstanding, modern society as a whole should be able to relate to this in many ways.Throughout the book, the architecture community, and the Banner readers gradually come to hold Ellsworth Toohey--the principal antagonist--in high esteem. Conversely, an individualist such as Roark is principally concerned with his own visions, rather than the opinions of others. Fast forward to the present day, and we are becoming a society more concerned with public opinions than ever. For example, a website such as Yelp has magnified the voice of the general public; consequently, many of my friends will refuse to eat at a restaurant that doesn't have 'at least four stars.'While many of aspects of the book are flawed, it is still well worth the rather extensive read; despite its length, the story progresses quite fluidly."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a book that should be boring. A nearly 700 page novel mostly about a bunch of architects standing around talking. Yet it is mesmerizing! Ayn Rand breaks down and dissects each character and their motivations in a constantly thought-provoking way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Wish I would have discovered this book along time ago. The storyline of Roark and his struggles through life as he is not wiling to compromise what's important to him was a gripping read. Actually caught myself staying up late at night trying to squeeze in just one more chapter. Never had a book that actually wanted me to cuss a character (Elisworth) for being such a crooked manipulative man.While it is an incredible book that everyone should read there are parts that tend to get long it the tooth, particularly Elisworth's Phislophy rants."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I had heard a lot about this book, but it took me a while to read it because the mere length and size of the book intimidated me. I eventually came across the audiobook version, so I quickly got and began listening to it. This book eloquently described Ayn Rand's philosophy, which is what I was mostly after. After finishing the book, I can definitely tell that this book is one of those books I will keep referring back to in terms of my outlook on life. The main thing to take away from this is that man can only be truly happy when he is pursuing his own self-interest, an interest that is selfish by nature."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"First of all, I do not understand the animosity of most of the reviews. The objectivist (artist, own man) character is usually the hero in most books and movies. This has been true since Greek times. I think a lot of people are putting in their views of Rand and are not really reviewing the book. No, she did not invent the wheel. Yes, it is true she is not the only person that wrote a book with an objectivist type hero and in fact most books and movies have one. Most cartoons have one. In fact, they are a little more blatant as far as the message goes. I am sorry if that upset her in any way to realize this. And I am sorry to say that to most Ayn Rand fans. She really did not invent the wheel as far as ideology goes, but she wrote one great book. What makes this book great is that our hero, Howard Roarke is flawed. In all the other stories, movies, and books I have read the objectivist type hero is always perfect. Roarke is far from perfect. Ayn Rand does not try to make him appear any better than he is, and in fact, she sacrifices his image to prove a point about how society views women. I would even say she outright smears him. No writer other than Shakespeare has ever done that to the hero. That's what makes the book great. It has a lot of the same themes as Titanic, except the characters are three dimensional and they all have flaws. Even the Jack/Roarke character. You even feel kind of sorry for the Peter Keening character (who is like Cal). He is human, he he does not come off as a bad guy. In fact, his life revolves around being nice to everyone. He really admires Howard Roarke, who keeps snubbing him. He's kind of nice guy that gets in the middle of a game that he never asked for. Roarke and Keening also kind of start off the same, they go to the same college. But Roarke gets expelled. In fact, I think this gives Roarke more respect but it is harder to feel sorry for him because he causes his own demise. In the end though, he prevails and he doesn't die. He never dies. That's great, and it is so original. In other story lines, like in Titanic, Jack is in the position he is in due to no fault of his own, and he dies. It is easier to feel for the objectivist type artist when they are downtrodden due to no fault of their own. It is harder to feel sorry for someone when you give this character respect and allow them live, and Ayn does. It is just so brave, and unlike anything I have ever read. I fully recommend it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book was written and appeared in 1943 and I remember that I read it then and was hugely impressed.- After so many years I had forgotten much of its plot, so that, when I heard that a friend of mine was reading it, I ordered a copy for me at Amazon.- This time I was so tremendously fascinated that I finished its 694 pages(Centennial Edition) in four days.- It is truly inspiring and the characters and the plot are extremely well drawn, as well is Ms. Rand's general premise that all collectivism and work in committes are \\"second-hand\\" and cannot really be as creative as the lonely effort of a gifted individual.- The book is a hymn to the creative mind of man, and to absolute freedom.- She rejects all altruism as egotism, and she makes a very convincing case for it.- If one has to \\"criticize\\" something, maybe it would be that the dialogues often become long monologues, which is probably unavoidable because with this book the author wants to explain and to defend a theory of hers, whch she calls \\"objectivism\\".- The book, even after so many years, is a MUST READ for young and old.-"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read Fountainhead 45 years ago and have frequently returned to it and Atlas Shrugged (which has unfortunately become prophetic). Rand's gift to us of logic and rational thought has been my rock to cling to in the midst of chaos. And really, more is learned thru her lovable, insidious villian, Toohey, than the other characters. He puts into words in his discourse to Keating just before Roark's last trial what you've learned from plot and characters. No other villian comes close. \\"I play the stock market of the soul, and I sell short,\\" he says seemingly kidding earlier in the book.

It ended up having a very similar theme to Atlas Shrugged, but this theme was very well hidden up until the ending, and I thought that the book was definitely more effective than her incredible title: Atlas Shrugged.

I enjoyed getting to know them throughout the script, and look forward to seeing them again in print.Enjoy this book! It is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As a disclaimer for this review, I must hereby state my political postition: I am a devout liberal. So devout, in fact, that I considered making myself a nice book cover out of brown paper in order to disguise the fact that I was reading such an infamously aliberal book as The Fountainhead. (I decided against it-- paper is a valualbe natural resource, you know, and it shouldn't be wasted for something as frivolous as my vanity). But I must confess, after toiling through all 704 pages of it, that I didn't abhor it. Not consistently, in any case. One of my main comlaints is that most of the characters, including Howard Roark, the hero, and his lover, Dominique, are entirely static throughout the book. There is not one point at which Roark's incredible integrity is compromised enought to make him seen even slightly human. While Rand's stated goal is to portray life \\"as it might and ought to be,\\" it becomes ineffective when the characters are too obviously godlike for humans to even aspire to. Also, for all his supposed integrity, Roark (and all the other characters in the book, for that matter) think and act entirely in contradictions. No one ever sinply eats a piece of bread because he is hungry; he eats it because it is the best way to make someone else conscious of his indifference toward them, even thought what he wants most is their love. Here is a prime example: \\"It hurts me every time I think of him. It makes everything easier-- the people, the editorials, the contracts-- but easier because it hurts so much. Pain is a stimulant also. I think I hate that name. I will go on repeating it. It is a pain I wish to bear.\\" Huh? Another complaint: after years of the world's absolute contempt (at least outwardly) for Roark, I found his final triumph completely unbeleivable. Finally, I resent Rand's manipulativeness. Face it: this book is not an artistically written novel, but a piece of Objectivist propaganda. I suppose I resent the fact that, no matter how much one may, in principle, agree with the opinions of the antagonist, Ellsworth Toohey, his positions are so radical, and taken to such ridiculous extremes that the reader has no choice but to hate him. Who could possible agree with the sentiment that all reason should be automatically discounted in favor of intuition and \\"feelings\\"? Toohey's lengthy diatribes against selfishness and his sermons about his plans for the world come off more like the rantings of a mad scientist than a sane (if \\"misguided\\")philosopher.I did say, however, that I don't hate the book. I like the message of the triumph of artistic individualism against the garbage of the masses, and I even found the scene in which Gail Wynand (a man who understands Roark and tries oh-so-hard to be like him and stand up for his beliefs) is finally crushed by the power of the ignorant masses rather moving. To this end, I say read the book. Yes it IS long, I know. But at least you will have broadened you horizons. If only to understand the mind of the enemy. ;-)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read The Fountainhead years and years ago and, like most very young people, I loved it. I came across it recently while clearing out boxes of old books; now that I am older and (hopefully!) wiser, I wondered if the book would hold up for me, and I re-read it. I did still like the book, but certain things stood out for me that I don't believe registered with me originally, particularly Ayn Rand's innate elitism and her fascination with physical looks (particularly concerning women).When she depicted someone of admirable character she would so very often describe them as having a noble, aristocratic or patrician bearing. She was particularly fond of the word aristocratic to convey the idea of physical attractiveness. Also, she continually portrayed Dominique as fragile, delicate or insubstantial in appearance, qualities which I believe were meant to put the reader in mind of a frail but lovely princess (i.e., the opposite of a robust working-class type who would, presumably by definition, not be beautiful).On the other hand, Rand's short-hand for conveying a person or type of person's low character was to describe them as having as much intellectual depth as a chambermaid, or in one instance, as being about as refined as \\"a woman you might see riding the subway.\\" This last one amused me, since I have frequently ridden the subway. Another, rather horrifying means of conveying unattractiveness was to describe someone as being \\"greasy\\" or \\"thick\\" lipped.I think the most appalling instance of her reflexive distaste for the poor was when Howard Roark is pitching to a committee the idea of a summer resort aimed toward the needs of the middle class. He says that the very rich and the very poor do not have a dilemma as to how to enjoy their summers because (paraphrasing): \\"The rich can simply escape to their estates, and the poor don't mind the feel and smell of one another's bodies against one another in the summer.\\"Rand's stubborn determination to equate beauty with goodness and ugliness or poverty with evil I think connects to her own personal obsession with physical looks. Over the years I read that she was extremely preoccupied with other people's looks and would genuflect toward a person she found to be particularly attractive. She herself felt her only two good features were her eyes and her legs, and always took pains to show off those assets.I'm focusing on these two aspects of the novel (Rand's fixation on physical beauty as denoting goodness or integrity and her automatic loathing of poverty vs. her reverence for perceived aristocracy) because I've seen that her actual philosophies have been discussed thoroughly already by wiser Amazon readers than this one!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. As with the rest of her books it has a heavy dose of her philosophy and politics like all the rest of her work does. Its main focus is the difference between people that derive their motivation and purpose in life from themselves and others that derive their purpose in life from the reactions of others and the power, praise money and respect that they get from them. For me the practical application of the philosophy fits what I have seen and felt in the world. It discuses the moral situation of creation versus distribution and differences between the way society treats who make vs those that only give without making. Ayn Rand is often referred to in libertarian circles but the subtlety of the philosophy in her books is far in excess of some of the crude parroting of it I have read before. Unfortunately I don't find that her writing matches the quality of her philosophy. Like many women she seems to believe that where one word is good two would be better. In addition to that the excessive self awareness/exposition of some characters, especially Toohey later in the book, that make the philosophy clearer but the characters less plausible. Overall I would say that it is well worth reading for the insights but don't expect the entire book to be gripping action.I would lean towards 5 stars for the ideas but the writing style is FAR longer then necessary and just plain uninteresting for the majority of it. The writing seems as crenelated as the works of Keating."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book when I was 19 (many many years back).

Anyway, all that needs to be said about Fountainhead and its characters has already been said."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When I started reading The Fountainhead it took me a year to complete the novel, but it was definitely worth the read.Fountainhead revolves around five main characters: Howard Roark, Peter Keating, Dominique Francon, Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand. The story goes on to talk about Howard Roark's blatant rebellion to society's traditions, especially in the field of architecture. He would not submit to the \`classical' and traditional style of building, but rather followed his own mind and his own personal vision of how buildings should look like. To him, modern architecture was a way of expressing himself, as he is a very silent and closed person, but he spoke through his drawings and his creations. Through his journey, we meet all those people mentioned above, as each affected his life to a certain degree and he had to fight through it all as a singular force that took a stand against the architectural establishment of his day. And in his own unique way, he prevailed.One of the main and more obvious themes that the book discusses was the conflict between traditional architecture and modern architecture. In those days, the common and dominant style of architecture was the classical style; skyscrapers were not accepted, as were all modern architecture. Of course, as expected, societies follow the norm, and the norm was classic, not modern. Therefore, traditional architects were respected and highly looked upon, whereas modern architects lived in shabby states and were neither respected nor were they counted as architects in the first place. Howard Roark worked to prove society wrong and defied them by building one skyscraper after the other, forcing modern architecture on them. Rand uses architecture as the all-encompassing metaphor of the novel to showcase her argument for \\"selfishness\\". Otherwise, the story is pretty much standard soap opera. The book is best when its simply talking in terms of monologues. It definitely brings up an interesting argument. Roark's - or let's say Rand's - architectural views represent his/her philosophy of life, just as buildings designed by men like Peter Keating and other more traditional architects, represented their philosophies.This was a very interesting book, and the classic vs. modern theme was only one of MANY themes in this book; including selfishness, altruism, power, collectivism vs. individualism, integrity, morality and much more. If people haven't read it yet, please do so, even if you hate it, it's still worth the read I think."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"First of all I was gripped by the incredible ingenuity in the construction of this plot, as well contrived as any I have read, and mostly much better. The story is a classic one man versus the mob, and absolutely riveting. I enjoyed this book far more than the shaggy dog, Atlas Shrugged, which struck me as a novel that had gotten out of its writer's grip. But the Fountainhead is a marvelously fun read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Those who have characterized this book objectively over the years are spot on. The storyline is wonderful because of its intellectual intensity and the moral questions it raises. In terms of character development and plot development, it lacks in many areas. Overall, it remains a must read even if it is not a perfect book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is a very different writer with her unique philosophy of Objectivism. Her support for the individual is epitomized with Howard Roark who refuses to sacrifice his principles for anyone. There are Five main characters in the book, Howard Roark, Gail Wynand, Peter, Ellsworth, and Dominique. The plot is straight forward, and it is a easy read. The themes the book deals with are integrity and individuality. This book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is probably Rand's best work. Rand uses the characters as mere symbols themselves to portray her views and philosophy on life. She is strongly committed to the belief that the greatest man is successful because he works for the sake of passion, not for the sake of competition. Anyone who is wishing to develop their morals or ethics should definitely read this amazing novel by Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fountainhead by Ann Rand is a classic. This is the reason I decided to read this particular book. I started it with an open mind and the idea that I would probably gain the ability to say I had read a Rand. I was soon startled to discover that her rich and varied textile of language not only fascinated me but made me desperate to read more.This story is a study in psychosis. Each character displays various traits from major narcissistic tendencies to borderline personality. Dominique and Roark, two of the most interesting and multifaceted characters, show signs of Asperger syndrome, a mild form of Autism.The interactions between the characters are extreme and intriguing. I even found myself involved in the intricacies of architecture a major theme running through the story. The writing is sometimes stilted but the story kept its grip on me because of the massive possibilities. Although this book was long and by the end I cared less than I had on page 217. Oh my goodness page 217! I can say that I have not had the visceral feelings I had while reading this book in years. Objectivism is going to be a philosophy I look into. I take my hat off to the classics."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Where to begin, where to begin. This book is quite possibly the best I have ever read. Sure it is challenging, but the time spent wrapping yourself into and very well becoming the characters is worth every second. The fact that it still enters my mind after having read it 6 months ago is a true example of the potential impact it can create. I suggest this book to anyone who feels that todays world and standards just don't hold true to what your heart is telling you. Read it, but don't stop there. To grasp the true meaning you have to really hear what the book and it's author is telling you. Amazing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I would give this book 5 stars if I hadn't read Atlas Shrugged already. While at least one review calls Rand's philosophy simplistic, living the philosophy gives the lie to his assertion that it is undesirable. Rand's writings have given me a clarity of thought I heretofore had been denied. Her philosophy was a part of my life before I found her books, but I was under the impression that I was wrestling with Satan with my thoughts. Instead, I discovered that I was trying to deny my own existence by believing what I was taught. Rand helped give me the words to fight the battle for my Self. Do yourself a favor, read her books, and open yourself to existence."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is the story of the struggle of an individual against the collective mindset that demands that all things be done for the good of society rather than the rewards and pleasure that the individual enjoys based on the merits of his own work.The main character, Howard Roark, fights an unending battle for the freedom to live and work according to the dictates of his own conscience and integrity. As the plot unfolds, questions are asked that beg an answer from every thinking viewer. In American society today, we are regimented, &quot;bell-curved&quot;, homogenized, and forced to fit the demands and whims of those who consistently tell us &quot;egoism is bad&quot;, &quot;selflessness is the only way to live&quot;, etc.It is refreshing to see this film's character state so eloquently that he &quot;lives life for his own sake&quot; and that the existence of his ideas are the sole domain of his own mind and not the property of others to take as their own in the name of &quot;society's good.&quot;You can't come away from this film not changed in one way or another. Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal play their parts to perfection. This is a classic in every sense of the word. Don't take my word for it though, get it for yourself and enjoy some true &quot;food for thought.&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I must admit that even though I was an English major, I did not read this book until just recently. I was surprisingly pleased with the ideas and characters that Ayn Rand expounds upon in &quot;The Fountainhead.&quot; This novel takes quite a while to get through, but it is well worth the effort. Be sure to set aside the time not only to read it, but to think about the material!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In my 20's, I devoured every Ayn Rand book I could lay my hands on. &quot;Right On!&quot; I cheered. &quot;Make room for the do-ers.&quot; A quarter of a century later, after rereading &quot;The Fountainhead,&quot; I am a bit more critical. The characters are rather one-dimensional, intended to emphasize a philosophy, at the sacrifice of character development and storytelling. E.g., Toohey is a cartoon socialist; Keating is an opportunistic, weasel-like shell of a mediocre person; Mrs. Keating is a stereotypical, overbearing, guilt-tripping Jewish mother; Dominique is beautiful, wealthy and schizoid; Howard is brilliant, uncomprising, heroic, and ultimately prevails, but let's not forget his first encounter with Dominique was rape. So is he really as heroic as Ms. Rand paints him, or is he really a bull-headed, opinionated jerk? So who are the great characters of the book? I propose Mike, the construction foreman for loyalty and competence; and the sculptor, for creativity and passion. Read the book, by all means, for an interesting social theory and for great prose, but keep your eyes wide open for the ultimately one-sided, B&amp;W doctrinaire propaganda espoused by Ms. Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Thank you Ayn Rand for this piece of fiction which is closer to the truth than a lot of us want to believe. If only we were all strong enough to reveal the roles we and others play in real life...."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"When people say Ayn Rand's characters are &quot;wooden,&quot; what they mean is that they don't know anyone like these characters in real life.They should speak for themselves.When people say that Ayn Rand's dialogue is &quot;stilted,&quot; what they mean is that real people don't have anything important to say.They ought to know.When people say that Ayn Rand's plots are &quot;contrived,&quot; what they mean is that human life isn't purposeful, but a deranged spell of chaos.Takes one to know one.*The Fountainhead* really can change your life. But only if you're on the premise that life-changing -- and life -- is possible."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Everyone, of course, needs to read The Fountainhead. But it is certainly not a particularly good novel. For one thing, it is really a tract, not a well crafted piece of fiction with a satisfying plot or style.Now, don't get me wrong. Personally, I happen to agree with much of Rand's basic \\"philosophy.\\" (Although, frankly, despite a lot of her mumbo jumbo, it is not nearly as complicated as many people would have you believe. Most of what Rand believes can be summed up by the phrase \\"Individualism: good. Collectivism: bad.\\")My primary criticism of The Fountainhead is simply that it is poorly written. The characters are wooden and speak in a way that no human being ever does . . . or should. Rand's style is reminiscent of a bad Taylor Caldwell novel. Well, okay, maybe that's redundant: there IS no such thing as a GOOD Taylor Caldwell novel. But what I mean is that, in The Fountainhead, people are always storming out of rooms in a huff, usually after making some \\"devastating\\" remark that ... well ... just seems rather silly.And why was Rand never able to develop a name that actually SOUNDED like a real name? I mean \\"Dominique Francon,\\" \\"Ellsworth Tooey,\\" my God. Howard Roark (another clumsy and unappealing name) may be Rand's ideal man but, to my mind, he's a prig, a bore, and he never acts in a way that seems natural . . . even for a supposed ideal human being.So, sure, read The Fountainhead. But, if you have any literary taste at all, you're not going to like it. In fact, if you want to save some time, cut to the chase and read Roark's court speech at the end of the novel. You'll get the gist from that. But, like everything else in The Fountainhead, even it doesn't ring true. (No judge, past or present, would allow such a thing in court.) Nevertheless, at least it presents \\"the philosophy\\" in a pure form without the annoyance of Rand's leaden \\"plot,\\" bloated and stilted prose, and her polyester characters. Despite its popularity, this really is an aggravating, amateurish book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is still a good read after all these many decades! I'm glad I waded all the way through this again!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Intriguing book that embodies defiance, ambition, breaking out of society norms, working towards self-satisfaction no matter what society judges.It urges you to wander, get swirled with contradictory emotions, and merely speechless after finishing it up."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've only had the book a couple of weeks or so.

It will take me a year to read, but I have high expectations as to the content.The book itself is very nice, and I received it very quickly.As for the content, I'll have to let you know later."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Haven't read it yet but the book is like new and arrived ahead of schedule. Couldn't ask for much better than that!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand gives us this work which, as with her entire body of works, represents one of the few serious attempt to justify capitalism. Not as a means to some other good, like civic peace or a high standard of living, but as a rightful determinant of victors and losers according to virtue, without the need of melioration by socialism, altruism, or anything more than a minimal government. As such, it ranks among the best proofs against laissez faire capitalism I have read.This review was previously published as \\"The only serious attempt to justify capitalism--fails\\", but was edited due to Randian demand. Lest I forget, a few others big-name thinkers and their respective apparatchiks have attempted the same. A few years back, in fact, I was in the habit of reading LewRockwell.com every day, and I tell you, reading the occasional Rothbard excerpts (where he wailed about how \\"Taxing is stealing\\") introduced me to one of Rand's chief errors before I ever read The Fountainhead. Not believing man a social animal (Rand amazingly disregards nature, and chooses to see sexuality as a purely two-party affair, ignoring its natural role in creating children and necessary role in perpetuating family and community), she creates an alternative world where the ideal architect cares more for his buildings than their inhabitants (if their use is not their purpose, then taken to its logical conclusion, Roark's buildings are meaningless once he dies). But as for my former critic's fave, Ludwig von Mises (whom I have not read--it would take ten lifetimes to read all the authors claimed to be essential reading), simply reading Wikipedia: his attempt to justify capitalism assumes most people know what is good for themselves and what they should want. I have to hand it to Rand, she isn't that ludicrous.How then does Rand fare? The Fountainhead has its moments--Rand is a muscular writer--but is wholly uncompelling and riven with contradictions. Howard Roark is supposed to be the hero, the perfect individualist--and yet explains time and again that his style of architecture takes its cues from how each material ought to be best used according to its own qualities, or in other words, according to nature. He is not creating some random, rootless standard like Lois Cook, but divining the proper way to build from a preexisting, permanent standard. Rand never addresses this problem, likely because it would show the tension between rationality and individuality. While Roark discusses the right use of steel in building, he never explains why steel, rather than more traditional (and immediately accessible) materials like wood and stone. In other words, other than their size (why be big just to be big?) he never shows why skyscrapers are so great, even though they are so ugly and intimidating to most of the people who have to see them every day.Roark's slut, Dominique Francon, is perhaps the worst and most hateful character in all literature, and Gail Wynand is a close runner up. Despite their supposed happiness, and self-sufficiency approaching Roark, there must be at least one hundred times in the book where they stop themselves from saying something, or taking pleasure in something, because they \\"have no right to...\\" What happened to the \\"great and challenging novel based on a supreme belief in the rights of the individual\\" the back cover boasts? I'm no Freudian, but these three ignoramuses have some major neuroses, and zero self-knowledge. For that reason, the purported antagonists--Ellsworth Toohey, Peter Keating, Ike the Genius, and especially Ralston Holcombe, who rather reminds me of Poombaa--are the real heroes of this misadventure in architecture."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've read Atlas Shrugged as well, and while I basically agree with her philosophy- as I've seen written before, everything is black and white with her; I disagree on this- her fiction writing is kinda dull. She's a better non fiction writer. If I were meriting only the interest value of the story, plot, characters, etc..., I would give it a slightly lower rating, but there are other elements that make it worthwhile. I find her characters to be 2 demensional, although Elsworth Toohey is a fascinating character. Fountainhead is a more entertaining read in this sense than Atlas Shrugged. For those who've read Atlas will understand when I say that, still speaking only in terms of 'flow', for lack of a better word, something is lost when the plot is interupted by a 20-30-40-50 page, or more, monologue in which the character expounds on his philosophy. While academically interesting the flow is broken.She claimed that her stories were not merely vehicles for her philosophy but they are definitely secondary. I give the Fountainhead 3.8 stars."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"As neither an atheist nor an objectivist I can still say that this is a very powerful novel. Only because I have read Atlas Shrugged and know about the descent into cult like status which objectivism fell prevents me from giving this book 5 stars. It's long and a bit dry, Ayn Rand is certainly not bathroom reading, but in the end worth the effort.My personal opinion on objectivism is probably a bit harsh; I consider it a parasitic ideology that can only survive in the comforting environs of a strong established democracy, but it is worth reading as reinforcement of certain principles; namely ambition and individuality. I'm sure there are a lot of counter-culture kiddies that read this and Kafka or Kerouac and think they understand the world, hardly so. An architect cannot stop a city nor can a copper magnate, a Swedish pirate and a philosopher ... grease monkey turn off the \\"engines of the world.\\" I know who John Galt is and he is the bastardized interpretation of the ubermensche of Nietzsche's philosophy. Pure objectivism would essentially be social Darwinism, survival of the smartest and most cunning, not something that depressed teenagers should be reading. Never the less, I do agree with Ms. Rand that we are individuals. We should drive ourselves to excel no matter the obstacles but, that said, the rest of society is not necessarily an Albatross around the neck. We are not necessarily responsible for/to those less fortunate. We should help them out of compassion, not obligation. Mix in a little compassion and some reality into this book and it's worth reading and recommending.P.S. Stay away from Atlas Shrugged, it's the Fountainhead with renamed characters, an implausible plot (see Swedish pirate above) and a monologue at the end that would put Tolstoy to sleep."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is masterfull. I loved the way all the charachters were realistic. This book is one of the best ones I have ever read. I hope everyone else who reads it gets as much from it as I did."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;A great story of a hero. Just that and nothing more.&quot"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a \\"passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential.\\" This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw: it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted. A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation. Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its \\"leveling effects.\\"Here's the problem with her \\"philosophy:\\" for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable. With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many. Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students. One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status. I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them. But Howard Roark is no hero. He's a stick figure that represents a hero. I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are \\"deep.\\"In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views. Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic. Judging by some of the reviews posted here, this probably remains true today."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I did not purchase \\"The Fountainhead\\" because of the outrageous price charge by Amazon for the Kindle readers. When I purchase my Kindle several years ago, I was told the New York Times best sellers would cost $9.99. Since then, I have purchased over 80 Kindle books which I have enjoyed very much. Amazon currently advertises the this book in paperback for $9.99 and yet want the Kindle readers to pay $20.99. It appears Penguin Publishing wants to do in the electronic book concept. Since we still are in a free market, I choose not to buy the Fountainhead at that outrageous price or any other book published by Penguin. Further, Amazon is without blame, they should not accept the publisher price of $20.99 but simply state the Fountainhead is not available in the Kindle format. Kindle is about to screw up a great concept."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'm sorry but Rand's novels are just plain boring. I've read three of them and all three of them have bored me toward near-death experiences. She seems to hold up creative people as some kind of heroes but the problem I see is that highly creative people never behave the way she portrays them. Her characters are always so stilted, so two-dimensional, so much like cardboard cutouts of what real heroic people are like. She seems to be marketing some ideal about running a world without emotions as though rational thinking sets atop some kind of rock-solid pedestal that is completely separate from and immune from our emotional lives. It's not the way our brains are \\"wired\\" and it's certainly not the way the minds of creative people work. Creative work involves tons of intuition, which is closely linked to our emotional inner world. From what I can tell Rand experienced little or none of the intuition necessary for creative life. She seems to dream of a world operated by some big mathematical computer program that she, and she alone, wrote over and over and over into all of her novels."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In brief, the book is about Howard Roark, a man striving to become a modernist architect in a society which despises modernism and adores classicism. He falls in love with Dominique Francon, the daughter of the most prominent New York classical Architect. The story tells of his struggle, and Dominique's struggle with some of her own issues.The three things which struck me most about this book are:1: The characters are all utterly deplorable2: Todays society is run by facsimiles of the characters3: Objectivism (Ayn Rands Philosophy) offers despair as its reward.The book itself was fabulous. I had a difficult time putting it down. The book has many dialogues, some of which did not make it clear who was speaking, on the other hand, many of the dialogues were the sharpest I have ever seen. At one point I was physically buzzing due to this (When Dominique - the main character, first meets Gail - the wealthy newsman.)Rand describes a stuffy society, run by wealthy men but controlled by unions. She builds a society of &quot;second-handers&quot;- people who spend their lives imitating all that has gone before them. Her main characters obviously depict her Objectivist philosophy. They are the outcasts in a hostile society.Rand showed many of the errors of her philosophy (unwittingly, I am sure) in this book. Reversing the roles of the selfish and the selfless. She manages to make it look like a person, selfish by todays standards, is in fact a selfless person, and vice versa. The method she uses is highly transparent.I would recommend the book for people who love to read and will read anything. I don't recommend Mrs. Rands philosophical ideas - and if you do choose to read this book, you will see why.The character I loved: Gail WynandThe character I despised: Ellsworth Toohey"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I wonder how Roark would review \\"The Fountainhead\\". Hmm...Let me start by saying you've made a mistake already, Peter, by asking what I think of this book. You can read. You can think. You're still human and you're still capable of reason. You know enough to make a judgement.The setting is the world of architecture. The theme is the importance of integrity. If the title, setting, or theme intrigue you read the novel.What I think of the Fountainhead matters to only one person: myself. I will not provide you with a pre-digested approval or disapproval of this book. I will, however, offer you advice on how to understand it. Advice that applies to any other book you might read in the future as well.When an author publishes a novel, they publish only a slim fraction of the thought that went into that product. Art is a process of selectivity; for every word in a novel, there are a thousand words written and struck out again.When an Ayn Rand offers you \\"The Fountainhead\\", she is laying before you, for a price of a few dollars, years of her life and enormous mental effort. Understanding the novel to the root requires that you put in the mental effort to follow- a tiny fraction when compared the mental effort that went into the creation. Your mental effort is multiplied by the originator-but the degree of your understanding is your OWN achievement, and your final assessment is your own \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" in answer to the author's song.An Einstein may give you E=MC2. That will be of no benefit if you accept it passively. But if you seek to understand, the road from ignorance to knowledge is a glorious road- even if the knowledge is ultimately rejected in favor of something else that you find more convincing.Ayn Rand has placed in your path either a rock or a gem. Pick it up and value it according to that which you determine it to be. Don't judge it based on what others say. Hold it in your hand and really look.A novel I read is something I judge against my own lifetime of knowledge. The connections I make between it and my own observations are unique and unrepeatable.A novel is just like a love affair, a college course, a career, or a cause- you get out of it what you put in.So don't look to me to review it. That defeats the very purpose of Art. If you love it, you will have gained a value in this life. We may find we have a value in common. If you hate the novel, it will not affect my opinion in the slightest.Nor will it affect Ayn Rand or the value of her acheivement.Oh--And please take my blueprints out of your pants before you go..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I see a compliment to the power of Ayn Rand's FOUNTAINHEAD, in this fact:I was able to vote \\"Yes\\" on most of the reviews I read on this novel, including the ones I disagreed with or which, from my perspective, misinterpreted some of the content of the book. What impressed me to click the positive vote was that each of the reviews showed interesting contemplation communicated well (including the ones with only one or two sentences), and intriguing ways of looking at the plot, characters, and thematic framework of this novel.Savor the extra shot of admirable mental exercise exhibited in reviews on this novel. Maybe there's a reason that the words \\"savor\\" and \\"savory\\" are so similar.This book is so pregnant with cranium stimulations it's easy to forget it's foremost a novel; Prozac and the sideline collection of wannabe Seratonin Uptake Inhibitors would be put out of business if people read a chapter or so of this type of material daily.(Of course, the Prozac-type high wouldn't come as easily as the the simple swallow of a pill. It takes time to work into the type of steady self-worth which gives a true high on the potential of life.)I've read both FOUNTAINHEAD and ATLAS SHRUGGED three times each, and will probably reread them periodically over the remaining course of my life. I've written my review of ATLAS; now I'd like to focus on what I valued most in reading FOUNTAINHEAD.I loved the character, Howard Roark.I identified with that character more than any other I've met in a work of fiction, more than any nonfiction person I've known about who has lived and been memorialized. I admired and was renewed by his repeated choices to be true to himself, his talent, his creativity, and his needs and desires on his life path.I enjoyed the way Rand wrote Roark's attraction to Dominique, and could understand the source of that attraction, even when she was pretending to be a spoiled, superficial, self-destructive fool. I knew he saw under the facade, and was uplifted to watch him gradually draw the beauty and honor out of her.What about the rape scene?That scene played in reality by humans at this time would have been a true rape, and that is anathema to me as it was to Ayn Rand. Within the world of the novel, FOUNTAINHEAD, that scene was not rape.You may thank me for not including here the several pages it would take for me to begin to explain my reasons for making this discrimination. Anyone who would actually read this review has the capacity to reason (whether he agrees or disagrees with me) why I've made this discrimination between the development of human character in current reality, and these two characters within the essence of this novel.I loved Gail Wynand and the way he so easily saw Roark, and grew to love him.I was fascinated with Ellsworth Toohey; he was a perfect personification of the frightening power of Evil, a power which (as Roark knew) is linked securely to the underlying impotence of Evil in the face of integrity.Loved and hated each of the characters as Rand intended me to feel.Loved the way Rand described objects she hates:\\"The Cosmo-Slotnick Building rose ponderously over the street, like a huge, white bromide.\\"I loved the way Rand described objects she loves, as she began her lead in to the architectural conclusion at the end of FOUNTAINHEAD:\\"On a spring day, eighteen months later, Dominique walked to the construction site of the Wynand building.\\"She looked at the skyscrapers of the city. They rose from unexpected spots, out of the low roof lines. They had a kind of startling suddenness, as if they had sprung up the second before she saw them and she had caught the last thrust of the motion; as if, were she to turn away and look again fast enough, she would catch them in the act of springing.\\"Rand's grand composition of Dominique's perceptions of Roark's building continue from the above paragraphs. You won't want to miss them. You won't want to read them until you have read every word leading up to them.I was wholly engaged in and intrigued by the mesmerizing, convoluted plot.This novel is exquisite, powerful, and perfect.With what do I agree or disagree in the volumes of interpretations of this novel, as story or as philosophy, by the hoards of people who've read it, or who spout off from just hearing talk of it?I really don't care at this late day in my life what other people think about anything, though I am often interested to read or listen to something about which an individual has given serious (corrected from \\"seriously\\") thought; an individual who can put a new, spicy twist on a tired subject; or an individual who takes time to draw his own conclusions about something (all of which has been done well in reviews here).I crave intelligence communicated well, and if it can be communicated in a well-written, interesting novel, all the better. In my opinion, this is what Rand has done, at least twice.I honor and admire Ayn Rand's FOUNTAINHEAD beyond my capacity to do so. I am saddened that our world and cultural limitations did not allow her to experience more fully in her own life the potential beauty in the universe which she captured for us in her fiction.Thank you, Ayn Rand for the huge sacrifice of your life lived in such an immature world; yet in your world of definition, and thanks to your integrity, your life was in no way a sacrifice,Linda G. ShelnuttAuthor of several books and Amazon Shorts, including:Molasses Moon"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Anyn Rand is simply a great writer, and you will not be able to forget this story / book. The education and development of a couple of architects is used as the basis for demonstrating the impact of being \\"true to ones values\\" versus \\"going with popular demand\\". I feel it is probably the most profound book that I have read, and will go out of my way to read more written by Ayn Rand.A warning is that the book gets slow at times due to the length of the book - but overall it deserves the highest possible rating!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is truly a great book. Ayn Rands' writing is beautiful, some of the best descriptive prose I've ever read. The story is wonderful and will keep you turning pages. But the best part of it was the introduction to the philosophy of Objectivism, which, at the very least presents interesting &quot;food for thought&quot; and possibly can change your life if you want to try to live by its principals. The book is long and very dense, but I thought that every page was additive to the novel. I could not believe some of the other reviews I saw on this book, I just don't think they got it. Yes some of the language is &quot;cheesy&quot; and a little dated feeling (the book was written in the late 30s and early 40s). But this is very minor when compared to everything else you can get out of the book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished The FountainHead for my A.P. English class and it was an amazing book. Howard's struggle made me love him and how easy Peter got everything angered me. I hated Ellsworth and his abuse of the power he had. It's a great book to read for a high school student because it teaches not to follow the herd and to think on your own, something few students do. Even though Howard had it rough, it payed off in the end for him. It also taught not to give in no matter how hard it seems and to stand up for what you believe in."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's talent as a writer is manifest primarily in her characterizations, and her ability to write dialogue. She is also a master of analogy, though it is an over employed technique.Although my familiarity with her philosophy is limited to The Fountainhead, it certainly is capsulized in Howard Roark's summation to the jury at the close of the book. Rand's celebration of the self (egotism in her words) at the expense of the collective (second-handers in her terminology) seems shallow and unworkable. She idealizes the creator of the wheel, because such advances to civilization exemplify the results of an individual working for his own self interest, whereas the user of a cart is merely a member of the collective second-handers following the resultant availability of carts (essentially). Man's self interest is the highest good to Ms. Rand; higher than spirituality, higher than love (witness the 'heroic' surrender of Roark's love, Dominique, to two other marital partners apparently because neither could submit to the discounting of creative genius by the collective); higher than altruism (the ultimate underminer of Randian self-interest); and certainly higher than government regulation (as manifested in the current financial crisis led by such Randians as Alan Greenspan and Phil Graham).The ultimate moral collapse of Gail Wynand makes no sense because he had no need to submit to the collective will- eventually acquiring full ownership of the Banner newspaper and closing it (those who have not yet read the book will forgive me this paragraph). The acquittal of Howard Roark makes no sense; predicated on the basis of a contract giving him full creative powers. In short the tenuousness of self directed behavior strains the narrative, itself, because of the faulted philosophical underpinnings.Ayn Rand is the antithesis of Vedic thought from the Upanishads to the Buddhist sutras. One must feed the motives of the self. We are independent entities beyond the necessities of others. The highest self is that which knows no compromise. The transcendence of the ego leads to no discovery because there is no higher Self, no Atman, no Holy Ghost, no God, and no higher consciousness.In short The Fountainhead is an engaging read. Within its narrative style lies a self-refutation of selfish behavior, a dramatization of the suffering caused by egotism, and blindness to the commonality and interdependence of mankind.As a counterpoint to utilitarianism and the philosophies of the East stands Randian libertarianism ; a polarity to contentment, and in its contrast allowing one to understand the higher Self more deeply. If we all were capable of inventing wheels, and the servicers of our biological needs were insentientautomatons perhaps the empty bauble of Howard Roark's existence would make sense, though it would remain empty; as untenable as Ayn Rand's philosophy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a philosophical journey into the life of Howard Roark, a young man struggling as an architect in a society that can not accept his innovative style. Set in 1940's New York City, Roark toils in the shadow of a prolific and publicly-favoured rival Peter Keating, and must work despite the crushing power of the influential columnist Ellsworth Toohey. Roark's modern and efficient style of architecture appeals to a very select crowd of people, but his stubborn self-interest prevents him from bending to the wills of society. Thus his work is shunned, ostracized, and he is repeatedly put out of work either by lack of clients or by lawsuits against his almost offensive creations.Under the surface of this straight forward plot lies vital insight to Ayn Rand's philosophical views of society, producing the book's main themes: the importance of self-interest and the strength that individualism possesses over the universally appealing virtue of altruism (collectivism); and the inherent evils contained in a collectivist (almost communist) society, and their consequences to the individual.The long and tedious beginning and middle sections of the novel are overwhelmed by the value held within the closing chapters. Rand takes ample time to intricately develop each character through tiresome descriptions, but this is necessary to understand the events, interactions, and the mindset of different characters at the book's climax; which delivers her philosophical message in one final, exciting knock-out blow. This novel is very thought-provoking, and is a great read for the politically, ideologically, or philosophically-minded person. Be forewarned that this book is not an adventure novel by any stretch of the imagination, but is a must-read for every member of the intelligentsia. I truly enjoyed this novel, as it was an excellent source to develop one's own philosophical ideals, depending on which stance is taken against Rand's blatant presentation of \\"Objectivism\\" (Rand's philosophical adaptation of individualism and capitalism)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I havent read a great deal of books on my own during my 18-years of life. Most of the novels I've read have been requirements for school, with the stuff I read on my own being things like Michael Jordan's bio and Mark Bowden's \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"With that said, The Fountainhead is easily, and I stress *easily*, the best book I've ever read. I'm not even finished yet, as I'm around page 506 of 727... and I can tell.This is something that every teenager in America should read by their Senior year in high school -- regardless of intelligence level or religion, etc. REGARDLESS if one does not agree with Rand's stance on society, the world and her philosophy of Objectivism that plays such an integral part in her classic novel, The Fountainhead should be a book that all read.10/10 in my book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a book that every person should read... especially when one is encountering that \\"search for meaning\\" phase or phases in their life. It is a story about why one should never compromise values. This book, although a thought provoking fictional adventure, will tap into all that you've experienced so far in life and will help explain the things you felt that were significant to you in one way or another, but could not identify... The Fountainhead, in the very least, inspired me to get my engineering degree. The story and the surrounding philosophy continues to have an impact on me regarding my career, my relationships, my family, my life... I purchased this book for a friend's son, who just started college and loves literature."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I've read Rand's other three books of fiction over the years, and they are some of the greatest novels I've ever read. I just finished &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, and I cannot believe this is the same person who penned &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; or &quot;We the Living&quot;.I think the main problem is that she's struggling to incorporate a more formal version of her philosophy into a fiction work. That's a great goal (and she succeeds in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;), but here she 'tells' way more than she 'shows'. I felt insulted as a reader as she tried to lead me by the nose!The novel reads like a rough draft that needed more editing, and it has none of the strengths of her other works. None of the characters are appealing. The plot is uneven - it lurches forward only to stagnate for dozens of pages. The overall tone of the book was depressing and venomous to no apparent purpose, thematic or otherwise.Worst of all, some of the action was just competely unbelievable. For instance: Roark taking on the housing project that sets up the final conflict in the novel was a transparent plot device. It didn't seem to be something he would do - either philosophically or from common sense. Why would he trust the people he trusts in taking on that project?I pushed through to the end, but I was so happy when the novel was over. Worst of all, I really don't think Rand succeeded in presenting Objectivism or an exalted sense of life. The novel was too negative and soggy with bile to do either.Ayn Rand is a brilliant novelist, but &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is easily one of my least favorite books. Read her others; they're incedible!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Note to recent readers: The bad taste in your mouth *will* go away. Five years ago I read as much of this book as I could endure. Today I'm happy to say I remember nothing but the barest outline of the plot and certain mental images associated with some of the events. I've done some stupid things in my life but I take glowing pride in the fact that never did I once consider becoming an Objectivist. In years to come I'm sure the world will come to realize that Ayn Rand's greatest legacy was that her books, her philosophy, even her conduct of life all lend themselves so readily to satire. And what is it with her and Kant? It's like reading Stalin's denunciations of &quot;Trotskyites.&quot; And kinda funny if you know anything at all about the real relationship between Kant, the Enlightenment, and Romanticism."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The successful philosophical or political novel is a rarity. Of the former, Sartre's \\"Nausea\\" is a modern masterpiece. Of the latter, I would nominate Zola's \\"Germinal\\" and Steinbeck's \\"In Dubious Battle\\" as leading contenders. Of course, \\"War and Peace\\" and \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" present philosophical ideas, but neither is a novel in the traditional sense. The secret of success in these endeavors is to to present the ideas through the media of sympathetic characters and a compelling narrative. \\"No sense in useless tub-thumping,\\" said Zola. Ayn Rand should have heeded that advice. Her characters are mere types, employed repeatedly (and I mean repeatedly) as mouthpieces for specific points of view.There are three telling omissions in \\"The Fountainhead\\": the first is that, although this is an epic tale, covering several decades in the lives of many characters, there are no babies born, no children reared. I'm afraid a philosophy of selfishness has to go the way of dirty diapers when Baby arrives. The second omission is humor. There are no laughs here. Egoism is a serious business. The third omission, perhaps arising from the first two, is emotional warmth. Ironically, Rand's essentially Humanist (that is, atheistic and anthropocentric) view lacks humanity. Her heroine can only achieve sexual fulfilment through being forcibly raped, her hero's heart and soul are centered on bricks and mortar. This novel will oblige you to think, but will not move you to laugh or cry.\\"The Fountainhead\\" is well written and thought provoking, but in addition to the points I mentioned above, I was left wondering what the problems were supposed to be in relation to the architecture of the time. This was the age of Art Deco and of Frank Lloyd Wright, surely a golden age in American architecture. And is the era of the the Wall Street Crash, the Great Depression and Roosevelt's New Deal really the best advertisement for laissez faire economics?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Unbelievably, I actually didn't hate this book. Despite my husband's insistence upon hanging Ayn's portrait in our den and the fact that it ultimately contributed to the demise of my marriage.When my husband at the time bought it for me so that I could try to understand and relate to his obsession with Ms. Rand's philosophy, I was a good sport. I actually enjoyed the book, and we even enjoyed the movie together. But I warn readers and potential readers: Tread cautiously. And if you meet someone claiming to LOVE Ayn Rand - run fast and don't look back.It's not cool or noble to emulate Howard and Dominique to prove to the world and yourself just how important it is to only think of yourself and no one else. Living your life like this on a daily basis can cause destruction, pain, years of heartache and can damage the lives of those around you for years to come.This is what my former husband did. Woke up one morning and out of the blue, told me he didn't want to be married anymore. What did he cite? Ultimately, Ayn's edict of selfishness. My inability to understand this caused my husband to leave me. Operating for himself and only for himself, he continued to disintegrate little by little - taking a married woman as his mistress, breaking up hers and our marriage, isolating himself from friends and family, and several years later - continuing to live a lie - all masked under Ayn's philosophy of selfishness.The end of my marriage nearly killed me. If I could stop the sad reality of divorce in this country, I would. In my 31 years of existence, I've experienced nothing worse. But now I'm happy to report that I have found a partner who exhibits more selfLESSness on a daily basis than I ever thought was possible. And I've been blessed to witness the other extreme. This is how we're meant to live on earth - making the world a better place and helping those in need. I'm not saying that one's own needs aren't important - they certainly are - just not at the expense of dozens of loved ones and certainly not to appease Ms. Rand as she rots in her grave.Read the book and see what I mean. Read the book to become well-versed in Rand's banter and atheist philosophies. Just don't read the book and become an advocate of selfishness. The world doesn't need any more of those."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Personally, Objectivism as a philosophy is attractive on the outset because Ayn Rand gave voice to the rebellious character in all of us. But if you go beyond the obvious, we can see the problems with Objectivism.I am not suggesting an alternative philosophy to Objectivism. In fact, I admire the works of Ayn Rand as much as any other serious reader, but the problem lies in the practicality of her philosophy.I must concede that individualism appeals to me just as to most other Americans. America being the citadel of individual enterprise, needless to say, all the innovations were made possible because of the unrelenting spirit of some individual who refused to be chained down by the fetters of a utilitarian philosophy. But objectivism persuades us to goes far beyond that spirit. There lies the problem.I can understand that Ms. Rand has exaggerated the characters to bring forth her point but still that doesn't justify it. To say \\"I don't cooperate with anyone\\" presupposes the fact that every individual is right in his or her own way. So what if the President and Vice President of a company or a country were to say this? What if every individual insisted on having his or her own creative way in every endeavor of theirs?I agree with Ms. Rand when she says that to feel sorry for someone is bad, because there is a subconscious and embedded malicious delight in other's misfortunes when we feel sorry for someone...kind of a good feeling that it's not happening to me. But \\"altruism\\" is not the word for it. I guess, it could be because Rand's mother tongue was not English that her choice of words were flawed. It almost gives me the impression that she was trying to say something but ended up choosing poor substitutes for the right words.But where I disagree with her is the concept of \\"second-hander.\\" What if someone did offer oneself to serve others just because he or she wanted to do it and not because others wanted it? What if I loved serving others because of the innate pleasure it gives me? What if I donated my time and resources to help others in whatever small way, because I wanted to do it because of my intrinsic need to do it? You could be an altruist but still be not a \\"second-hander.\\"Now, take the example of Mother Teresa. She was altruistic in the true sense of the word. I refuse to accept such people are second-handers. What if she was doing what she was doing, just for of her sole self, just because she found joy in doing it, a selfish joy?Now, there is no way I can have my creative way in everything in life. What if every CEO of this world said that he wouldn't listen to anyone and would have the company run the way he wants. What if a scientist said that he would refuse to allow any modification to his innovation? What if a doctor said he would carry out a medical procedure only the way he thought was right?I wish I could extol the virtues of Rand's philosophy but whichever way you look at it, a world conceived by Ms. Rand is not possible in any walk of life. However, I don't suggest that Collectivism is the answer either.Towards the end of the novel, she praises the virtues of the vanguards of capitalism. But most of the stalwarts of capitalism of the 20th century do not fit Rand's description of a creative genius. Agreed that, all of them believed in going by their instinct and designing their life in their very own way. But they had one more thing in common...they knew that even THEIR ideas might be flawed and needed cooperation by the fellow members of their species to make it work unlike Howard Roark.I would find it disgusting to live in a world where every guy raped every other girl just because \\"I\\" wanted it that way like Roark did to Dominique.As I stated before, I admire Rand as a writer but I can hardly agree to the premises of her philosophy. For a student with an academic interest in Objectivism, this is recommended. However, to adopt her philosophy as a way of life, is not a healthy choice. I give 3 stars for the quality of the literature (though, as I said, I don't agree with her philosophy)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"i don't even want to say why, but this book changed my life, and you shouldn't read people's reviews of it because anyone you know that recommends this book will let you figure it all out for yourself. not only is the book extremely well written but it applies to anyone anywhere and has taught even the people who wrote terrible reviews of it something about life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Like Atlas Shrugged, this tale is an extraordinary one. Ayn Rand worked within the realm of ideas and their consequences. The characters here are both the usual and the heroic. Howard Roark, our hero, stands firm for individual integrity, against the critics and the masses until his point-of-view wins out. The greatness of Rand's work is that she sets a path in which mediocrity loses. Like any philosophy, her work didn't change the world, but had a deep impact on individuals that changed themselves and helped to make the world that much better.The villain Ellsworth Toohey is one of the great nemesis' in American literature. He is plainly passive-aggressive. He uses people's insecurities for his own power. Much like many villains in real life, Toohey defeats his foes through subtleties and pawns. He spends a lifetime propping up disciples around him for insulation. The bandwagon mentaility means that none of his ideas need ever come under logical scrutiny. When his game is discovered, his power is such, that he is not easily defeated. Roark's use of logical rhetoric at the conclusion of the novel is such that Toohey's nefarious work is rendered meaningless.For as good as the work is, I am opposed to Rand's atheism. She would replace God with the worship of man. Her heroic characters certainly make a case for such, but in real life even our most brilliant men are not without flaws and contradictions. I believe that God would want man to as heroic as Rand sees him. Rand would feel any recognition of a superior being would cast man back into the pool of the collective. This disagreement would put me outside the realm of Rand followers, but I love the book anyway and feel that it has a great deal to offer anyone who believes in individual liberty or is open to hear a case for it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a typical Ayn Rand novel. If you are part of the school of Objectivism, take a second to read back through this book. I find it ironic that the woman who started an &quot;intellectual&quot; movement can write in such an obvious (and poor) manner. With no subtlety in style and little suprises to the plot, this novel truly reflects the shallow depths of American intellectualism. I'm baffled at it's long standing popularity."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Howard Roark, allegedly an architectural genius, is 'projected' in this work of so-called 'Romantic Realism' as the most concrete-bound of mechanical engineers. If, as we are told, other people are not real to him, how is it that his buildings take such marvelous account of the needs of their occupants? If the descriptions of his inspired, Frank Lloyd Wright-type buildings are accurate, why do the descriptions of his 'creative' processes all involve little more than engineering calculations? If, as we are told, he is capable of seeing nature only as raw material for buildings, how is it that his buildings seem to be such 'natural' extensions of the landscape?Roark is not an ideal human type; he is nothing more than a projection of Rand's own self-absorbed fantasies. The human mind is indeed the 'fountainhead' of human progress, but Roark's own concrete-bound, highly limited mind is not exactly a shining example of it.By the way, why is it that all of Rand's male heroes are rapists?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Yes, that's true. Anton La Vey, the leader of the Church of Satan, used the ideas of Rand when he set up his religion. Also as every decent person can see, Rand really hated ordinary people.

Still controversial in numerous ways, understanding the philosophy and thoughts conveyed through strong characters and an engaging plot provides for a good book.While dates from the 1920s and 1930s are mentioned a number of times in the book, there is a certain timeless quality to this publication. The personalities of the well-drawn characters and the action flow seem as if they could be found in a book published just last month.The philosophical underpinnings found in \\"The Fountainhead\\" may not appeal to everyone, but reading this book should provide insight into a particular way of thinking and acting via an engrossing read.Read in conjunction with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", also written by Ayn Rand, one can witness an emerging view of how one author saw the world.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have read nearly all of Ayn Rand's works and have to say that next to Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead is her best.

The contrast of these two figures is not fully revealed until the last hundred or so pages, but it is startling and, when looking back, always present. First, the dependent - a man who relies on others for his survival. Rand shows us that the great dictators of the past are these people - the ones who have no power unles they control others; destroy them and rule them. Yes, it's power - but it is still dependency. The people under Toohey - Peter Keating, his authors and playwrights and architects - all broken and relying on this man's tyrany. Toohey boosts the mediocre so that &quot;greatness&quot; can be achieved by anyone. He discourages people from taking a course that they would be good at and that would make them happy, all to eliminate the chance that anything truly great could exist. In one sad scene he even tells poor Peter this, and Peter, at the end of the confession, still clings to Toohey, because he has nothing else left.Second, the independent. Roark has no concern for others because he expects to be scorned. Far from hating man-kind, he loves by making them cope with the truth - letting them see what they could be and allowing them to heal themselves. He can only respect those that have respect for themselves. The only way to live is to be completely selfish - unwilling to give up integrity, truth, courage, kindness, greatness. People lose themselves briefly in the blinding truth embodied by Roark - and then heal, become better people because he looked upon them.The Fountainhead is a stunning examination of the power of the independent, written in such a way that a single character can become that term and another its opposite. Too often we hear that worthiness is defined by &quot;selfless acts&quot; with egoism being the true evil. Rand argues that the center of selfishness depends on what you're speaking of - selflessly giving away your integrity is suddenly not such a selfless act. Told within the context of architecture, the story gains scale. What does the audience see of Roark's buildings - his modern masterpieces - and what do they see of the filth (excuse me - the things everyone else build) that quickly fill the skylines? Roark respects all aspects of designing and building - enough to insist it be done his way, with complete integrity as he knows few others are capable of.I found this book to be beautiful and sad - a startling model of two disceptively similar roles blown completely out of proportion. If you find Roark to be emotionless than you did not read correctly, for he cares about many things, and if you blindly believe my words you have missed the point. We may never be able to reach Roark's independence, if ever we want to, but it never hurts to know what a purely selfish and undeniably great person can do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My reviews generally focus on novels and non-fiction works dealing with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, genetics and the like rather than sixty year old novels, but Rand's ideas will become even more important - and controversial -- in the coming decades. Although she has pushed objectivism to an untenable extreme, she is still the most relevant and important philosopher of our time and will remain so through the first half of this century. Why? Because scientists will incorporate her ideas into the new minds, both human and artificial, made possible by these rapidly evolving technologies.Ayn Rand is a great but flawed philosopher. Her Howard Roark is one the most admirable and terrifying characters to appear in any novel: a man of rigid, absolute principles; of talent and determination; and of intellect and emotion. Also a man who will stop at nothing, even violence, to gain his objectives; who cares not a whit about the needs of others, even his paying clients; who regards virtually all of humanity as parasites, living off the abilities of men such as himself. Roark could be a great man; he could also be a monster. These strengths will be attractive to many, leading science to develop methods to enhance our machines and our genes. The latter will be particularly attractive: who wouldn't want these characteristics for your child? The genetic inheritance of Howard Roark will be engineered into our genes, but which ones? And where would such men take us?The Fountainhead is a great read as fiction, and Rand challenges us with her ideas. Rather than fading into the background, such powerful ideas become more important as time moves on."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book provided me with the insight I needed to change my life. I feel better about my-self and now I understand my-self in a way I never thought possible. This is a truly great read for anyone who is up to the challenge of changing.

I think in every twenty years or so there emerges some radical new line of thought which is against everything which was thought true uptill then. Ayn Rand by some stroke of genius has atleast for me opened up a new line of thought.The book is essentially based on the glorification of the human race and more specifically we as concious individuals. It deals with the struggles and aspirations of a young architect who is determined to do things the way he knows is right. The power of one against his thousands of detractors.But actually this book transcends all boundaries like age, career etc and caters to the basic human being in us and urges to realise our selves and our dreams.But like all other philosophies Ayn Rand's one isnt totally complete. It is a bit extreme in its approach but the book is extremely useful in the sense that it opens the door to a new line of thought rather than takes you to utopia. It gives you the crucial push needed to complete and augment your philosophy.Any reader who reads this book with an open mind will understand the virtue of this book and if possible adapt himself. It takes us one step closer towards perfection."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a glorious book. It should provide a beacon of hope and inspiration to anyone who has struggled to stay true to their own vison. I recommend it to anyone who works in a creative field, after reading this you will realize that you are NOT crazy or alone in your vocation and its consequences.Beautifully written, with characters and scenery that are 3 dimensional and alive, the story rings clear like a church bell, even when re-visited over and over again. You will recognize these characters in the world around you, and so the Fountainhead will become more vivid and relevant.Objectivism fails to answer some of life's questions to the same degree as any other philosophy, but its emphasis on independence, courage, hard work, creativity, truth, and the respect for the effort to live such ideas is important. Likewise Rand paints in believable colors the opposition to a person such as Howard Roark, and such opposition is alive and real. I have met a variety of Second-Handers, thankfully none so adept as Ellsworth Toohey."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"All I can say is that this book is unbelievable.

Read it!!!This is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read The Fountainhead in 1979; I've had three copies, and re-read it more than a half-dozen times, since then.If you're unfamiliar with Ayn (rhymes with 'nine') Rand, she can be difficult to follow as she writes in long, multi-paragraph dialogs.If you want to try something a bit shorter, yet a good introduction to her writing style and personal philosophy, try something lighter like \\"Anthem.\\" I feel her best book is \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After all that I had heard about this novel I was disposed to dislike it, expecting it to be full of thinly disguised political viewpoints. I am now so glad I had an open mind and was prepared to read it for myself before jumping to ill considered conclusions. The political perspective is presented, but in no way intrudes on the plot if you do not wish to involve yourself in it. The story is of the struggle of two young architects to achieve their differing ambitions, which does not sound on the face of it particularly gripping. However Rand through her excellent characterization and her depiction of the violence of Roark's struggle against convention and the contrast of the almost prostitutional nature of Keating's rise held me spellbound. Treachery, violence, rejection, manipulation and dominance are just some of the themes Rand explores though this fantastic novel. The politics behind the story, well I guess it's interesting if not compelling, but not nearly as interesting as the story."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I don't usually read novels since I'm not into fiction but this novel kept me interested all the way through. The characters are representations of various ideologies and all have various imperfections. Ayn Rand basically leaves her outline for the philosophy of Objectivism for &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; but this book is a good starter for those who may not share such political orientations but are curious. After reading more of Rand's philosophy which are practiced by many people to varying degrees, nonconformity became a virtue rather than a simple constant. Although the characters are polarized versions of the contemporary debate, this is quite acceptable and necessary in a fiction novel since it has a goal of engaging the reader as much as possible. throughout the novel, Howard Roark is held up at the star observer of the philosophy but other less perfect versions are given such as Dominique Francon and Gail Wynand who share similar views, and strive to follow the philosophy as much as possible. In a final throughful courtroom speech Roark admits the limits and obstacles one will encounter in following such an individualistic path but heralds the journey and effort as what is important. Libertarians and many other people will find this book to be quite uplifting while also entertaining. Rand's greatest success in the novel is the portrayal of Ellsworth Toohey as the greatest threat man has encountered. One begins viewing the character as an intriguing and mysterious intellectual with a considerable amount of witty banter. By the end you see him as the most despicable dictator you can ever imagine.

I've just finished reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. Simultaneously the crystallization of Jesse Ventura as a political candidate has begun. When Jesse was a wrestler for the WWF and the WCW, the essential idea behind grappling was that of a carnival act pitting good guys (baby faces) against bad guys (heels). The good guys were at one end of the moral spectrum and the bad guys at the other. A newcomer could be defined immediately by his interaction with the established order. If a newcomer used questionable tactics to defeat a baby face, then he became a heel. A newcomer who used the same questionable techniques to defeat or even lose to an identified heel became a baby face. Life was simple then. Not simple really, but objective. Black and white. Objectivity, taken to the nth degree, becomes Objectivism, the philosophy that Rand created and used throughout her writing. Ayn Rand once told Alvin Toffler: \\"I most emphatically advocate a black and white view of the world. What is meant by the expression black and white? It means good and evil. Before you can identify anything as gray, as middle of the road, you have to know what is black and what is white, because gray is merely a mixture of the two. And when you have established that one alternative is good and the other is evil, there is no justification for the choice of a mixture. There is no justification ever for choosing any part of what you know to be evil\\" Much of Jesse Ventura's perceived allure comes from his willingness to \\"speak his mind\\". In general, Jesse's mind remains a carnival of baby faces and heels; a non-intellectual version of objectivism. So Jesse speaks his mind to Playboy and a tempest in a teapot starts about his demeaning views of religion. Ayn Rand also rejected religion because both of religion's fundamental premises; a) an all powerful being and b) acceptance of that being's existence through faith rather than logic are rejected by objectivism. Rand once explained her position thusly. \\"First, there are no reasons to believe in God, there is no proof of the belief, second, that the concept of God is insulting and degrading to man- it implies that highest possible is not to be reached by man, that he is an inferior being who can only worship an ideal he can never achieve\\". Ventura contrasts and distances himeslf with other politicians, once again because of his willingess to clearly speak his mind in spite of political ramifications. Ventura holds great contempt for politicians whose philosphy is disguised with weasel words. Ventura seeks only to be understood not necessarilly to be embraced. Rand contrasted and distanced herself from other novelists of her time. She told a Newsweek reviewer, \\"one cannot write about life without discussing philosophy. Most novelists today try to be as vague as possible in order to be misunderstood by the greatest number of people. I want to be understood, so I present my philosophy openly and consciously. Ventura is a reform candidate which means he is not accepted by Democrats nor Republicans nor liberals nor conservatives. He is an entertainer although his medium of entertainment is not accepted whole heartedly by other entertainers. He is an athlete whose sport is not accepted by other athletes. His sport is, in fact, defined as sports/entertainment with nods towards the lowest common denominator of each. Likewise,Rand was either ignored or denounced by the critics of her time. The literary community considered her an outsider. She was exiled by philosophers. Glowered at by liberals and swallowed hard over by conservatives. Both Jesse and Ayn have had made for teevee movies made about them in the past year. If Ayn Rand were alive today and if Jesse was looking for a female to round out his ticket... hmmm let's see. I'm sure they would oppose George W Bush whose \\"gray\\" compassionate conservatism would be viewed as anarchy and W himself as an irrational hoodlum playing at politics without philosophy or consistency. They would also oppose Ralph Nader, the ecology movement and women's liberation. Of course Rand, feeling too often misquoted would never appear on the Sunday talk shows unless she could be interviewed alone without editing and without being confronted with quotations from her enemies. Those qualifications sound like a perfect match for theLarry King show. She would not be bringing her saxophone nor discussing her underwear. Jesse, on the other hand, would soak up all of the other media invitations and whereas Rand would refuse debate, Jesse would welcome it...after all his confrontational oratory skills skills have been polished under the tutelage of Vince McMahon and Mean Gene Okerland. And the economy? Allen Greenspan is a graduate of Nathaniel Branden's Institute formerly located in New York City. Branden's institute became in the sixties the headquarters for Objectivism and studied \\"The Fountainhead\\" as other institutes study the Bible. Of course this campaign will never happen because Ayn Rand died in 1982. Rand's death reminds me of one of my favorite bits of 60's graffiti. Crossed out on hundreds of restroom walls across America was the quotation \\"God is dead\\" signed \\"Nietschze\\" and underneath that quotation, was this correction \\"No, Nietschze is dead\\" signed \\"God\\"."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It is the simply the most thrilling book that I've ever read. It literally changed my entire attitude towards life. I feel as if I have stepped over to the other side of the world, a world where I can see, feel, and where the moments of sadness and elation are what make life the most valuble. I look at certain people around me and realize that they are wasting their precious bodily fluids and that they are fragil and spiritless. They can be zapped easily, crushed with their precious bodily fluids spilling out everywhere.

In fact, I very much enjoyed the book Anthem, also by Rand, which is essentially an anti-communist manifesto. Rand's style of writing leaves quite a bit to be desired, but she is passionate about her ideas, and that is laudable.But, this book takes stark writing to the extreme. I was never once amused or saddened or made happy because of this book, and I never for one instant believed any of the characters. To make the sick little world she creates more \\"believeable\\", Rand sprinkles a bunch of obscure, lengthy references to architecture throughout the already too-long tome. And, just to make sure she really pounds all of her points home, Rand makes all of her characters self-absorbed philosophy-spewers so you can't escape her tedious diatribes about the worth of the individual over society and the foolishness of any kind of selflessness, including charity. You can't help feeling disgusted by all of these terrible people who populate Rand's book.Now, I must admit that I never finished this book. I got about halfway through, but then I was entirely sickened by the fact that the supposedly \\"perfect\\" main character, Howard Roark, rapes an independent, self-made woman, Dominique, and she is HAPPY about it! That's right, Dominique WANTED to be raped - indeed, she falls in love with Roark after the event! It's this kind of sick rape rationalization that is the cause of sexual abuse around the world - how can people claim that a book that contains such smut to be a \\"classic\\"?Needless to say, I don't recommend this book; it's not even worth the ink it's written with, not to mention the paper it's printed on."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, when I was preparing an essay on objectivisim which was offered through the Ayn Rand Institute. This text was unlike any other I had read before. The concentration required was exhausting, yet being so well written it painted a clear picture of Howard Roark and the rest of the cast.As I progressed farther into the story, there were times when I couldn't read enough in one sitting and had to keep coming back. On the other hand, at one point I put it down for at least two weeks. At some point in the book you would rather watch 'Might Morphine Power Rangers', then continue to put such a strain on your brain. I waited until the end for Rand to state her philosophy and most of the main points clearly, but there is one meeting in the beginning which stayed in my mind throught the book. It helped me clear up any difficult moments later on. Peter Keating asks Roark a question, &quot;How is it you can always decide what to do?&quot;Roark replies,&quot;How can you let others decide for you?&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I liked this book, but I did not like the amount of rhetoric I had to weed through in order to get to the actual point. The philosophical muddiness of this novel became oppressive, especially Roark's massive speech at the end. It was difficult, because it requires you to pay attention, not out of interest, but because a massive argument is being put together, and it would be very frustrating if you got all the way through it and missed the point. I just feel that she could have made the point of the novel with less pages and more interesting fiction. My biggest complaint about Ayn Rand is she does not ever seem to clearly state that her philosophy is designed to further yourself, but not by screwing your buddy over, and, as a result, too many people use it to justify these ends.

This just might be the book for you. Assuming of course, you are strong enough in your beliefs and your love of yourself. Unlike every other philosophical book, The Fountainhead doesn't inspire agreement. You are not drawn to identify with the main characters. They are strange and unreal. You wouldn't want to trade places with them. That is the whole irony in this book - you either understand it enough to love it and not want to be anything preached in it - or you don't get it. I would give it a ten, but the ending takes away from it"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Even though this is an extremely long book, it is one that calls to attention a myriad aspects lost to man. As a whole, I agree with Rand's labeling of most of the world as second-handers. Her views on women seems distorted, but her clearness on the exaltation of man, logic, and reason above the inconstancy of emotion is quite revealing and honest. The fact that her book has a happy ending is really refreshing and rare. It has opened my eyes and blurred my vision at the same time. I don't agree with all she says, which is monumental, but she makes a good case.

However, there are points which I thought were montonous, unnecessary. There is a LONG speech given by the main character, Howard Roark, at the end of the book, mainly to consitute Rand's Ode To Objectivism. I mean, it was really long. If you want to learn Ojectivism, read any of the articles in Philosophy, Who Needs It. I also heard from a friend that there is an even longer speech, almost 50 pages, given by the main character in Atlas Shrugged. I don't think she had, at the point she wrote The Fountainhead, crafted her literary fiction skills perfectly yet.As far as the philosophy presented in the book, it's rather straightforward and logical: you are fooled by your emotions, and it's an essential to moral survival to observe all things objectively, and to interpret your perceptions both rationally and logically. However, aside from the philosophical interpretation of the world, I disagree with Rand's political viewpoints, for reasons I won't enumerate here, simply to save space and to avoid putting you to sleep. In short, I think her epistemological and metaphysical philosophy contradicts her political.The major downfall I see in Objectivism, demonstrated most clearly, is that it is a very dogmatic philosophy. Howard Roark's behavior seems logical, but it only goes to show how a real, stoic Objectivist behaves in an esoteric manner, holding their infallible logic aloof from all other 'common people'. With this I disagree, and again, I will not explacate here.Overall, I give The Fountainhead two thumbs up, simply because it champions logic and reason, and those are two virtues that are entirely too scarce in the modern world. Also, being an aspiring architect, I had a great appreciation for the dominant theme chosen as the vehicle to deliver her message. It is a long book, but is one which you can move through at a good pace, if you understand the basic tenets of Objectivism and don't have a hard time with vocabulary."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Yes, the characters are impossibly extreme, butthey are not there to be 'real'.

A libertarian's manifesto, Rand mercilessly tore into collectivism, which was something of a political reality - even in America - when the book was written. While her characters are philosophically monolithic and extreme in their behavior, so much the better for their full development and the reader's immersion in the life-long struggle of architect/genius Howard Roark against incompetence and the status quo. A work of philosophy that passes itself off as a page turner, Rand presents a compelling argument in favor of a capitalistic meritocracy ideal.

This is a heavy book but it makes you think. The characters are SO well developed that you think you personally knew these people! That's one of Ms. Rand's best qualities as a writer. She develops her characters so well. They have many demensions and layers, which you don't always find in books now adays. This should be a book everyone reads at least once, if not more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Conformity vs. Nonconformity plays a paramount role in Rand's novel, with Howard Roark, a man who does not want to \\"sell out\\" his ideals to be the next best thing in architecture. The basic premise illustrated within Rand's work is the question and morality of how important it is to stand alone in the crowd despite what others think, to \\"stick to your guns\\" and avoid non-conformity in a society that shuns that concept.Architecture is the vehicle and player for the characters within the novel, but it seemingly is only used to project the major theme of Rand's ultimate philosophy--objectivism. In Rand's own words in the book's afterward, she describes the essence of objectivism as being \\"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\" Perhaps her philosophy is a bit outdated in certain respects and controversial in others, but she is able to depict an overall story of good guy versus villain in the architecture world.Roark is probably the closest thing to being a poster child for Rand's objectivism, yet the book's many heroes and villains, and the issues they stand for, give the novel its utmost substance. There is Peter Keating, who is shallow, jealous, and fueled by status and fame oriented goals, and has a deep hatred for Roark even though they went to school together and even though Roark bails him out twice in the novel. Keating and Roark are the epitomes of opposite because of what they come to symbolize. Roark has an inner willpower which allows him to be untouched by others despite the monetary and material rewards that may come--he would rather be the \\"starving artist\\" of the architecture world doing what he was meant to do then compromising; Keating, on the other hand, needs acceptance from peers, a feeling of importance, and the feeling that he is significantly better than others. Another of the main cast, Ellsworth Toohey, the novel's main antagonist, despises everything Roark stands for; he wants to eradicate any notion of individual achievement and expression in a world he believes is collective. Dominique Francon, who seems to straddle both sides of the good and bad fence, is a distinct force in the novel because she finally meets her match in Roark, who does not allow her beauty or power to control him. Finally, Gail Wynand is a character who is somewhat transformed by Roark because he is able to see the integrity of not only what Roark builds, but his character as well.This book can at certain points become a tad long-winded in dialogue and plot, but Rand makes up for this in certain respects with unique characters and a strong finish. Certainly the ideals expressed from the point of view of characters are Rand's own, but she is able to create a unique (and imperfect) character in Roark, making the journey to the end much more enjoyable. While this book is probably not for those seeking a \\"page turner\\", this is a book that is quite original when read with an open mind.3 stars"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is my favorite all time book.

Most of his arguments didn't display obvious logical oversights as would be expected from a typical manipulative villain character. This is the kind of methodical restraint that allows her ideas to unfold in such an engaging, stimulating way. The broad strokes of the book are brilliant, however the detail is often incomprehensible. The mysticism of the unspoken understandings between characters seems at odds with the cold reality the book is grounded in and the further you get through the book the more the characters allude to their unspecified understandings.

The first 100 pages or so are kind of slow by modern standards, but after those 100 pages I was completely and definitively hooked. I think that what most attracted me to the book was the author's belief in the beauty and triumph of the true human spirit. I was born in a communist country and later raised in a climate of uncertainty that directly resulted from the mind-numbing policies of the \\"red plague\\" as I call it; I think this must be at least part of the reason why Ayn Rand's book resonated so deeply within me. Her viewpoint is quite extreme, so don't expect to agree with everything-you won't! Her message, though, stands beyond any disagreements I or anybody else might have. This book truly inspired me to give it my best, to be true to myself, and to never stop believing in my abilities . Also, I have come to appreciate the beauty of selfishness as Ayn Rand defines it. Selfishness, in her world, is living your life for yourself and eliminating the need to live in order to receive others' approval. In short, this is a great introduction to Ayn Rand's body of work as it lays the foundation for the later books including Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just re-read Fountainhead after 30 years. And enjoyed every moment of it.Ayn Rand's protagonist is Howard Roark, a maverick architect, who lives by his own rules and is passionate about what he creates. Most of the World are the antagonists, living to please others rather than standing up for their principles. The World tries its best to destroy Roark, but he survives and gives birth to Modernism in Architecture.It is, indeed, a timeless story. Despite deep philosophical anchors and long dialogues, this novel is more un-putdown-able than any Ludlum. The pace is mind-boggling. The flow is incredible. Above all, the characterization is so powerful that some of the plot weaknesses (like the tame end) are barely noticeable.Fountainhead is a modern classic that will survive. It is indeed a MUST READ."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand's novel The Fountainhead is a philosophical work. In her philosophical novel, Rand uses Howard Roark, an architect, in order to advance her plot. However, it is important not to get caught up in the architecture because it is a story depicting a philosophy, more than just conflict between characters. Given the book is a philosophical work, the criterion by which it should be judged, differ from the criterion when reading a book \\"just for fun\\". Most importantly, the ideas presented in a philosophical work must stay consistent and must be easily understood. This novel should also give a convincing case through the means of its story. It should also be noted that the reader's personal beliefs will not matter when reading a book of philosophical orientation.Rand's philosophy is presented in a clear manner throughout the novel. From the first chapter, Roark's unwillingness to compromise is presented. The philosophy however is more than simply do not compromise, but rather includes the reasoning and motives behind those thoughts. Roark refuses to compromise with the dean at the beginning of the novel because it would mean living for another person. Behind the motives we have the deeper meaning behind Rand's novel, and that is to say that each individual is most beneficial to society if and only if he lives solely for himself. This philosophy is clear for the whole of the story, assuming a general outcome is understood. Roark is presented as the hero and so long as he ends up on top, the philosophy is consistent. Naturally, at the end of the book, Roark stands symbolically atop the world, thus completing the uniformity of ideas presented in Rand's The Fountainhead.Furthermore, the destiny of the other character's of The Fountainhead help deliver a convincing argument for Rand's philosophy. Ellsworth Toohey loses his job at the Banner. Peter Keating loses all of his once potent fame and money. And even Gail Wynand loses the battle he had to win: against the strike. All three of these men represented something different and impure in the way man should live life according to Rand. Toohey was \\"selfless\\", Keating wanted fame, and Wynand desired power. All three are wrong and lead one into a life of a \\"second-hander\\". A \\"second-hander\\" can most easily be described as a person living through the approval of others. According to Roark, the worst second-hander of all, is the one who seeks power.When taking into account that the book was written fifty years ago, the philosophy of the book should not play a role in choosing whether or not to read it. If your are a selfish egotist, great; or a selfless individual, fantastic. From either perspective, new knowledge can be gained. The Fountainhead can help solidify a belief system already in place, or it can provide a gained perspective angle into life. Or, the book may be studied historically and understand that this is Rand's response to communism and collective thinking. Overall, the audience's personal beliefs will not factor into the importance and significance of reading such a book.Ultimately, Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead was a well developed philosophical novel. For the reasons that it is well written, focused, and powerful, The Fountainhead should be read by everyone. On a personal note, I enjoyed reading not only the philosophy intertwined in the plot, but the plot itself as well. For anyone considering picking up this book, I would recommend it \\"just for fun\\" and as a knowledgeable piece of literature."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Annotation: The Fountainhead is about an architect, Howard Roark, who builds for himself and not for society. He is hated because he won't sacrifice his ideals in order to please a client. Other architects use designs from prior periods in history that many times serve no functional purpose, such as Roman columns or gargoyles. There is not much originality and society likes what they are told to like. Howard is often considered a rebel, but should be considered a genius because he doesn't steal others' designs but relies on his own standards.Author Bio: Ayn Rand, the founder of her unique philosophy objectivism, was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. As a young child she taught herself to read and write and decided at the age of nine to become a fictional writer. In 1925 with Russia under communist rule she obtained permission to visit family in the United States; she would never return to communist Russia. Her first novel, We the Living, was published in 1936 but it was not until The Fountainhead was published in 1943 that she became nationally recognized and acclaimed. She died in 1982. Every book published during her life remains in print.Evaluation: The Fountainhead is the best book I have ever read. Howard Roark was created as the perfect being, the hero of this novel, according to Ayn Rand's philosophical views. It is a very good introduction to this view, called Objectivism. Roark is the beneficiary of everything that he does; he acts in his own rational self-interest. This is a highly condensed version of the basis of Objectivism. In order to appreciate this novel you must open your mind to anything, you may not agree with the philosophy but I assure you that you will learn more about yourself and your own morals. To understand this book you need to see the deeper meaning of things not just the simple plot. This book is not a thriller nor a mystery, but a thought-provoking masterpiece."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A lot of the reviews I read have not read the book carefully and made errors when describing it, and just like to repeat what critics websites say so here's why you should give the Fountainhead a shot:The Fountainhead tackles two great themes worth of attention, integrity and 'sense of life.' Roark is the shining example of integrity throughout the book, making hard choices but they are the right ones. He is an individualist, because he knows what is right and sticks with it despite what the rest of society may want him to believe and do. The 'sense of life' theme is even more interesting than the first. The whole book is first a battle between seconhanders like Peter Keating and Roark, but more importantly it is a battle between the intelligent people (Dominique and Gail) that are also cynical and do not think good can succeed in this world (can they learn to love life? read it). It is a story of a hero, one with integrity, purpose and a good outlook on life. If a man such as this is something you value, the Fountainhead has something to offer you in an action-packed book that has the philosophical insight to back it up."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I seldom care to read books of this length. However, I was mesmerized and intrigued by the first 25 pages. While the story and characters were larger than life and quite twisted, I couldn't get enough. I was completely drawn in by Howard Roark. And the relationship between Roark and Dominique was explosive.I like to be taken away in a novel. In this case, I felt completely transported to the world of architecture, the powerful, and the elite. I wouldn't want to live there, but it was a great ride. Rand's philosophy and politics while interesting, was not the attraction for me. This book did not profoundly change my views, but Rand's style of writing and storytelling did have an effect on me as a creative individual."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rourk is the man (woman) we all want to be. Quiet, immensely confident, and completely satisfied with himself and his life. He is the antithesis of \\"keeping up with the jones\\". He looks at many of the hollywood/elite types not as something to be revered but as the disfunctional narcissist they are. He is, however, almost too perfect, but that is ok because I think we can all learn something from him. For instance, whether you are a CEO of a fortune 500 company or a janitor, you should take pride in what you do and never let anyone make you think your title is indicative of your status in society. That is not to say that certain jobs are not more functionally important, but as Rourk showed in his relationship with Mike the electrician, you should treat a person as your equal based on the pride they take in their work.The only part that seemed too far-fetched was Rourk's action (and the resulting consequences) involving the government housing complex he designed. I don't think anyone, particulalry post-911 and Oklahoma, would see that action as justified or right.Even so, the book is fantastic and is the second best book I have ever read (Darkness at Noon being the first). I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"\\"Howard Roark laughed.\\"The infamous first line of The Fountainhead. A lot of people disliked it. Very few enjoy it.

This is not so. There are a lot of words, but each word is carefully chosen and placed. There is not a wasted letter in this entire book. It's long because it needs to be, otherwise it would be nothing.This book, overall, is simple. It's written quite simply, with only a few large words thrown in on behalf of Mr. Ellsworth M. Toohey. But the careful and considerate reader would know that one has to read between the lines with this book. As Toohey put (rather plainly not too far into it), what he states is often just chat; within his column there is ever only one gem of a statement made. The rest of it is drowned out. It's pretty obvious that this is why there is so much dialogue. Rand provides sentence after sentence clarifying everything. It can be confusing if you're only just racing through the book to say you've read it. But to really get it, you have to think about it too.The way Rand wrote this was beautifully done. If you'd rather read a vapid romance novel, no one will stop you. But if you want to read something with depth, actual character development, a plot, and walk away from a book having learned something, The Fountainhead is a pretty good start. Most people think it's just some tripe teenagers pick up to be rebellious. While I'm not a big fan of Objectivism itself, I have to say I am incredibly impressed with Rand's writing. I was when I was 14 and picked this book up for the first time and I am now, at 22, still picking it up to read it to redeem my faith in humanity after laying eyes on a bad book.What I've always appreciated about The Fountainhead were its characters. I love the dialogue. It's witty and it requires at least a semblance of brainpower to truly understand what is happening. I can always picture the characters interacting while giving these long speeches and speaking in the indifferent, choppy ways that they do, picking up conversations that never started. If you pay attention you will always know what is going on. Rand does not baby her readers; she pushes them into the lake and says, \\"Swim.\\" If a reader can't appreciate a writer like that then they should stick to books like Twilight where they won't require to comprehend a thing and just focus on getting to the naughty bits.The relationships between the characters are more than your usual pow-wow in books. They are soul-deep. Steve Mallory, Roark, Dominique, Toohey, Keating, even Heller all play such key roles in each other's lives, it's amazing. Without such terrific characters this book would be nothing. A lot of people seem to think they are all the same, but it simply isn't true. They share some of the same qualities, but they are so unique to each other that they complement each other quite well. This especially between Dominique and Roark.Howard Roark is probably one of the best characters I've read about. A lot of people take issue with the fact that his buildings are described as simple and perfect in their simplicity, and yet Rand enjoys going on and on and on about other things. I will say, it is done for a reason. If you can't figure that reason out then this book is too advanced for you.There are many more things to discuss in this book. But needless to say, it's a worthwhile read despite the lengthy dialogue. You will walk away having learnt something and you will appreciate it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are excellent novels. If you can think for yourself, make and live with your own decisions, are not manipulated by the masses or media, and believe that you control your own destiny, then this novel is a must read for you. Howard Roark is a non-conformist. An entrepreneur finding his place in life - his way. The characters are great. The story moves fast. It is not for the simple minded. There are many layers to the novel and it's characters. If you only read three books in your life read: The Bible, Atlas Shrugged, and The Fountainhead in that order."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Toohey gets shot at, and tells the press that of course he's not pressing charges and that he wishes they'd just let the shooter go? What kind of nonsense is that? It's ridiculous!!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After Atlas Shrugged, one who reads The Fountainhead may be a bit confused as to the message. I didn't really feel like I knew exactly where this was heading because it seemed the author did everything she could to keep it from the reader. Instead, it comes off as a slow burn and spends a great deal of time in descriptive stanzas familiarizing the main characters and their motives.Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Guy Francon, Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey and even Peter Keating all come off as larger than life as though each one of them has a significant amount of influence over their subjects while each poses as a characteristic of human existance that most of us can identify with or know someone that does.The main themes are individualism and integrity through Howard Roark but it's a very subtle and quiet integrity not to be recognized at all by his antagonists while devoid of grandiosity and pretense.Dominique Francon is the most complex of them, coming off as a woman who doesn't care to hurt people but doesn't care to cater to them either. She's willing to go along with society's whims but she does so with a quiet scorn and an inner strength of contempt.Her father Guy Francon, owns the most prestigious architectural firm in New York with his last desire be that he is remembered and hopes to accomplish that while turning his hard work over to a man, far below him in ability, by the name of Peter Keating.Peter Keating, Howard's architectural nemesis, is what most of us recognize as a leach, finding that it's far easier to prosper when following the direction of others and living off their accomplishments while knowing that he doesn't have a creative cell in his body.Gail Wynand hates humanity and will try anything and everything to break it down but he has no problem ruling it if he can. He runs the newspapers and wire services throughout the US.Finally, Ellsworth Toohey, nothing more than a slimy little worm slithering through the Big Apple's core. A worthless and vicious symbol of totalitarianism that wreaks of a hypocrisy so craftily formed that one cannot recognize him for what he is. His is the domain of the so-called \\"intellectual givers\\" where those who do not buy into his brand of collectivism under his command are branded as selfish and self-centered when there is no person on Earth more selfish then himself.This is the backdrop of a story about a man, who decides early on that he cannot be touched by any of these jackals and decides that all that is important to him is his work. Because his priority is the work, that of creation, Howard Roarke is not influenced by money, fame, or reputation. A man so willing to submit himself to hard labor rather than to sell himself out to the highest bidder and have his work bastardized by them.This story does have gaps that are hard to understand. The characters are so abrupt in some of the decisions they make that at times it seems almost contrived. It stands out as the biggest criticism that I have of the work. Secondly, some of the visual imagery sometimes just does not work well as though one should ask, did that add to the story and the answer being \\"not really\\".Nevertheless, the methods that Rand uses to mold and form her characters is brilliant. She does not come out and tell us exactly what we're experiencing but rather chooses to daisy pick certain instances out of the character's lives to demonstrate what this person is really all about. Some are quite benign and some aren't but at the end of it, one knows who these characters are and with most of them, the reader will want to find out more about them.At the end of the read though, one must feel a sense of triumph and hope for humanity for those who choose to believe in their abilities, especially those who choose to build rather than break down. That good does triumph over evil but sometimes only in symbolic ways and that the majority of men and women are quite content living in hypocrisy as long as it's comfortable."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Besides having a great plot and writing style, this novel challenge your mind and philosophy of life through the story of its characters, it contains so many quoatble lines of dialogue that I had the urge to use the headlighter in a lot of parts, it also has a very fast pacing: I could read 100 pages in one sitting without feeling tired, the only negative thing I could say about this book is how Rand handles the romatic relationships but that doesn't detract from the overall quality of this novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"EXCELLENT!

For the person who doesn't care what the Jones' are doing.Howard Roark is the man who lives for himself. He is the difinitive self-motivated man.This book takes you through a journey in a world where everyone is striving to gain acceptance from everyone else, save one man. He stays true to what he believes in, even if it means being hated. No SUV for this guy. He is not a bleeting sheep who does what the trend tells him.Great Book!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I can only laugh when I read the other reviews and see how angry this book makes people. However, you don't make waves by going with the flow. Yes, the book is controversial and that is what makes it worth reading. You will either hate it or love it but either way your time will have been well spent. As for me I thought it was the best ideology I have ever encountered, but don't take my word for it. Read it and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was the first Ayn Rand book I read and it changed many of my point of views on life and my creativity. The suspence and storytelling capabilites of Rand are amazing. If you love to create, read this book. And if you love living an independent life read the rest of Ayn Rand's books."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"its not a matter of style, or how rand writes her stories through and through again, its just the emotion. when you read this book you feel like you are a part of it.rand is definately a timeless artist, a writer with untouchable skill."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The concepts and ideas contained in this novel were very compelling to say the least! I thoroughly enjoyed the style of writing and the level of explicit character development present. Rand's realization of each important character (a unique manifestation of some abstract ideal) was brilliant. The book is extremely well written and thought provoking. If you despise compromise this book will reach you with certain intensity.If allowed one criticism it would be Rand's overuse of some obsolete slang (e.g. bromide)."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If you can understand the true meaning of the book, than it should move you. Truly the greates piece of lit I ever read,Ayn Rand provides the basis Of Objectivism, her theme, through the lives of a number of different mind set people. The individual vs the collectivist. Ayn Rand didn't write the book to tell her reader's how the majority of the world becomes successful, she displayed a way to feel content with inside yourself."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A good book, although it's very much like Atlas Shrugged--I think I like Atlas better. Howard and Dominique are both cold and indifferent to everyone and everything but each other. The end is not at all surprising. In fact, hardly anything in the book surprises me. Rand uses her books as a pulprit to preach the same sermon again and again."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead was very well-written and easy to read. Surprisingly well-written, given the enormity of her idea(l)s. The sentences just flowed. If she had to stretch the believability of certain characters to get her point across, then so be it. I don't see anyone knocking 'selfless' Indiana Jones or other fantasy icons. TF was entertaining and I cared about the characters. (Had Rand been a romance novelist she would have been a billionaire.) As for you (few) detractors of this book, I think Rand succeeded beautifully in clearly getting her message across; that's why people who love the book do so individually, while its second-hander socialist detractors all sound the same."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Just finished reading The Fountainhead for the fifth time. The first time was over a decade ago, and I read it every couple years when I'm feeling down or just generally need a &quot;pick-me-up.&quot; Interestingly, the book was much funnier this time. Maybe because I was focused in other areas in the past, but this time I caught a lot more humor and actually laughed out loud a few times (&quot;The Gallant Gallstone,&quot; the manner in which Roark talks to Toohey, etc.). For anyone that hasn't read this book, you owe yourself. For those that have read it, read it again and enjoy the subtle humor."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Even if you are intimidated by &quot;classics&quot; (or the size of this book), you will love this book. It's very interesting, very insightful and very modern. Pick it up. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is the story about one man, his struggles, and his triumph. It was truly an inspiring book in that it showed a man with integrity, courage, determination, nothing will stop me sort of attitude. Some have said that this man will go to any lengths to get what he wants which is just not true, he is determined to find success and happiness on his own terms, by keeping his morals. This work is so relevant in today's timeframe with quotes like \\"its not what you know but who you know, truth is what my peers will let me get away with etc, etc.\\" This book rejects such beliefs. It was men like Howard Roark (the hero) that founded this nation and crafted the constitution with ideas such as man has a right to live for himself, that the world is knowable, and that happiness IS attainable; \\"right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\".On a more personal note, I had just been kicked out of school when I read this, which was an extremely low point in my life. This book made me think that I CAN accomplish, I CAN achieve happiness, life IS worth the struggle, and most importantly, I can do it on MY terms. Since then I have enrolled in a new school, am pursuing a degree, and have made dean's list as well as been invited to the Honors Society.Note: If you liked this book I strongly suggest you read Atlas Shrugged, also by Ayn Rand. Or if you want a clearer explanation of the ideas in non-fiction form you may want to read The Virtue of Selfishness."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a must read. A truly inspiring novel of courage, innovation and a desire to stand up for what you believe in. Ayn Rand is one of the most remarkable thinkers of the 20th Century. If you truly want to me moved and inspired I would encourage you to take the time to read this novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I picked up _The Fountainhead_ again after having last read it 20 years ago in high school. As a high school Junior, I appreciated many of the points discussed, but ultimately thought the book was dry and underdeveloped. The characters were too stilted, and the dialogue and situations were implausible, it seemed to me.While cleaning out a box of old books in my garage, I stumbled on my old copy of this book. I picked it up and surprised myself by finishing it in a week and a half. (Given its length and my two kids, that is fairly quick reading.) What I had remembered as a dry treatise was to me now one of the most powerful and compelling books I have ever read.My changing perception certainly reflects my increased maturity and life experience, in that I now realize that the book's fundamental issues of ethics and humanity's place in the world are central to a well-grounded life. Rand's arguments are as powerful as they are profound, with a fictional world serving as a backdrop for a morality play between dominant, and in many ways unyielding, characters. This book reminds me of the structure of Greek tragedies, in which characters are placed against each other by fate, and there is little to do but watch until their struggles end.It is clear that Rand believes in free will, but her characters establish their choices early in life and continue in accordance with their chosen principles throughout the story. This gives the characters a consistency that is unusual in modern literature, in which characters tend to be \\"nuanced.\\" There is no nuance here. The characters do not reflect people. They reflect ideas. And it is the interplay between these ideas, and ultimately the merit of each one, that is the focus of the author.In this context, the structure of the book works brilliantly. This is not an adventure book in which cowboys save the ranch, or a romance in which the hero seduces the illusive heiress. Instead, it is an allegory for the decisions we all face, and the competing demands on our morality and desires. Do we pursue what we believe to be worthwhile, our dreams? Or do we spend our lives doing what others tell us we should do? Should our own happiness be our paramount goal? Or is self sacrifice the pinnacle of morality? How should we treat those who have provided us with the resources we use daily? And how should we treat ourselves? Upon what basis do we recognize moral acts and immoral deeds? These are all questions to which Rand provides a compelling answer; the individual's happiness should be the goal of the individual's life, and productivity (along with its recognition) is the key to happiness.Over the 20 years since I had last read _The Fountainhead_, I have come to appreciate both the author's questions and her answers more than I would have expected. I would encourage others to read this book (again). Regardless of whether or not one accepts Rand's answers, one's life can only be improved by considering these fundamental issues."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I discovered this book while dipping into the campus bookstore during an anti-war march (I was an engineering student - not a marcher). I liked architecture and picked it up. WOW! The strangest thing I've read in the reviews is the criticism of the writing which I think is both bitter and brilliant.Just as Atlas Shrugged was about Dagny and Hank, this story is about Dominique and Wynand. Wynand's depiction is surely one of the greatest of all time...just the right touch. In the end, Roark is still distant, unknown, more an idea than a flesh and blood person. But the way the plot weaves and intertwines and finally joins is just incredible! Especially moving are the scenes between Roark and Wynand, particularly their parting.This is a startling book because it is so different from the vast majority of what is now published - shoddy stories filled with cardboard characters, needless gore, obscenity, non-stop action and a complete lack of intellectual focus. It seems quite timeless (I first read it in 1969) even today because its focus is not trendy events or fads but the timeless interplay of people. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I like a book that can make me think, but mostly I like a book that will keep me entertained. The thing about authors with big ideas is that at some point they forget that they're authors and start thinking their sole purpose is to enlighten humanity. This must have happened to Rand after she finished this book, because Atlas Shrugged (her later work) was preachy and almost started to feel like a chore once I got halfway through.The Fountainhead is a novel and it doesn't forget what it is. It is rapidly paced, with interesting, human characters, facing realistic conflicts and generally being completely awesome about it (a couple of scenes had me yelling hell yes in my head). The only thing that makes the characters kind of strange is that they're particularly articulate and pensive, so some scenes have you asking yourself \\"who talks like that?\\". But it's still believable in the context, and it's worth it to suspend disbelief to get a glimpse of her philosophy. Her ideas make sense, but you have to understand what she means when she's saying altruism is bad and selfishness is good, she intends very specific definitions, and when you work it all out it isn't as sensationalistic as it first sounds.Overall The Fountainhead is to Objectivism what WE is to dystopian literature. It is a novel of ideas, but you only care about it because you have characters to relate to. It makes you think, but only because you are trying to understand the characters' motivations. It isn't just flat out telling you what to believe. Even the most expository sections feel like they belong as meaningful events in the novel. They take place at appropriate moments, speeches, a defense at a trial, after hours of meditation; it doesn't feel like it was just transposed from Rand's journal to the page.If you care about being entertained first and enlightened second (if at all), this is the right Rand book to pick up."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"For years I had known people who read Ms. Rand's books and raved about them. Now I understand. But take heed: her other major work (Atlas Shrugged) is not a good introduction to Rand; the Fountainhead is the proper starting point. It certainly deserves to be included among any top ten list of American classics. A belief system that values the creative power of the individual, strength of character, uncompromising principles, and other admirable qualities are told in a compelling manner. You must view the world (and your role in it) a bit differently after reading this book. Now, why the heck isn't the Gary Cooper movie version out on DVD? Strangely, the book seems to explain that too."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have always been a great admirer of Ms. Rand's philosophy and The Fountainhead is my personal favourite. The central character Howard Roarke has had a profound effect on me. He may seem to be too strong to exist in reality but if he were, I would have died to meet him.A mustread for anybody who believes in himself and lives by his own terms."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"First off, I am completely different than any of these characters in the Fountainhead. It is one of the reasons why I like this book so much. It challenged me to see another side of human nature and how we are in control of our fate and lives. It uplifts the perfect captilistic society, and challenges those who wants everyone to be treated exactly the same. It is book that should be read in these times, when socialistic ideas is flooding the media and our culture. Freewill is overlooked and we are in a sense forced to be what society deems &quot;best&quot; for everyone. This book is first and foremost about passion. Peter has none, Roark is consumed with it, and will never give in to those who want to take it from him. Passion is lost today, and I believe will even become even more stiffled in the future. It is ignored, hidden, and buried, because it frightens us to find it in ourselves and it frightens us to see it in other people. It challenges us to lead, but usually we decide to follow our logic rather than our truth. True passionate people in our society often are outsiders and freaks, just like Roark appeared to the characters in the Fountainhead. He believed in individual freedom and ideas, he lived for it and would have let it destroy him. Thats true passion. This book gives me the outlet to wonder what would happen if one day, I did completely what I wanted to do with my life, instead of conforming to what everyone else does, the 9 to 5, come home, living like a robot lifestyle.Although I don't always agree with Rands philosophy, I respect it. I believe we as humans are capable of so much more than what we give in our daily lives. The enemy in this book isn't a person but an idea, its conformity. Conformity verses individual freedom.The Fountainhead is one of my favorite books, not because of the writing or story, but because of its ideas and characters. Even if you don't like Rands philosophy, you can't forget her characters, and that makes a great book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is at once a profound, daring novel, and a thrilling, plot-driven page-turner.Ayn Rand was an original writer. It's because of this that if you don't find yourself disagreeing with the content of Ayn Rand's writing, you'll almost certainly disagree with her methods. If you love most modern fiction, you may dismiss Rand as a hack, or as didactic. In fact, she's neither, but comparing her to modern fiction makes her seem that way, because she wrote stories which she meant to be understood by the reader. She never muddied her waters to make them appear deep. Most people today, though, seeking depth, look for mud. Ayn Rand doesn't give it to them so they call her shallow.Ayn Rand dares to present, in dramatic form, her theory of human nature, and of the essential issues which ultimately determine our success and happiness in life. This is just not done in modern fiction. Modern fiction is generally more modest in scope than most things Ayn Rand ever wrote.Ayn Rand presents characters which embody important essential principles of human character (the intransigent individualist, the self-tortured worshipper, the intellectual power-luster, the material power-luster, the obsequious social climber). In other words, extraordinary characters. This, also, is just not done in modern fiction. Modern fiction avoids presenting characters which are too unfamiliar to the average reader. Instead, it presents characters which don't highlight any essential principles -- average people. It tells a story you can be comfortable with, rather than really contemplate.Ayn Rand's self-confidence as a writer is bracing. It may scare you. It's certainly scared plenty of people enough to tell all their friends to avoid Ayn Rand like the plague. Are you curious about what they're trying to hide you from?Accept the challenge of The Fountainhead. Then form your own opinion of it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There isn't much I can add to the comments already posted about \\"The Fountainhead\\", but I would like to chime in anyway.This book started me on a quest for knowledge. I was completely enthralled with Ayn Rand's outlook on life and I dived headfirst into her other writings as a result, fiction and non-fiction alike.Those interested in Objectivism should view \\"The Fountainhead\\" as a starting point, rather than an end product. The novel is complete in and of itself of course, yet I must disagree with some reviewers who state that the characters are unrealistic. In a generic sense, those reviewers are correct; Rand's characters do not speak and act much like they would in \\"real life\\" in the pages of \\"The Fountainhead\\". What some readers may not understand is that this was done intentionally! Rand took broad abstractions and made them flesh; this was her intent and she succeeds. Roark as the \\"perfect\\" man was intended to show man at his best, while Toohey and Keating reflect man at their worst; never was the intent to show man at his most \\"realistic\\". \\"The Fountainhead\\" is Romanticism at it's finest.The story centers on Howard Roark, the Ideal Man. He is the flesh-and-blood manifestation of Rand's philosophy, Objectivism. Roark is an architect and the story follows his life and that of the people around him as he lives the life of the \\"perfect man\\". The novel raises questions about collectivism, altruism, selfishness, the nature of love and friendship, and individual rights among other things, but Rand takes things one step further; she is bold enough to provide ANSWERS. Perhaps it is her boldness that turns people off, but I find it very refreshing and unique.Ayn Rand's writing style is the most powerful I have ever read. She can be introspective, brutal, thoughtful, reasoned, concise, and vicious all at the same time. Miss Rand is the most brilliant writer I have ever had the pleasure of reading.After studying Rand's work for several years, I find myself in agreement with about 90% of her theories. I still don't understand her concepts of sexual love as presented in this book, however. I would disagree with those who call it \\"rape\\" but at the same time I fail to understand why Rand's views on sex demand such a \\"violent\\" overtone. After reading this book again recently, I'll have to go to my bookshelf and find other Rand essays on love/sex and see if I can make sense of it.This book comes highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy a challenge in their reading. The philosophical questions herein force you to think about life and the world we live in."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The underlying philosophy of The Fountainhead, masterly conveyed by Ayn Rand through the plot-theme and her characters, showed me man and life as they ought to be."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"There is no imaginable way to understate the magnitude and importance of this book. It is written extremely well and you will rue the moment you must close it for any reason. This book is a true statement of what every man, woman, and child should be-rational. I only hope that readers will try to immulate Howard Roark at least partially in their day to day lives so that the vastness of human stupidity will begin to contract. Logic is the only regulator of people's actions that is based in reality and this is clearly shown in the book. Read it, it will be an overwhelming experience."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I highly recommend this book to the intellectuals of the world. It's written for men or women, and will hypnotize its reader, provided he or she has an open mind to unusual philosophies. Ayn Rand had a unique thought process, and, inevitably, you will relate to at least one character in this novel. For me, it was Dominique. She is way ahead of her time: independant and strong, but constantly struggling to remain so. Roark is the typical laid-back man, continually harrassed by the torments of his own mind. The Fountainhead will definitely make you see the entire world in a whole new perspective."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It has disturbed me and shaken the very convictions that I have built my life around. I have never read a book that had such power to do that, and it has opened my mind in a way that is almost frightening."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I just finished this book today, and I was amazed the whole time.I guess it turns out that I have been somewhat of a Howard Roark all of my life, but not entirely I must admit. This book is excellently written; Ayn Rand uses many literary techniques I believed to be my own (especially in the first couple of pages)The only problems I found:-The book seemed to be a bit too long for me. I don't mean this in terms of pages, but in terms of storyline (I'm definately not afraid to read long books. One of may favorites happens to be War and Peace). I think that the book should have focussed more on Howard Roark than it did; this would have made the message of the book stronger. There were too many scenes that seemed unnecessary to me.-Toohey - -I think that his speech in Peter's room kind of ruined it for me. He reminded me too much of an insane super-villain.Other than these two things I think it was an excellent book, and offers many brilliant insights into society and morality."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Last week Isubmited a reveiw of this book that was two sentences long &quot;It was good. I liked it.&quot; It was not printed. Why? Just because this book is long doesn't mean that the reviews have to be even longer in order to be meaningful or influencial. The Fountainhead is my favorite book. I have read it twice and I read nothing twice. I understood the book, however, most of the pontificating reviews I don't. They were long and unintelligable. The Fountainhead is not. It was good. I liked it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead started off very slow. But as the story farthered, it was much better. My only problem was that it was drawn out. Every page could have been summed up in one sentence."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It has been many years since I read The Fountainhead, yet it sticks with me. I read it when I was a young and impressionable teenager. I fell in love with the ideas, but time and experience has taught me that humans are infinitely more complex than Ms. Rand ever acknowledged in her text.I love the hero archetype, but disagree with &quot;hero worship&quot; as this tends to imply inequality. Now, I take her ideas with a grain of salt. I realize that there is a huge gulf between literature and reality and sometimes a writer must stress this difference to make her point. However, I am more fascinated with how Howard Roark was formed and reached his perfection. The psychology of Dominique and Ellsworth would garner some investigation as well.Truthfully, the book subsides into a philosophical preaching that should have been couched in the characters. Ms. Rand did an incredible job of illustrating her ideas in the persona of the hero, but it seems that she thought readers were too insipid to gather the information from that alone.In conclusion, the novel is a a life altering and life affirming one. Keep the joyous portrayal of an existence without shame close to your heart but leave the author's disdainful view of the intellectual weaklings behind."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"few things in life have had as profound an impact on my life, personality and philosophy as this book. after reading ten pages, i was so amazed by the sheer brilliance of rand that i continued to read for two straight days with a stupid grin on my face until the final page had been turned. for anyone who has not read the book, words just don't help--you really need to experience it first hand. it is not just a simple story of individual versus society, not just a theme of different versus the same--it is much more. doors will open up to you, and even if you do not agree with all she says, your life will probably be fuller just by virtue of reading it. i know mine is."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, if not THE best!!

Those of you that have not, will find out. Let me first say that you should read this book, it is a very good story. It differs greatly from &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, however, in that there is not one single human being in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; that one could look up to. Howard Rourks ideals are simply too lofty to be taken seriously (remember that this is just a novel and as such Ms. Rand can take all the leeway she wishes. Superman is a fictional hero also). The rest of the charactors are so evil that they too are beyond belief. In &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; one could truly admire the strength of the charactors and grab with both hands their struggle against others who felt the world owed them everything as their destiny.

When I purchased the book I didn't think that I would like it, but I said what the hell I'll give it a chance, because you never know. It turned out to be very interesting. I enjoyed the way the author used two architects to portray two different outlooks on life. In order to enjoy this book you have to go into reading it with an open mind, and if you don't then the whole point will be missed. Read it you may have a different outlook on life when you've finished. This is the type of book that really makes you think while reading it. So if your in for a challenge I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Hi all, I am a Junior in High School &amp; i pickd up this book b/c my sister recommended it.

Don't. Whether you agree or not with Rand's political views, this is a great story and an extraordinarily well-written novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I really like this book. I may not agree with all of the ideals described within its pages, but as far as keeping me interested, it is one of the most challenging, yet eloquent books I've ever read.I feel, though, as if I missed a lot of what the author was trying to say. I felt as though she repeated herself with slots of continuous dialogue that made me feel as if I should fall to the ground and cry &quot;OK! I submit!&quot; But, perhaps I missed something.I love all the characters except for Dominique. I wasn't quite sure of her motives and actions. She talked a lot about how she wanted to suffer, but she didn't really suffer. Trying to ruin Roark made her happy, and being with Roark made her happy. She had a happy second marriage, but broke it off and tried to &quot;sacrifice&quot; herself for other reasons. Her actions would seem only to hurt somone else, and barely give her a scratch. But, on the other hand, she was, I suppose, living like a true egotist. But, then again, she was only happy through a few other people. I don't know. I'm just confused.Ellsworth Toohey was my favorite. They way he manipulated people was often funny and frightening at the same time. The fact that he always &quot;had a sense of humor&quot; showed how easy it was for him to needle into anyone's life.All in all, I think the book is worth reading again. I still feel as though I don't have a grasp on everything, just maybe a jist. I think I was trying too hard when I read this. I don't know, perhaps I'm one of those people who would have found &quot;The Gallant Gallstone&quot; a good book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead was not inteded to entertain people. It was intended to educate us, to show us a new point of view, and it does. Some would say the book is simply Ayn Rand stuffing her objectivism down the reader's throat, but she has every right to, as she wrote the book. As an audience, we must simply try our best to see things as the characters see them. Although the characters do seem a bit unrealistic at times, it is all to show the reader the goal that Rand is getting at. Perhaps objectivism, like so many other philosophies, can never exist in the real world in its true form, but perhaps just a touch of it could make our lives better. It seems, as this book shows us, that if we were to all put a little Howard Roark in our lives, maybe the world would be a better place. Even if it didn't, Howard Roark still proves to be one of the greatest unsung heroes in fiction."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"this book is a beauty, and uncompromising and unapologetic coomentary on man's potential and his hatred of it. her hero defies that to focus on his potential and realize it against all odds."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand shows to us the way man was meant to be. The Fountainhead shows us a glimpse of what we, as individuals, are capable of. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am one of the high-school students to whom this book is so emphatically recommended. I read this book for the purpose of entering the Ayn Rand Foundation scholarship contest, and it was only discipline (and need for the money for college) that kept me at it. If you're going to write a novel, write a novel. Don't write a cheap allegory of your ideas that banters ON and ON and ON. I find it ironic that Ms. Rand repeatedly touted the simplicity and efficiency of Roark's work, yet said in 700-some pages what could have been said in 100 or less. I agree with thinking for yourself, but after a session of reading The Fountainhead, I was lucky if I could think at all. I would liken it to being hit in the head with a sledgehammer of ideas. While some were worthy, the intensity of their repetition defeated the enitire purpose. And if objectivism and individualism is the goal, by elevating Ayn Rand to the status of a godess and her philosophies to the gospel, her dedicated followers are defying everything she tried to teach. Smells like hypocrisy to me."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was the most interesting book I've ever read. The greatest part of it was the way the author seemed to mock her readers: by totally agreeing with her philosophy, arren't you just as bad as Toohey's supporters. On the other hand, if you don't agree with her concepts, then you're actually more of a second-hander than the average human because you don't even know that the kind of power Toohey got was the exact type of thing that happens today. As a high school student I know well that her portrayal of the public is right on, because we live in a world where people strive to emulate their fellow man, but why do all kids have to wear the same name brands, and why do modern buildings need Reniassance or Classic style? Why is it that we seek happiness through the acception of our fellow human beings, shouldn't happiness come from inside of ourselves. In the end, isn't your own body the only thing that is truly yours? I don't agree with everything in the novel, I believe in an ordered society and in religion, but how can we have a wonderful society without great individuals to contribute to it? This novel was a wonderful piece of work, written in the extreme to clearly convey Rand's philosophy, I found it thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I love and hate this book at the same time.I love it because I have never read anything like it. It engaged me, challenged me, made me angry and happy. But most of all, it questioned my viewpoint on life, my relationships, my own agenda and my quest for happiness. And that is what I believe a book above all should do to its reader.I hate it because Howard Roark, the hero of the book, is so idealized. Everyone else in this books struggles with their demons, their place in society and their relationships with each other. Roark, however, is different. He appears to have it all figured out. He always knows what to say and what to do. There are never any doubts, no regrets, hardly any pains. I asked myself: how does he do it and how did he get to this point? He is supposed to epitomize the ideal of happiness and content. But in that ideal, he seems so inhuman. He actually does not seem like a real person. Where you would expect a character to struggle with a decision, Roark storms forward without any faltering. If Rand intended Roark to be the person that we should all strive to be, I cannot figure out how to be him.The curious thing about the book is that all the other characters actually depict the human traits that you expect in a fictional character. There is the woman who seems to have everything except for love and happiness. There is the man, who has risen from the slums of poverty by working hard and corrupting others. There is the man who lives through the opinion of others and is never truly himself, and there is the man who has figured out how to construct public opinions through his own manipulations. All these characters struggle, all of them develop, change, come to an awareness of themselves. Only Roark is the same on page 1 as he is on page 700.Yes, this is a long book, but don't be discouraged by its length of Roark's idealized character. The story keeps you going and the interweaving of plot lines is fantastic. Read it! Really read it, even if you don't believe in Objectivism or Rand's theories. You will find that besides its faults and ideals, it is a fantastic read that will surely challenge your outlook on life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read The Fountainhead last year for a high school English class. I wasn't really expecting to like it going in, mainly because it was a pretty long book, and I had heard it was boring. I'm glad that the class required me to read it, because I think it is one of the best books I've ever read in my life. I'm not really one of those people who reads for fun, but this is the kind of book that I would recommend reading, even if it's not for a class. Normally I look at reading as a chore, but this book was different. It held my attention, which many books can't do. I was very impressed by this book, and I would highly recommend it to other readers.Ayn Rand, the author of this book, did an outstanding job. Her characters are amazing, and the plot that goes along with them is equally as good. She has all the necessary aspects that make a great book, in my opinion. The story is great, the characters are great, and the book is great. It takes the reader through twists and turns through the lives of the characters. I never found it to be boring or dull in any way. I'm not a \\"book person\\", but I really did enjoy reading this book. It had a big impact on me and most definitely changed the way that I thought. As I was reading it I remember thinking about how it related to me, and to today's society. I think that there is a lot that can be learned from this book. We shouldn't just believe what we are told, or believe everything we see. After reading this book I didn't want to be just another follower and do what I was told. It made me want to be more of individual and break free of society's \\"rules\\". I think that there is a lot to be learned from this book.The Fountainhead is set back in the 1920's and 30's in New York City. It's a book about a man, Howard Roark, who is an architect. Roark is an idealistic, almost free spirit who goes against the norm. On the other hand, Peter Keating, another big character in the story, is pretty much the opposite of Roark. Keating goes by the rules, and does what society dictates. The book focuses on Roark's struggles on making it as an architect, more or less. It also deals with Keating and Roark's lives, and how their paths cross in and out of each other.The book starts out with Roark and Keating while they are attending the Stanton Institute of Technology. Keating's mother runs a boardinghouse, where Roark lives. Roark is kicked out of Stanton, mainly because he refuses to design how others want him to. Keating on the other hand dishes out exactly what is wanted. They are pretty much opposite ends of the spectrum. Roark's work is creative and controversial, and not accepted. The book shows the differences between these two characters, and their ideals.This book also contains a philosophy of life. Her philosophy is known as objectivism. Two of the major characters, Peter Keating and Howard Roark, represent two different ideals of life. Peter Keating is the follower, who just goes along with society. He seems to be a good guy in the beginning, but you'll have to decide for yourself in the end. Roark is the individualistic, free spirit who rebels against society. Roark is the basis for objectivism, in my opinion. The book isn't anywhere near as simple as I've explained it. Buy the book and figure it all out. In my opinion we have way too many \\"Peter Keating's\\" in the world today, and this book open my eyes to that. After reading this I no longer wanted to be a \\"Peter Keating\\", and I've tried not to be since. This is a great book with a great outlook on life. I don't think you'll be disappointed by it at all."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Looking at the recent reviews, I realize that many reviewers have been giving this book fairly bad reviews. Yet, deep down, this doesn't really surprise me. The fact is, when it comes to philosophy-type literature, perspective and experience makes a big difference, and many people aren't finding something worthwhile in Ayn Rand. However, this book can't be passed off simply as the crazy philosophical ravings of an offbeat author- there is much more here than may meet the eye at first.Most things about this book are very complicated- especially the characters. You'll probably end up wondering why they make the choices they do; often, you'll be completely taken aback by the strangeness in them. However, upon closer inspection, they are all very realistic, and all very solid. You just need to invest the time and effort to do this.This book also has a fairly good plot to it- the ending, while left open, is fairly satisfying, and the climaxes are well put together. And, I must say, the antagonist of the story is one of the best in literature history- seemingly innocent and weak, yet at the same time powerful and very evil. And the dialogue is incredible- it's realistic, but not in any way boring. It's well ahead of its time, just like Ms. Rand.The best thing about this book is that it provides so many untraditional ideas to think about. While many reviewers didn't like this book because they disagreed with it, it offers many ideas that can expand your horizons. I would say to read this with an open mind, and don't worry about everything you read. Some of it may seem more passable than other parts- the best thing to do is to take what you want to and leave the rest.Overall, this is a good read, and in the long run is rewarding. If you don't get too deep into every dynamic of the philosophy, you will probably enjoy it more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's Fountainhead has confused me. I've just finished reading it for the second time, a year after I read it first. It has confused me simply in the fact that I don't understand my own reaction to it. I loved the book both times, no doubt. But the more carefully I read and re-read passages, the more I hate what the characters are saying--ALL of them, protagonists and antagonists alike. I still love the book, but Raynd's philosophy bores me with its pretentiousness, and her description of Toohey and his followers is far too simplistic- he's written so blatantly evil that the reader is insulted...Did Raynd think we wouldn't pick up on his wiles if she didn't spell it out for us this way? And, strangely enough, the book has made me somehow more aware and embracing of my religion, instead of shunning it as one would expect to be affected by the book. I'd say everyone should read this book; it affects the way you think about things. But I don't think it has the effect on all people that Raynd necessarily wanted. In shamelessly plugging her own philosophy and attempting to win people over to it, she has contradicted the very things for which is purports to stand, leaving a funny taste in my mouth...I don't know. Like I said, I'm confused."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Howard Roark, struggling architect, has to compete with meritocracy and the system. He has no intention of corrupting his principals. The world (good guys and bad guys) plans to do that for him. So he finds a unique solution.I have read the book, saw the movie (1949, Gary Cooper, Patricia Neal, and Raymond Massey) and listened to the audio tapes. Each media gives a different feel to her story and brings out the underlying message in different ways. If this is your first Ayn Rand book then either you are in high school (where they think this is the pentacle her work) or you started in the middle of here forming. Other books as \\"We the Living\\", she knew something was wrong, but did not know what it was. In \\"The Fountain Head\\", she puts her finger on the symptoms and rebels against them. In \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", she finally identifies the source of the problem and even if it seems like a surrealistic story, she offers concrete solutions. Out of this process Objectivism was born."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a thick book. I don't mean pagewise because I've read longer. Thick meaning that careful patient attention should be taken when reading. That is the writing style. \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a quick read as much as it's a book about 20th century architecture.First off, I must say I'm surprised by the average review of 4/5 stars by 829 previous reviewers. The only way I could see giving this book a marred marking from perfect is Ayn Rand's using the profession of architecture as a vehicle to spew her philosophy. But spewing is the wrong word as it has negative connotation. And this reason, this fronting I've described is too coincidental. The message of her philosophy being individualistic creation and achievement, a self-fulfilling achievement of Miss Rand of having done so through the publishing of \\"The Fountainhead\\". Or perhaps she recieves lower marks from \\"second-handers\\" or real life Peter Keating's and Ellsworth Toohey's whose lives are mirrored in the pages. Oh well. What do I care? It's not a crime against me. Perhaps these people would've enjoyed \\"The Gallant Gallstone\\" better.Patient character evolution is done with brilliance and the book spans somewhere between 20-25 years of the characters lives. The story parallels the careers of Peter Keating and Howard Roark. Rand shows the difference between two working philosophies. One is riding the coat-tails of predecessors, the easier route (in her opinion), the office politics of how you look in other people's eyes, the country club. Soon enough, the reader finds that this first example is pawn to an elaborate control scheme that society constructs. The premise is that no one man should have egotistical power, a premise formed by people not willing to create or put themselves on the line, a premise by those who are too afraid to change. The other is the power of the individual, the one who cares not for the folly of other men but who sees holiness only in the process of personal creation. Criticism and backlash mean nothing, because they add nothing. This is existential self, exterior forces put to the wayside, the heart of the philosophy.I can understand this a hard book for some people to read. Not difficult to get through, but difficult to accept. People don't want to view their careers as worthless, and in my opinion, no person is worthless. We do get that sense of Peter Keating and even Gail Wynand to some extent. Men who could've been. It's sad and sometimes hard to bear, I suppose. In some respects it reminds me of Thoreau's preaching.Yet I love the delicate care Ayn Rand put into \\"The Fountainhead\\". Descriptions of creation are among the best, IE The Stoddard Temple. The reader gets a feeling of the power shared among Howard, Dominique, Steve, and Mike. It's a beautiful part of the book that I love and feel. The difference of the two ideals described above are so clear-cut among different characters, which are developed with such care that the reader can easily make distinction between both forms.It really is a beautiful five bean thick chili of a novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead truely captures the essence of capitalism that the founders of America held so dear. The hero of the novel, Howard Roark, exemplifies the spirit of the self and capitalism. The ideal he holds dear is living life for oneself. Roark says in a trial summation &quot;His [man's] vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man's spirit, however, is his self.&quot; Roark struggles in a mindless society where humans give their souls to anyone. The villain is Ellsworth Toohey, a man who feeds off the weak-minded. His true ambition is to control the minds and souls of people so he will be projected to the forefront of society. He preaches theorys of altruism and collectivism which place him at the top of civilization. Rand uses Roark to refute the communistic philosophy that destroys man's self. Roark stands against the illogical notion of communism that overtook pre and post World War II Europe and Asia. The ideas of socialistic practices have penetrated the minds of Americans and they will be a crucial step towards forfeiting or preserving freedom. Roark tries to make this clear for the people who still have a chance at living life for themselves."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"&quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is the story of Howard Roark, an ideal man of perfect virtue in world full of men that want nothing extreme and follow those who do know what they want, so long as the leaders help them mask their emptiness. Roark is an architect who only works his way, asking no one to like or accept his work, demanding nothing from others. His buildings are highly efficient and a tribute to the best within man, and he deals only with those who approach him ready to accept his terms. Ultimately &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is not the story of his struggle against his antagonists, but the story of their struggle to stifle the good in men so that Roark can never work, which would destroy him.This is about the broadest synopsis of the book's conflict that I can make. I read the book at a time (at 18) when I was fighting off the growing realization that my religion and my country were intellectually and morally bankrupt. This is terrifying when you aren't aware of *why* they are and what alternate thinking this implies. I was looking carefully for some new ideas. I found &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and some very challenging questions of mine got answered. If you haven't read the book I hope you will."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book, while being celebrated as a philosophy and a story, is nothing more than a lot of excess words on paper. Ayn Rand's so-called epic is a childish rant of sorts that calls to mind the selfishness of Holden Caulfield while not being nearly as compellingly written. I won't say much of the life she led and that it's odd that she is one whose ideas seem to all too frequently be adpoted.In reality, I must say that she writes a monolgue like no one else, but I cannot forgive the implications or content of a book so obviously self-involved."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is certainly and most definitely the most boring book i have read in my whole life.There is a lot of hype created around this book and that is why i think a lot of them thinks that if the book is not liked by them then they are not literally normal..."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"the print was extremely too small making it very difficult and annoying to read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book, along with 'Atlas Shrugged', are two of the most vile, uninteresting books you'll ever read. There wasn't one likeable character in either book! And that is saying a lot, considering both novels are 2 huge bricks of lumber. Seriously, was this woman kidding when she wrote these? Absolute garbage. There is no warmth or humour or real emotion throughout either of these books. And so people say it is a philosophy. Her philosophy of \\"selfishness as a virtue\\" is not grounded in reality. Perhaps it is for the disillusioned Republicans or Captialists. You get an image of some smug capitalistic egoist saying to themselves after reading these, \\"see, I can do anything I want because it is human nature to do so..and the world is better off because of it\\". Reaganites, Bush2, Thatcherites, that type of thinking (note- the story of Enron comes to mind). We now know that Karl Marx's philosophy was very flawed. Yet we fail to realize that Adam Smith's philosophy was also flawed. There is no 'Invisible Hand'. We do not live in a vacuum. Yet Ayn Rand thinks we do.Another thing... perhaps most important and above everything else when you are looking for a book, whether you are reading the book, or have completed a book you might wonder is this authour likeable or not. And for that one simple thing, this book is dead last on my list of books I've read. This is the coldest, elitist, most self-centred, boring, and unrealistic authour I've ever read.

Ayn Rand carries her tale with such swaggering confidence that it is necessary either to agree with her or to disagree with her. Ignoring her is out of the question. The novel had a deep spiritual significance to me-- one Rand probably did not intend and might have resented in light of her atheism. I loved her characters-- a love she would have despised. I admire her book-- an admiration for which she would not care. Rand practices what she preaches-- a perfect egoism, and a total disregard for anyone else's opinion. If you are prepared to be snubbed, read this book. It is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Fitzgerald once penned, &quot;An author ought to write for the youth of his own generation, the critics of the next, and the schoolmasters of ever afteward.&quot; And though Fitzgerald's words are a bit antiquated, I can think of no greater a &quot;litmus test&quot; by which to judge fiction in general. _The Fountainhead_, all pundits and critics of Objectivism aside, is a narrative that stands on the pinnacle of literary excellence for it's scope, timelessness, authority, seamlessness, eloquence, and shear bravado. The damn thing is well written. Crtics of Rand's work point to the characters as charicatures, or hyperbolized men and women without emotion, empathy and humanity. If one takes this consideration at face value...so what? This is the world of fiction we are talking about. I can remember reading Klotzwinkle's _The Fan Man_ and thinking of the unreality of Horse Badorties; thinking Horse was so far out of the box that I would never come across a character so pathetically lethargic in all my life. But because of this &quot;grotesque&quot; aspect of the character, I was much more interested in reading about his destiny and eventual demise. I believe the same notion can be applied to Rand's characters in not only _The Fountainhead_, but all of her work. It is because of the fabulous and often distant nature of the characters that liberates the reader into a kind of unreality and allows the reader to think about the reality of situations at a distance. Regardless of literary intent by the author, regardless of her staid philosophy, _The Fountianhead_ (if nothing else, or everything else in this case), transports the reader into an entirely original and thought-provoking way of looking at the world.It is an exercise in futility for anyone to endeavor in evaluating the rightness or wrongness of this &quot;trip&quot; or the perspective you are given by the author, as the true test of great literature is the ticket there. If the story takes you to a place you have never been, and teaches you something (whether you like it or not), it passes the test as being worthwhile. This is the case with _The Fountainhead_.It strikes me as humerous that the negative comments of Rand's work surround the personal characteristics of Rand and her characters; but rarely is a comment made on the style of storytelling. In the case of _The Fountainhead_, the storytelling is no less brilliant than that of any great writer extant or extinct to date. Creative Fidelity is maintained from start to finish. I would be willing to bet that everyone who has read the _The Fountainhead_ (be it admirers or pundits), have the desire to sit with Rand or one (if not all) of the characters for an afternoon discussion.This book can inspire you to think and feel many things. In this, it is a controversy. Rand was no dummy. She designed it exactly for this purpose. And the purpose, be it good or bad, was to turn over a rock inside everyone who picked the book up, and examine the underside of the rock inside all of us. This is the kelson of excellent fiction.From the Passion of the Pundits to the Loyalty of the admirers, it is clear that no one who reads _The Fountainhead_ simply walks away from it indifferently. This novel is a romance of extremes, and well wraught at that."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The first time I read Ayn Rand was when I was about 18. It was a life-changing experience. It was one of those moments when one finds the right words to describe what one feels, especially when one did not know that such words existed or had been expressed. All my life up to that point, I had been stymied by the will of the collective, as enforced by a domineering father hell-bent on molding me in his image, and a stifling cultural environment that valued fitting-in, rote memorization and academic succee bss as described by narrow definitions limited to doctor and engineer. I grew up in the hyper-competitive rat race world that is the Indian middle-class, where intelligence, curiosity and creativity are all to be sacrificed at the altar of a steady job and one's total devotion to the pursuit of the ultimate goal, public adulation, typically based on a facade of 'normalcy'. I had a hard time trying to adjust to a world that constantly told me, \\"Well yes, you are intelligent and have the brains, so why dont you use them to get better grades and become a doctor or an engineer?\\" Just at the time when this pressure was rising up to a crescendo, I happened to find \\"The Fountainhead\\" in my first year of college.It was like a new dimension had opened up and this person, Ayn Rand, knew exactly the mind-set that I was struggling against. I recognized the Keatings and the Tooheys I had dealt with and would have to deal with for the rest of my life, and rarely, the other mavericks that walked their own path to their own drumbeat. I knew instinctively that this was more than a book, it was an instruction manual for a certain type of person. For others, especially those of the Peter Keating, \\"i want people to love me and I will do anything to fit in\\" mentality and of the Toohey \\"He enjoys what he does and so he must be destroyed\\" mind set, it was a load of crap. Now, I am sure there are a lot of people that do their own thing, don't worry about others and still don't like Ayn Rand, but for someone thats drowning in a sea of negativity, Ayn Rand is that piece of driftwood that comes at the right time just before one is about to go under. It gave me the strength to survive the constant barrage of naysayers telling me what I couldn't do, how I was stupid to try things my way, the critiques, the ridicule and stifled laughter behind my back for daring to go against the grain and just for trying something in my life that had nothing to do with their own lives. In later years, I learned to gauge the degree of 'rightness' of a course of action by the amount of uproar it created among a certain set of people. I learned to use the negativity to my advantage.The upshot, well, life is an ongoing process, but I am happier through all my successes and failures precisely because they are mine and I have lived them on my terms. It has been very very hard at times, but I have never felt despair or the need to ask others about the course I need to set at every turn. The successes have been extremely rewarding and the failures, mere setbacks that just make me stronger for the next battle. Reminiscing about the younger days (I am 33 as of this writing) and meeting the sheep-like Peter Keatings that were in my life back then only affirms my self-belief and the strength I got from Ayn Rand when no such reassurance was forthcoming from the people around me.There are several reviews and opinions here, some I agree with and others that I dont. They all have a right to their opinions, however, my only request to the negative (and some positive) reviewers is, please don't assign current political terminology such as liberal and/or conservative to the Ayn Rand canon. No matter what you think about her ideology and literature, lets get something straight. She talks about individuals and their strength as such. Even her harshest critics will grant her that. The very idea behind \\"The Fountainhead\\" is to be whatever brand of ideologue one wants to be and to have the freedom to be that regardless of public opinion. She cannot be hijacked to serve the purposes of a political party or of any other ideology besides the one that she espouses in her books, that of objectivist individualism. It transcends 'manufactured consent'-era spin doctor created labels such as liberal or conservative that have lost all objective meaning and only serve to evoke knee-jerk responses in the minds of the readers to push the right buttons that spin-mongers have programmed within the collective consciousness. The ideology that comes closest to her ideals is Libertarianism but even that has branched off into myriad flavors further underlining the fact that individualism cannot be summed up easily into one philosophy. It means different things to different people, which is exactly the point."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I cannot stress how much this novel, reading it 10 years ago has changed my life. I cannot by any means explain how Howard Roark is my ultimate idol for achieving my dreams, keeping my integrity, and have a better understanding about us humans.By far, no one needs to praise this masterpiece more. It's a classic with words, pages, and sentences that will definatly rattlesnake forever in one's mind. What is a man's purpose? What's the difference between selfishness and will? What is objectivism or universalism? Why would you stay original in your endeavors and believe in them no matter what?My favorite part is when Roark brings down the designs that they have changed. Call me idialistic but what if Howard Roark would emmerge from each one of us? What if we never supplicate to a social programming of what should and what shouldn't be? Believe this is a charchter that if you always remember, it coudl change a couple of decisions in your life for the better.I know it's a ficticious charcter, but it jumps out of the pages.Imaginary, intellectual, and so fabulously written it makes me think it is a spell book of magic hymn to a better mankind. This is a long book, that usually most writers don't know how to make it interesting and keep it in tempo. But Ayn Rand writes so beautifully with a consistency you can't deny that at the end you still want to read more.Also every chracter is drawn perfectly. Every Charachter even Peter Keating, Elsworth Toothy, is just so believable and with reasonning logic and motive of their own.Also I really like the strange love relationship between Roark and Dominique. To many this relationship, or affair, whatever you want to call it, is out of the ordinary and not believable and sometimes unethical to some people. But this a side love story with reality biting at it.That's Ayn Rand's magic!The philosophy she imposes might seem radical and counter-intuitive in the beginning. If you don't read carefully you might get confused of why the charcters act this way. It needs time to shift your thinking to one of the greatest philosophies of history.Ayn Rand is a great and detailed obsever of the human beahviour, analyser at best, on-purpose, and accepts it that we are paradoxically a conflict-based bein. We swim betwen between our real needs and wants and those social ideas bestowed on us.I don't want to sound poetic or as if i try to be writer ... read this book and buy some other copies for your grand children ...Awsome!Atlas ShruggedAtlas Shruged is as good and at moments even better.The Human Effectis also a novel intensivley interested in human paradoxical behaviour explained chracters who are architechts as well. Only beware it is a phsycological hunting horror in genre with a mystery plotline.Catch-22is my ultimate human condition book that on contrary of Rand, this one makes me laugh at the ideas imposed on our lives as individuals. One great book! A classic of course. A catch will alwys remain with you for life.Reviewed by PJ"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I admit it - I was assigned this book in college but didn't get past what I perceived as the author's thoroughly obnoxious introduction. Fortunately, between an excellent instructor and some really good Cliffs Notes, I didn't HAVE to read it, and I never gave it a second thought. The book had been quite the rage on campus in those days, and I dismissed it in my usual anti-snobbish way. But I recently had the experience of touring some Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings, and I remembered the rumors of Rand basing Howard Roark somewhat on Wright...and I was intrigued enough to dust off my copy and give it a try.I'm sure I'm not saying anything unique when I point out that the book is by turns brilliant, maddening, suspenseful, completely unbearable, totally absorbing, realistic, and utterly far-fetched. And I don't think it's unfair to say that Ayn Rand made the mistake of many other women who created memorable male characters (think Dorothy L. Sayers): she fell in love with her own creation.So, that said, I have to give the book an endorsement for a few reasons. First, the second I finished it, I started scrambling to learn more about it. I think only a first-rate work of fiction inspires that sort of scramble (in me, at least). Second, the book made me think, quite deeply, and examine many of my own assumptions. This last, I think, is precisely what Rand had in mind; and I guess I'm adult enough now to allow it, while in college I was not.First, the good. Some of the scenes in this book will live forever in my memory as among the most dramatic and affecting I've read. Roark's defense of himself in the courtroom - the reasons behind Gail Wynand's naming his boat I DO - the glorious descriptions of Monadnock Valley - the scene in which the intellectual snobs, looking down their noses at the common people, decide to make an awful play the toast of the town just to show that they have the power to do so - the final scence of Dominique soaring up over the city to the top of Roark's skyscraper, the symbol of their ultimate triumph. Really, really fine writing there - and an epic imagination that many writers simply aren't capable of.Now, for the characters. For me, these fall into two categories: the human and the not-quite-human. The most human to me was Gail Wynand, and I know why: Rand takes the time to explore his childhood and his formative experiences, so we can see why he's become the man he is today. Peter Keating, a reprehensible slug, is given the same treatment - a complete sell-out, a charming manipulator - but we see a bit of his background and what's driven him. In all the discussions of Keating, I haven't seen him exposed in the way that I think Rand is exposing him: Keating is the archetypical charmer, that slimy, disgusting, good-looking guy (or sexy woman) who uses looks and an ingratiating manner to make his way to the top. There's something so perfectly amoral about that type of person, and I thought Rand captured that archetype almost perfectly with Keating. He's the type of person who feels moderately guilty about doing something wrong, but never for long and never enough to do anything about it. You know the type. You see them in your life everyday.Ellsworth Toohey is the villain of this piece, and he's just about as effective a villain as you can get. His snobbery is epic; while he writes for a rag newspaper, his sense of himself and his ability to shape public opinion (to further his own ends) is not unlike that of many journalists who write for a certain New York City newspaper that I shall not name. We see a bit of Ellsworth's childhood, too; not *really* enough to explain who he is, but enough to give us a hint. Then again, I'm sure most Rand critics would argue that Toohey isn't so much a person as a Symbol of socialism. I'm not arguing that point; what I *am* saying is that he's just as effective as a portrait of, the complete embodiment of, the arrogance of, snobbery. Snobbery's as much a part of our lives today as it was in 1943, when the novel was first published, so the character holds up, as does Rand's complete evisceration of him.Now - Howard Roark and Dominique Francon. These are the not-quite-human characters. If one takes out all of Rand's philosophizing, one might see Roark almost as a sociopath, or at least the ultimate narcissist. The reader (or at least this reader) finds herself on his side, not because he's particularly likable, or even particularly attractive, but because he is so true to his vision. The man who refuses to sell out is a rare man indeed - and this is why I rooted for Roark, even as I wanted him to do what we all do, which is make concessions early in our careers so that we can get established, get noticed, and then have more freedom later on. There are hints that he's capable of great emotion, but he's a one-note character, even though it is quite a note.As for Dominique Francon, she too isn't quite human - again, because Rand gives us no insight into how she became who she is. Like Roark, she just seems to have sprung from the head of Rand (a la Athena springing from the head of Zeus), fully formed as an adult with no formative experiences. She and Roark are two of a kind, operating on a higher plane. It took me a while to get used to this, as Dominique's behavior simply drove me up the wall for the first half of the book. But by the second half of the book I had an epiphany: What makes Roark and Dominique so maddening is the fact that their behaviors are based on IDEAS, on grand conceptions of what the universe is, or should be, rather than what exists in reality. And that epiphany humanized the characters for me a bit, because I know several people who fit into the same category. For instance, I know a couple who never argue about money, child-raising philosophies, or leaving the toilet seat up, but are rather perpetually on the verge of divorce because each does not fulfill the other's expectations for what SHOULD BE, or what MIGHT BE, or what COULD BE. There are people like that out there, my friends; and let me just say they're as maddening in real life as they are in fiction.I once heard THE FOUNTAINHEAD described as a \\"young person's book\\" - the type of book that young people are impressed by, but one that doesn't stand up to adult analysis. I'm happy I didn't read it as a young woman; I was able to appreciate it, and engage with it, much better as a mature adult. But I can see its appeal to those in the arts, to those who wish to make a life out of their craft. At the same time, though, it made me feel thoroughly bourgeois, because to live as Dominique, Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey, and the other characters in this novel do, you must have a great deal of money. If you have to work for a living, you're too busy putting food on the table to get uppity when your boss tells you what to do.And it's hard not to see all the parallels between Rand's time and ours, especially when it comes to the tastes of the masses. Gail Wynand builds an empire by playing to the lowbrow tastes of the uneducated masses. Newspapers may be on their way out, but we still have reality TV, celebrity gossip magazines, and other horrors to remind us of what sells in this day and age. And I can just imagine how good, hard-working, serious novelists feel when they see the latest piece of dreck from James Patterson rocketing up the best-seller list. I've reviewed some fabulous books that had maybe 5 or 6 reviews here on Amazon. Then I look at Janet Evanovich and see thousands of reviews. It's enough to drive one mad, and Rand wrote a book about it.BUT... amidst the glory, you'll get an awful lot of speeches and pontification that goes on for pages and pages. THE FOUNTAINHEAD is a dense book, and while I enjoyed reading it there were times I thought it would never end. The maddening game between Roark and Dominique in the middle of the book nearly sent me off my rocker. I think the average reader needs to be patient with this book, to let it build, to see it as a \\"reading experience\\" rather than a book to be gotten through. I finished it a few days ago, and I'm still thinking about it, and I expect I will continue to do so for quite some time. For me, that's the mark of something enduring, and I can see why Rand has had the influence she's had. I can't critique her philosophy, not really knowing enough about objectivism (or philosophy in general), but I can say that there are times when her prose sings, her descriptions of New York stop the reader in her tracks, and you feel that you are in the presence of a great (albeit somewhat obnoxious) talent. But that's probably the point; maybe the truly great have the right to be somewhat obnoxious. The problem today, I think Rand would say, is that Obnoxious has been adopted by people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, who actually think they matter."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My favorite dynamics in this novel were Howard's unwavering belief in his unconventional architectural style and the romance between him and Dominique. I saw him as the true starving artist. Well, he did starve at some point since no one would give him a chance after they would take a good look at his sketches. The world around him was not ready for his unconventional creations as they didn't mimic and follow the classic canons of sculpting/architecture. I pictured Dominique as some sort of Greta Garbo character... wearing silk robes and smoking a cigarette from an extension. Dominique and Howard's dialogues are steamy and playful. I thought the author presents Howard himself as a work of art: chiseled body, facial features, just like a sculpture from a slab of granite fresh from the quarry. A bit redundant in the theme of individuality at times. Not a before bed read. It requires lots of concentration as the characters are many and very intricate. So, not ideal if you are looking for a light read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend who said I should read it before I read Atlas Shrugged, not because it was related to it but because it would make AS a better read. This book is just amazing and inciteful in how it illustrates the difference between the Producers and the Moochers or as related in the book the Second Handers. I highly recommend this book as it should be a required read for all college students."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"After reading Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD or ATLAS SHRUGGED, you feel as though you've been spoiled forever, because you realize that, henceforth, few authors are likely to afford you the sense of rapturous enjoyment you've come to expect from a literary masterpiece. And the reason I ardently recommend Rand's novels -- even go out of my way to purchase them gratuitously for friends or acquaintances whom I suspect have the mind and soul to appreciate them -- is because it gives me the vicarious pleasure to re-experience through these first-time readers the powerful writing and deep-probing insight into human nature contained in both these outstanding works.One of the most startlingly dramatic paragraphs from THE FOUNTAINHEAD appears when the brilliant, but villainous, Ellsworth Toohey (disingenuous champion of the \\"common man\\"...ridiculing denouncer of human intelligence...unrepentant hater of human ability and achievement) eagerly reveals the true nature of his iniquitous soul to an equally brilliant adversary (Dominique Francon), whom he realizes has the intellectual capacity to understand his evil...and the moral integrity to despise him precisely for it. Looking out over the radiant lights of New York City, Toohey softly utters to her the following:\\"Look at it. A sublime achievement, isn't it? A heroic achievement. Think of the thousands who worked to create this and of the millions who profit by it. And it is said that but for the spirit of a dozen men, here and there down the ages, but for a dozen men - less, perhaps - none of this would have been possible. And that might be true. If so, there are - again - two possible attitudes to take. We can say that these twelve were great benefactors, that we are all fed by the overflow of the magnificent wealth of their spirit, and that we are glad to accept it in gratitude and brotherhood. Or, we can say that by the splendor of their achievement which we can neither equal nor keep, these twelve have shown us what we are, that we do not want the free gifts of their grandeur, that a cave by an oozing swamp and a fire of sticks rubbed together are preferable to skyscrapers and neon lights - if the cave and the sticks are the limit of our own creative capacities. Of the two attitudes, Dominique, which would you call the truly humanitarian one? Because, you see, I'm a humanitarian.\\"Only Ayn Rand could have captured with such incisive subtlety the essence of human evil."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Although &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; contains a broader and more detailed look at Objectivism, this book benefits from not having such a burden placed upon it. Where &quot;Atlas&quot; gets bogged down with lengthy philosophical statements and never gets some of it's main characters developed (in some ways we still wonder &quot;who is John Galt?&quot;), this book is a more complete work. Don't get me wrong, &quot;Atlas&quot; gives great insights and is possibly a more important philosophical work. The Fountainhead, however, is a completely woven literary tapestry and one that can fully be enjoyed on that level."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Okay, so I bought this book at a whim at an airport bookstore. I didn't know what I was getting into. The writing, plot &amp; characters are timeless, unique and all in all, outstanding. I feel as if our society &amp; times have been impacted by Ayn Rand's philosophy more than we realize. Her thoughts &amp; characters are so original and I must say that I haven't read anything like the Fountainhead. Sure, the characters are unrealistic but I believe Rand took them to the extreme to make her points. I do not profess to be or consciously follow objectivism (some of it is common sense) but her book was deep, and a thought provoker.One last recommendation, do not buy the small paperback. The words are tiny and reading 700+ pages of that small print will kill your vision. Go ahead and invest in the bigger paperback, or better yet, get the hardback... it's worth it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I originally bought this book about ten years ago, but recently re-read it after reading a new techno-thriller that had a number of similarities to Rand's work.The ideas expressed in The Fountainhead are less about selfishness and more about how hard it is to have integrity in a society of parasites. The contrast between Roark and the second handers -- people who blame society for their shortcomings rather than make any attempt to control their destiny -- is timeless.I believe people should read this book and then take a good look around them; they'll suddenly see the world in a whole new light. I would also suggest that anyone looking for something new with the same independent, objective and libertarian feel would do well to check out 3000 Years by Richard Mgrdechian. Although a little technical at times (sort of like a Michael Crichton book), it does cover many the same themes as Rand but in a new and very different way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, like her &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; (which I had previously read), is a fast, interesting, thought-provoking if overly idealized read. Above all else, it's very strongly written, clear in its intentions and consistent in its characterizations. It is, while being most noted as a vessel for a particular philosophy (Rand's &quot;Objectivism&quot;), first and foremost an oustanding literary work. I would strongly recommend it for anybody interested in politics, philosophy or social issues - positive or negative, it's sure to get a response.In this novel, Ayn Rand takes us into the lives of Howard Roark and Peter Keating, two aspiring architects who choose differing paths when forced to market their skills in the world - Keating choosing that of populism and pleasing the masses, while Roark chooses that of individualism and self-sufficiency. Other characters become involved in shaping the story and characters, including Ellsworth Toohey, a socialist newspaper columnist who coddles Keating and gives support to various &quot;mediocre&quot; artists; Dominique Francon, an independent, free mind who influences both of the lead characters; and Gail Wynand, the owner of several newspapers whose content he continues to ignore until it's almost too late. The story largely follows the two leads, Roark and Keating, as they adapt to the market with Rand's unique philosophical discourse espoused strongly in the final 50-100 pages as the resolution nears.As a story, it's one with few faults. It flows quickly and remains true to its ideals. Rand's writing is, while overly idealized (okay, okay, so nobody in the real world goes on these kinds of idealistic rants seemingly at random places in normal dialogue), on a whole very readable and descriptive. The plot culminates well, even if the motivations of the some of her characters and her arbitration of &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot; are sometimes open for questioning. The only plot point I would question is the resolution to the legal battle near the end, which while serving Rand's ideological point, has no semblance of realism at all. That verdict would simply not happen. Anywhere. Ever.On an ideological level, this novel has the same strengths and weakness as her other major novel, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. On the plus side, it's clear, well articulated, forceful and likely to please anyone with even a fleeting interest in her style of thinking, that individualism promotes greatness and collectivism promotes mediocrity and tyranny. Using the dichotomy of Roark and Keating, two idealized characters, she manages to stress this point well.On the minus side, there is a great deal of this story which is idealized to the point where it loses some of its relevance in the real world. The world is not as even and completely divided as she paints it, with all individualists aspiring to individual greatness and all collectivists aspiring towards either a) complacency; or b) absolute power over complacency. There are a great deal of individualists who aspire towards hedonism and self-gratification and a great deal of collectivists who aspire towards general well-being. There are also people who don't seen individualism and collectivism as mutual exclusive philosophies, depending on the issue addressed. In that sense, the character of Ellsworth Toohey is somewhat of a strawman - he's meant to symbolize everything that associated with collectivism, but represents only Rand's interpretation of it, people who preach general well-being but seek personal power.The philosophy, like all philosophies, also suffers from the leap from one or two, or a handful of, situations to a universal truth. In this case, she jumps individualism promotes greatness while collectivism promotes mediocrity (which is still questionable) to individualism is a superior moral philosophy to collectivism (she made a similar jump in &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; from individualism is superior to collectivism economically, therefore...). If you're willing to make the jump that great architecture is produced by individuals acting in their own interest not collectively, therefore low income housing is an abomination unless its built by people acting in their own self interest, then fine. Personally, I would keep different tiers of a philosophy's application (moral, economical, social, asthetic, etc.) separate. That asthetic greatness can be produced by one man acting for his own selfish good does not, to me, imply that all those who seek to help others are suckers.Anyway, recommended reading.Matthew D. Johnston"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"While I was reading this book every paragraph seemed to give me a different feeling. Most parts were laughable on how blunt the woman could be to get her point across. Others stuck a nerve to a deep realization that what she says has truth. While reading this novel you can definitely tell she wasn't writing for the casual reader. Speeches drag on, characters disappoint you, but for some reason people have latched on to her like she is the goddess of objectivism and can't be question with. I did enjoy the novel to the point where I respect the thoughts it contains and what the novel has done for many peoples lives. For my own satisfaction I would not read the novel again. It did teach me many lessons but after reading the Fountainhead there seems to be no hope for mankind and leaves a deep depressing thought in ones mind after reading. Many people would just say I don't understand and comprehend, but you can't believe everything one woman says just because she was one of the first that questioned society this way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Whether you agree with Ayn Rand or not, that doesn't take away that The Fountainhead is a masterpeice. Personally I like it better than 'Atlas Shrugged', it's about 1/2 the length and doesn't get too wordy. The story has excellent characters and make wonderful points about what drives individuals to be who they are. The protagoni, Howard Roark &amp; Peter Keating, are symbols of ego and greed, neither of them truly desirable as a life model, but excellent characters in what I would classify as Ayn Rand's finest work.We could debate all day whether Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy is correct, but her work, sans philosphical arguement, is wonderful. The Fountainhead is the paramount example of her talent as a writer."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Well, not quite, but as the &quot;Playboy&quot; Ayn Rand interview explains, the ideas of Ayn Rand exert a strong hold on the minds of intelligent adolescents because intelligent adolescents are especially open to compelling new ideas. It is very difficult to read Ayn Rand and remain impervious to her Weltanschauung, and teen-agers are particularly susceptible. In any case, this is a well-written, imaginative, and cleverly plotted novel. Yes, some of the prose is flawed, but none of it is &quot;purple&quot;, as a reviewer below has suggested. It is certainly significantly different from any other novel I've ever encountered. I hold it in high regard but recommend it guardedly.(I also recommend, for musicians, &quot;Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist&quot; by Jeff Burns.)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Amazing, I loved it.

And although I wouldn't say that I was an Ayn Rand fanatic, I did read quite a bit of her work. At this point in my life The Fountainhead wouldn't have quite the same meaning that it did to me at age seventeen. However, I think that I still could appreciate aspects of the novel, which is certainly a modern classic, though some might say (and some might be really offended by this term), a cult classic. What comes to mind for me looking back is the strength of the protagonists and the really powerful way in which the author portrayed each character. For me as I read the book, the characters really came to life. Although I may not have understood it completely or caught nuances that might be apparent to me now, the characters were very well developed. Thinking back on the novel, what must have resonated strongly for me was the bravery, the belligerence, and the independent spirit embodied by Howard Roark and Dominique Francon. To my adolescent thinking these were really admirable and essential qualities, and even now I appreciate aspects of the integrity of their characters. Also I think that there is something in the novel that hooks into an environmental ethic. Though certainly the rape scene embodies an opposite spirit. If I were to recommend any of her work, it might be The Early Ayn Rand, because the stories seem to come from a less extreme and polar place than the later works that I have read, and they reveal an intelligent, articulate, tenacious, and developing author and artist."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Those that love this novel fall into two groups: 1) Individualists and 2) People who see little or no philosophical message in Rand's writing (almost unbelievable to consider, yet...) Those that hate this novel fall into a single, huddling mass: Socialists.The Fountainhead is clearly philosophical in nature, and in that, it deals with ideals. To criticize this book for being expressed in idealistic terms is like criticizing \\"Saving Pvt. Ryan\\" for being violent or \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" for being dark. Accordingly, Rand's heroes directly represent those ideals and can appear transparent; her supporting characters, however, are anything but.

OK then, so Dagny (sorry--Dominique--they're the exact same character so it's easy to get confused) invites Roark up to her bedroom with the tacit intention of having sex. You would think such rational and self-confident characters could honestly deal with their sexual urges in a pragmatic and open way. But no, Ayn must insert her father/authority issues into this and turn it into a masochistic rape-fantasy. Only the strongest of men would know that Dominique must be violently forced into sex, and her resistance must simply be contrived (I'm sure a few actual rapists have come to the same conclusion/rationalization). And only the strongest of women would seduce a common quarry-worker with good posture and a confident glance but then put up a violent show of resisting to...what, display her individuality and discriminating taste?Rand's women are a strange bunch indeed. Completely self-assured and self-knowing, yet subservient to the men they despise and unremittingly cruel to the men they respect. Would any truly strong and confident woman marry a man she hated to torture a man she loved? Would she punish herself unrelentlingly and debase herself sexually as revenge against the world at large? Dagn--er--Dominique's marriages to Keating and Wynand reveal a level of internalized contempt seldom seen in either literature or in life. And I don't see the rational connection between hating the world as it is and punishing yourself to try to effect change (I'll freely admit it happens a lot, but there is nothing rational about it).Since Rand's characters (good and bad) never develop or resolve a conflict, I'm not sure what to make of Dagminique's \\"bottom\\" tendencies with respect to Howank Reargalt d'Aconioark. I'd love to hear replies from feminists and people with a good grasp of gender psychology (and self-loathing behavior). Alas, if I do get any responses I assume they will be mostly from Objectivists accusing me of not reading the book, or not understanding it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I can't believe I am submitting the 1000th review for Ayn Rand's \\"Fountainhead\\".Its already been praised leaps and bounds by its readers.What more can I say?Bravo,Ayn Rand,Bravo!!!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ok, there's a lot that can be said about this book. But I'm only going to give the ups and downs up Rand's Fountainhead.Ups:I was hooked on the story. Howard Roark is a admirable character and I just loved the way he was portrayed. The same can be said about the other characters. I really enjoyed the first quarter and the second half of the book.Also, I don't understand the 'still' dialogue. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. I think the dialogue is quite good, but unbelievable at times.Downs:The whole objectivism thing is too radical. While I love the pro-individualist part, I can't get past Rand's elitist attitude. Dominique Francon, while she doesn't ruin the story, is so unbelievable at parts. I mean, the whole \\"I go to work only beceuase it amuses me. Muahahah\\" nonsense is rediculous. It isn't possible to act so cold. Ok, enough rambling.The only REAL bore in the book is the middle, which focuses on Ellesworth M. Toohey and Dominque a great deal. Once you're past this, the novel picks up its great pace again.If you're into the whole philosophy thing, or if you think that you're better than everyone else, buy this book. But for those who just want a good story, buy the book as well."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is a book you will finish. Not nearly as entertaining as &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; in my opinion. I like Rand's views on individual responsibility and capitalism, but her sneering dislike for anything spiritual leaves me cold. Also, her view of love is rather odd, almost masochistic. I think the main thing I didn't like about this book is the fact that none of the characters is very likeable. Howard Roark, in my opinion, is a rapist and completely amoral...and he's the hero of the book. Sure, he has high standards regarding his work, but his standards in other areas of his life are questionable. Rand also has a habit of being quite unrealistic in some of her writing...Roark's and Dominique's first glance at each other merited a couple of paragraphs regarding how all of a sudden they knew what the other was thinking, how they knew they belonged together, etc.That having been said, the plot is interesting and keeps you wondering what will happen next.

Supposedly, the story-line deals with identity, morals, beauty, change, and everything else underneath the moon. Sure, any 600+ page book has to throw in some ideas (vague and uninteresting as they are presented). The most amazing thing is that Ayn Rand is a famous author and...there is an institute named after her! In one word: WHY?!? This is quasi-literature at its finest and I can't believe that this is a celebrated novel.

It is, overall, worth reading, but do not take it seriously.BTW, I am not saying this because I am an enemy of the Human Kind. :-)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I had a mixed reaction to the book. On the one hand, I find the Objectivist philosophy to be fascinating. I was especially drawn to Howard Roark's determination to live life on his own terms--to be himself. This is one of the hardest things to do in life, and yet one of the most valuable. I am reminded of the quote by a MacArthur Foundation \\"genius grant\\" winner who said that \\"your own karma badly lived is better than another person's karma lived well.\\" Additionally, I like the resolute opposition to forms of collectivism, including fascism and socialism/communism that Rand made part of her work.There are, of course, certain parts of the ideology with which I disagree. While I highly prize and value individualism, I sometimes got the feeling that Rand advocated the Balkanization of society--her individualism seemed that rampant to me. Additionally, I could never be an Objectivist, simply because I believe in the existence of God, and it is a belief that I have rationalized, and not just taken on faith. Perhaps I am just the latest person to accept the terms of Pascal's Wager, but in any event, my religious beliefs would conflict with Objectivism. I could never be Howard Roark--a man who was practically born without a religious brain center, according to Rand's own notes on the novel. Finally, I have some scorn for Objectivism's disdain for all things traditional and classical. I think it is fine if a Howard Roark wants to challenge tradition. But to entirely dismiss it altogether, as he does with architectural traditions and classical designs, is arrogant in the extreme. Tradition and the classics persevere not because they are sacred cows, but because they have survived centuries of trial and error. This is a fact Rand does not appear to appreciate.I also could never be Roark because, quite frankly, he struck me as being the world's biggest jerk. He was flippant and dismissive of people who disagreed with him in the slightest, and since his was a decidedly minority opinion on life, his flippancy affected most people. I know that is how Rand drew the character, but I still found it off-putting. And then, of course, there is Roark's approach to romance, which . . . let's just say, is somewhat unorthodox. Rand was able to achieve the desired effect with other characters--I despised Toohey, was puzzled and dazzled by Dominique, saw Wynand as a tragic figure, and I think that Peter Keating is nothing short of pathetic. But Roark just struck me as an unlovable figure. And I don't understand how he suddenly achieves respect later on in the book, after being scorned at the beginning. No one really changes in their thinking about him. No one adopts his philosophy (at least not successfully). It is almost as if Rand has decided that Roark has done his penance, and should now achieve acclaim.The other problem I had with the book is that Rand is a bad writer. At least in my view. I found her to have a tin ear for dialogue, and an even worse ear for inner monologue. Her characters struck me as being wooden and unreal. I would have given anything for some colloquialisms--which almost none of the characters seemed capable of. The dialogue and monologues appeared contrived, and made me roll my eyes several times. On a specific matter--and perhaps this is just the lawyer in me objecting (no double pun intended)--the courtroom scenes were entirely unrealistic, which annoyed me to no end. Also annoying was the fact that Rand appeared to set up two separate straw men--the Objectivist one, and the Collectivist one--and decided to knock one of them down. Her universally Manichean approach is something I don't agree with.I suppose that the thing to bear in mind is that this is more a book about a philosophy than it is about a story. But I think that a philosophical work doesn't work when applied to a real life setting. I think that Rand's style of writing would apply more to a science fiction story, which is why I would be interested in reading \\"Anthem.\\" I'm also more than willing to give \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" a chance as well, despite the fact that it is not science fiction. But I just think that this story had problems as a result of being applied to a real world setting.All in all, I would recommend people to read \\"The Fountainhead,\\" if they haven't already. But proceed with caution."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A brilliant exposition via novel format; the struggles and triumphs of a self-disciplined, honest, devoted genius, who maintains his self-respect and integrity in spite of relentless assaults from those who would take what they have not created.The message is timely for us; we live in the age of denial of responsibility, when too many people seek to play the victim of circumstances rather than achieving in life. Even though communism is thought to be dead, there are still many people who would like to get something of value only because they \\"need\\" it rather than earning it. We advance as a free people because of the worth of the individual, and his achievments.Now try this one: you decide to hire an architect for your dream home.

Since I have taken both in account, I really can appreciate Rand's philosophical views. This book is not for people who are used to a quick pace and thoughtless plots. This book is for people who are interested in philosophy or thought-provoking reading and doesn't mind 727 pages. I know a few readers went into detail about the basis of the book so I won't bore you with the details; but if you want someone who appreciates good, classic writing, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I loved this book yet I felt I did not fully understand the message she was trying to convey.

But still I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The best book i ever read was Atlas Shrugged. I think that alot of people misunderstand the fountainhead. People seem to get hung up on the fact that Rand's characters don't seem to be human or the idea of selfishness being a better virtue than selflessness. Rand has never claimed that her characters were ment to be acurate representations of people. They were meant to show her ideal man, they are to be ideals to look up to. Her ideas about selfishness deal with a meaning much broader than the common definition especially in connection with greed. I believe the reason she makes all of the characters who would be called selfish the heros is because to her selfishness goes with integrity, not sacrificing yourself to the justifications of other people. Her characters are people unto themselves who do not feel that they owe anything to any one and that no one owes anything to them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This novel is a masterpiece. Ayn Rand, who was born Alice Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1904, wrote captivating dialogical novels every bit as detailed and interwoven as the novels by Dostoevsky--though significantly more affirmative.She constructed her characters in a similar manner to the way in which Victor Hugo constructed the characters of his novels; that is, she created a smorgasbord of characters representative of different ideals whereby each one consciously and/or subconsciously acts in accordance with a specific philosophy and sense of life.As in real life, some of her characters vacillate between contradictory principles. Her main characters, however, are \\"ideal\\" types. In the course of the narrative they are brought together in situations in which their integrity is tested.This novel demonstrates how some people gauge their self-worth according to how others view them. Some rely on the evaluation of the opaque ubiquitous majority; some feel they need to subordinate others to themselves. Only the protagonist, Howard Roark, does not assess his self-worth and the meaning of his person according to how others evaluate him. He is the self-reliant individual.This is a novel of ideas in which their concrete implications are demonstrated in the actions of the characters. For those who believe that ideas have no consequences (psychological, social, economic, and political), this novel will not register. Those who understand otherwise, who seek and are self-creative, may find in this novel a treasure trove and a companion. Those whose souls are set ablaze by all that relates to the human spirit may find inspiration in this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is the story of Howard Roark, a young architect with a unique talent and a profound ideology. Through encouters with plotting competitors, deceitful journalists, and corrupt businessmen, Howard works tenaciously and artistically to eventually succeed in his own way.Ayn Rand displays her captivating writing style in this novel about hte true value of the ego. Individuality is emphasized in the originality of the story line and plot, which is extremely paradoxical and is exemplified through character interaction. A mirror structue establishes this work as a reflection of society's weaknesses and potentials, which serves to further its theme of paradox. Ms. Rand has created a great work which accents the inportance of belief in one's self derived from inner confidence, rather than from superficial success. As Howard Roark said, &quot;Man's first duty is to himself...this includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty...&quot;"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is a story of one man, Howard Roark - Ayn Rand's ideal man- and it is the story of how he fights the natural tendency of our world toward collectivism. Roark is a lone creator in a world of fakers, followers and phonies.For those out there who follow a religious sect who believe in compassion and altruism as lofty goals - the atheistic objectivist credo of Ayn Rand may be hard to swallow. For me, it was not difficult at all. In fact, I had no difficulty at all reconciling Howard Roark with my religious beliefs. Simply, God and the highest ambitions and accomplishments of a creative individual, to me, are one and the same. Compassion and pity are not the loftiest Godly virtues in my world. I can reconcile compassion with objectivism.In my religious world, individualism and achievement reign supreme. Compassion does exist but is secondary. Simply, the American experiment works so well because it has done a masterful job of balancing both fundamental needs of man: the need to create in an unfettered environment(liaises faire capitalism) and the need to believe in God. Ayn Rand's objectivism is a necessary antidote to our present condition to help restore the balance in a world where altruism is becoming the highest ideal. Although Ayn Rand is a proclaimed atheist, I do not think it is impossible to be both an objectivist and a believer. Man does not have to destroy the greatness in the individual to be God-like. One does not have to be a sociopath to be like Howard Roark. (One reviewer called Roark a sociopath and I totally disagree.) Roark has no use for most of the world and unlike the warped sociopath, he does not scheme to get his way - he merely works and achieves. The textbook sociopath feeds off the sickness of the world and achieves through cunning and deceit. Perhaps Wynand could be considered sociopathic, Toohey - definitely - but not Roark. His selfishness is the virtuous kind - directed toward creation. If one is religious - Roark is god-like and of course, blasphemous to the secular and non-secular priests - like Toohey - that are not willing to allow another god in their presence. (Toohey's god is power.)In this novel, Ayn Rand describes her philosophy of objectivism through the interactions between characters. Peter Keating, an architect, achieves greatness by copying others. He is immoral and despite wealth and seeming success, his life is empty. He is the ultimate user and hypocrite. Keating is the immoral user that is the antithesis of the moral hero of the objectivist philosophy.But Rand does not favor altruism as an answer to immoral deeds. In fact, altruism itself is evil because a society, which fosters it, always does so at someone else's expense, and that someone is, as in Roark's case, the true creator and ndividual. This warps and compromises the rightful way of things and inevitably leads us down the path to collectivism. In the person of Ellsworth Toohey, a sociopathic newspaper columnist, Ayn Rand shows how the power hungry manipulate the masses by setting a standard of mediocrity which fosters collectivism. Altruism is a favorite method of manipulation.In our own time, over 50 years after the original publication of the Foutainhead, we can see how in the name of altruism, greedy and soulless politicians are still selling us an Altruistic nirvana. What started as an altruistic call to help the underclass and the oppressed, Affirmative Action and other programs of its like have become programs of evil. Though well intentioned, Affirmative Action programs allow the mediocre to take the place of the best and the brightest in our schools and other institutions. And the sickness is not merely that it advances the stupid and slow among us. There are some very bright but terribly misguided people who think that Affirmative Action is a good thing. Out of guilt and the need to conform, many intelligent people have been led astray as well. And for the people of color who think it is a good thing - it is nothing more than the face of slavery in a new costume.So, in the end, Roark's passion for his work and uncompromising creativity in accomplishing his professional goals set him apart from the second-handers - the same one's that feed off the creativity of the greats thinkers of history: the Galileos, the Edisons, and yes, even our modern Prometheus - the Edward Tellers of the world!Roark is a hero because he will never compromise despite enormous pressures to do so. Although many argue about the necessity to compromise depending upon circumstance, compromising to misplaced altruism or the forces of evil leads to immorality, or fascism, or downright stupidity. Does anyone really want to be operated on by an Affirmative Action brain surgeon?Roark did not sell out. He is certainly a valuable model in this world of immoral leaders and corrupted politicians willing to sacrifice even the greatest among us for their collectivist agendas."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is certainly an extremely well written book. As I read the book I found it very mind stimulating and the way the story is witten integrates a killer story with objectivist philosophic views.

If you are looking for a story that will change the way you look at the world and think I would totally recommend this to you. I plan to read this book many more times in the future because I believe I will get more and more out of it.Howard Roark is truly an inspirational character and I hope I can emulate this person as I get older and never become an evil man like Elsworth Toohey. Roarks triumph should be an inspiration for all of us and I hope those who will read and those who continue to read this book will feel (exuse me think) as I do."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I was struck by how little Rouke allows himself to suffer. He looks at pain in the same way that he looks at everything else; as something to be understood, and then move on. I particularly liked Roukes response to evil, when the unscrupulous Ellsworth T. asks him at a party &quot;What do you think of me&quot;? Rouke replys, &quot;I never think of you&quot;. Rouke is very unique in this repect. He seems to be able to step outside himself and look at the irrational objectively. Once he understands it; it becomes impotent to hurt him any longer.Evil and pain don't rate very high in Rouke's life. Whereas many of my friends, aquaintences and family members constantly horriblize over events that happened years ago. They carry these painful events around with them like prized battle scars. They refuse to try to understand them. They are not curious in the lest about the nature of their own suffering, and therefore, never solve them; keeping their suffering as the only evidence that they are alive.Rouke, on the other hand, rejects suffering as a way of life. And for this reason he is able to live a happy life and achieve his highest values. As opposed to the millions upon millions of pituful misshapened lives left in the wake of religion - which teaches us, not to be happy and live, but to suffer and die."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You can probably refer to the other 755 Amazon reviews to get a sense of this book. I will explain quickly, however, why it's a pernicious force, based on my own experience. The Fountainhead takes a very powerful hold on a lot of young people who read it just before or just after arriving at college. At a time when these young people are going through a lot of upheaval in their lives, and often feeling very alone, this gives them a false sense of security; rather than going through the hard work of making friends and generally being an adult, this book feeds notions that we don't need other people. That's not a healthy outlook for an 18 year-old striking out in the world.Life is complex and none of us make it alone. It's true that we need a strong sense of self, but Rand takes it to a sociopathic extreme. Luckily, I had a respected college comp professor who told me that \\"this is a dangerous book for a young guy,\\" and who suggested that I rethink what a world of complete individualism would look like. I'm the better for having known him, not Ms. Rand.I hope that those of you who see value in human interaction and feeling, and reject Rand's almost incredible view that any of us can be truly independant, will avoid giving this book as a gift, reading it, or recommending it to anyone. If you want to give a good gift, choose something that will challenge your loved ones to be more thoughtful, caring individuals, not something that will turn them inward and give them a god complex.PS - This is not philosophy. Rand wasn't that smart, or if she was, it's not demonstrated in this book."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I must confess, I loved this book and Atlas Shrugged when I first read them as a freshman in prep-school. I must also relate that reading these two novels did more to confuse and isolate me as an adolescent than any two works I'd encountered. I so identified with the protagonists that I thought of nothing further than &quot;forging my own destiny&quot; and carving out my place in the world at the expense of letting no one come closer to me than arm's length. As far as exposing Rand to impressionable, young psyches, I would have to beg any responsible adult to keep her &quot;at arm's length.&quot; She took Carlyle's heroic individualism to an absurd conclusion. She goes beyond Nietzche in her appeal to the isolated self. Each of us is his/her own island, seperate and unequal. Any notion of social amelioration is an act of cowardice. I am no proponent of political correctness, but Rand's philosophy borders on Fascism - the strong leader pulling the herd along by tethers. As much as I abhor her philosophy, I must give her due as a novelist. She carves out compelling characters and keeps a narrative moving. She can write. If you can keep a fourteen or fifteen-year-old interested for 1000 pages, you must be doing something right. Then again, I also loved Harold Robbins' novels at that age."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It seems to me that one has to separate Objectivism from the Cult it generated. Rand DID write some very helpful things, but also some nonsense. There is a lot of evidence around that she was not a very pleasant person to be around unless you treated her like a omniscient prophet. The problem is that her legacy has been transformed into a dogma by some people who refuse to see her dark sides. I strongly urge you to read Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult. It's not a great book, but I believe his research is sound. He has read most of the literature about Rand, as well as interviewing Objectivists and ex-Objectivist that knew Rand. Then ask yourself this question: Which one is most truthful, Jeff Walker's book or the hagiography Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life? I guess reason requires you to read both before you make up your mind."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead's enduring popularity remains a mystery to me.

Then she falls in love with him? Maybe people believed this tripe back in the thirties, but I hope most of society has learned better by now. Maybe instead of debating DR Albert Ellis, Ayne Rand should have seen him as a patient."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:q},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],F={key:0},E={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(w,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),g(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",F,"See more"))],8,j)):b("",!0)])}const O=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ae05db4d"]]),z=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/55.md","filePath":"people/55.md"}'),M={name:"people/55.md"},N=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(O)]))}});export{z as __pageData,N as default};
