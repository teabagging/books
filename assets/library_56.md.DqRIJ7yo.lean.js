However, the characters are rather one dimensional and the plot line rather predictable.

If you love her work you will like this book."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"30 something Meghann Dontness is a divorce lawyer in Seattle and doing quite well for herself. Clare Cavenaugh, Meghann's younger half-sister, is a single mom to a five-year old daughter in a small town in the Pacific Northwest who helps her father run a small resort.The girls, coming from a disrupted childhood of a mother who chose Hollywood to raising her children. Meghann who pretty much single-handedly raised Clare still keeps an eye on her from afar but finds some of Clare's choices to be annoying (like falling for the country singer and planning to marry him), but the differences between the girls are all pushed aside when Clare is diagnosed with a brain tumor and Meghan may have the connections needed to make amends in more ways than one...This was a smooth read of two sisters who lives had become far from each others. Hardened Meghann had grown up too fast and drover herself too hard to be the best she could be. Opposite to this is Clare who lives life in the slow lane enjoying each moment. It takes a tragedy to bring these two together to work out things of the past.It's no secret that I enjoy books on friendships and this book is no exception. Written in a way that seems consistent with what little I have read of Kristen Hannah, I found the characters to bewell-developed with life breathed into them.My only complaint is that the plot occasionally felt a bit stretched, a little too much of several things coming into play that made it feel unreal and took away from the read for me, but was not a deal breaker.A good breezy summer read. In the end I closed the final page feeling satisfied and will admit that this was a three kleenex book for me - so do not say you were not warned. :)"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This is a wonderful book about the bond betweeen two sisters and their fight to restore the closeness the had a children.

She has an exceptional nack for bringing her characters alive and relatable."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I was so excited to read this book based on all the 5- and 4-star reviews. What a disappointment. While the story was engaging, the characters were caricatures of real people, and the plot required so much suspension of disbelief I couldn't fully enjoy the pleasant story.I wish someone had indicated in the reviews that this is not serious literature at all. It's not even semi-serious literature. It's just a mildly enjoyable romance novel, with some funny lines and likable characters.Slight spoiler here: The beautiful, and completely unrealistic, tying up of loose ends was too unbelievable to be satisfying, and really, the author should do a little more research if she's going to tackle a medical subject. A patient who just underwent brain surgery is not going to wake up with a headache in a recovery room -- she's going to be in intensive care. These sorts of false details and the far-fetched ending left me feeling like I'd just wasted a good bit of time on this book."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"At first I wasn't sure if I would like this book but after a few chapters was captivated and couldn't put the book down. I am enjoying reading books by this author. Stories share a similar theme but each are different. Easy to read."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This author was recommended to me by the librarian in our town and this was the first book I have read by Kristin Hannah. The storyline fantastically kept my interest but the language was FOUL. In the real world this kind of language is accepted by many people and unacceptable to others, I'm in the latter category. Loved the characters and especially the ending.A couple of times I thought about not finishing the book, during the first half of it, but then I had to find out how it ended. That's a great author that can keep me from closing the cover when I am thinking about it. So good that I gave her another chance, plus my librarian has steered me to great authors before, and my second choice is Between Sisters. Am 50 pages from the end and can highly recommend it to others. Have already made a list of Hannah's books and if another raunchy one shows up I'll know to stop and make another choice. An excellent storyteller is Kristin Hannah."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I happened upon Kristin Hannah's books several months ago and have read several.

Keep pickiing up and reading 20 or so pages and then going back to my housework."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I really haven't read a lot by Kristin Hannah, but what I have read I've enjoyed. A friend of mine read this recently as said it was worth a look so I went on her recommendation. I don't have a history with this writer so I can't compare it to her \\"usual\\" work but can comment on my general reaction to the novel.Focused on two sisters who were horribly neglected in childhood, we met them as adults and explore the paths their lives have taken. The elder sister, Meghann, has pulled herself up by the bootstraps and is a successful family practice attorney in Seattle. Single and financially successful, she is consumed by her work and has very little time for friend and family nor does she have any real desire to spend time with them either. Claire has taken a different course and is managing a 16-acre campground with her father and enjoying small-town life. A single mother (who never married), Claire has surrounded herself with a close group of friends and enjoys a strong bond with both her father and 5-year-old daughter. Both women have been significantly damaged emotionally by their self-absorbed mother. When their mother left for a trip (when they were very young) and never came back for them, the rejection caused wounds that aren't yet healed all these years later. The sisters use to be close but events and old resentments have torn them apart resulting in on a few phone calls a year which usually end in arguments and hurt feelings. The reader gradually comes to understand the choices that were made by all involved and as the novel develops, other characters come into the story which manage to poke and prod at the emotional bruises.I am not usually a person who gets too emotionally wrapped up in what I read but this one really got to me. I have seen a professional review that called this book \\"over-wrought\\" and maybe it is, but if you are ready for a good cry some day, this is the book for you. Characters that I came to care about, hurts I came to understand, and fear I wanted to sooth. It started out slowly in the beginning as a fairly easy beach read and kept building page after page. While some of it was predictable there were enough surprises along the way to keep me interested. By the time I finished, I felt like a rag that had been rung out and I was emotionally exhausted. Maybe it is \\"over-wrought\\" but it still had the type of emotional punch that reminded me of that all-time tear jerker movie - \\"An Affair to Remember\\"."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Although some parts of this book were very predictable and a little sappy, I still enjoyed it. This author always has well developed characters that you find yourself rooting for."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Is it weird that I love the way Kristin Hannah stirs up my emotions? I was starting to worry for a bit that 'Between Sisters' was only going to get me chocked up and a full blown sob fest wasn't in the cards. But of course by the end I was surrounded by soaked kleenex and announcing to my husband \\"Don't look at me, I'm crying, again!\\"I always find it difficult to write reviews for Hannah's books. I enjoy everything about them, the pace, character development, style, and of course her stories that bring my fears to life through the art of writing.Tami Hoag nailed it when she said Hannah \\"touches the deepest, most tender corners of our heart.\\" I couldn't agree more. Hannah wrote a beautiful story about two sisters who've not always understood each other, or the decisions they've each made. But when it comes right down to it they'll be there for each other because ultimately, there is nothing like the bond and love 'Between Sisters'."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Wonderful book! I was captivated in the first chapter. I love any book that I can relate to, laugh at, and cry to. What a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"BETWEEN SISTERS by Kristin HannahFebruary 9, 2008Rating 4/5 starsThis was my first book by Kristin Hannah and I loved it! I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the story and how fast I was able to get through it.Meghann Dontess is a high-powered divorce lawyer and is obviously very successful based on where she lives and how she lives. She goes from man to man, never seeing anyone for very long, avoiding commitments. Her life is empty. Part of Meghann's problem is a guilt that she's lived with for most of her life. She and her younger sister Claire Cavenaugh were separated when Meghann decided to leave Claire with Claire's biological father. Their mother rarely was around to take care of them, and in order to save themselves, Meghann had gone in search of Claire's biological father, who promptly took them in. But Meghann and Claire's father clashed, and so Meghann ran away, knowing she was leaving Claire in responsible hands. But since that parting, the two sisters have grown apart, and every time they do talk on the phone, they fight. Meghann actually took care of Claire as a mother would a daughter, because their own mother was not responsible enough or was ever there to take care of them herself. Being an actress was much more important to their mother.Now, Meghann and Claire are reunited. Claire has decided to marry a man that she had just recently met, and Meghann feels it's her responsibility to steer Claire in the right direction. Meghann had been out of Claire's life for the past 27 years, but now she feels it's time to do the right thing. Claire, however, doesn't want her older sister meddling. All she wants is Meghann's blessing.When everything seemed to be falling into place, something happens that may bring short the sisters' new found friendship. I don't want to reveal what happens, but the story becomes a near tragedy by the end of the book, and will have the reader in tears.In a subplot, Meghann meets a man while visiting Claire and helping her get ready for the big wedding. He's a mystery at first, until the reader and the characters in the story realize who he is, the brother of one of Claire's best friends. His story is tragic and ties in with Claire's, as it will be revealed in the last half of the story. Meghann may have finally found the man of her dreams, but she is afraid to go that extra step. Commitment had never been her strong point, and she is afraid she may get hurt again.BETWEEN SISTERS was a highly enjoyable piece of women's fiction. Good writing style, characters who were believable, and I was very interested to know how things were resolved at the end. I will definitely be reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"What a great book! The story of Meg and Claire will evoke every emotion you can muster up...anger, misunderstanding, happiness, sadness, joy...I could go on and on. I don't even need to describe the story line, all you need to know is that if you like a heartwarming story...this is the book for you. Kristin Hannah has done it again."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Author Hannah sets up an intriguing dilemma, one that will be familiar to many readers. Two sisters strike out in different directions, then come together again at a critical point in their lives. WIll they reconcile? That's what keeps the pages turning. But I believe the deeper question is: Why should they feel guilty if they don't?The novel begins with big sister Meaghan, a hotshot divorce lawyer, being challenged by her highly-paid therapist. She's almost a stereotype: wealthy and successful with an unsatisfying, empty personal life. Coincidentally Claire, the younger sister, has just become engaged to a country singer. Naturally Meaghan's first thought is not to congratulate the bride, but to offer help with the pre-nuptial agreement!Hannah begins by emphasizing the contrast between the sisters. Claire, a party-girl who dropped out of college, versus Meaghan who got a law degree. Claire, simple in the country; Meaghan, sophisticated in the city. Stereotypically, we're supposed to feel sympathy for Claire and resent Meaghan's heavy-handed intrusions.Meaghan feels guilty about losing touch with Claire, but it's hard to see why. As children, left alone by a self-centered mother who stumbled into a starring television role, Meaghan saved Claire from a foster home with Social Services. It was Meaghan who ended up homeless, who put herself through college and law school. In the novel, I believe the Meaghan character was more well-rounded and more interesting, with contradictions that led to questions.Following a bizarre episode in a courtroom, Meaghan finds herself with time on her hands. She visits Claire and volunteers to help with the wedding. Personally, I think attending a bridal shower with *games* is going beyond sisterly devotion, entering the realm of masochism -- a funny and sad scene, marred only by wondering why an experienced sophisticate like Meaghan wouldn't ask ahead of time about dress code.After that the book becomes predictable. I don't want to give away the ending -- which most readers will figure out somewhere early in the book -- but by a series of coincidences, everyone ends up helping everyone else. A frog...er, bum...turns out to be a prince. And Meaghan becomes transformed. Pre-nup? No way!Of course this book has to follow genre conventions, but I wish we had been exposed to a more complex sisterly relationship (see The Interpreter by Kim for an excellent recent example). Sure, I kept turning the pages, but it was like finishing up a gooey dessert. By the end I was ready for a return to meat and potatoes.And what's so unromantic about a pre-nuptial agreement? Given the career directions of some of the characters, I bet everybody will eventually wish they'd had one!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Between Sisters by Kristin Hannah, is another heartwarming story by this amazing author. I have read all of Hannah's books, and each and every one of her books is endearing and so filled with life's realities. Hannah is able to draw the reader directly into the story and one just does not want to put her books down until the every end! The reader is relating to all the characters by feeling all of their emotions and seeing their world perfectly due to the artistry of Hannah's words.I love Hannah's books, as they are so full of hope and love, even through the challenges that life presents each and every one of us. There is nothing stronger than love and Hannah portrays that so very well in all of her books. A crisis surely pulls a family together, where the love of one another is able to overcome even the strongest challenge.Hannah portrays that so well with her latest book on the bond of two sisters, broken apart by life, yet love pulls them and those around them closer together. Love heals, as Hannah so clearly shows. Sisters torn apart by family forces yet brought together again though their love of one another.Hannah's books are not only wonderful stories, but she also weaves a message throughout her books that just fills one with hope.I loved this book and highly recommend it anyone! You will not be disappointed! Five stars does not do this book justice!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This is one of the most outstanding books that I have ever read! It has all the elements of a book that can't be put down nor wait until the next chapter. I listened to it in audio form and even carried the cassette player in my pocket while doing chores! That's how good it was. Didn't want to miss a single line. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book that has love, family, mystery, challenges, good and bad relationships, healing old wounds and appreciation of people that touch your lives. You won't be able to put this one down!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed BETWEEN SISTERS, but that doesn't surprise me, for Hannah always delivers a well-written, emotional story about relationships and situations that most women face sometime in their lives. Women's fiction is my favorite genre (or sub-genre, that's an ongoing debate) and there are a number of authors who are at the top of my list TBR. Hannah is one of them. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Kristin Hannah always delivers. Between Sisters has all the things I love in a book - rich, believable characters, individuals who must face their fears and weaknesses in order to grow, external challenges, friends, romance, and a great plot.

WOW!!! What a great story. I have never read a book that literally moved me to the point of tears, as \\"Between Sisters\\" did.(Truth be told, I was sobbing like a baby).I was so impressed with this book, I ran out & purchased many of her other titles. She is now on my list of favorite authors & I eagerly await her new releases.\\"Between Sisters\\" is one of her best."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"Wow, what a great book!! This was my first Kristin Hannah novel and definitely won't be my last! I laughed with these characters, I cried with them and I also rejoiced with them. I'm amazed at Hannah's ability to make you to feel what her characters are feeling. In fact, I really feel like I know them personally now and I'm sad that the story is over. This book was a fun read and a fast page turner. I really didn't want to stop reading once I started. Read this book!!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - all the characters were interesting,although their inability to figure out the common people in their lives until the end was frustrating.I made the mistake of reading the editors review while I was in the middle of this book so I knew everything that was going to happen. I still found it difficult to put down, however. I was so caught up in the characters that I found myself laughing, crying, frustrated, disappointed and happy at various points.My only disappointment was the ending - she wrapped up the sisters story well but left me wanting to know a lot more about the other key relationships and how they got to where they were in the final chapter. I hope Kristin Hannah develops these characters in a future book."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"The book was well written, as are most Kristin Hannah books. It held my interest although it was easy to figure out where the entire story was going."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"As with all of Kristin Hannah books, once you start you just can't put it down.

The supporting characters also add o the depth of the story.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I had the hard covered copy of Between Sisters on my bookshelf since it had first been published. Knowing I couldn't carry a book of that weight back and forth on the train every day, I recently ordered a paperback in hopes that it would entice me to finally read this book. After all, I hadn't read a Kristin Hannah novel in a long time and I had once considered her to be one of my absolute favorite authors.Apparently it was about time! Immediately I felt swept up into the world of the Pacific Northwest, as so often happens when I read Hannah's novels. The cabins and camp ground, despite the fact that I practically hate the outdoors, seemed so inviting, and the way in which Hannah describes the setting, you can almost imagine wanting to visit. The setting, which takes on such a prominent role in the beginning of the book, fades as other characters and more serious issues come to be in the story. But what always drew me to Hannah's novels, and this one is no different, is the element of reality. The settings are so simple and inviting, the characters are flawed in such ways that make them feel real to the reader. The characters have flaws, but the flaws are created in a way that makes you feel sympathy for or appreciation of the character, not in a way that would make you hate the character for being so incredibly obnoxious. Trust me; I've seen so many authors try to do this and they end up stepping over the line and the character suffers. Hannah though, yet again, creates characters that are likable, and even more so, respectable.I also love how Hannah's novels flow. I've done my fair share of heavy reading in my life, but while the hardcover of Between Sisters seemed so daunting, I breezed through the paperback in just over a week. And as I read, I remembered how much I appreciated her use of language and her simplicity. It is much appreciated in a time when the plots of so many other books seem incredibly over-dramatized and their characters fake and uninspired.Between Sisters, while definitely a very worthwhile read, is not my favorite book by Kristen Hannah, for I still love and remember On Mystic Lake like no other. I have also read Angel Falls, which I loved, and Summer Island, Distant Shores and Comfort and Joy, which were good, but not nearly as great as the others. Between Sisters, however, has definitely gotten me excited to read what novels of hers that I've missed over the years."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"What a wonderful story. This books poignant characters kept me interested. I found myself not wanting to put the book down. The writing is spectacular. It made me chuckle at times as well as cry.The characters have a chance at redemption in life and that is all we ever need. What a great reminder this book is. It is never too late."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I thank Kristin Hannah for a wonderful book! She may just become my favorite author!

Will be reading more Kristin Hannah soon :)"},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"I found the story of these two sisters very touching and moving. I would love to read more by this author for sure."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This heartwarming tale of two sisters, separated over time by the choices they had made in their childhood, will warm your heart. Meg and Claire, two sisters born to a negligent and selfish mother but with different fathers, have a very close bond until fate steps in and tears them apart. When the book begins, many years have passed, and both have gone on to lead their own lives, but think often with regret of the events that separated them. Each woman feels guilty for the choices she made, and blames herself for the separation. The rest of the book details their struggles to come together again and resolve the issues that separated them to begin with, and to ultimately find happiness.I don't know if this review does the book justice. It is definitely my favorite of the four books I have read by Hannah, and marks a departure from the storyline she usually follows. Even if you are not sure whether this book is for you, pick up a copy. It remains one of my favorite reads of 2003."},{"Title":"Between Sisters","review":"This is the best book I've read in a long, long time. It brought out every emotion in me.

Anytime a friend or relative has anxiety issues, I get them a book and recommend Recovery. It was a lifesaver for our family."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"In most respects this book and it's author, Abraham Low, were decades ahead of their time. Although this particular book was not published until 1950, Low was advancing the methods described in it before he founded Recovery, Inc. (now Recovery International, but generally referred to simply as Recovery) in 1937; a network of mutual-support groups for former mental patients. The technique of \\"spotting\\" thoughts and behaviors in this book that lead to \\"temper\\" (behavior resulting from emotions like resentment, impatience, indignation, disgust, hatred, shame, inadequacy, hopelessness and despair) are comparable toAaron T. Beck's Cognitive TherapyandAlbert Ellis' Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy.In other respects, this book is in lockstep with the year it was published. Readers may have difficulty relating to discussions about the thrill of automobiling at speeds of 50 miles per hour, and new \\"mechanical conveniences\\" like refrigeration, electricity and gasoline. Many of the examples and stories in this book deal with traditional nuclear family themes; with the man as the head of the household and his wife playing a subservient role. It is important to remember that this book is going on sixty years old, and that for its time, its ideas, particularly that mental patients were not hopeless and could recover, were very progressive.It's difficult to resist comparing Recovery withAlcoholics Anonymous(AA) as they were founded independently within just two years of each other and both are voluntary organizations for of people with similar illnesses aiding each other in a common purpose. The million dollar question: why are there only a few hundred Recovery meetings worldwide, while there are over 110,000 AA meetings?There are remarkable similarities between the two programs. Both of them ask members to preserve anonymity, to overcome resentments, to place a premium on creating peace and serenity, to defer gratification for the sake of long-term goals. Both programs see self-centeredness as a cause of illness, encourage discursive thinking and discourage mixing politics with recovery. The only real incompatibility is the method suggested for changing behavior. In AA members surrender to or cooperate with the will of their Higher Power, whereas in Recovery members are expected to follow direction of their physician and \\"command their muscles\\" to behave rightly. In Recovery language, \\"muscles train the brain\\" (a sort of layperson's phrase for a kind ofHebbian learning), in this way, members slowly learn to behave correctly. In each case the result is the same, members slowly learn new habits; one through a spiritual method and another through a secular method.According to the peer-reviewed literature (see specifically Marc Galanter's research on Recovery and Christine Timko's work on AA) they are both effective programs for dealing with the problems members present with, so the deficiency is not the methods.Abraham Low was born in Poland and educated in Austria at the University of Vienna, and while his command of English was solid when he wrote this book, reading some of his earlier works (such hasManage Your Fears Manage Your AngerorThe Techniques of Self-help in Psychiatric After-care) it is obvious that English was not his first language. More than that, it's difficult to tell if he meant this book for Recovery members or if it was written more for an audience of other physicians or professionals interested in the organization. It is detailed and encyclopedic, but it is not warm or inspiring. Low was very good at communicating tactfully and technically, but his writing lacked the charisma of someone like AA's founder, Bill Wilson.Another possibility is that the demographic Recovery deals with, people with serious mental illness, is not as good of fit for being treated in self-help groups as are alcoholics. Frequent meetings may be more of a benefit to alcoholics who are always in danger of a relapse than people gradually trying to improve themselves. AA, however, describes people in their program as changing slowly over a period of time. The third most popular twelve-step group, Al-Anon, treats co-dependency. It would seem that self-help groups are useful for helping people gradually recover from a variety of chronic problems.Recovery's program, as outlined in this book, relies heavily on a physician overseeing Recovery members and working closely with Recovery groups. Low played this role until 1952 when he suggested that Recovery become more of a stand-alone mutual-support organization. AA's program never relied on professional help in the same manner. Still, other programs for people with mental illness that assiduously follow AA's model (such asEmotions Anonymous,Neurotics Anonymousand GROW) each, like Recovery, have yet to move out of obscurity in to the mainstream.With several organizations facilitating support groups for people with mental illness (to the list above you can add the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance) it could be there is a significant factor of confusion both for individuals looking for a group and for mental health professional referring members to such a group."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"This is a terrific book in good shape.

I found RECOVERY through Alchoholics Ananymous, because I was not an alchoholic, but had reached a point where I could not sleep more than an hour a day and I found alchohol provided temporary relief but was afraid of becoming alchoholic. After reading this book and attending 6 months of meetings, the symptoms slowly disappeared and I was able to use the tools explained in the book to regulate my thoughts and as a result, regulate my feelings. This book is practical and very useful on an ongoing basis. I strongly recommend it.sincerely,michael"},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"This is THE book on mental health for any kind of disorder from compulsive eating to schizophrenia. Tens of thousands of people have been helped by this book. I already have been helped greatly. Self-disscipline is the only answer. And I think we all know this at some level. There is no easy way to happiness. The paradox is that we have to go through misery in order to be happy. I have written reviews on meditation for Amazon. And I do feel that this is what really makes us into warm human beings. But I did confer with practioners who have practiced for over 30 years. And in pathological conditions (severe depression, obsession-compulsion, eating disorders, and similar problems including schizophrenia) - many people need a little more. This also includes anxiety disorders which so many of us suffer from. Alcoholics Anonymous costs nothing for the treatment of alcoholism. And Recovery, Inc. costs a recommended donation of $2 for a 2-hour meeting. A.A. works despite the technocrats and their twisted statistics. The Mad Scientists. And Recovery, Inc. has been helping people all over the world for mental problems. And this is their Bible just as &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; or the Big Blue Book is the Bible of A.A. Dr. Low had created a system of cognitive behavioral therapy that works! Then came the &quot;new breed&quot; of healers who promised us self-esteem in ten weeks or 3 minutes a day. They ignored Low (ripped him off actually) and attacked A.A. They are not a &quot;well-meaning&quot; breed of lion tamers. In this book, you will learn about &quot;The Courage to Make Mistakes&quot;. You will find that the first goal in mental health is to shoot for being average. Whether you think you are Napolean or &quot;exceptional&quot;, you can afford to be average according to Dr. Low. This was all stated way before Drs. Ellis and Beck decided they were the new scientists of mental health. Dr. Low created the cognitive-behavioralapproach way before these gentlemen. The only difference is that his approach works. Please refer to &quot;recovery-inc.com&quot; on the net. A diagnosis from a qualified physician comes first in Low's method. Then you will be allowed to attend meetings. Yes, you can leave early. That is part of recovery. &quot;Spotting&quot; when you are beating yourself up with thoughts. And you &quot;encourage&quot; yourself for your progress. The people seem very intelligent and kind. Both my psychiatrist and therapist are ga-ga about Recovery, Inc. They love it and recommended it to me. The changes are swift and lasting. But not in 10 weeks or 3 minutes. It's very much of a shame that A.A. and Recovery Inc., which originated in the thirties when people were not looking for a &quot;quick fix&quot;, are now being over-looked by the new intelligensia. Many have been hurt by these pseudo-intellectuals from the sixties. Dr. Low emphasizes that we go into a &quot;DANGER&quot; alert kind of status all the time. Many need to change this to &quot;DISTRESSING&quot;. As he states in the book, sometimes a headache is just a headache and not a brain tumor! I am so grateful to Recovery, Inc. and it's kind members. Along with A.A. and my Insight Meditation course (also available from Amazon.com), I don't feel that I will ever be truly lacking in the ability to love others and to be loved in return. Thank you."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"This book is for those who desire self-help using a cognitive method. Dr. Low was an unrecognized pioneer in the mental health field; he has been credited by his patients with saving many lives. The book is extremely practical. It may encourage readers to participate in a self-help organization founded in 1937 which has in the intervening years become international in scope. One may choose portions of the book that are applicable. After having read the book more than 25 years ago and consulting it as a resource, I recommend it for those suffering from mental/emotional afflictions for whom self-help is appropriate. Recovery does not replace a professional, but rather works with him/her."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"I attended my first group meeting when Treasure Rice was president when there were only 3 people attending. We met every week at the home of one of the members. I had a fear of cancer. Went from one doctor to another. In 1970 my worst fear came true. I had melanoma (skin cancer) 2% of the population had it. I had a skin graft and was cured. Ten years ago I had a mastectomy and was able to get through that through my Recovery training. I also had a complete hysterectomy four years ago and now have osteoporosis. Because this book stresses that the WILL is what gets you through ANY situation and it shows you how to get through every day, sometimes 1 hour at a time or 1 minute at a time. It is the fear that seems overwhelming. I learned that most of the things in life are trivialities and that through my will which instructs me to face my fear and that I can bear the discomfort. I now have peace of mind in my life. I am a retired legal secretary and am busy every day. I volunteer at the local theatre and usher so I get to see the shows. I also volunteer at the Senior Center in the exercise room and I go to the Spa for water exercises. I have used this book and its teachings in raising my children (daughter 49, son 46) who have used it in their lives. One may feel helpless but you are not hopeless. Anything is possible. I keep a positive attitude and always have a sense of humor. This book covers everything in one's life and shows you step by step how to handle any situation that you are experiencing. I highly recommmend reading this book and putting its method into practice. Our group started in Detroit, Michigan around 1953. It has become my philsophy of life"},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"This is the best available therapy for depression, bipolar depression, panic attacks, and related disorders. Either alone, or with psychotropic medications, this group therapy succeeds where individual therapy fails and makes the patient more amenable to individual therapy, as not sabotaging mental health is a major focus. This is precisely the method used in cognitive therapy, effective since introduced widely in the 1980s, but not affordable by most of the population.The Recovery method is still going strong after all these years."},{"Title":"Mental health through will-training: A system of self-help in psychotherapy as practiced by Recovery, Incorporated","review":"I received an e-mail from a lady who told me that rational-emotive therapy saved her relationship and maybe even her life! And I believe her. But some of us need more heavy &quot;Head Work&quot; I believe. Real &quot;Trench Warfare&quot;. Dr. Low teaches you cognitive-behavioral therapy in this book. But he doesn't leave it there. Daily readings. And ONE TWO-HOUR MEETING A WEEK WITH OTHER NUT CASES! Why am I screaming? Because it is easy to sit at your computer and be mean. But you can't getaway with this in real life. I read most of Low's book after my first meeting. I felt excruciating anxiety for 4 days BEFORE THE MEETING! I'm screaming again, right? Sorry. And my reading didn't really DIG IN until I got to the meeting. You say something and then everybody else contributes and then these cognitive techniques are really cut into your brain. This is the main text. So it is one-third of the program. The other two parts are daily application and one meeting a week. It seems that people with psychological problems make TREMENDOUS demands on themselves. This book will re-wire your brain. And that may take awhile. But remember this. According to Dr. Low, when you cut a &quot;temper&quot; sequence of working yourself up into anxiety and anger or down into depression, you will be automatically reducing those HIGHER STRESSORS which you will have to confront. Let's make it simple. Asking a question of somebody on the street may cause incredible anxiety. Let's say 99. But if you &quot;spot&quot; this scenerio and replace it with realistic thoughts (&quot;I'm not doing anything wrong&quot;) and endorse yourself (&quot;I did just fine&quot;) - this process will reduce the the anxiety of public speaking, say, from 1,000 to 859. Good deal, huh? As Low says, &quot;Strike at the Weakest Link&quot;. If your dog dies and you have a BIG DEPRESSION of 876, let us say, and you practice this program and your spouse dies, you might only get hit with a 700! Whereas, before, it might have been 7,000, given you a stroke, and put you in a hospital. Do buy the book. I could philosophize about all the chapters (Like &quot;The Courage to Make Mistakes&quot;, chapter 30), but I think you now understand the whole purpose of the text. If you don't want to wait, then find out where the closest Recovery, Inc. Meeting is (they are worldwide for those of you in Guam), take 5 minutes, run in, and buy a copy.

It briefly introduces choice under uncertainty, risk aversion, portfolio optimization problems, market efficiency hypothesis, and equilibrium of asset markets. In addition, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) are presented. It brings the most exciting part of academic evolution of financial economics in the last three decades to the pubic with modest knowledge of mathematics. It also shows the weakness of these theories. Very self-contained and readable. However, if you want to pursue a ground understanding of these theories, you should go further."},{"Title":"The Economics of Financial Markets","review":"The intention behind this book was to provide a solid introduction and overview of financial economics and financial institutions. The authors suceed brilliantly in those goals. Most people with limited training in economics and mathematics should be able to understand the book (so, for example, this book would be great for early undergraduates or MBA students who have not been exposed to finance or economics).I think there is enough information in this book to be of some use to even people who have more advanced training. Why? This book gives a good overview of both the theoretical (deductive proofs) and empirical (econometric) research that has been done on various topics (relatively up to date). The book tries to give a balanced view of the merits or problematics of any particular theory in financial economics.This book deserves a 5 star rating rather than a 4 star one because for what it was intended to be -- a solid introduction and overview -- it does a superb job. It would be unfair to judge any book by some unintended higher standard when it does a great job at doing what it intended to do. Bottom line: If you need a good introduction to financial economics, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Economics of Financial Markets","review":"As a law student with an econ degree, I was looking for a way to review concepts I had learned in a financial economics course without having to lug around Copeland and Weston. I found this book covered all the concepts I was looking for at a deep enough level and with enough math to keep me satisfied. This book was written for MBA's or advanced undergradute business majors, but to that list I would also include two more groups: (1) those with a background in econ or math that wish to review concepts learned long (or not so long) ago, and (2) anyone wishing to gain a deeper understanding of financial markets through applying a more rigorous, scientific approch.This book teaches basic financial principles like the risk-return relationship, the CAPM, efficient market hypothesis, and option pricing.

Readers will become involved in the story of Portor's struggle with his compulsive habitual sexual endeavors and potentially damaging lack of loyalty to his nation's military as he rediscovers the path of God he once knew to rejuvenate and fall no less than reincarnate his wounded soul. Storm Tossed is very highly recommended to students of human sexuality, as well as those who are struggling with their own addictions (particular sexual additions), as an inspirational and engaging read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Storm Tossed: How a U.S. Serviceman Won the Battle of Sex Addiction","review":"Storm Tossed tells the story of how one man fell into a lifestyle of sexual sin and ultimately found redemption through the work of Christ. Taking on the pseudonym Jake Porter, the author tells how his problems began with pornographic magazines in his youth and rejection by girls in high school and college. He led himself to believe that because God wasn't providing him with a wife, he was forced to fulfill his sexual desires in other ways.So Jake Porter joined the Navy and \\"saw the world.\\" Along the way he became addicted to prostitutes, even admitting at times that he didn't even want the women, but he was compelled to be with them anyway. At first he would ask God for forgiveness after an encounter, but eventually he gave up. He reached many points of empty depression, and though he desired to commit suicide, he could never bring himself to do it. The final chapters tell of how honesty and faith brought him to the point of claiming victory over his addiction. The Epilogue provides some practical tips for wives whose husbands who are heavily addicted, as well as for men.My main criticism about Storm Tossed is all of the secondary characters seem flat. This is probably due to the story being filtered through the theme of sexual addiction. The result is that very little is known about the personalities of the other characters, even the author's wife. For the most part, all the reader learns is how someone either corrupts or aids Jake, or simply helps to move the story along.Apart from the criticism, Storm Tossed is an intriguing read. Jake Porter's story shows the devastation sexual sin can cause in a man's life as well as the redemption that can be found in submitting one's life to Christ."},{"Title":"Cool Careers for Girls as Crime Solvers","review":"This book has 10 examples of jobs that involve some form of criminal forensics: Firearms Examiner, Latent Fingerprint Examiner, Forensic Anthropologist, Forensic Microscopist, Investigator-Insurance Fraud, Forensic Pathologist, Bloodstain Pattern Analyst, Police Detective/Forensic Artist, Computer Forensic Specialist and Forensic Science Lab Director. EACH career path has a real female example and how she got into her current job. It also has a \\"career checklist..

An example is You'll like bloodstain pattern analysis if you \\"love to sovle puzzles, are good at math and physics...have a strong stomach, can face the worst human beings do to one another...like to teach.\\" I went through this book within a few hours. I felt as though I had interviewed each of these women about their careers without doing the leg work. It also gave salary information, experience and educational requirements. It is a great book to begin your research into a career in crime solving without becoming a police woman. It also has web references for more in depth information.

Best known for his works about Jeeves and Wooster, his stories that do not focus on these famous characters are just as entertaining - if not more so. \\"If I Were You\\" is a laugh-out-loud funny tale of two men having been switched at birth and trying to figure out if amends can be made almost thirty years later.Tony Droitwich, the Earl of Droitwich, leads a happy-go-lucky existence and has just proposed to a rich young woman who will help shore up the Droitwich foundation. His Aunt Lydia and Uncle Herbert couldn't be more pleased. If only it wasn't for Tony's former nanny, Ma Price, and her impudent son Syd; for Syd is an annoying socialist barber in the making, and Nannie Price threatens to tell everyone the truth about the two boys - that Syd is the true Earl of Droitwich and that Tony is her son. Pressed against a wall, the family decides to give Syd a try, hoping to make the prospect of being an earl so hateful to him that he will give up his claim. Tony, meanwhile, fills in at Syd's post in the barber shop and finds himself liking the simpler life. Will things work out for the happiness of both parties?\\"If I Were You\\" is a fast-paced and enjoyable read. Just when it seems that all dastardly plots have been achieved, Wodehouse springs a new twist at the reader.

This is an oversized, paperback, large-print edition from the oddly-named publisher, International Polygonics (IPL). I don't think a smaller font version exists in paperback. In the preface D.R. Benson says that If I Were You makes use of a bit of plot from W.S. Gilbert (as in Gilbert and Sullivan), and the sense of theatre runs throughout.

It's about teenage love and basketball - 2 topics that don't interest me in particular, yet it grabs you by the ears and hurtles you right to the end of the book. Upon reaching the end, i truly could have gone right back to the beginning and started again - in fact, I probably would have, but i had to proceed to The Book of Reuben! A hugely under-read author - she is not, as far as I am aware, published in the UK, which is completely unfathomable.

This isn't a simple 'boy-meets-girl high school romance coming-of-age' book... Sam and Deanie are just two of the foils Ms. King uses to push our buttons while continuing her incredible Nodd's Ridge saga."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"This was one of the best books I've read. The characters are real, the emotions they evoke tear at your heart. The sex is incredible - I have not looked at chains or body piercing without a smile since! This is a book every modern mother should read (for herself and her angst with her teens). This book hooked me into the characters I was so happy to pursue in The Book of Reuben and Pearl. Looking for more"},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Love this book. Read it years ago and found the character voices astonishing. I don't know how an older woman got the voices of teenagers, their attitudes, their problems so right. Can't recommend highly enough. Difficult subject matter, beautifully handled."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"One of my all-time favorites that I recommend to people all the time. I read this back in 1994...it was an unexpected find and the first book I'd ever read of Tabitha King's. Other must reads by Tabitha King are The Book of Reuben and Pearl. I wish I could read them for the first time again."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Tabitha King's previous (and sadly, subsequent) novels only hinted at the wealth of insight and evocation that has made One on One among my favorite books. The characters are fully developed and believable; the events in which they are caught up and/or instigate come across as natural outcomes of their nature and their milieu. And in Deanie, the female protagonist, King has created one of the most memorable and realistic adolescents in fiction, one I want to spend more time with and watch come of age."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Sam is a basketball hero. He is from a small Maine town, and he dominates his high school team. After winning the championship, he makes a statement that the next year it will be not only the boys' team but also the girls' team bringing home a trophy. It is a bold statement, although the girls' team is also very good, but Sam is determined to make it a reality.The key element in Sam's plan is Deanie, most often called The Mutant by the student body. She shaves her head, has tattoos, and wears chains through the rings in her face. Despite her weird appearance and antisocial behavior, Deanie is a powerhouse on the basketball court and pushes her team to win.Sam finds himself intrigued by Deanie, especially by the fact that she seems to hate his guts and repels any advances by him. He continues to try to find ways to become her friend.When Deanie does start to let Sam into her life, though, he finds himself horrified by what he sees. He begins to wonder if his affection and attention will be enough to pull her out of her bad situation.I liked Sam's family. They were down-to-earth and very solid, despite their problems. I also liked seeing Deanie's evolution from the beginning of the book to the end, when she had things much more together.It was hard for me to understand, though, why Sam was so attracted to Deanie and why he continued to pursue her after she continually repelled his advances. It's hard to believe any high-school boy would be that persistent in the face of so much rejection."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"\\"One on One\\" tells the coming-of-age story of two unique teens. Sam Styles is a popular basketball captain, aiming for the championships, who also has his own unpopular ethical code amongst his peers. Deenie Gauthier is a \\"townie\\" who is also a basketball star, but whose poverty and attitude have made her an outsider. Sam becomes intrigued by her, and they begin a mercurial relationship which eventually becomes sexual. The contrast between Sam's close-knit family is made more poignant when compared to Deanie's abusive homelife. But Sam has his own scars, and though the two are made for each other, their union will not be an easy one.Only two things bothered me. Every few pages we get yet another description of Deanie's appearance. The reader \\"gets\\" that she's unusual looking but still beautiful without her skin being compared to a narcissus petal or fine wood constantly. If the reader doesn't like the character or feel sympathy, they'd have put the book down by now. The other was that there were an excessive amount of sex scenes. I'm not a prude, but it got a bit tiresome; there are only so many ways you can describe certain sexual acts that teens perform. I would rather have had more basketball scenes - and I'm not a jock."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Under weird circumstances, I somehow i got this book. After two days of reading it I am so glad I found it. As someone who has been through the whole &quot;high school&quot; experience, it makes me look back about what I could have changed and what I miss so much about it. Kings analytical prose is so vivid in detail that the characters are easy to identify with, including all the subtles, idiosyncrasies and sexual innuedo it makes readers feel what the characters are going through.

One On One is the best book I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I've read it 3 times, and each time I like it even more. I love Tabitha King's style."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Until two days ago, I never knew Stephen King's wife was a published author. Now, after losing most of my sleep last night because of her, I can't understand why she isn't at least as famous a writer as her husband!I was given this book Tuesday afternoon by a friend who knows my taste in books. It's the only book she's ever told me I really _should_ read in all the time I've known her. I didn't start it until bedtime Wednesday, and finished it Thursday afternoon despite my washing machine going out, several calls from clients, my son having playmates over all day, a doctor's appointment, and lunch out.WOW.I never wanted it to end even though I wanted Deanie's ordeal to be over with as soon as possible.Tabitha King's writing style is almost poetic in its descriptions of feelings and places and situations. Her dialogue is not bogged down by too many adjectives or adverbs, and she knows her characters inside out from the very beginning. These characters aren't just developed -- they spring to life fully formed nearly from the instant we meet them, with all of their baggage properly influential in their decisions, their attitudes, and even in their nicknames. We meet them from a distance, almost like a new kid at school who will become increasingly intimate with them and their close friends and family members. As we learn each fact that constitutes their baggage, we nod and agree that yes, we really should have known that from the way the character acted or reacted.The author uses present tense throughout the story. I usually find present tense novels awkward, but not in this book. The present tense lets us find out more about Deanie and Sam as they learn more about each other. We are right there with them, going through the hormonal hells and peer pressure battles just like they are. We feel how important the state championship is. We don't blame Deanie for her need of chemical solace; we admire Sam's restraint each time he wants to, but does not, break his training. We become a little annoyed with his righteousness, but we shake our heads and acknowledge that that's just Sam.Evil characters are not pure evil, except for two which could easily fit into one of Stephen King's horror stories as unearthly bad-guy archetypes: J.C. and Tony.We want to take Deannie's chains and swing them at Tony with all our might, and we want to put J.C.'s cigarettes (and joints) out on his exposed skin. Our stomachs roil with disgust and Deanie's mother. We want to hug and love the awkward, shy, ugly, unlovable Deanie and we want Sam to find a nice girl with whom he can achieve that physical relase sought be every seventeen-year-old boy. When we read the last page we want to know more about these brave survivors. We don't want to leave them so young and vulnerable, even though we recognize their incredible resilience.I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone who remembers high school, who might not have fit in, who fit in almost too well, who ever felt a surprising pang of longing or ache for something or someone so unlike themselves.This incredible story alerts us to the fact that all the perfect jocks and cheerleaders don't lead perfect lives and don't usually warrant the envy of the faceless multitudes on the sidelines. The story is raw and painful. It is a release. It is a treasure.Anyone who reads it will always remember it. I have not been so profoundly struck by any book in memory."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"I've read this book so many times I've lost count. I go back to it about once every six months as I would go back to look at a yearbook. I recall the small incidents (such as the sexual prank that opens the novel), the emotions (like Deanie's 'second' sexual awakening) and the people (especially Sam and Deanie 'The Mutant')with such a vivid recollection that I'm swept right back into their world as I turn to page two. Tabitha King has created a masterpiece that has affected me in such a deep way that I cannot even fathom. Seeing that it is out of print is disheartening. I would dearly love a copy. MESSAGE TO PUBLISHER: PLEASE REPRINT! Not only do I want a copy of my own but I'd like the rest of the world in on the secret...

I can think of no other way to get Tabitha King to write a second piece to this tale. I am a big reader and love series books. After reading all of Jennifer Weiner's books last month I was looking for someone else, on her website or a fansite of Jennifer's it mentioned Pearl. I went to the library and picked up a copy. Read it immediately and loved it instantly. I told my husband that Tabitha King writes like her husband, always leaving you with wanting more. I went to the trusty WWW and found that there was a whole series to be read and I happened upon them in the middle with Pearl. After work I was at the library picking up the remainder of the series. I didn't read them in order, you don't have to, they work well independently. One on One was the last for me to pick up. I read it in no time and lost much sleep because of it. I took it to work with me and was HAPPY to be in a 1 hour traffic jam so I could have more time to read it. I was captivated by Sam and Deanie, and hungry to know more about Pearl and Reuben. I did something I have never done. I did't put it down. Upon finishing it I started back on the first page again. She writes sex scenes like they should be written, raw, real, and not perfect. I want more from her...that is why you have to buy this book. Hopefully she will see there is a surge in her sales and decide to feed her fans with MORE.

About seven years ago, I was browsing through the S. Kings at the library looking for something that I hadn't read fifteen times when I ran across One on One completely by accident. Because the particular S. King that I was looking for wasn't on the shelf, I decided to &quot;broaden my horizons&quot; and take it for a &quot;test drive,&quot; and what a decision that was! I couldn't put it down - I read it cover to cover twice, then bought my own copy. I've since ventured into Tabby's other offerings and they're equally wonderful, but One on One will always be my favorite read - and my favorite inspiration."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Tabitha King has a wonderful talent with bending the written word in such a way that it captivates the reader to the point of not being able to put the book down until the very last page. Unfortunately, though I am a great fan of Stephen King, Tabitha gets very little of the spotlight and I am disappointed that none of her books are available to buy as new books."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"In my opinion, Tabitha King's forte is creating characters that are real enough to make you &quot;wonder what they're doing now&quot; years after you finish the book. They are multi-dimensional people who will make you alternately want to hug them, yell at them, cheer for them or slap them, but you always care. ONE ON ONE was the first Tabitha King novel I read, then I subsequently purchased all her books and discovered that ONE ON ONE is the third book to feature Sam and his family, and I also loved THE BOOK OF RUEBEN and PEARL. I've been a Stephen King fan for years, so now my bookshelves are filled with even more King books!"},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"Most people don't know that Tabitha King, wife of uber-author Stephen King, is also an extremely talented writer. I stumbled upon Tabitha's novels while searching the library shelves for something of her husband's--since that fortuitous discover I've read all of the lesser-known King's novels and been completely entertained. In a style that differs totally from her husband's macabre touch, Tabitha seems to focus on character developing, creating real people that live in your mind for years after your read her stories. (I'm a HUGE Stephen King fan, having read everything he's ever written with the exception of a few magazine articles, but I can't say that his characters necessarily stick with me the same way as Tabitha's do.)In &quot;One on One,&quot; the first Tabitha King novel I read, by the way, teenage jock Sam finds himself mysteriously attracted to, and ultimately sexually involved with, weird, gothic Deanie. A member of a very dysfunctional family, Deanie is part tough, dangerous chick and part incredibly vulnerable little girl. One thing that has always stuck with me about this book, which I read shortly after its 1994 release, is that I didn't really like either Sam, too wimpy, or Deanie, too disturbed, but I was entranced by their tale. This is one of those stay-up-all-night-and-finish-it-books--once you start Sam and Deanie's story, you'll have real trouble putting it down.Since discovering Tabitha with &quot;One on One,&quot; I've become fan of all the King family writers. (For the record, while I've like many of Tabitha's other novels, I think &quot;One on One&quot; is her best effort.) I also admire Mrs. King for 1) publishing under own name, knowing the inevitable comparisons and envy (&quot;Gee, I wonder how SHE got a book deal?&quot;) that would result and 2) undertaking the struggle of writing at all.

Deanie and Sam's relationship makes me wish for something I've never had before. Her usage of words portrays the teen's feelings better than anyone else ever could. You can totally feel what they're feeling while reading this book. I recommend it to everyone and I hope Tabitha King writes more books like this one. The best thing that could ever happen with this book is make a movie and let Tabitha direct it."},{"Title":"One on One: 2A Novel","review":"This is my second Tabitha King book reading and review. She is just an amazing author. She has the ability to make characters that have you thinking about them when you are finished reading as if you knew them personally! I love how she makes the female characters not the *norm* of other books by having them drop-dead gorgeous and perfect. Her characters are flawed both inside and out. Here she takes Deanie &quot;The Mutant&quot; and makes her someone you would fear had you not known what she went through in her personal life. She had Sam see Deanie from the inside and not just what she looks like on the outside. I love how Sam feels the need to protect Deanie and how Deanie feels safe in his arms. A great love story. Like her women characters, Tabitha has the couples experience sex and life unlike glossy characters written in so many other novels!!

The quote in the book says, &quot;For every five statues made, there is enough to make one more statue. Suppose a student is presented with 25 ounces of clay. What is the maximum number of statues he can sculpt?&quot; According to the way it's written, most people, if not all, will answer 30. The book says 31. Incorrect! The puzzle says &quot;for every five statues made, there is enough to make one more statue.&quot; It does NOT say for every five statues made, there is one ounce left over.

I was disappointed. Granted, this is a very different sort of book from the previous three - set in contemporary time, dealing with more contemporary (though certainly universal) issues. It just didn't resonate with me. The central story -- one man dealing with his grandfather's illness and the ghosts that haunt his grandfather's past -- is quite compelling,and their final scenes together are very poignant. But what do we make of the history of the Fanshawe family ... and the rather alarming painting that is discovered while the current residents of the Fanshawe house are stripping paint in the living room? It seems the Fanshawe's are supposed to parallel the lives of the novel's central protagonists. But then the issue is dropped and doesn't pop up again until the novel's final page.Barker is a master of nuance and of getting into the heads of her characters and making them real to her readers. On this level, she does not disappoint. But the book as a whole is a rather minor affair and doesn't pack much of an impact.Certainly not bad, but not great either.I look forward to her next..."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Violence crosses time and space to trouble the lives of both a centenarian and his pre-teen great grandson. The focus of the story is the dying of Geordie, who fought in the First War and now, having lived long beyond his time, is slowly dying. Other generations and other days are woven through the novel, reminding the reader of the common thread of humanity that runs through all time. I particularly commend Barker for her description of Geordie's dying and moments of actual death . . . she has obviously been there with more than one dying person. The portrayal was both respectful and, from my experience, accurate. I'm working my way through Barker's entire opus, and this is a worthwhile contribution to her fine reputation."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Barker might have entitled this novel Still Another World, so many overlapping worlds does she present here. On the surface it is the story of Nick and the complex life he now shares with his second wife and new son, his ex-wife and daughter, and his strange stepson. It is the story, too, of the Fanshawe family, a much earlier, and also troubled, family that once inhabited the house Nick is now restoring.But it is especially the story of Geordie, Nick's 101-year-old grandfather and the worlds he has known, including the world of war. Although Nick learned as a child that &quot;You had to be two people, one in each world [of family and of school],&quot; he has always believed that his grandfather &quot;never changed; belonged to only one world.&quot; Now that Geordie is dying, however, Nick learns of Geordie's other worlds: his family life, his difficulties after World War I, his marriage, his war nightmares, the haunting death of his brother in battle, and his mother's comment that the wrong son died. And we see the tyranny of memory as Geordie relives his brother Harry's dying moments. Geordie himself says, &quot;I know that what I remember seeing is false. It can't have been like that, and so the one thing I need to remember clearly, I can't ....It's as clear as this hand...only it's wrong.&quot;These vividly depicted battles, real and symbolic, all raise questions of responsibility and blame as each character assesses the accuracy of his own memory. Even the supernatural is evoked, peripherally, as characters consider whether they have really seen what they think they have seen. As Nick gains knowledge through his time spent with Geordie, he recalls their visit to the &quot;ageless graves&quot; of Thiepval, which keep perpetually alive the traumas of a terrible war, and he recognizes the contrast to the graves of the tiny churchyard in which Geordie will lie, with names hidden by moss, old mourners dead and forgotten, and gently decaying stones. And he and the reader recognize that &quot;there's wisdom too in this.&quot;Barker's tightly constructed plots and themes, her vividly drawn characters, her evocation of atmosphere, her deft use of settings to enhance the drama, and her ability to communicate new visions, all testify to the brilliance of this novel, one which may, itself, escape the erosions of time and its &quot;obliterating grass.&quot;"},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Years ago I came across Vera Brittain's memoir of growing up in England from 1900 -1925 (Testament of Youth), and had my eyes forever opened as to the horrors of WWI and its impact on the everyday citizen at home. Pat Barker's fiction echoed the horrors of the battlefield in her trilogy (and Sebastian Faulk does the same in Birdsong) Barker's latest novel skillfully runs two parallel courses --a dying old man's all-too-vivid memories of the Somme, frozen in time, and his middle-aged grandson's battles with the viciousness and complexity of modern life. As the old man nears death, the younger man slowly comes to understand the silence which has surrounded his grandfather's war experiences. True, Barker tells several stories here - not all with resolutions--but I don't think this lessens the impact of her work. Life is often filled with dangling ends, and some readers prefer to imagine what hasn't been written. Not as powerful as her Regeneration trilogy, but a worthy addition to her list of novels."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is one of those novels that is as flawed as it is beautiful - a real torment for a reader - you can't stop thinking about it, but there's no resolution, no way to put the pieces together. The narrator, Nick, is struggling with the impending death of his grandfather, while at the same time trying to keep an uneasy peace with his pregnant wife and their three children. What the reader struggles with is the disconnect between the Nick who is so lovingly, physically present as witness and caretaker to his grandfather's last days, and the Nick who is infuriatingly, selfishly, and dangerously neglectful of his own family. Particularly harrowing are the portrayals of the two young-adolescent children, Gareth (Nick's stepson) and Miranda (his daughter by his first wife). Gareth is a budding sociopath who can only relate to violent computer games, while Miranda is so swallowed by her own silent rage and absence of selfhood that she &quot;moonlights&quot; as the ghost that haunts the family's home (a subplot of the novel that is never fully developed or resolved). Worse, these children are essentially unparented - in fact, their relegation to other family members at the end of the novel appears to be a positive decision, a way Nick and his wife Fran can hope to resolve some of the stresses in their own life. The essential flaw in this novel is that these two &quot;sides&quot; of Nick - the devoted grandson and the negligent father - just don't mesh. The contradiction doesn't ring true emotionally. Meanwhile, Pat Barker has unleashed these two terrifying youngsters onto the world, and I can't stop thinking about them, especially because they present a chillingly accurate portrait of adolescence in contemporary culture."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"This book was my introduction to Pat Barker. I picked it up at in a bookshop, attracted by the fact that she was a Booker Prize winner. I wasn't disappointed.Barker wields realism to portray Nick's modern, dysfunctional family struggling to keep their heads above the swamp of hopelessness that threatens to engulf them. Then she teasingly weaves gothic threads through the story. Are we encountering the supernatural or are we witnessing the interior workings of the overwrought family members? Violence broods like an approaching storm, especially in the frightening boy-next-door malevolence of the young step-son Gareth.Almost a story within a story, the final days of Geordie, Nick's 100 year old grandfather, is beautifully portrayed. This World War I veteran is either a survivor plagued with guilt, or a man that committed a horrible crime. Nick and the reader are drawn into Geordie's story, but in the back of your mind you can't stop wondering if Nick's attention to his grandfather will be the trigger that finally unleashes the destruction of his family."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Overall I feel that 2 disconnected stories have been pulled together, and I wish they had remained separate. While the story of Geordie is gentle and told with great sensitivity; that of Nick's domestic life is unresolved. He seems to grow in his understanding of age and death - but then celebrates his belated realisation of his grandfather's love for Helen by going to bed with her. For why? To consumate Geordie's love or to give him an excuse to leave another family? Surely he could have taken his insight to existing relationships. The children, with their isolation, pain and problems are very real, but also totally unresolved. Touched only by the ghost? Maybe, observing both Gareth's behaviour and her greatgrandfather's funeral will give Miranda the ability to cope with her mother's mental illness. I wished she could have met Helen; the only other person with the potential for personal strength and integrity. I would love to see the author write Fran and Gareth's story in full. Maybe the move to York will miraculously turn Gareth into a confident child with no antisocial tendencies. Maybe I've missed the point; maybe the book is intended as a study of isolation and stress within families leading to unsolvable problems."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Pat Barker is yet another tremendous discovery for this reader. Added to my introduction to Penelope Fitzgerald several months ago, 2000 has been a great year.The accolades she has earned include, The Guardian Fiction Prize, and the highest award in Great Britain, The Booker Prize, for the final installment of her trilogy, \\"The Ghost Road\\". I have begun the first book of the three, \\"Regeneration\\", and I look forward to finding the words to express how remarkable a work it is.\\"Another World\\" is a tremendous piece of writing containing complex characters, multiple plot lines that are distinct but not independent, and primary players that are uniformly disliked with ease. Secondary players don't quite rise above dysfunctional, save perhaps the very youngest in this tale.The initial stage of the book seems a bit slow, however it still communicates the misery that will underlie the book. And when the writer introduces, or perhaps allows the cover to be taken from past terror, the pace indeed was never slow. Ms. Parker just lulls the reader into a false sense of security. Comfort may be a better word, for it is a rare book that truly disturbs a reader, I suggest this is just such a book.The truth of what happened in this story is never completely clear. Reasonable conclusions can be drawn, and careful attention to detail makes all the difference. However much of the time A truth, as opposed to The truth, is what we are offered.A 101-year-old man, a veteran of World War I and all the horror that entails complains of a scar and the pain it inflicts. The problem is he chooses the scar that is 80 years old, and not the days old incision that physically is the site that should cause the pain. A Grandson who tends to this man, who wants to know what personal horror tortures the old man, the horror that pains him more than his failing health. Eventually some information is shared, but I don't believe it is The information.The Grandson has his own Family, most charitably called eclectic, as each parent has brought children from a first marriage, and a life they have created is en route. When the cover I mentioned earlier invades this family, they face an obscene result, a visual dementia, which immediately threatens them. And this initial shock is only the beginning.An act of violence from the past that can be argued as humane is followed by the most nightmarish atrocity. The past does not repeat, or has the outcome just been delayed? I had written of another novel \\"she did not hand this one to you\\". I feel the comment here is equally valid. The Writer does bring closure to some issues, she leaves at least on event suspended, not ambiguous, but specifically left in abeyance. I don't know what her intent is, but this issue, combined with one other that can easily be missed by the reader, and perhaps the key players in the book, would make for a great continuation if Ms. Barker chose.I really look forward to the balance of this lady's work. Her work is sophisticated, clever, and the major events that shock, hide much deeper, and darker issues. I may be wrong, if I am, then the book is probably better than I believe it to be."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Pat Baker explores new ground and revisits old territory in this strangely engaging novel. A new theme is the supernatural, while she continues to draw on her established skill in depicting the horrors of WWI. Two simultaneous stories unfold linked by the main character Nick.

The other story revolves around Nick's thoroughly modern, blended family which has recently moved into a haunted,old Victorian home. The twin hauntings suggest the title, ANOTHER WORLD. It is a world co-mingled by spirits and undying memories. Without giving away too much, both hauntings involve the possibility of murder. The book alternates between this reality and the tangent other world as the stories unfold with tantilizing suspense."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Ms. Barker is one of my favorite fiction writers. Her books are in a special pantheon for me, as I am not a heavy fiction reader.I won't give a detailed review of the plot, as this would make me a &#34;spoiler&#34;.Although this is not a long family chronicle, the startling link of past and present is quite powerful.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"A moving, beautifully written novel that serves as an interesting addendum to the Regeneration trilogy. Barker is a fine novelist and shines here."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"I cannot quite comprehend how this little read provokes the above adoring ratings except, perhaps, as remembered tribute to the oft mentioned Trilogy of the same author. Either that or some folks have been on a calorie poor diet of prose of recent. Like a few others, I found this a let-down, thinly written and not terribly convincing either in characterization or in point. It's almost as if she were in a hurry to tell about something, not quite having the time to decide what. Throwing together a number of high profile dramatic elements along with a collection of overwrought characters does not a story make. To each their own, I suppose. I vote for passing on."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Gareth is Fran's son. Miranda, a stepchild, is to visit for six weeks. Nick meets Miranda at the train. Their house says Fanshawe 1898. Miranda points out it is like Wuthering Heights.When Gareth isn't in school he plays computer games. The authorities at his school feel that he has a propensity to bully younger children. His mother Fran disagrees with the assessment. Jasper is the baby of the family. Another child is expected. Nick and Gareth, his stepson, do not get along. Miranda is visiting because her mother, Barbara, has been hospitalized for a nervous breakdown.The family scrapes wallpaper in order to redecorate. A sort of Victorian portrait is discovered. Unfortunately the portrait of the family is anatomically correct and not in very good taste.Nick visits his grandfather Geordie at the hospital. Nick's father had been the headmaster, and his mother the matron, of a small preparatory school. As a boy Nick had been devious and deceitful trying to curry favor with others.Geordie is 101 years old. He has cancer. He seems to be having flashbacks of his service during World War I. The story with Geordie is that he believes that his mother said that she wished his brother had survived the war instead of him.Nick reads that a child of the Fanshawes, the previous owners, died under mysterious circumstances. Members of the family were acquitted in a murder trial. When Nick's family goes to the beach, Gareth throws stones in the direction of the baby, Jasper, and wounds him. Miranda witnesses the incident but denies being present.The grandfather dies. Just before this happens Nick learns more details of Geordie's experience in the war. Gareth is to start a new school and is upset. One of the themes of this excellent novel is the complexity of truth."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Shipping was excellent.Book was so so It took all the book to appreciate what barker was trying to say about modern life and family and world war I and a survivor.."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"This is a funny book, not that it is funny though! But reading it I was wondering - What kind of book is this? There is a ghost in it, so I thought maybe it is ghost story? But not really. Then there is also a story about a boy, Gareth, who is jealous upon the smaller boy in the family, Jasper, which is the shared child of his mothers new husband, Gareth's own father has broken the connection. So Gareth feels left out of the family and exerts pretty serious violent actions upon Jasper, so I thought then is then a psycho drama? But not really either. Then there is an old 1WW veteran who are dying Geordie. The book takes place in the 1990. What strikes me about the book is that the author is not afraid of decribing some of the tabuised areas of physical life. Things like the gentials, excrement and she even describes an intercourse with a highly pregnant woman."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Barker's popularity and respected position guarantee that one of the comments in any discussion of this work will be: so there is no direct line of amelioration of a woman's lot from Richardson's Pamela to Barker's Fran. Perhaps, we saw the best of it in Eliot. Perhaps, democracy is not what the myth of democracy claims it to be.Too, the frank and coarse language used in this modern effort haven't made Plato's basic questions any easier to answer. So, spacing the novel from the bowdlerizers apparently hasn't added to clarity.Further, Barker and David Chase (The Sopranos) must have, at some point, agreed on endings. This story's non resolutions are the novel's version of fade to black, a realistic, if not comforting, ending.Additionally, Geordie is dead and leaves a legacy that suggests that extremely long life without dementia is not necessarily a blessing, at least for the long living.Why a five star? It was a very good read written by a great writer.I'd have said something about the ghosts, but I haven't figure them out."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"I read this book about 2 weeks ago, and I'm still wondering how this book was published when only one plot line was resolved and the painting they find under the wallpaper had no relevance to any part of the story. There must be more to come or no editor would have let this pass of their desk.I liked the Geordie storyline, which is why I'm able to give this 3 stars, but I really feel a bit cheated that nothing was resolved with Miranda and Fran."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"The author does a wonderful job describing the atmosphere and the emotions of the characters but leaves out too much detail. The main story about grandson and grandfather is very touching, and felt authentic but so much was left unclear. The secondary story that centers on the grandson and his blended family was very incomplete. Things were wrapped up too quickly. This novel left me with several unanswered questions and a vague feeling that I've been lured into reading a sequel."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"I went through phases while reading this novel. The first 50 pages or so seemed awfully slow in moving along, but by page 100 I thought it would be brilliant (when they discover the drawing below the wallpaper). But then, Parker seems to be more involved in Geordie's passing (and fascinated by Geordie's shriveled genitals) and abandons the Fanshawe family story, and abandons Gareth's revolt story, and abandons Miranda's lonely musings. These never became resolved to satisfaction in my mind.Barker has gifted narration skills and she has some excellent ideas started in this novel, but that's all that I can say that is good about it. I haven't read any of her other novels so I can't compare her other work to this one.Oh, well, I'm not complaining. I'm just moving on. For you: read it if you want, or move on, too."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"Another World is a step up from tne Trilogy series. I recommend the book for discussion groups. There are some serious family issues that my be difficult to discuss, but should be stimulating. I lived in Newcastle and see both the loving and rough Geordie life style reflected in Another World. A must read if you liked the Trilogy or know the north of England."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"This novel seemed more like a sketch of a novel than a fully realized work. Barker, the author of the outstanding Regeneration trilogy, employs several devices of 19th century fiction, including a haunted house, to develop a story of sibling love/hate and the imprisoning effects of traumatic memories. In comparison with her prior work, I found the characterizations thin and the plotting somewhat contrived. Nor does this novel contain any of the virtuoso passages that particularly characterized the last novel in the Regeneration trilogy, The Ghost Road. Fans of Barker should skip this work and wait for her next novel."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"I figured out what happened between Geordie and his brother but kept reading to see how it would come to light. For the most part, the characters are annoying: Nick is a wuss, Fran needs her tubes tied, Gareth needs to be sent away to military school...I can't see the appeal of this book."},{"Title":"Another World (Thorndike Core)","review":"The new novel of Pat Barker has all the traits that distinguish her widely acclaimed and highly awarded Regeneration Trilogy - excellent language, brilliant and psychologically exact depiction of characters, several intertwined lines of the narrative and profound exposition of the problems of human existence. The author takes traditionally sentimental elements of the plot, extirpates even a tinge of schmaltz and forms edifice of the novel.She tells us about the moral responsibility of a person whose rash decisions can destroy a previous marriage in ephemeral hope to attain happiness in a new one and mold some fly-by-night alliance, externally resembling a firm family but internally demolishing (sometimes even physically) by ghosts of hate and intolerance that were begotten by these indiscreet decisions. Masterly synthesis of different time layers, description of remorse of an old man who took part in the First World War in Europe, thoughts about atonement and perdition give this problem, give this novel a timeless Biblical aspect."},{"Title":"Dialogue About Catholic Sexual Teaching (Readings in Moral Theology) (v. 8)","review":"This book is a comprehensive examination of a range of issues pertaining to sexual ethics. An array of authors is used. It has been one of my most consulted texts in my moral theology studies. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Shepherds After My Own Heart: Pastoral Traditions and Leadership in the Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"I highly recommend Shepherds After My Own Heart, by Tim Laniak, for those serving in ministerial positions and/or interested in the biblical theology of the shepherd/sheep/flock metaphor found throughout the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. I also recommend this book for anyone interested in the study of leadership, Christian or otherwise.Dr. Tim Laniak is an OT/Hebrew Professor at Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary. His book represents an exhaustive study of the shepherd motif/metaphor in the Old and New Testaments, as well as ancient near eastern cultures.The analogies of a shepherd, undershepherds, sheep, goats, rams, ewes, and lambs provides a rich medium in which to help communicate the biblical theologies of 1) leadership, 2) the sacrificial care and concern of God for His people, 3) the visible church, 4) church discipline, 5) the role of human ministers, 6) the saving work of Christ, and 7) eschatology and judgment.The book is written to accommodate both the common laity as well as advanced biblical scholars. Someone with little or no knowledge of the Bible will appreciate it, as well as the Biblical language expert.In addition to its \\"standalone\\" value, the book has an advanced bibliography and detailed indexes to serve as a reference text for exegesis and sermon preparation."},{"Title":"Shepherds After My Own Heart: Pastoral Traditions and Leadership in the Bible (New Studies in Biblical Theology)","review":"The book arrived soon after purchase. It was in pristine condition. The content reads like it is the author's doctoral thesis."},{"Title":"The eight of swords,","review":"John Dickson Carr took a heavy-handed turn toward humor in \\"The Eight of Swords,\\" and almost drove off the edge of the cliff. The characters say \\"What ho\\" more times than Bertie Wooster. What starts out as the story of a young man who is afraid to tell his father, the Bishop of Mapleham that he spent his time in America at speakeasies and hanging out with loose women, instead of attending criminology courses at Columbia University, ends in attempted murder and murder. The farcical characters fade from view and we hear no more 'what ho's after about the middle of the book.Carr's serial detective, the humungous Dr. Gideon Fell, galumphs into view disguised as the Viennese psychiatrist, Dr. Sigismund Von Hornswoggle. He fools no one, least of all his friend Chief Inspector Hadley. In fact, Hadley is glad to see the enormous, eccentrically-dressed detective, as he is being badgered to investigate the case of a bishop who seems to have gone mad, and is caught sliding down banisters, attacking maids, and creeping about on his host's leads in the middle of the night. There is also the mystery of the poltergeist who biffed a vicar in the eye with an inkpot.While in Hadley's office, Colonel Standish, who is currently hosting the eccentric bishop and the poltergeist, is informed that a man has been murdered on his estate back in Gloucestershire. The deceased was discovered with a tarot card clutched in his hand: the Eight of Swords, a minor arcana, which symbolizes (according to Fell) Condemning Justice.The eccentric Bishop of Mapleham, his errant son, and Dr. Fell pile into Colonel Standish's tonneau (this book was first published in 1934) and set off for Gloucestershire to investigate the mystery surrounding the dead man.\\"The Eight of Swords\\" leans more toward farce than Carr's usual blend of mystery and ominous, supernatural doom, although there is one rather creepy chase scene toward the end of the book. It is a fun read and one of the author's less complicated mysteries--actually it's the only one of his mysteries where I've been able to correctly pick the murderer before the grand denouement at the end of the story."},{"Title":"The Blue Marionette","review":"By TT reviewer Chuck GregoryJaimie has been blessed, and cursed, all of his life. He is blessed with wonderful understanding parents, with privilege and a comfortable standard of living. He is further blessed with an incisive wit, a quick mind and deep feelings that he is willing to face and longs to understand. Perhaps most important, he is blessed with not only the admiration but also the true love of others. But his deep feelings can be a curse, especially when he is parted from someone he loves most. This happens more than once; the results are poignant and help to shape his attitudes and his innermost self. His is at the same time an uplifting and a heartrending tale, and in this way it has a strength that seems to lift it out of the computer or printed page and into the reader's heart.I found this book extremely difficult reading. Several times I put it aside; it tended to penetrate too deeply for me to be able to go on. Each time that I stopped, I said to myself that it was worth reading, indeed very much worth reading-but I couldn't continue just then.Stafford's prose has a lyrical quality that is almost hypnotic. His lush descriptions start from an event or a place, but move on to the realm of mind and emotion, and always there is an awareness of God, angels, fate, life and death. He mentions in his dedication that he had taken 60 years to finally write this novel. I am afraid it might take me 60 years to fully appreciate it, for I have developed the short attention span of our day.I believe that if I could find more patience to relax and enjoy this novel, I would rate it far higher. It is so full of detail that it is overwhelming. Reading it is a bit like trying to stand in the center of a river after a dam broke upstream-you have to let it take you where it will, and not spend too much time trying to analyze as it goes by. Yet, on another level, it is well deserving of analysis, and so you feel you have missed something, and you want to go back.In \\"The Blue Marionette\\", Jaimie's eyes are blue, as blue as the sky in fairyland. Blue is the color of happiness for Jaimie, and Jaimie is happy, although always the happiness seems to end. For someone is pulling his strings...If you have patience, and you enjoy layer upon layer of description and a slow but inexorable revelation of events foreshadowed from the start, try this book. It will reward you. If you, like me, suffer the impatience that is all but encouraged in this 21st century, you might want to spend your time on one that provides quicker gratification. Still, I must commend Elsan Stafford on his achievement."},{"Title":"The Blue Marionette","review":"Upon finishing The Blue Marionette, the feeling that swept over me was that I was in the presence of greatness.Elsan Stafford is a masterful story-teller, and with The Blue Marionette has taken us back to a time when chivalry and altruism were still prized measures of character. It is also a look into the human struggle between the desire to find true love, and the realization that there are other responsibilities of even greater importance.As an added bonus, the author begins most chapters with a brief but fitting poem. You'll find them to be among the most hauntingly beautiful verses you've ever enjoyed. Whether through the story itself, or through the ability to arouse your emotions and reach deep into your psyche, it seems that at 88 years young, this gentleman can still show the rest of us a thing or two about living life to the fullest.If you enjoy a poignant love story that will ultimately leave you uplifted and filled with a renewed desire to express altruism in your own life, then you should read The Blue Marionette."},{"Title":"The Blue Marionette","review":"Just got my hard copy of Elsan's epic novel and am reading it for the second time. What? You haven't ordered your copy yet? What're you waiting for, the Second Coming? I dare say there's not a more beautifully written book in the whole universe. And I dare say your life will be forever positively and poignantly changed after you read The Blue Marionette. Do you dare not read this book? If you do, you will miss out on enjoying one of literature's most unique and rhapsodic creations!"},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"Helen Keller's teacher was a very interesing book. The book is about Annie Sullivan ( Helen Keller's teacher) as a young girl. This biography discusses and observes how Annie from ayoung age goes blind from a disease she contracted when she rubbed her eyes and scrathed her cornias. She goes on to school and learns to read braille because she couldn't see. She has a very tough and hard life. She had surgery on her eyes and it was successful. She could see. She then, finished school and went to teach Helen. She could deal with the same tantrums Helen displayed because she herself acted that way out of frustration. This book taught me that it is a lot of hard work to teach a kid. You have to have a lot of patience. I recommend this book because it explains how people have to work for their accomplishments. This book had a lot of information on Annie Sullivan. This book was sad because Annie Sullivan didn't have a good childhood. There was lots of disappointments and sadness in her life. She overcame so many obstacles and ended up being an inspirational leader for Helen. I hope you will read this book and learn about Annie's childhood."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"the name Helen Keller.I remember ordering this book through the Scholastic Book Club when I was ten. I couldn't wait to read the book. Anne Sullivan came from a background of poverty, neglect and disease; Helen a comfortable home in Alabama. Yet if not for Anne Sullivan, Helen might have wound up in a home for those whom society can't help.The only postive characteristic Anne Sullivan got from her childhood was tenacity and perserverance, and those qualities served her well when she set out to teach Helen Keller.From the time I was 10, Anne Sullivan has always been my hero. She never gave up, she was creative, stubborn, and believed a human being could accomplish anything he/she set their mind to.She was right."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"True story of Annie Sullivan's life. She was a miracle and a godsend to Helen Keller - a deaf, blind and mute girl who had never been able to communicate with others before the arrival of Annie Sullivan. Annie was not only Helen Keller's teacher but also Helen's best friend. You will see Annie's struggling endeavor to teach Helen to speak and she was eventually successful. I highly recommend this book to you and your young children."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"FINALLY!!!! A book on one of society's greatest hereos, Anne Sullivan! Oh, boy, was her childhood a NIGHTMARE!!!! Oh, she was so strong to endure so much; she endured more pain in twelve years than most human beings endure in her lifetime. Poor Anne! It's her dignity & courage that keeps her going throughout poverty, her dad's alcoholism & abuse, her mom's tragic death, her own lifelong battle with trachoma & being blind, her brother's horrible death in the poorhouse, the terrible conditions in the poorhouse...wow, and to think she survived that all & grew up to reach out to Helen Keller & other handicapped people! Wow, were her cousins, John & Statia so stupid to dump her & Jimmie in the poorhouse; I wish I could just blast those two idiots for not understanding that they needed love & support, not to criticize Anne & put her down. Well, it was their loss since Anne battle her problems & grew up to be a loving, wonderful person to be proud of. The books goes through her arrival at Perkins, her difficulty dealing with her wounded feelings when other students make fun of her & when a teacher humiliates her, then her working hard & graduating valedictorian of her class. The part with Helen also changed her life & I'm glad they found each other since their relationship blossomed into a beautiful lifelong friendship. The part after the Breakfast Table Battle where Anne struggles & wins at getting Helen to eat with a fork is touching as it describes how Anne went up to her room afterward & cried. Poor Anne didn't realize how out of control Helen was! I found Arthur, James, & Kate a little shallow & short-sighted; after Anne opens the world of language for Helen, at first they fell all over her with praise since she'd \\"tamed\\" Helen so she'd be easier to handle, but I get the feeling that they, esp. Mr. Keller felt threatened by Anne & the fact that Helen had a closer bond with her than with them. I like how it went into how their relationship deepened over the years & became almost like a mother-daughter bond. Anne had her heart broken so many times throughout her life, yet I think Helen was one consistant light in her life. One thing the book left out was Anne's disastrous short marriage to John Macy (who, from what I've read in other books, was a real jerk who broke her heart, cheated on her & was jealous of her & I think even hit her). I would have liked to have read that there, but I guess since this was more of a teen-or-kid book, they didn't want to get into the sordid details of that. Anne stayed true to herself to the end & encouraged Helen to do so too, much to the chagrin of the rest of the Kellers. The best gift she gave Helen was her freedom & independence. I thought it was really wonderful that Anne wanted Helen to be even independent of her, since once Anne got old & became permanently blind, she wanted Helen to continue her happy, productive, independent life long after she was gone. It is such a good lesson of pushing yourself to be free, since once Anne died, Helen did just that...lived a free, independent life even without Anne & continued working on behalf of handicapped people everywhere. As the last sentence in the book says, \\"Annie hadn't failed.\\" She sure didn't'; she really was a success story. WAY TO GO, ANNE SULLIVAN! CONGRATULATIONS, ANNE!"},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"Hellen Kellers Teacher was a great book. I liked it because it had a lot of dialouge and lots of interesting facts I had never known That were about Annie her teacher. Annie was blind when she was little so she knew what Helen felt like. Most people concentrate on Helen but this is all about her teacher. I would recomend this to any 3rd 4th or 5th grader."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"This is a very good book. I read it for a project i was doing on social studies about one of my hero's. I was doing extra credit and did two heros, Helen Keller and Anne Sulivan. This book helped me imensly. I would recomend it for anyone who is doing a project on either Helen Keller or Anne Sullivan."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"Anne Sullivan Macy's work with Helen Keller is certainly ground breaking. A survivor of paternal abuse, abandonment in a poorhouse with her terminally ill brother and a nearly-lifelong battle with trachoma all hardened Ms. Macy's armor. She was so bright and determined that she made a good academic showing at the Perkins Institute for the Blind and it was through this noted institution that she was assigned to work with Helen Keller, who suffered the dual challenges of being blind and deaf.One admires her gritty determination; she survives the poor house, which was a genuine Chamber of Horrors; she survives being relegated there with her terminally ill brother as no other relatives were willing to take her in; she survives the painful loss of her brother and the subsequent losses of others she came to know in the poor house.This is a good starter book and provides interesting information about Anne Sullivan Macy's life. The one drawback is that it does get stuck at the water pump where Helen learned, from Ms. Macy's constant spelling into her hand that all things have a name. This &quot;watershed&quot; landmark in Helen Keller's life is, in her words, &quot;her soul's birthday.&quot; Helen, then nearly 7, learned at the now famous water pump that all things can be identified by name. For her, that singular lesson served as her lifelong key to communication.I admit, I do get rather tired of that water pump scene because many otherwise good works seem to get stuck there. Many books that cover Helen Keller, this one included, languish at the water pump and with what little speed the book has left gives scant attention to the many accomplishments these women made and their indelible stamp on history."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"This book is highly recommended for all readers.

What happened in the book was annie's mother died and Annie and her brother Jimmy were sent to the Tewksburry poor-house. After a while jimmy died and Annie got into Perkins Institution.

It isn't a simple one page or two page list of facts but it won't go over ever-single detail in Annie Sullivan's life. After all, it's only 153 pages, hardly a novel. It's well written but not a difficult read. It really tells about Annie Sullivan's life, not just the time she spent with Helen Keller. For example, it talks a lot about her childhood and the time she spent in the Perkins Institution. In fact only half of the book is spent talking about her time with Helen. The first half is spent telling about Annie's struggles with her disabilities. I recommend this if you are looking for a quick, yet engaging read about Annie Sullivan."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"To maintain their effectiveness, educators must constantly troll for new and interesting ways to present their material. I recently attended a meeting where a candidate for a position in the education department was doing a learning presentation. One of the topics covered was the difficulty of finding alternative ways to present the same topic and we discussed the different ways in which students process information and reach a state of understanding.Sometimes, casting your gaze only in the forward direction can cause you to miss solutions already tried and proven successful. This book is a biography of the life of Annie Sullivan, the woman who educated Helen Keller. Helen was a woman who was rendered blind and deaf by an illness while she was very young. Annie was a woman who was nearly blind in her youth and was raised in a home for the indigent. Annie's problems in trying to educate Helen were more difficult than most educators face. She had to somehow relate to Helen and impart concepts that most of us obtain through either visual or auditory means.Annie was fortunate that her student was very intelligent, but that fact should not diminish the significance of her accomplishments. Her methods of adapting to the situation and developing new ways to present material remain an object lesson in quality education over a century after her student became the first deafblind person to graduate from college.This story is a demonstration of the power of the human desire to learn and understand. I strongly recommend it as required reading in late elementary school."},{"Title":"Helen Kellers Teacher","review":"Everyone knows the story of Helen Keller, but the life story of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, is even more remarkable. I read this originally when I was 10 years old and it made such a vivid impression on me - that no matter what obstacles life throws at you, you CAN come out victorious - that I recommend it highly for every young girl (8-15 years old) as an essential part of growing up.

It is really well written and although it's a cliche I really did laugh out loud while reading it. The perfect gift for any guy...which is why I am buying my Dad a new copy."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"This was a very enjoyable book, easy to read (in a good way) and laugh out loud funny in a lot of spots. Josh Wolk has a great way with words and some of his quips are quite clever and extremely amusing. I have never been to summer camp, but that didn't stop me from appreciating this entertaining book. By the time the campers were being picked up by their parents at the end of the book, I actually realized I was going to miss some of these characters (even ADD Kid). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"I take that title from a Frank Black song, which I think is a pretty accurate way of describing the nervous step you take into full-fledged adulthood. \\"Cabin Pressure\\" details Josh Wolk's step.I first took notice of Wolk through his terrific writing at \\"Entertainment Weekly.\\" He wrote day-after commentary on the \\"Real World\\" that was so gut-bustingly hilarious my friends and I used to E-mail the highlights to each other. After a while, the writing was so good and the show so bad, we stopped watching the show and just read the wrap-ups.Wolk's best skill as a writer is his gift of observation. Give him any scenario and he can instantly break it down, expose each player's motivation, and end it all with a hilarious analogy.He brings that keen observation to \\"Cabin Pressure,\\" his tale of heading back to camp as a counselor on the brink of his wedding day. Having remembered camp as a kind of innocent oasis, Josh wants to reexperience it one more time before he becomes, gulp, a husband and a father.Wolk fills us in on summer-camp life -- what he remembered from his day, what has changed, and what hasn't. The best part of the book is Wolk's interaction with the kids in his cabin. He does an amazing job of letting you know each one, whether they are charming, maddening, or depressingly and prematurely stressed-out and miserable.I don't necessarily think I bought into Josh's overall theme here -- this whole nostalgic innocence trip -- but it doesn't matter because \\"Cabin Pressure\\" is often hilarious and reading this book is like a well-spoken, really funny friend telling you his best summer-camp stories.The tone can shift from body-odor humor to some strong emotional connections with the boys, and all the while Wolk's razor-sharp observation and pitch-perfect punchlines remain.After reading Wolk in \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" all those years, and laughing my butt off, this book lives up to all of my expectations. Funny and insightful, \\"Cabin Pressure\\" is a wonderful debut book."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"Even though it's been 35 years since the first time I was a counselor, every year around Fathers Day I have the urge to grab my sleeping bag and head up to camp for staff orientation. This book reminded me of why that urge is still so strong - why I spent six summers of my life as summer camp staff, working 14 hours a day most days and making less than I could have working a virtually anywhere else.In the summer before he married and entered a new phase of life, the author chose to relive part of his childhood by becoming a camp counselor at the same camp he'd attended as an adolescent. Although older than the typical counselor and with a fiance waiting at home for him to finish his adventure, the authors experiences of feeling like he didn't quite fit in with the staff, his struggles with trying to stay upbeat after weeks of little sleep and hard physicial work and the silliness he shared with his campers mirror the experience of every counselor, whatever age. His story rang so true - although I worked at two coed YMCA camps rather than an all boys camp, the songs, jokes, activities and adolescent angst are universal.For those who were campers, it's a window into the mysterious life that counselors led. For those of us who staffed camps, it's a sometimes funny, sometimes touching reminder of why we chose spend our summers without creature comforts of home, making little money while living with other people's children."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"This is in many respects one of those universal stories that plays effectively on shared memories. It may have taken place in Maine, but the images that ran through my mind as I read it were of a Boy Scout camp in East Texas. Wish we could have ended each camp session in the Eastwind tradition, but it was not to be. Regardless, I'm in debt to Mr. Wolk for letting me return for one more season."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"Reviewed by Vicky Burkholderon 07/13/2008Who has not been to summer camp, even if only for a day? And as an adult, who has not sat in his or her industrial beige/grey cubicle on a clear, beautiful summer day and wished they were once again that carefree youngster jumping into a frigid lake or pounding initials into a piece of leather?Josh Wolk, a senior writer for Entertainment Weekly, decided to spend part of the summer before his wedding doing just that. He returned to his old haunt as a counselor, hoping to find his boyhood before stepping solidly into adulthood. His lighthearted look at the goings on at camp will keep you laughing. But, just as in life, all is not high-jinks and pratfalls. He is looking back at this from the perspective of twenty years beyond most of the people there. But he gives even the serious stuff a humorous edge.If you've ever been to summer camp, or even if you haven't, you'll enjoy this book. It's both funny and nostalgic, a perfect blend of entertainment. So grab your gorp and bug juice and come along for the ride. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"I am never at all sure why I like reading camp books. I hated the actual camp experience, due to overwhelming homesickness and general dislike of being in groups! But I love reading about camp, and this is probably the best book about it I've ever read. Josh Wolk spends the summer before getting married working as a counselor at the camp he attended for many summers as a boy. The best part of this book is that it really doesn't romantize the experience. Josh feels like a misfit much of the time, the 14 year old boys in his cabin can be very, very hard to deal with, the other counselor in the cabin doesn't pull his weight at all...but still, he has many moments of remembering what he loves about the camp. It sounds like a great camp. I have 13 and 10 year old boys, and I wish now that overnight camp wasn't out of our price range, as it sounds like it could be a wonderful experience.I hope Wolk writes more books. I'd love to hear about his life as a parent, as he seems like someone with real insights."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"Be prepared. While reading this, you may forget to change your kid's diaper. Maybe you'll play the Salt Game and bet your husband a beer that he can't compete. And if your husband steals your copy of Cabin Pressure and then attempts to give you a wibble, you'll know that you're not entirely lost. That's the point: learning to be a kid imparts wisdom and confidence and a sense of humor that many adults so desperately need. And that's why Cabin Pressure is the perfect summer read. It's a reminder of the more important things that, growing up, we may have lost along the way.Plus, the dialouge is fantastic and, truth be told, I discovered great comebacks and conversation pieces to entertain my in-laws and the kids next door that ring our doorbell and run.NOTE: If you're one of those parents that barks orders from baseball bleachers and demands anti-bacterial soap at all times, your kid's therapist might just give you this book. Read immediately. Learn and laugh."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"I too am a Josh Wolk fan from reading his EW work.

I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"My mom bought me this book a week before i left for my own summer camp and after i read the first page i found it impossible to stop. The word nostalgic is a perfect adj. to define this book.

I recommend this book to any one because anyone can read it and enjoy it. I found myself laughing and cracking a smile numerous times during my reading and I know other readers will too."},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"Highly recommended! - Josh Wolk's quick wit almost provides him some defense as this 34-year old writer/camp counselor returns to the summer camp of his youth the summer before his wedding. He balances the every-day realities thrust upon us as adults as well look back on the presumed innocence and simplicity of our youth.Josh Wolk's humor and satirical commentary provide an engaging read that brought me back to my own days as a camp counselor.A great summer book for the by-gone days as I daydream out my office window!"},{"Title":"Cabin Pressure","review":"I enjoyed this book from line one.

I kept getting more and more depressed by the author's descriptions of his human relationships. I am sure that he was trying to make his short sighted insecurities funny but I guess I am the one reader not laughing. I kept expecting something interesting to happen. I at least expected that the lame communication with his bride to be would end in a messy break up. I am always looking for good outdoor stories but this book wasn't one for me. However, the author is a good writer and if being crammed in a cabin with stinky socks, belches and farts is your idea of a swell time, then you would enjoy this macho look at camp."},{"Title":"Philippians and Colossians;: Introduction and commentary (Torch Bible commentaries)","review":"Synge's commentary on the Books of Philippians and Colossians in the Torch Commentary series deserves only passing notice and, likely, no shelf space for the serious students of the books in question. Of the little 96-page work, 8 pages are devoted to preface material, 39 pages cover Philippians, and 48 pages discuss Colossians. For the purposes of this review, a focus will be given to the portion of the work dedicated to the epistle to the church at Colossae.In the 14-page introduction to the book, Synge quickly sets out his argument against Pauline authorship. In its essence, it runs something like this: because Ephesians and Colossians are different while using similar terms, they must be from two different sources. The flaws with this argument are too many to pursue in this context, so a more important point will be made here. If an author is to attempt to overthrow the overwhelming evidence (both the deep internally and ancient externally) of the authorship by the Apostle Paul, the burden of proof lies with this author. In his attempt to present his case, Synge is simplistic, unhelpfully brief, and illogical. The oversimplification is in the essence of his argument (see above). The brevity of his comments in the seven pages regarding the authorship are mainly a rambling dialogue of nothing more than educated guesses as to how a writer may or may not compose an epistle. Even the commentary itself moves too quickly through the text of the epistle and provides very little helpful exegesis. The logic of the arguments is, in the view of this reviewer, the most embarrassing of all of the faults of this work. While referring to the epistle to the Colossians as unartistic, \\"rambling,\\" hastily written, \\"perplexing,\\" \\"obscure,\\" inferior, and \\"inept\\" (52, 54, 55), Synge has the...courage(?) to then state: \\"let us be clear that [this view of authorship] does not reduce the authority of Colossians\\" (53). The reviewer cannot find any way of logically reconciling these two views of the Book of Colossians. In his description of the mysterious writer of the epistle, Synge goes on to state that he was \\"no forger\\" with \\"no intention to deceive\\" (55), but then goes on to admit that what the author engaged in was but a \\"mild deception\\" (56). In other words, the little white lie was a big help to the Church and presented doctrine similar to Paul's, so it was overlooked by the Church. The reviewer has great difficulty reconciling this bizarre view of truth with statements such as \\"do not lie to one another\\" (Col. 3:9).The few redeeming qualities of the work are: (1) several good insights on interpretational difficulties, (2) several comments on some textual variants, (3) several pithy statements (e.g. 73, 79, 84, 88, 90, 92, 93), and (4) a strong view and presentation of the deity of Christ (57-60). These few merits do little to outweigh the overwhelming weaknesses of the work as a whole; therefore, the reviewer must give his first single star review.If the reader is looking for a more helpful, yet brief volume on Colossians, they would likely profit from a work similar to that by HM Carson (The Epistles of Paul to the Colossians and Philemon: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale New Testament Commentaries)) or, somewhat less, that of G Thompson (The Letters of Paul to the Ephesians to the Colossians and to Philemon (Cambridge Bible Commentaries on the New Testament))."},{"Title":"Philippians and Colossians;: Introduction and commentary (Torch Bible commentaries)","review":"Synge's commentary on the Books of Philippians and Colossians in the Torch Commentary series deserves only passing notice and, likely, no shelf space for the serious students of the books in question.

While Alfred Rahlfs (Goettingen, d. 1935) provided a quality synthetic version of these ancient Greek manuscripts of the Old Testament, and Robert Hanhart (also of Goettingen) updated and republished this important work, New Testament scholars have for the most part ignored these texts which actually formed the basis of and established much of the vocabulary for New Testament Greek. Now comes John Granger Cook of Emory University, and also Goettingen, with a study of the Old Testament (using its Greek form) as it was interpreted in pagan Greco-Roman culture. Covering such vitriolic pagan intellectuals as Celsus, Porphyry, the anonymous pagan reported by Macarius Magnes, Hierocles, and Julian the Apostate (Emperor of Rome: 360-363 a.d.), Cook provides modern exegetes with the definitive treatment of this important and neglected topic. It is also worth mentioning that this same author served as a protege and understudy of the late Martin Hengel (Judaism and Helenism), the seminal scholar of intertestamental Judaism of the last half century, in the latter's final years. Like the rest of Cook's publications, this work is understated, severely critical and ultimately grounded in and informed by his impressive command of ancient texts. The volume, despite its cost, is a must-have for any serious scholar of either the Old or the New Testament."},{"Title":"Notes on the book of Genesis","review":"A simple guide and analysis of the Biblical book of Genesis.

I purchased two books since my son was planning a trip to the area to visit Mitton, Clitheroe, Preston, and other nearby Parishes. Although the book gives a good descendancy account of the Sherborn family of Stonyhurst, it also includes other Sherborn families in the area.

This was recommended as \\"additional reading\\" in Claire's couture book and I could not believe what all is included. Each article has valuable information about specific designers' techniques. These are not just \\"overviews\\" of a couture house. While the articles are not more than a few pages each, each is chocked full of wonderful bits of information. The writers of these articles are to be commended for their thorough research and writing style! And the designers... I started with Balenciaga - After a paragraph of biographical notes, they launch into the analysis of his designs...as one example, all have heard of Balenciaga's unique collars that stood away from the neck just enough to \\"let the wearer's pearls breath\\". Well, one picture shows he accomplished this by putting a series of small shaped darts in the undercollar! In addition to the finished coat photo and a muslin with the darts stitched in place, there is also the detail from the muslin, marked for the darts laying flat. So much information and lots of photos with fabulous detail. Vionet is covered also - the author sets out to \\"solve the mystery\\" of how Vionet manipulated bias. She met the extraordinary technician (vionnet's name for herself) and got information that everyone who loves to sew should find out about. So interesting and insightful!!!! I have the book about Vionnet written by the author of this article and I highly recommend that book! However, the information in the article is very very thorough and insightful and you will enjoy reading it. Chanel, Schiaparelli, Kawakubo, norell, Kleibacker, Madame Gres, to name a few more who have articles about their work. Also, there are wonderful articles on tailoring, zippers, interfacings, hand stitches, lapels, buttonholes, pockets on and on. I have sewn for over 40 years and love hand sewing - have lots of couture instruction books and was taught in my teens by sewing vogue designer patterns with my mother. In short, I have a lot of knowledge already, but these articles are wonderful!!! It is filled with so much information - and one thing is certain - anyone who sews is always on the lookout for a \\"better\\" way to get the look. If you love working in your sewing room and read sewing books like other people read novels.... you will love this book. Don't let the dated photo on the cover fool you into thinking it is just another \\"80's fluff\\" book."},{"Title":"Great Sewn Clothes (Threads On)","review":"I was looking for a book that had more information on couture.

When a friend from the past leaves her daughter, Sabrina, at their house, with no intention of returning, and Carla learns she's pregnant, their marriage begins to disintrigate. Both Simon and Carla make foolish choices, but God is working to bring them back together in a new way. A Piece of the Sky is a gripping novel you'll have trouble putting down."},{"Title":"A Piece of the Sky","review":"Michelle steps outside the Christian fiction box with a book that is hard to put down. She uses compelling story telling to get inside a subject too many people sweep under the rug - infertility in a marriage, showing the devastating effect it can have on a relationship. This is a book that can keep you enthralled, and prick at your conscience at the same time. It's a good read."},{"Title":"A Piece of the Sky","review":"\\"A Piece of the Sky\\" is a powerful, beautifully written story about a couple torn apart by infertility and the unexpected detours in their lives that make them question all they thought they ever wanted. Carla, the always-in-control successful plant manager, already has a life enviable by any standards - a dream job, gorgeous home and hard-working faithful husband - but she wants a child to make it all complete and is willing to risk everything to make it happen despite her husband's assertion it isn't \\"God's will.\\"I must admit, by the time I hit chapter five I'd already begun asking myself, 'What is she doing here?' and furthermore, 'How is she doing it?' Even though I've never had to deal with infertility, her words stirred up feelings in me I couldn't quite pinpoint, and more than a few times I had to stop reading to reflect on the significance of what she'd just said.Then I finally figured it out. It wasn't only how \\"real\\" the characters were (they could be your mother, your sister, your husband, your best friend) but the way she breathed life into them all: characters are as flawed and eclectic as any you'll find in an Anne Tyler novel; her lyrical and poetic prose is every bit as soul stirring as novelist Pat Conroy's; yet - and I emphasize \\"yet\\" - Buckman brings such a unique voice and style to her first novel it elevates fiction to a whole new level. It is all at once funny, emotional, inspirational, page-turning, and, before you're halfway through, will have you rethinking and reflecting on your own life views and attitudes.Be prepared for an extraordinary read guaranteed to lift one's heart far beyond \\"A Piece of the Sky.\\""},{"Title":"A Piece of the Sky","review":"This was an awesome book. It helped remind me that I'm not traveling this Infertility Journey alone. I've been ttc for over 8 years and have had 10 IUI's. In that whole time, my faith has struggled, but I always know that God is with us and he's just waiting with open arms to wrap around me in comfort. It was so great to see the relationships grow in this book.I just could not put it down. I'll be encouraging all of my friends who struggle with infertility to pick this book up.Thanks Michelle!!"},{"Title":"A Piece of the Sky","review":"A Piece Of The Sky by Michelle Buckman is a fast-paced tale of an intimate relationship between main characters, Carla and Simon, gone terribly wrong when Clara's urge to become a mother deems her willing to disregard the importance of her marriage. Readers will follow Clara through her merciless quest for conception (discerning Simon's acceptance of their imperfect conditions for fertility) as she breaks the promise of an important and irreplaceable bond. Very highly recommended reading for all general fiction lovers, especially those who may appreciate a contemporary tale of confused and determined Christian woman."},{"Title":"A Piece of the Sky","review":"Don't read this unless you are able to complete it over one sitting. It's difficult to put down. The author, Michelle, doesn't pull any punches in this book. Infertility is a difficult for any couple. For Carla and Simon, it's no different. It's a story about trust and a committment to love one another through the good and the bad times. The characters reveal thoughts that couples deal with from time to time but would never admit it. It is a story that will keep you thinking after it has ended and cause you to reflect on your own life. I look forward to her future books."},{"Title":"The Brothers Karamazov: Worlds of the Novel (Twaynes Masterwork Studies)","review":"A very thorough review and interpretation of Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov that provides an excellent analysis of the themes of the novel and the ways in which Dostoevsky's separate narrative threads comment upon and enrich each other.

Another irritating factor with this book is that a third of the content is source code which can be obtained on the WWW anyway.

Readers expecting an historical overview will quickly become mired in long discussions about colonial ethnic politics. Readers expecting more penetrating scholarship will be put off by such gloss-overs as when Balmer writes the socially complex Salem Witch Trials off with a single word: 'misogyny' or when he repeatedly asserts that contemporary hymns inherit significant sexual imagery from the pietistic tradition but never presents an argument to support this assertion. The final two chapters strike me as thinly veiled assaults on Promise Keepers and the Christian Coalition. Justified or not, these attacks take the book out of the realm of history and into the realm of socio-political commentary, thus adding to my confusion about its ultimate purpose.Balmer does have some interesting things to say, particularly about how American individualism and anti-institutionalism affect American politics and religion. Despite its apparent lack of focus, I enjoyed reading the book and found some useful nuggets related to my current academic project. Students of history, sociology, or religion may find the end-notes a good starting point for more serious study. Those looking for an overview (as the sub-title suggests) should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Blessed Assurance: A History of Evangelicalism in America","review":"Maybe its because reading Balmer's &quot;Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory&quot; was like reading my own mind that I found &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot; a dull read. I got the feeling that the author took several academic essays and made a book out of them. There is still some great information and thought in this book, so it is worth reading. I agree with the author that confessional theology and ideology in general have given way to pragmatism in evangelicalism, but I disagree with his assertion that the general dislike of Hillary Rodham Clinton among Evangelicals is simply because she is a powerful woman. Most evangelicals strongly support powerful women such as Margeret Thatcher, Jean Kirkpatrick, Elizabeth Dole and Laura Schlessinger on ideological grounds. If you've already read &quot;Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory&quot; then go ahead and read this book..if not start there."},{"Title":"Blessed Assurance: A History of Evangelicalism in America","review":"A nice short (115 text pages!) history of Evangelicalism in America, from the First Great Awakening to the present day. Barnard professor Balmer gives an historian's perspective on different aspects of the Evangelical movement in our national life without placing undue emphasis on the personalities behind the scenes. At the heart of his discussion is the exploration of several key ironies. First, he marvels at the fact that Americans take their religion so seriously (compared to people from other industrialized societies). It is ironic that it is in the United States, with its Constitutional imperative to keep church and state separate, that religious expression is so vibrant, various, and abiding. He attributes the freedom of religion (and the absence of direct governmental support though taxation) as being key to the ability of native-born religions to prosper and grow exponentially. He also finds it ironic that the Fundamentalists who decry scientific modernism in every form have so willingly embraced the new technologies: radio, technology, and the Internet. Another irony he looks at is the current-day Evangelical rejection of feminism. Women are sidelined within Evangelicalism and assigned the sentimentalized role of guardians of morality. This is ironic in light of the important leadership roles women held in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century church-based reform movements.This book is more handy than it is comprehensive (the endnotes direct the reader to some promising articles and books, but Balmer does not provide even a short bibliography). This book probably won't be very satisfying to serious students of American religion looking for a good introduction to the subject; but the average reader who is curious about religion and public life will find it informative. Don't skip the last chapter, \\"Vocabulary of Evangelicalism\\", in which Balmer defines the Evangelical subcategories: Fundamentalism, the Holiness Movement, Pentecostalism, and the Charismatic Movement."},{"Title":"Barbara Taylor Bradford's Living Romantically Every Day","review":"This book is a beautifully illustrated and well thought out display of some wonderful romantic ideas.

Fifty-seven years later I'm enjoying it again as I use it to teach ESL!"},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I really wanted to like this book, especially after all the glowing reviews it received. But the book has fundamental flaws in structure, topics, and approach:- As someone else mentions, the book is heavily, albeit not exclusively, skewed towards Unix applications. Given that only 3% of desktops currently run Unix (6% if you're generous and include MacOS X), this immediately raises an accessibility barrier for those unfamiliar with the intricacies of Unix, and an unfamiliarity with Perl, Python, and shells. There are many Windows mapping applications that do much of what is described in this book far more easily and accessibly than the Unix-oriented solutions presented.- Critical topics are defined incompletely and haphazardly. For example, while shapefiles are mentioned in several places early on, the first even barely-adequate definition comes several hundred pages into the text. Datums are covered very poorly, and given their importance in real-life applications, that's simply not acceptable.- A significant fraction of the book is handed over to a discussion of different kinds of projections, and programs that will display them. While interesting, the fact is that most of the useful information about projections can be gotten from the text, or from a website that discusses projections; the \\"hacks\\" are essentially superfluous. I'm also disturbed by the amount of space given to projections vs. datums. In my experience, more people run into mapping issues with datums (e.g. using GPS units in WGS84, and wondering why they don't match up with topo maps in NAD27) than they do with projections.- A huge chunk of the book is taken up GRASS. GRASS is very powerful, and as much fun to learn and use as sticking red-hot knitting needles into your eyes. Most of the problems that GRASS is used to solve in the book could far more easily be solved either with other freeware programs, or with Manifold GIS if you've got the money. For that matter, other difficult-to-use programs are employed to solve tasks that could be done more easily with other programs (e.g. SPLAT! is cited instead of the superior MicroDEM or RadioMobile for broadcast coverage; POV-Ray for 3-D models instead of 3DEM/Landserf/MicroDEM/Wissenbach3D; GRASS for map texturing instead of 3DEM or MicroDEM; PERL for spatial data analysis instead of GeoDA/STARS/PASSAGE; and so on). You could spend huge amounts of time becoming a \\"GRASS Ninja\\", as the book suggests, or you could spend less time and get more done using other software that's far easier to use.- Sloppy terminology. For example, \\"Georeferencing\\" is used to refer to both linking digital photos to the location they were taken (should be \\"geotagging\\"), as well as its normal use in cartography, associating geographic coordinates with raster or vector features. And a GeoTIFF is not a Tiff with a world file, it's a Tiff with the georeferencing information embedded in it.- A book of \\"hacks\\" should contain complete, self-contained hacks, and any number of hacks in this book don't fulfill this requirement. For example, the hacks on WMS/WFS, PostGIS, and building your own car computer/navigation system are either incomplete or hopelessly inadequate in giving you the information you need to implement them.- Many of the hacks have been superseded by recent developments, like Google Maps/Earth, and the APIs from Yahoo and MSNLocal. This clearly isn't the authors' fault, but it does lessen the overall value of the book.I could go on, but you get the idea. I have no idea of who the authors and publisher believe is the intended audience for the book, but unless you've got both a strong cartographic background and a strong Unix background, most of these hacks will be beyond you. And if you are strong in cartography and Unix, few of these hacks are even worth bothering with, since you'll most likely either know them, or know a better way to get them done. There are a few nuggets of useful information, primarily in the GPS section, but for most people, this book simply isn't worth the money.Addendum (7/3/2011): The book is also now hopelessly out of date."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I found another book that's excellent if you're into maps and software that creates them... Mapping Hacks - Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography by Schuyler Erle, Rich Gibson, and Jo Walsh (O'Reilly). You can have a lot of fun with this one...Contents: Mapping Your Life; Mapping Your Neighborhood; Mapping Your World; Mapping (on) the Web; Mapping with Gadgets; Mapping on Your Desktop; Names and Places; Building the Geospatial Web; Mapping with Other People; IndexWhat's nice about this book is that it's not all about installing some large mapping software package and then learning how to use it. Mapping Hacks covers a wide array of mapping techniques, tricks, and hacks that can be used by anyone willing to sit down and try things out. For instance, the first hack (#1 - Put a Map on It) shows you how to use the online mapping services and how to hack together a URL to add mapping to your website. Ever wondered how those driving direction sites work? Hack #2 - Route Planning Online - sheds light on that one. They even go so far as to cater to the ultra-geek and explain how to build a car navigation system that \\"will consume all your time and money, but make you the envy of all your nerd friends\\". Gotta love it...Like O'Reilly's other mapping book, this is printed in color, so you get a lot of information from the context of the figures and graphics. Nicely done. The book is also larger than a normal Hacks title. There's the standard 100 entries, but there's around 525 pages to it. You get a lot of detail on some of the more complex hacks, which in my opinion adds a lot of value to the book.A perfect book for those looking to get their feet wet on the subject, as well as for those who are more experienced but want to learn a few new tricks. Very nicely done..."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"Nowadays it isn't about simply getting information about a place or location, thanks to the recent explosion of personal-GPS units, online mapping and free and low-cost satellite imagery the latest trend is to transform information into a map to present the information in a more dynamic and sometimes more usable way.Mapping Hacks is a unique book in that it will take you far beyond simply bringing up a map of Grandma's house. It will show you how to take data that you collect and use it to present maps and cartographic data about everything from mapping the wi-fi hotspots in your area, to tracking a package as it moves across the globe to creating 3-D maps of your neighborhood, your city and even the entire planet. This book is for those who aren't simply satisfied with the basic information MapQuest or Google Maps provide, but want to take that information and use it in ways that were unheard of just a few months ago.Though having a GPS unit to collect data is a great way to get the most out of this book, there are also plenty of hacks devoted to simply mapping out or building on top of existing data. Perhaps you want to setup a web site that shows all the local eateries in your neighborhood along with their latest health report -- no problem, there is a hack that will walk you right through it! This book helps open your mind to the possibilities of what all you can do with the data you already have. You may implement the hack for the health code violations and then build from that to start mapping out housing prices, or crime statistics -- the possibilities are endless.Unfortunately, the book does not cover the latest API into Google Maps -- one of the recent, and more popular resources for mappers. However, the book does cover a lot of the more traditional ways of accessing sites like MapQuest and Yahoo Maps. It was written so that you don't have to be a programmer or computer guru to get the most out of the book.It's a unique book (and in full color too I might add) that really will open your eyes and mind to the new ways of using services and information that once was only accessible to map makers and businesses."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"As another selection from the \\"Hacks\\" series, this book is useful for anyone, whether they have the time to read the whole book, or merely select and use a single hack.

Within 1 hour of picking the book up, and choosing a hack at (nearly) random, I had accomplished something that could have taken me 2-3 days to find the tool for the job, figure out how, and then use it.From pointers on using simple web-based mapping services, such as MapQuest (http://www.mapquest.com/), to using GRASS (http://grass.itc.it/) for advanced GIS mapping, to deploying your own basic web-based mapping, this book has all you need to get started, and even finished with whatever you want or need to do with maps.A few of the hacks could use a bit more explanation, for my tastes, as to be more understandable to tweak, but overall it was an excellent selection, that I would recommend to anyone interested in electronic cartography."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I really like to look at maps.

From tools and techniques for determining the shortest route between two points, to labeling your photographs with GPS information, to building a \\"neverlost\\" for your car, to building maps to help in decision making. The book really contains a little for everyone: from basic information to understand cartography, to using your GPS device to show where on the planet you've been.O'Reilly did a really nice job with the printing of this book, as the whole thing is in color. For mapping applications, that's a necessity, and made this book stand above some of the others in this category. Additionally, the author does a really good job appealing to a wide audience and making many of the hacks interesting to as many types of people as possible. I have read some complaints that this book was printed before the Google Maps API became available, but that's certainly something that can be covered in the second edition.This is a great book for the mapping hobbyist. The book contains a lot of great ideas, tips, and information on tools to really make the most of creating and using maps in your life."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"This book was assigned as the textbook for a graduate class in cybercartography, mostly because the professor couldn't find a book that really addressed the topic. And while this is nothing like a textbook, it's a fantastic resource for anyone interested in internet or dynamic mapping -- and the information is relevant beyond this (perhaps relatively narrow) discipline.It's cut into bite-sized pieces, and the bites are tasty and well chosen. The topics cover a broad range of material, from cool web sites I'd never have otherwise found to propeller-head \\"get under the hood and have some fun\\" stuff that you'd be hard pressed to find covered in a half-dozen other books.This is definitely worth a look -- I'm going to keep this for years, and I KNOW I'll be using it for a long time."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I am definitely not a professional cartographer, but I do have quite an interest in mapping and GIS that started when I spent a summer making maps at work. When I saw this book on the shelf, I made a beeline right for it. Unfortunately I was on vacation at the time and spent an excessive portion of my vacation reading it. Thankfully I had my trusty Powerbook with me so I could actually start trying stuff out.I have a bunch of the 'Hacks' series from O'Reilly and I really enjoy them. I like being able to read them in tiny chunks. This book, like the rest of the series, has Hacks that range from a page and a half to nearly fifteen pages, but most are 3 to 4 pages. The one drawback is that you never really get into things in great detail. For instance, there are entire books on some of the Hacks in this book (ie. #91, Build Interactive Web-Based Map Applications). But that can be a good thing as well, since you get introduced to lots of various things.I really enjoyed this book. The writing is easy to follow, with enough humour to keep me entertained. The majority of the Hacks in the book were interesting and useful to me. A lot of them had me back in front of the computer before I had finished reading them to try them out. I found the cross-platform coverage to be excellent as most of the software covered is available on multiple platforms so no one gets left out.If you are interested in mapping in general, I recommend you pick up this book.

Which is something I've done for many of my clients using Illustrator to draw the maps and then transferring it over to Fireworks (or sometimes creating the map directly in Fireworks) and then exporting it as a .gif. Not so here. This book shows various ways to use MapQuest, Yahoo and other types of mapping systems you've probably never heard of and learning all sorts of sneaky ways to take these systems to the limit. Probably too geeky for me and maybe a lot of you, but if you want to learn how to take these various mapping systems and sites to the max, this book is for you for sure."},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I should begin by noting that while I am a competent programmer and geocacher, prior to reading this book I knew only as much about mapping and cartography as I could glean from episodes of NOVA and my childhood orienteering training. It is my suspicion that those more familiar with mapping technologies could make better use of some of the hacks in this book, so my review will be necessarily incomplete as I am not in a position to evaluate or even comprehend the more sophisticated hacks.Perhaps the greatest virtue of this book is the introductory material toward the beginning that discusses some of the theory of mapping, geocoding, and computer navigation. Arguably I learned more from this material than from any of the more specific technical hacks.For a great many of the hacks, however, the book is a victim of bad timing. While today (and even at time of publication) the Google Maps API is the de facto standard mapping system on the web, and Google Earth is certainly the best designed and most thorough free end-user GIS program, O'Reilly's Mapping Hacks makes no mention of either. This was a supreme disappointment for me and, I would think, anyone who was hoping this book could provide guidance for developing the latest and greatest Google Maps-enabled web application. If O'Reilly follows this with a new edition (which I very much hope they do) this major deficiency will obviously be rectified.Some of the neatest hacks, however, are ideas that many of us have thought about in the backs of our minds but have never seriously tried to implement. These generally also do not depend on any particular mapping API, mitigating the foregoing concerns. I am particularly fond of Hack 16, which supplies the reader with information on a variety of useful geopolitical statistics websites, and Hack 62, which introduces Perl functionality I didn't even know existed and is instructive on mapping GSM cell sites. (After all, everyone has wanted a nice map of cell coverage just like in the TV series \\"24,\\" right?)Overall, I would recommend this book to those interested in learning what is possible to do with computer mapping, but who are also willing to go research more modern innovations to supplement the book's material. For those seeking more shake-and-bake recipes (as are frequently found in the excellent \\"Hacks\\" series), lobby O'Reilly for a new edition!"},{"Title":"Mapping Hacks: Tips & Tools for Electronic Cartography","review":"I didn't really get a lot out of this book.

Some hacks are just introductions to websites. These include David Rumsey's website, Census' TIGER server and NASA's World Wind. Other chapters introduce online tools for changing decimal degrees to degrees/minutes/seconds, and for the experienced programmer, there are the tools to build a desktop application using open source PROJ.4. There are quite a few hacks that involve programming - PERL in particular - so to get the most out of this book you should already be familiar with PERL.

This is simply a part of life that one needs to get used to.However, it is also sadly true that, too many geospatial \\"professionals\\" (that's in-house jargon for full-time Mapping geeks) simply fail to look outside the narrow square of the dominant (incumbent) software players providing carrier-grade GIS software and tools to our particular vertical market.We have become an industry that is too inward looking: one that spends so much time reminding everyone how special GIS is, that it forgets that mapping (the core of our science) is really a true horizontal market technology.So, you can imagine how interested I was when given a copy of \\"Mapping Hacks\\" to read for it allowed me to indulge my after-work passion for reading a good book (and not surfing the internet) with my love of all things spatial. It was great to get a book that reminded me (as if I didn't really know!) how horizontal market the core technology really is. I don't know if my, or Frank Warmerdam's, mother would want to read this book, but I think that every geospatial professional should have a copy and read this book and have it readily accessible in the professional area of their bookshelf! While there was a lot I already knew, there was also much that I did not; and from that which I did not this old dog has learned many new tricks that will help in providing a better service to my employers (in my more mundane day-job).I rather liked the \\"story\\" narrative that links the chapters together: it gives the book a rather appealing, \\"home steader\\" feel.To Simon St. Laurent (the Editor), Schuyler Erle, Rick Gibson and Jo Walsh, I thank you for having reminded us (like Google Maps, Yahoo!, MapQuest, Map24, Maporama etc) that you \\"don't need a GIS to produce a map!\\".Thanks.Simon G GreenerGIS ManagerAllens Rivulet, Tasmania, Australia.Longitude: 147.2048Latitude: -43.0141"},{"Title":"Collected Poems","review":"This book of collected poems is the most treasured book that I own.

Far from being a diatribe which serves the propaganda interests of any side, the authors explore the multiple implications that have arisen due to the loss of Western morality (or perhaps, the sham that was the West's previous pretence to morality) from various angles, and discuss not only what this means for the Bosnian themselves, but also its importance for today's Western societies."},{"Title":"The Conceit of Innocence: Losing the Conscience of the West in the War against Bosnia (Eugenia & Hugh M.

He rehashs the tired Zagreb-Sarajevo party line of a &quot;land grab&quot; by the serbs and completely ignores the fact that Serbs made up a full 33% of Bosnia before the war. He of course, completely ignores war crimes commnitted by Croats and Muslims against Serb civilians. Also, Mestrovic ignores the role of Croatia in fomenting war amongst the croats and Muslims.

It is an excellent survey of the history of classicism from its origins in ancient Greece, to the influence of Architect Andrea Palladio, throughout Europe, England and the rest of the world. Linley is an excellent modern day interpreter of classicism, which is evident by his furniture designs which are featured throughout this beautiful book. He goes into detail about the great furniture makers such as, Chippendale, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton. He also discusses the influence of some of the great architects such as Adam and Kent. I had the good luck to see up close, one of Linley's biggest commissions: The conference table in The Board of Trustee's Room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which was more than cleverly done. In years to come, he will unquestionably be regarded as one of the great modern interpeters of classical furniture ever.

Alice Verney is one such moth, no longer as young as the other ladies who grace the Restoration Court of Charles II, but still formidable, set upon a good match for herself and her friends, the other ladies-in-waiting to Catherine, Charles' infertile queen. Alice has recently returned from France, in attendance to Charles' sister, Henriette, the princess married to Prince Philippe of France. Alice is delighted to be with friends again, although alliances have shifted since she's been gone. Reestablishing herself as the most clever courtier of all, Alice negotiates for a position with Queen Catherine; but first, she must return to France with Henriette (and a secret treaty with Louis), only to be devastated by the princess's untimely death, rumored to be by poison at the hands of Henri Ange.The next English homecoming is tainted by grief at the loss of the beloved princess, bitter feelings and suspicions surfacing between France and England, along with rumors of war with Denmark. Verney has brought with her a French beauty, Renee Karoualle, who becomes a member of Catherine's entourage, sponsored by the powerful men who seek advantage through the French courtier, the Duke of Buckingham and Sir Thomas Verney, Alice's wealthy father. Renee immediately captures the heart of Lieutenant Richard Saylor, who plights his troth to her only to be pushed aside by the king, as Charles seduces the lush beauty with all the advantages of his position. Richard is faced finally with the realization that his beloved Renee may not have the strength of character he once believed, drawn into Charles's seductive web.The Restoration Court is one of excess, luxury and amorous affairs, Charles making up for the poverty-riddled years in exile. The Catholic-Protestant struggle for dominance continues to unsettle the country, Charles's heir, the Duke of York, secretly and adamantly Catholic. The machinations of the nobles revolve around this potential shift of power, considering how best to position themselves vis a vis the religious controversy over the throne of England. When Alice learns of a plot to poison the barren queen, the court goes into full alert, especially when Henri Ange is spotted on English soil.Alice Verney is on a journey of self-discovery, albeit a twisted one. Arrogant and self-serving, Verney proceeds with her plot to wed the Duke of Balmoral, thereby exacting revenge on the man who spurned her, demanding respect and obedience from her circle of ladies-in-waiting, respect she fails to reciprocate. One by one her friends turn away; Self-styled architect of their futures, Alice refuses to forgive those who go against her wishes. Such hubris is ultimately her downfall: \\"Clever Alice, no longer clever.\\" As the court seethes with intrigue, Alice learns the value of friendship too late, her best laid plans of little merit, her schemes puerile in light of a terrible loneliness bred of overweening pride. At the end, her spirit redeemed and a real love affair on the horizon, Verney is but a spectator on history's horizon, this volatile era ushering in even more turmoil for the throne of England.

Set against the backdrop of the court of Charles II, this novel has it all...romance, suspence, mystery and power. Really worth the wait all these years.

Highly recommended to all..."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"The prequel to Karleen Koen's first two novels is just as well written, yet I did not find it as exciting as the others. No doubt I still found it wonderful, enjoying to find out about the life of Barbara's grandmother, Alice Verney. The plot is interesting and follows history well, which is a must for any historical fiction I read.

She's overdoes the \\"visual\\" details. She often goes places that don't affect the plot. Her writing is just heavy. I could hardly force myself to finish the books. In this one, the plot just got silly at the end and I was disappointed in the character."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Although I loved Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, I wasn't aware of Dark Angels until I happened upon it in an airport bookshop. It is one of those rare books that is so engaging I was able to tune out all the miseries of flying and just read. And in this case, reading was pure joy. I loved the depth of the characters and details of the setting. Koen's characters are flawed, but in ways that make them seem real. This book is an example of how historical fiction should be done!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I pre-ordered this book, and could hardly stand the wait. How much I had loved the first book by this author \\"Thru a glass...\\" and the 2nd was almost as good \\"Now face to ....\\". Ms Koen has taken her story writing skills to a new and even better peak. This is the best of the 3. Now, I have to reread the other two since it has been so long. I just hope she will not wait this long for a 4th book. Or, maybe, even do a book on something else. Don't do a \\"Jean Auel\\"!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you are looking for the exact same type of novel as Through a Glass Darkly and you go into this book with the preconceived notion that it is going to be the same, you might walk away a little disappointed. That being said, I truly feel that Dark Angels is just as strong of a novel as Koen's first novel. (I enjoyed the sequel Now Face to Face as well).Koen takes us back in time and focuses on the youth of Alice Varney, a strong and amazing character in TAGD. While I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a \\"romance novel\\", it is still a wonderful book. The story is based around the court of King Charles II, and it has many great twists and turns and mysteries that keep you up for hours reading. Alice is just as I pictured her...young, self-centered maid-of-honor for the queen...trying to determine who is and isn't loyal to her queen after a member of the royal family is mysteriously poisoned. While Alice meets a man she may be falling in love with, the book is not entirely focused on Alice and her love story. It also has plotlines that include Charles II and his court, betrayal, power struggles,poisonings as well as Catholic plotting and the threat of war.Koen once again provides such amazing descriptions, you can really tell that she did her research again...and it really makes you feel as if you went back in time and are seeing everything firsthand. As I stated before, it tends to shy away somewhat from being a romance novel, but those looking for that should still be satisfied...and those looking for thrilling twists and turns and wonderful characters will finish the book with a smile on their face.5 stars"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved her first book, Through A Glass Darkly, I read it at least four more times!! Her sequel, Now Face to Face, was closure to the first, but not as exciting or sad. I cried every time I read the first one! Dark Angels deals with the young Alice, the grand old grandmother in Through A Glass Darkly. She's just as feisy and clever in this prequel, but I still liked Through A Glass Darkly the best out of the three. If you want to read any of the books by this author, I suggest you start with that one!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was so excited when I hear this book was coming out. I loved \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\", liked \\"Now Face to Face\\" and adored the crotchety old grandmother Alice Saylor, who this prequel stars as a young woman. So, I pre-ordered this book, expecting it to be like those two.This book is much more like \\"Now Face to Face\\" then \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\". That means it is not as good. It has more of the quality of a mystery novel, which is never really solved, with a half written love story thrown in (which is resolved far too quickly.) It's not as descriptive, and while there is a major plot line including poisonings (the dark angels of the title are French scoundrels who are suspected in Charles II's sister's mysterious death), plots by Catholics in England, and the ever interesting subject of Charles II, it feels like huge parts of this book were left out. While it is definitely cool to read about Alice as a conceited, arrogant and busy body of a 20 year old maid of honor to the Queen, it felt like there were just too many gaps in the foundations of this book. For instance if you've read \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" you know there was a major romantic history between Alice and a \\"someone\\" I will not name for those who have not read the book. But for the first 400 pages of this 530 page book this \\"someone\\" is not with Alice, and it is never really described when Alice realizes she loves him or vise versa. There are a lot of loose ends in this book in fact that could have been tied up. But perhaps that was an editing problem.Still, it's by Karleen Koen, who is a great writer. I liked more than I disliked about this book, and finished it in a day and a half. I would like another (please) about Alice's youth (she is just as interesting as Barbara, maybe even more so because she appears to have very few scruples) and Richard's life as a soldier. In the end, four stars. Nothing will approach the sheer brilliance of the author's first work, but for a third effort, and after such a long publishing gap, this isn't a half bad book (even if it is annoyingly littered with bible sayings.)Four stars."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"We have all loved Barbara for the past 20 years, and her exploration of the new country and domination of the old country for 10. This was not a novel, but an extended and intimate character study into Alice Verney. It explains so much! No, it doesn't tell the story of her and Richard's formal courtship and marriage, the birth and death of their children. It illustrates, not explains, who Grandmama is, how she came to love Richard synonomus with breathing, and almost as stealthily, and how she, strong, willful Alice, could have permitted Diana to be what she was. And why she could not refuse Barbara even Roger, when she knew he was wrong for her. It was a specatular book. We can only hope for more."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"In Dark Angels, Koen allows us to see how Aice and Richard met. If you've read her two previous novels, Through A Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, you will have already met the two lead characters. In the previous novel Alice is the Dowager Duchess of Tamworth and Richard is dead. This novel is a prequel. It is fast paced and a non stop good read."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'll start with an admission - Koen's prose is not the most original, and sometimes she falls into cliches (see: every kissing scene). But it is to the point, exciting, and even sometimes terribly romantic, and she has produced a fine novel. Naturally, there are a few villains who are unforgivable and pure evil, and some incredibly handsome and noble lads -- but for the most part her characters are engaging, and as sympathetic as they are flawed. The situations and characters' reactions feel entirely plausible, and while you may pass judgment on quite a few of them, Koen puts you far enough inside of their heads that you'll be tempted to weep for them too. Queen Catherine is particularly fascinating - Koen gives you a lonely woman whose miserable situation sometimes seems of her own making, and who you may be tempted to shake in the first several chapters. But by the end, contempt has been transformed into pity -- and gradually becomes respect. I lost some very needed sleep over the course of an extremely busy week because I could not put this book down! In addition, Koen is historically well-informed, and her research is appreciated! The moment I finished the novel, I went out to purchase its sequels, which I can't wait to begin reading. It's going to be another sleepless week..."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I say it fell short only because when I got this book I hoped it would delve further into Alice's life, and beyond that, into Diana's life. After reading TAGD, which is one of my all-time favorite novels, Ms. Koen hinted strongly at an interesting history for Alice and Diana, and I just knew that a prequel had to come at some point. YEARS later, it is here, and while I loved the book, I was dissapointed in that it only spanned a couple of years (if that)and then ended abruptly at the most interesting time (I won't divulge so that non-readers won't be spoiled). And not one hint of Diana - so I am wondering if there is such a thing as a \\"second prequel\\"?? Ms. Koen simply MUST go further into Alice's life after this book ended and definitely introduce us to Diana when she was younger!! I want more!!!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"What a read! Like Miss Koen's other historical novels, I couldn't put Dark Angels down 'til I reached page 530. I was so totally immersed in the court life of Charles II and the story of Alice,his Portuguese Queen Catherine's lady-in-waiting, I barely came up for air. Trying to speed read was impossible because every paragraph was filled with details and action that was not to be missed. Court life was so different from our lives today, the book makes for fascinating reading and not a little history in the passing, fictional or non. But I might say that at the last, it's as though the author got tired of writing her novel and decided to zip it up. The story came to a sudden and predictable ending, leaving many questions of \\"what happened to\\". Could this have been Koen's way of setting up for a sequel? Let's hope so."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"We get the story of Alice Verney, with this prequel of Koen's first novels (Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face). Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like this novel the best. Koen depicts Alice as both a good person and full of faults(mainly pride and difficulty forgiving) from beginning to end, who still matures and grows as a person while trying to forge a life for herself and her friends in the increasingly treacherous court life surrounding the reign of Charles II. I found the novel's conclusion satisfying and I'm glad all ends weren't tied up in a saccharine and formulaic happy bow."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because I thought the last 150 pages or so were exciting and fun to read.

Its characters, from King Charles II and Louis IX, to the leading lights in both England and France, are finely drawn and explained. The historical detail and social conventions of the time are well-researched and rich in detail. The author, Karleen Koen, does an excellent job of explaining the times and the competing forces at work following the downfall of Cromwell. The plot itself is exciting and thoroughly enjoyable. Ultimately, I couldn't put the book down, although I was somewhat chagrined that I fell for such an unliterary entertainment.

It is 1670, ten years after the Restoration in England took place.A little history revisited: in 1649, the unthinkable happened -Charles 1 was beheaded. His heir, Charles, Prince of Wales, drifted around Europe at the mercy of various monarchies for food and shelter. Impoverished, Charles spent 10 years attempting to raise an army and enough money to mount an invasion of England, ruled as a republic by Oliver Cromwell.Charles's first attempt at invasion failed. It wasn't until Cromwell died in 1659 and England began to fracture that a return to monarchy was viewed as the only hope of salvation. Charles was invited to return, which he did in 1660. The Restoration Settlement, however, gave Charles II notice Parliament would not be ruled by him. For most of his reign, Charles was tied to Parliament until, in 1681, he prorogued Parliament and reigned as an absolute monarch until his death.His first years as King of England were not easy; a war with the Dutch was unsuccessful, the plague decimated London's population in 1665 and the Great Fire of London in 1666 necessitated the rebuilding of the majority of the City.Perhaps from his youthful experiences of deprivation of even the basic necessities, Charles II was determined to live life to its fullest. A quote from Charles II perhaps sums up his motto: \\"I always admired virtue - but I could never imitate it\\". This attitude bestowed upon him the moniker \\"The Merry Monarch\\", which has survived down through the centuries.Charles II married Catherine of Braganza of Portugal in 1662. She was unable to carry pregnancies to term, thereby leaving the succession of the crown in doubt. The only contenders were his bastard son, Duke of Monmouth, son of his mistress Lucy Walter, and his younger brother, James, Duke of York. Charles adamantly maintained his oldest illegitimate son would never inherit the Throne and divorcing his Queen was out of the question.Dark Angels opens in May 1670, ten years after Charles II has been restored, and his beloved sister, Henriette, wife of Louis XIV of France's younger brother, Phillipe, arrives in England for a brief reunion with her oldest brother. Along with Henriette, arrives Alice Verney, a maid of honor.Alice, having left England 2 years earlier under the shadows of a scandal, is determined to once again become one of Catherine's maids of honor. Her second goal: marry the elderly, powerful Duke of Balmoral, ride on his coattails and exert control over Court members.The daughter of the \\"wily, ambitious rogue\\", Sir Thomas Verney, Alice inherits many of his traits. She is loyal to a select few, schemes to realize her dreams at the cost of others, is devious and unforgiving towards those who defy her will. In fact, she has few redeeming qualities.This is the beauty of the character Karleen Koen has drawn. Alice is far from the perfect heroine and there are many reasons to dislike her, but she is most intriguing. Koen keeps her characters true to their nature and, should there be internal reflections and transformations, she doesn't portray these evolutions instantaneously. She draws them out over time, much the same as human nature does.Dark Angels is over 500 pages of secrets, plots, counterplots, counterplots to the counterplots, betrayals, false loyalty, extravagance, passion, heartache and, yes, even some regrets. That's a one line summarization of Dark Angel.I finished this novel a few weeks ago and spend a great deal of time pondering how to write a review; not because I didn't like the novel - I just couldn't figure out how to adequately convey the mastery with which Karleen Koen blends all the above aspects into a novel (and keeps track of of it all!). The plot never sags or becomes tiresome; there is just too much action for that to happen.I highly recommend reading Dark Angels prior to Through a Glass Darkly so the storyline flows chronologically, even though the books were not written in that manner. Now Face to Face is the sequel to Through a Glass Darkly*This review was written at arm's length. I did not receive renumeration or gift in kind for review of this novel.*"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I love, love, love, love, love historical fiction.Through a Glass Darkly: A Noveland its sequelNow Face to Face: A Noveltake you on a grand tour through English and French high society in the 1700s. Koen's evocative writing style and incredible descriptions of time and place will transport you into a world of intrigue, paranoia, and love (and fortunes) lost and gained. The love story underpinning the first two books alternates between touching and heart-breaking and is as fine a cautionary tale about the double-edged nature of getting what one wants as any I have had the pleasure of reading.Dark Angels: A Noveltakes you deeper into the backstory of one of the most endearing and curmudgeonly characters in the two original novels. And fortunately for you, dear readers, the books are all readily available now (when I was first introduced to the series, through the prequel, I had to painstakingly track down used copies of the sequel - and pay an arm and a leg for it.

Once I actually read it I found it to be a well-researched and enjoyable look at Restoration England. The plot included plenty of intrigue and romance, but with depth. There was only a hint of sex, and that was just fine because the story carried itself quite nicely. I didn't realize it was a prequel to Through a Glass Darkly, but was pleased when I realized it.

Just a good historical fiction novel with plenty of everything that is good about Regency-era England. I made my way swiftly through the book in a couple days and put it down, satisfied."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Set in 1670 England, \\"Dark Angels\\" is the prequel to Karleen Koen's \\"Through A Glass Darkly,\\" (one of my favorite historical novels). Although not as well written as the sequel, \\"Dark Angels\\" is entertaining fiction, chock full of multiple storylines, betrayal, romance, politics, deep friendship, adultery and murder.King Charles I reigned from 1625 until his execution in 1649. He was a staunch advocate of the \\"Divine Right of Kings,\\" and believed he received his power directly from God. Thus, he was in a constant struggle for power with Parliament. Many of his subjects feared he was attempting to gain absolute power. His reign was marked by two Civil Wars, after which the monarchy was abolished and a republic called The Commonwealth of England was set up under Oliver Cromwell. Charles was subsequently beheaded for \\"high treason and high crimes.\\" After the death of Cromwell, England was in a state of political turmoil and Charles the First's son was invited back to rule England.Our story begins during the Restoration Period when Charles II, known as the \\"Merrie Monarch,\\" is king. Young and vibrant Alice Verney, a maid of honor to Princess Henriette of France, (Charles' sister), had been living at Louis XIV's Baroque-style court for two years. When the princess dies a horrible death, Alice returns to England and is anxious to establish herself at court, which she does by becoming maid of honor to Charles II's Queen Catherine. A born courtier, the prideful Alice wheels and deals with the best of the politically ambitious. She is determined to make the most adventitious marriage possible, with wealth & title foremost in her plans. The elderly Duke of Balmoral seems a likely target, even though she is deeply attracted to Richard Saylor, the handsome but relatively poor Commander of the King's Guard. Unfortunately Saylor only has a small part in this tale. This lack of character development makes Alice's and Richard's romance appear to be a shallow one.Loyal to her beloved queen, Alice sets out to investigate those she believes to be plotting against the crown, including her own father. Potential foreign wars and would-be assassins complicate the story and increase the tension.Real life characters people \\"Dark Angels, such as the Duchess of Cleveland, the Duke of Buckingham, the actress Nell Gwynn, King Charles's spaniels, d'Effiat, and Beuvron, as well fictional characters.As I wrote above, the writing is not as tight as \\"Through A Dark Darkly\\" and its sequel, \\"Now Face To Face,\\" which I recently read and enjoyed. The characters In \\"Dark Angels\\" are not as well developed either. But the narrative is fast-paced and fascinating as is this period in history. If you like this book, then you should definitely look into Ms. Koen's sequels which take place in the future when Alice is a grandmother. The older Alice is a much richer figure.I found Alice Verney to be a rather arrogant, self-absorbed young woman. I believe her major task as the novel's heroine is to mature and become more empathetic, which she does to a point. However, I never felt her to be a truly likable character. In reality, perhaps she could not be a \\"better\\" person given the competition and intrigue at a court where everyone has their own personal agenda.Jana Perskie"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I loved Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, but Dark Angels left me feeling cheated. This book centers on the character of Alice Verney, who is Barbara Devane's grandmother in author's previous books. I was expecting all the wonderful details of Alice and Richard's epic romance, which the author mentioned over and over in the previous books, but this book sorely disappoints.It seemed like Richard fell in love with Alice out of default. The woman he really loved, the beautiful Renee, broke his heart when she became King Charles II's mistress. When Richard couldn't have Renee, his love for Barbara sprang up out of no where. It seemed like an after thought to me. Same for Alice's love for Richard. All she talks about during the whole book is how she dreams of marrying the Duke of Balmoral. Suddenly, and I do mean suddenly, these two realize there is something between them.As other reviewers have pointed out, where was Roger Devane in this novel? All we hear about in TADG is how close Richard and Roger were. Roger gets misty eyed at even the mention of Richard's name, and elderly Alice wonders if Richard loved Roger more than her. Yet, Roger was never once mentioned in this novel. What a disappointment. And why wasn't Diana's birth included in this book? I was convinced I would come across it at the end, but I was wrong. There are no mention of children at all. They get married and that's it. The book is over.I wouldn't say the book was horrible, but it pales in comparison to the other two books. You could feel Barbara's love for Roger in the previous books.It was a reak tear jerker. This book reads more like a history book, with all the information about the murder of Princess Henriette, which is fine, but I'm still bummed about how Alice and Richard fell in love. Alice only started to notice her feelings for Richard towards the end of the book and vice versa. Alice spends the whole book holding a grudge against two old friends and playing pranks on the former mistress of the king. It's hard to believe this troublesome little girl grows up to the wonderful and wise Duchess of Tamworth.This book was ok, just ok. If you really loved Through a Glass Darkly and Now Face to Face, you should read this book just to get a glimpse of a young Alice. However, don't go out of your way to buy it if you haven't read the other books."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I had not read Through A Glass Darkly when I started Dark Angels, so I knew nothing about the characters of the Duke and Duchess of Tamworth. (I got Dark Angels for $5 at my local Barnes and Nobles and thought to give it a try.) I went into Dark Angels with an open mind and was hoping for an interesting historical fiction novel with a touch of romance. For the most part I was not disappointed.Ms. Koen is one of those authors who write their novels in almost exhaustive detail. I often found myself skipping large chunks of pages that contain paragraph after paragraph of descriptions. Other readers may enjoy copious details, but I prefer character development and plot rather than knowing what fabric the curtains in the main hall are made of.I have to say that I trudged through the beginning of this book, mainly for the reason listed above. I found character names too confusing to remember (most of the characters are known by two names: a \\"normal\\" first name and then their title) and I got confused about the constant location changes. When I got to the middle of the book, I have to say that the characters became much more engrossing and the plot unfolded in such a surprising way that I literally could not put the book down. The first half of the book took me almost a month to read while the second half of the book took me less than a day to finish.I am reading Through A Glass Darkly now and can agree with reviewers who find little correlation between the Alice of TAGD and how she is portrayed in Dark Angels. I can't decide which Alice to like, as they both are interesting characters- but still seem to me like two distinctly different characters. If no one had told me that Dark Angels was the prequel/sequel of TAGD, I never would have guessed that Alice was the Duchess of Tamworth.In Dark Angels, I like the refreshing twist that Alice is not beautiful but has an interesting personality to make up for it. I also like that Richard isn't instantly smitten and obsessed with her. While the book was more historical fiction than romance, I have to say that the small moments of Richard and Alice realizing their affection for one another was a joy to read. I also found their relationship more realistic than most novels of this genre because they weren't instantly in love with one another. Richard isn't the stereotypical courtier who sleeps with every woman in court and is suddenly smitten by a virginal beauty, and Alice isn't the type of girl to get instantly swept off her feet/seduced/raped by a cavalier charmer.The sex scenes in this book were not numerous and not overly graphic- I actually thought the book could have used more, but it was engrossing enough without them.I would have given this book five stars except that I felt it dragged in several places. I look forward to finishing TAGD and Now Face to Face."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This novel began so well, I'm not sure where it went wrong for me. At the end I couldn't quite fathom the point of it all. I was immediately engaged by the main character Alice Verney. She was intelligent, sensitive, pragmatic, ambitious, and very proud. Somewhere along the line I stopped liking her. I understood, and sympathized with her feelings toward her former chum Caro who slept with Alice's fiance. But after a while I just didn't care very much about her bitterness.I guess my big problem with the novel is that it couldn't seem to make up it's mind as to what it was. I thought the strongest story line was Alice's determination to stop a French bought assassin. That was the most exciting part of the story. Her meddling in her friend's lives could have supported that story, but her entire personal life seemed to be happening in another book. It was a strange disconnect and it finally lost me about 40 pages from the end of the book. I skimmed the rest to get to the very end, which I found unsatisfying.I do think the author did a great job of describing England under Charles II. The setting was totally believable.I'm kind of conflicted about what rating to give this. I'd say it's more of a 2.5 stars for the setting, writing style, and Alice Verney at the beginning. I just wish the rest of the book had been as engaging."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This book tells the story of Alice Verney, Barbara Alderlys grandother, and the Duchess of Tamsworth. I was truly expecting a story of romance between Alice and Richard, who she would later marry. Those of you looking for that story, its here, but way towards the end and not really the central focus of the book.The book starts about 10 years into the reign of Charles, known to history as the Merry Monarch for his many mistresses and children(none of them by his queen, Catharine of Branganza).After many years apart, the king's sister is returning to England for a visit. She is married to a Prince of France, and while there are children from the marriage, it is known that the princesse is not happy, nor is here husband. When she returns to France, she dies suddenly. Alice, one of her ladies in waiting, is determined to finds out 1.) who killed her and 2) Who is now threatining her new mistress, Catherine of Bragnza.Throughout the book, there are plots against the queen, plots for the queens, plots, to marry. Also bits and pieces mixed in about a spy from the french court, who is reluctant.Alice, while at times stubborn and arrogantly sure she knows whats best for her friends, is likable, but almost a different person then the one we meet in TAGD. Although this is to be expected. After all, in DA, she hasnt gone through the hardships of losing her entire family just yet. So, she's a young girl here, with a young girl's attitude and assurance in herself.There's no way i could possibly list everything here that goes on. It is shorter then its two predessors, but still worth the read.The only thing i didn't like, was not enough Richard and Alice together!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I'm going out of order, having read this between \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" and \\"Now Face to Face\\" (which I'm in the midst of), but since they stand alone, it works.HOWEVER, I echo the reviewer who says that there are too many loose ends -- we need to hear the story BETWEEN \\"Dark Angels\\" and \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\"...

It didn't. There are too many characters, and too many plots; what I really wanted was more information and insight about the Alice Varney and Richard Saylor characters. Koen hints at the childhood and youthful development of Richad and Alice, but does not develop the plot around them. Why not? Further, who is Jerusalem Saylor - She has the sight;and is known to Prince Rupert. Why? How? TELL ME!!!Where is Roger Devane and Phillip? Was there ever a love story or the possiblity of a love story between Roger and Richard? The story of these pivitol characters in the new novel might also have been explored. Koen's new novel raises to many new questions, and the reader is provided few details and examples about the main characters lives and loves. The novel has too many twists and turns,unresolved issues and these equal confusion. I guess I was looking for just an old - fashioned love story, with a historical setting, characters whose lives were inriguing,heartbreaking, and altogether too human... Maybe next time."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had a hour to kill one evening and was looking forward to this book. After I read 80 pages I threw the darn book in the trash. It was boring, along with the characters. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Of late there seems to be quite a few books being released about Charles II of England and Restoration England. This I don't mind at all, since I'm always on the look-out for a good read, fiction or otherwise. And author Karleen Koen certainly knows how to craft a good story, filled with plenty of details, dark deeds, and romance. Having written two previous novels, Through a Mirror Darkly and Now Face to Face, she takes one of the major characters from the previous works, and gives new depth and understandstanding to Alice Verney in Dark Angels.Alice Verney is a tough young survivor, serving the King of England's sister, Henriette-Anne, as one of her maids-of-honour. Married at a young age to Louis XIV's brother, Monsieur, Madame is coming to England to visit her beloved brother, Charles II, and Alice is coming with her. Of course, for stubborn Alice, it's also going to be a chance to see her machinating father, Sir Thomas, and the man who jilted her for one of her best friends. It's a rare chance to serve up a dish of cold revenge, and Alice is more than ready to do so with a plan that will not only catapult her into the heights of the king's court, but also enable her to snap her fingers at any future trouble as well.But that is going to take some patience and skill, as Alice's target is rather unaware of her scheme. The Duke of Balmoral is elderly, and the uncle of Lord Colefax, the man who spurned Alice years earlier. Cole, married to the stuttering Caro, is still hot for Alice, so she is not only dodging her former suitor, but others who are interested in her as well. Finally, there are Alice's fellow maids-of-honour, her friend Barbara, shy and loving a man who has little to recommend him and Renee, a beautiful French girl of good birth and little money.But Madame, as Princess Henriette is known, isn't just on a homey visit with family, for she is on a mission to bring England and France closer together, forging an alliance between the two kings, and an even bolder plan underneath. But when the princess returns to France, she is taken ill and dies suddenly, quite possibly at the hands of her own husband, the jealous Monsieur. And Alice suddenly finds herself returned to England, up against a poisoner, and a young soldier who is more than she thinks, and the prize of the Duke of Balmoral is hovering just beyond her grasp.It's quite a tale, moving beyond the typical historical romance, and spinning a tale that blends plenty of plotting and actual history. It's that last touch that made the book very enjoyable for me, with the author able to keep the balance between what really happened and the author's own creations. The characters of the Verneys, Balmoral, and Richard Saylor are all fictional, but they would have easily lived in Restoration England. It may be interesting to other readers that Queen Catherine, Charles II's wife, was pretty much as she is portrayed here, struggling to be Catholic in a very protestant England, and always living under the threat of being divorced and sent away. She was also able to openly tolerate her husband's many mistresses, and the open distrust that the courtiers had for her. So too are the varied mistresses, from actress Nell Gwynn, the greedy Barbara Villiers, and his chase of other women.But there are a few drawbacks as well. Some might find the use of homosexuality and sex to be a bit disturbing -- Monsieur was well-known for his fondness for handsome young men, and the character of Mistress Neddie is far from an oddity of the times. As for the sinister Henry Angel/Henri Ange, history has always been arguing over what caused Madame's sudden and painful death that so horrified people at the time, and there is the famous 'Affair of the Poisons' that shook the French court a few years after her death. Both Balmoral and Alice are a touch more ruthless than what we usually see in historical novels, but I found them to be a refreshing change. One other aspect that I found a bit tiresome was the character of Jerusalem Saylor, Richard's mother, who is the 'white witch' of the novel -- despite the fondness of modern authors who keep thrusting such folk into their novels, the idea of the modern 'good' witch who uses her powers for healing and magick is a fairly recent idea, and although folk rememdies were certainly well-documented from the time, there is very little to actually be seen in the surviving histories. But it makes for a clever touch, and at least Koen doesn't go overboard with it as say, Philippa Gregory does in her work. So it's a forgiveable sin.For those who like their novels full of details, and what might have been, this is an enjoyable read. It was enough to make me want to reread both of Koen's previous novels, and rediscover Alice Verney and her family."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Is there a more fascinating time or place than the court of King Charles II? I cannot think of one, and Karleen Koen lends her pen to bring it alive in \\"Dark Angels\\".Koen has a knack for hooking the reader early on with hints and promises, and interesting characters. She writes romantic heroes, heroines and villains extremely well, as readers of \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" know. I flew through the pages and loved the characters, costumes and themes centering on the struggles between love and greed or jealousy, forgiveness and revenge, and strategic scheming and surprise. Koen transports you to the decadent Courts of the Sun King (Louis XIV of France & creator of Versailles) and Charles II of England, and drapes you in damask, jewels and lace, and on the next page sends you to seedy brothels and privy court chambers for some debauchery, drunkeness and gambling. Regicide, religious wars, royal gossip and exploits, romance and gold digging rule the day. It is delicious fun!The real story of \\"Dark Angles\\" introduces us to Alice Verney who is first a young Maid of Honor to Princess Henrietta Anne of France (sister to Charles II of England) and then a not-so-young Maid of Honor to the shunned Queen Catherine in England. She's had her heart broken in love and loyalty through the betrayals of a friend and lover, and the murder of Madame, Princess Henrietta. Alice puts up a condescending, stand-offish front in an attempt to protect herself and others, and finds that such a barrier isolates us from those we love, rather than keep them close. She is sassy, spoiled, scheming and sophisticated, and yet disillusioned by life at court. We see an early glimpse of the life lessons that shaped the loving, accepting and wise grandmother we met in \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\".Koen brings alive the sexual charge of the time through accurate presentations of its rogues from the well documented exploits of Kings Charles II of England and Louis XIV of France to the English Earl of Rochester and Sir John Sedely who drunkenly bumble and grope their way through the background of this book. It was a drunken, decadent time of debauchery and hedonism, and great fun to re-live through books such as this, \\"The King's Touch\\", \\"The Perfect Royal Mistress\\", \\"Duchess: A novel of Sarah Churchill\\" or even \\"Forever Amber\\" (I am not a huge fan, but many others are).I gave this book a \\"4 star\\" rating because it is just simply an intriguing, fast, fun escape read, but it does have its flaws. The main draw back is that Koen seems confused as to whether she wanted to write a \\"whodunnit?\\", a romance or a fantastic period novel. She delivers pieces of all three, and that leaves fans with genre preferences feeling disappointed. The good news is that this novel seems ripe for a sequel (or two!) to fill the time between its end and the beginning of her stellar debut, Through A Glass Darkly. I love the promise of more to come... I only hope the wait is short!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is hard to believe that Dark Angels and Through a Glass Darkly were written by the same person. With the exception of some of the names of the charecters there were few similarities between the books. Through A Glass Darkly offers genuine emotion, clever dialogue and believable relationships, not to mention the sharply drawn portraits of Barbara, Roger, Diana, the Duchess and the rest. I will admit that Dark Angel's Alice was many-faceted, but everyone else in the book was one-dimensional. The story itself was fast-paced for the most part, but didn't really make me care about any of the protagonists. However, the biggest disappointment was that Dark Angels never fleshed out the intriging parts of the Duchess's story that had only been hinted at in Through A Glass Darkly; e.g. Alice and Richard's early relationship with Roger, the births and deaths of their children, Diana's marriage, Richard's military successes. Even Richard's proposal to Alice was different from the way it had been portrayed in TAGD. This book is supposed to be a \\"prequil\\" to Through a Glass Darkly but as far as I am concerned that prequil has yet to be written."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"This prequel to Through a Glass Darkly does not disappoint. If you like Charles II and the period of The Restoration, you'll love this book. The character of Alice Verney is intelligent, charming, controlling, manipulative and sympathetic.

Through her story the reader learns a great deal about the personal and political history of King Charles - the tragedy, the whimsy and the fascinating people that orbit his sphere. Great book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"If you enjoyed \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" I think you will like \\"Dark Angels.\\" This prequel tells the story of Barbara's grandmother Alice and her grandfather Richard. Koen gives us a story rich with detail and does a wonderful job of bringing the period to life. The Restoration period in it's grandeur and degradation is fully presented. She doesn't spare her characters the warts and all approach either. Alice particularly, is a three-dimensional character capable of kindness, generosity, and terrible, hurtful pride. A real person, not a cardboard character.I enjoyed the book enormously, but please, Ms. Koen, we need another volume taking us from Alice's time to Barbara's! And don't skimp on Diana's story, either. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"It is true that Dark Angels is different from Koen's first and very successful novel, Through A Glass Darkly (as well as different from the sequel Now Face to Face), however, this is truly Koen's finest work to date.Barbara of TAGD and NFTF was the conventional romance heroine: beautiful, plucky, encounters misfortune but ultimately prevails. Alice, the grandmother of TAGD, is a more complex, more realistic, more human character. I found myself rooting more for Alice than I ever did for Barbara, who had too much going for her too young.People who have never read Karleen Koen, and who would scoff at the typical romance novel, should read this book. It is full of carefully-researched details about the late 17th century (an extremely interesting time that truly lays the groundwork for the modern era in which we live). Koen brings this century to life. I felt transported to that time, which I have found very rarely in books and movies that attempt to portray times other than our own.Whether you're a TAGD fan, looking for a good story, or a European history buff, I recommend this book. It has enough of the \\"old\\" to remain interesting to Koen fans, with plenty of the \\"new\\" style to attract first-time Koen readers. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book in order to feel qualified to review it. Koen's other book, \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" is one of my favorite historical novels, and I probably read it once a year. This one, however, is just not enjoyable. After I had read 1/3 of it, I still felt no connection to Alice, the main character. The writing was very disjointed, and it was very hard to tell who was talking or being talked about a lot of the time. I loved the character of Alice as the grandmother in \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\", and I was really looking forward to reading about her younger life. The Alice in \\"Dark Angels\\" did not mesh with the character as I knew her in the other book, and I wish I had never read this one. Very very disappointing."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Unlike a lot of other reviewers below, I had never read any of Koen's previous books, so I was able to judge DARK ANGELS on its own merits and not how it stacked up to my expectations. And I loved it. It started a bit slow while I sorted out the enormous cast and the author built up the historical backdrop, but the characters are so strongly drawn and the details of court life are so fascinating that I found myself staying up all night to keep reading. I think I'd call it a mystery first and foremost, not specifically a love story--I'm not sure which loose ends should have been tied up because the author answered all questions about who did what to whom. The missing boy was DEAD (this won't be a spoiler), and I didn't need Koen to spell it out to make it more obvious. Give DARK ANGELS a chance on its own merits and you won't be sorry. Alice springs to life almost instantly and even though she's not universally admirable, she's always fascinating. The book is complex, brilliantly plotted, engrossing, engaging, and even--dare I say it?--educational with all the intimate, intricate details of life in Charles II's court. I was afraid that she wouldn't wrap up the love story to my personal expectations but, relief, she did. (BTW, did the rest of you notice that Ned, a minor character here, is the subject of the movie STAGE BEAUTY?)"},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Welcome to the court of Charles II, hotbed of corruption, both political and moral. Enter Alice Verney, who aspires to a command a position of power within the court and seeks to attain her goal by marrying the aging Duke of Balmoral. Longstanding friendships are threatened by Alice's quest as well as her unequivocal need to control not only her own life but also the lives of those around her.Alice is an unconventional heroine in the respect that she has always had money and been accustomed to the finer things. Unlike the \\"up from the gutter and into the glitter\\" characters that usually make their appearance in these historical sagas, Alice is initially not a very likable character. She is manipulative and deceitful, but does manage to present the reader with a colorful portrait of a woman of her era.The author manages to evoke the flavor of the 17th century and capture of the Restoration-era mindset with its brazen women and conspiratorial men. Most of the characters in this narrative quagmire subscribe to the theory that their machinations and schemes are a necessary by-product of success and that \\"life isn't filled with easy choices and we all get our hands dirty from time to time\\". Personally, there is only one character in this entire novel that I would be inclined to trust with my life.Finally, let me say that the book ends on a somewhat unfulfilling note. Two of the characters, Henri Ange the poison-maker, and Walter the young stable hand disappear from the pages without a resolution to their stories. Guess I am one of those readers who wants all loose ends neatly tied up with a big red bow. 2 1/2 STARS."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I had high expectations for it because I loved Through a Glass Darkly and its sequel Now Face to Face.Dark Angels is the prequel to both those books. It's the story of Barbara's grandmother, Alice, as a young girl in the court of Charles II, \\"the Merry Monarch.\\" The novel opens upon an historical event: the day Charles's sister Minette arrives home from the French court for a visit after ten years away. Afterwards, Alice secures for herself a position in the court of Queen Catherine. While the author does a remarkable job describing the events of the time, she captures none of the debauchery and licentiousness that characterized the court of Charles II; all of the characters seem lifeless and flat. There's a mystery included, I guess to add some excitement, but it was anticlimactic.Alice in the 1670s is 16 and mature beyond her years. The problem I had with Alice's character is that she appears to be a completely different person from the woman she becomes in TAGD and NFTF! I found myself completely disliking the Alice who appears here. Another thing I disliked was the relationship between Alice and her future husband, Richard. There was none of the \\"spark\\" that I expected; they don't end up together until the very end. It left me thinking, \\"now what?\\" Let's hope there's a sequel planned.As a novel of the Restoration period, I recommend Kathleen Windsor's Forever Amber over this book."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Not quite on par with the classics of this genre, however this earns a solid 4 stars. I enjoyed this novel very much."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"Alice Verney, a maid of honor to Princess Henriette of France returns to England after her mistress's mysterious and horrible death, with the ambition to marry the elderly Duke of Balmoral. This ambition holds firm in spite of her attraction to Richard Saylor, an enterprising soldier who, while he appreciates Alice's wit and political savvy, is competing with the king himself for the affections of Renee DeKaroulle, a French beauty who cannot quite make up her mind whose affections she truly desires.I was drawn to Alice the moment I started reading. Koen shapes the main character of the story to be someone who is cunning and daring, clawing her way up the totem pole for status and respect in a world where women were afforded little of either.The historical England that Koen creates in \\"Dark Angels\\" is breathtaking. Her phrase and descriptions are truly believable and transport her readers directly into seventeenth century England and France. I was also drawn to Richard Saylor who I thought made a perfect leading man, and even though I knew it impossible throughout the entire book, wanted him and Alice to finally be together.Despite its slow start, \\"Dark Angels\\" delivered for me. Towards the end the book became a page turner, but was somewhat of a let-down with its predictable ending, and sometimes tiring plot twists. Overall, it was a great historical fiction, and I will more than likely be coming back to Koen for more."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"I liked the book but it left a lot of holes to be filled.

As in her other books, the protagonists are fictional, tossed about by the real-life actions of the historically based characters. It makes for an occassionally queasy balance, and often in the story of Alice Verney there's the feeling that Koen is stretching to make her own characters fit into the proscribed history. While the sense of that history is strong and well-researched, there are times when Koen betrays her romance background, and the prose becomes luridly purple, particularly when describing Alice's encounters with Richard Saylor. To anyone familiar with the period, her interpretations of the historical figures can be a bit odd, too: while her version of Louis XIV's bisexual brother Monsieur seems right on the mark, her charcterization of the English king Charles struck me as curiously lifeless, without any of the zest of the Merrie Monarch. Readers should be forwarned that this is a prequel to Koen's \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\", showing us Alice Verney as a young woman. Since I didn't really remember the detail of that earlier book (except that I'd enjoyed it), I reread it after reading \\"Dark Angels\\". Curiously, however, the two don't really seem to mesh, with this version of Alice an improbable predecessor. But as a glimpse into an underused period of history, this is enjoyable, if flawed, and worth reading."},{"Title":"Dark Angels: A Novel (Random House Large Print)","review":"DARK ANGELS is by far the most amazing book I have read in over a decade. A friend recommended THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY to me, and when I saw there was a prequel to it, I decided to begin with the beginning and work my way to the other books.Having read this long (over 500 pages book) and detailed story in 48 hours, because I simply could not stop (and re-read many heart-warming/wrenching lines again and again), I can't wait to read the other books in this series.Karleen Koen is a master storyteller. It is true that sometimes her sentences are jumpy, convoluted, unclear, and that sometimes I felt the endless descriptions of flowers, clouds, dresses, jewels, furniture, tools, spices, and you-name-it bogged the story...HOWEVER the characters are phenomenal! The plot is intriguing, gripping, surprising, amazing, and refreshing in its uniqueness. The heroes are brave, clever, noble, fierce, compassionate, but also humanly flowed and well-rounded.

I think you appreciate the characters and story more.And what remarkable and marvelous characters they are! It is authors like Karleen Koen who keep me reading (thank you, thank you, thank you , Ms. Koen). She doesn't dilute anything. We get the full frontal attacks of ugliness and the whole enchilada of wonderfulness all in one. If you are looking for the sugar-coated easily digested brain candy that comprises much of the romance genre, this book will probably not please you. It has too many layers, too much going on, and not everything ends happily. Much of the novel is spent on political intrigue and *SPOILER* it isn't until the end that we really see the hero and heroine come together romantically. You want more of Richard and Alice (especially if you read the previous two books first) because they are such dynamic and strong and courageous and honorable and heroic characters. Who writes characters like this anymore? Very few authors indeed know how to illustrate all the flaws and facets like Karleen Koen. It really says something about an author when we get to see the darkest corners of a character's heart and still fall in love with them.

One by one, the standard platitudes about discrimination and poverty fall before Sowell's relentless statistical assault. Discrimination causes poverty? How about the Chinese minority in Southeast Asia? Discrimination against the Chinese minority is actually written into the Malaysian constitution. And yet the Chinese minority still dominates the economy. Likewise, Japanese-Americans were discriminated against so badly that 120,000 of them were forcibly relocated during World War II. Yet by 1959 they had equaled whites in income, and by 1969 were earning one third more. Politics is the only way for a minority group to advance? To the contrary: the general pattern in the United States has been for a group to become wealthy first and only then to enter politics (if at all). The Irish, on the other hand, who placed such emphasis on political action, lagged behind other ethnic groups.The book is absolutely filled with information like this. Moreover, Sowell also discusses the perils of attributing income disparities to \\"racism\\" and \\"discrimination.\\" I had to laugh when I read the critical reviewer below who claimed that Sowell's book was \\"simplistic.\\" Whatever criticism one might make of it, no one who actually read the book could describe it that way. In fact, I'm a college professor who assigned the book to my students, and their general complaint was actually that it was too complicated! Sowell's whole point is that it is the current \\"civil rights\\" establishment that is simplistic-all statistical disparities between groups can have only one cause: discrimination. Sowell demonstrates how utterly untenable-and, yes, simplistic-such a suggestion is.Finally, the suggestion that because Sowell holds such views he can't \\"really\\" be black: that's an accusation this brave scholar has had to endure his whole life. Apparently, all blacks are supposed to hold the same opinions. I'd say that's pretty simplistic.In short: I am not aware of any other book on this subject that is so relentless in its demolition of tired myths about affirmative action and civil rights."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"Thomas Sowell is one of the most articulate and intelligent authors today. His books are well-researched, politically unconventional, and highly persuasive. In this work, Mr. Sowell confronts the &quot;rhetoric&quot; of the civil rights establishment and contrasts it with the &quot;reality&quot; of American society and American law. The liberal establishment, according to Mr. Sowell, made a key blunder in the late 1960s. After the civil rights revolution became public policy, many assumed that there would be &quot;statistical equality&quot; between whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in all categories from family income levels to loan-acceptance rates. Needless to say, this did not happen during the heady days of the civil rights revolution. Even in the year 2000, this equality still has yet to occur. The only explanation, according to activists, is systematic racism. It would be nearly impossible for Americans to believe that - nearly 50 years after the Brown decision - we still live in a systemically racist society. But that is precisely the rhetoric that is force-fed to the American public. Mr. Sowell, on the other hand, states that discrimination does not explain the statistical variance. For example, Asian-Americans outperform Anglo-Americans on virtually everything from SAT scores to PhDs. Surely no one would claim that American society discriminates against whites in favor of Asians. We must take other factors into account if we are to explain this mystery. Family size, age, educational courses chosen, and savings rates are just some of the myriad ways that our races distinguish themselves. When we control these factors, there is absolutely no divergence between the races. An African-American male and an Asian-American male of the same age, with the same education, in the same occupational field earn the same amount of money. The same is true of Hispanic men and white men. Incredibly, these statistics have been consistent since the 1960s when America was still supposedly a &quot;racist&quot; country. Of course, there were racists in the 1960s just like there are racists today. But Mr. Sowell points out that our nation is - contrary to the conventional wisdom- remarkably color-blind. This would shock most Americans initially but is largely consistent with daily experience. The vast majority of Americans are not racist and would resist the suggestion that they are secretly prejudiced. Mr. Sowell's studies reflect this hidden truth. The author also makes important points concerning the feminist movement. Once you control for all other factors, a man and woman earned the same income during the 1960s, even before the feminist movement. Men and women still earn the same paycheck today, even amidst the whirlwind concerning &quot;pay inequality.&quot; If there is a moral to Mr. Sowell's story it is that the original civil rights movement has become a hideous deformation of itself. The original movement was fought for the right reasons - equality before the law - and was remarkably successful as these statistics reveal. But - like most revolutions - this one didn't know when to quit. The political goal of &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; became perverted into &quot;equality of results.&quot; The prescription of affirmative action, largely unnecessary, has only alienated the vast white majority and did nothing to close the quality-of-life gap between whites and blacks (crime, drug use, single-parent families, etc.) On the other hand, it has certainly fattened the wallets and enhanced the profiles of public figures who make a healthy living denouncing the racism of American institutions, bullying private corporations, and winning elections. In their hearts, most Americans - white, black, Asian, and Hispanic - suspect that these activists are wrong. This book will solidify their conclusions and renew their pride in our multicultural and progressive society."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"Although written 20 years ago, Thomas Sowell's book about the Civil Rights Movement reads like it was penned last month. Unlike many academics that simply take social policy at face value and support any policy that sets out to help, Economist Dr. Sowell measures the success of initiatives against their purported intentions. This is a great formula for honest education, but it doesn't win many friends in academia.Sowell demonstrates how discrimination alone does not result in poverty. He points out the success of the Chinese minority in many Asian countries where discrimination against the Chinese is written into the constitution. He also points out the many hardships put towards Jews in history and their accumulation of wealth despite the hardships.He shows some curiosity in how striving for equal opportunity in America eventually became affirmative action. He has the same curiosity about how de-segregation became busing. He then takes a hard look at the special cases of women and blacks.Since the book was set at the 30th anniversary of Brown v. The Board of Education and the 20th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sowell examines the conditions of education and economics before and after those important dates. He finds just the kinds of facts that will be detested by the Civil Rights industry.Dr. Sowell concludes that Civil Rights have become an easy way to gain favor with whatever new initiative someone might design. Now everything is a Civil Right and every new plague known to man is not usually the result of a denial of Civil Rights.The question no one but Sowell asks is how can we expect an equal outcome in the world when humans all have different experiences and abilities? His conclusion is that the Civil Rights movement was important when Jim Crow insured unfair treatment, but now the term Civil Rights has been perverted to mean anything that gains some group or another power. In essence, the current reality of Civil Rights is, in fact, rhetoric.You may not understand the full impact of what Civil Rights mean today if you don't read these 140 pages. It gave me a new outlook."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"Sowell uses rigorous, but eminently readable logic in dispelling one affirmative action myth after another. He starts with an explanation of the unifying &quot;vision&quot; underlying affirmative action, then proceeds to isolate and obliterate liberal shibboleths such as the disparate impact fallacy, &quot;comparable worth&quot; nonsense, and many more specific points. He sometimes takes an economic perspective, as when he shows that paying a worker less than she is worth creates an economic opportunity for your competitor. Capitalistic competitive pressure is therefore an agent for equal employment opportunity. He then follows with &quot;The Special Case Of Blacks&quot;, and &quot;The Special Case of Women&quot;, where he deals specifically with Black and Female civil rights issues. Finally, what is best about this book, and what sets it apart from most other Affirmative Action tomes, is that it is neither overly academic or legalistic. However, it is uncompromisingly empirical, unforgivingly objective, and unabashedly candid. Lastly, and this it what makes it a 10 on my scale, is that it is simply &quot;one good read&quot;!"},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"Sowell, yet again, displays remarkable skill crafting what is probably the best short work on contemporary discrimination, civil rights and racial and ethnic differences. It is wonderfully rational and empirical in an age where discussion of the topic is more likely to result in irrational anger and appeals to emotional rather than logical arguments. He is a wonderful purveyor of the great maxim: &quot;Capitalism knows only one color: that color is green; all else is necessarily subservient to it, hence, race, gender and ethnicity cannot be considered within it.&quot;Thank God we still have rational, thoughtful voices such as Sowell's in our current wilderness of political emtionalism."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"In Civil Rights, Sowell looks at the effectiveness of civil rights legislation. He looks at how ethnic minorities have been able to suceed without civil rights legislation and how civil rights legislation and other legislation designed to help minorities such as minimum wage laws have not been as helpful as the designers have planned. Also Sowell looks at how civil rights legislation has expanded beyond provided equal opportunity to such programs as affirmative action and busing which have had questionable success. He also looks at such factors as the quality of education received and cultural attributs of ethnic groups across borders to help explain differances such as how ethnic Germans have higher rates of professional jobs then Hispanics not only in the United States but Hispanic countries as well and overseas Chinese have dominated science and engineering in several countries.Probably the best part of the book is Sowell's conclusion where he tries to debuke his critis and those that misterpret his views such as those saying that eliminating differences in IQ and education between ethnic groups would automatically eliminate economic differances but factors such as quality of education and choice of careers play important roles as well."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"If you just read one book by Thomas Sowell, then read this. It is a short 140 pages, but still sustains the case that \\"There is neither evidence nor pretense of evidence for the proposition that all groups are prepared to make the same sacrifices to achieve the same ends.\\" In other words: culture matters.Sowell begins by documenting the differences in outcomes between cultural groups. Chinese only make up five percent of the population of Malaysia, but they are about twice as wealthy as Malaysians (page 20). Furthermore, Chinese have achieved this despite being the victims of institutional discrimination that is actually written into the Malaysian Constitution. The Malaysian government also has an affirmative action program comparable to what we have in America. But after a decade there has been no effect; Chinese still are about twice as wealthy (page 111). You cannot attribute this to under enforcement since Malays make up the vast majority of the population and the Chinese are only a small minority.The success of the Chinese is no accident. They work hard. In the lower classes, Chinese did most of the work in mining and industrial occupations. They were later imported to South Africa to do similar work, but were then expelled because white workers could not compete. Most rickshaw pullers in Siam were Chinese because the Siamese would not stoop to doing that work. In Bangkok the Chinese were known for waking the earliest and working the longest hours. In the United States, Chinese workers did much of the railroad construction; it is rough, physical work that Whites typically refused (page 27). At the higher socioeconomic classes, Chinese are disproportionately likely to engage in fields with rigorous mathematical demands such as engineering and the hard sciences. Chinese outnumber Malays eight to one in science and fifteen to one in engineering. Similar patterns are found in the United States.This pattern is not unique to the Chinese. Jews have outperformed the native populations just about everywhere. This is also true of Armenians in the Middle East and Africa, and Italians in Argentina (page 20), and German farmers in the United States (page 47). (InRace and Culture: A World ViewSowell provides many other examples such as the Gujaratis from India).Sowell then concentrates on the role of blacks in the United States. The \\"equality of opportunity\\" civil rights movement (not to be confused with \\"equality of outcomes\\" movement that employees income redistribution) has been meaningful and profound. For example, college educated black males with six years of work experience have seen their earnings rise from 75% of whites to 98% of whites (page 52). In 1969, the economist Richard Freeman examined black and white homes with comparable rates of library cards and magazines, as well as for comparable schooling, and found no difference in earnings (page 80). This was before programs like affirmative action were put into place. In 1984, blacks of West Indian descent earn 94% of what whites make, compared to 62% for blacks as a whole (page 77). This is hard to reconcile with racism; a racist does not care about the about the cultural background of someone with dark skin. In a similar vein, married, two-income black couples make slightly more than comparable white couples (page 52). College educated black males with six years of work experience make 98% of what comparable whites make.The \\"equality of outcomes\\" civil rights movement has not been effective. From 1969 to 1984, earnings for Puerto-Ricans, Mexicans-Americans, and blacks all slightly declined (page 51).Another section of the book focuses on civil rights for women. At the time the book's publishing in 1984, women only made 59% of what men made. But that pay gap does not withstand scrutiny. Never-married women made 91% of what comparable never-married men made (page 92). And the remaining nine percent difference should not be put on discrimination because at higher levels of education women are less likely to pursue high paying technical careers in engineering and the sciences. At lower levels women are less likely to pursue (or be physically suited to) high paying work in construction, mining, and other physically demanding fields. Finally, single women who become mothers will have to make tradeoffs at work that will affect their earnings. This is shown by the fact that even in 1971, women who stayed single into their 30's and worked continuously had higher incomes than comparable men (page 93). The conclusion is that marriage allows men to work hard because their wives take on a disproportionate share of the housework and childrearing. But marriage and childrearing causes women to work less. Even when women reenter the workforce, their skills have become partially obsolete, and thus they receive lower pay.Finally, it should be noted that racism without institutional oppression is self-defeating. Racist attitudes in the early 20th century caused Japanese to get lower pay than whites. But as it became clear that the Japanese worked harder, that trend actually reversed and Japanese became more highly paid than whites (page 114). Paying whites more money put farmers with white workers at a competitive disadvantage. It was either hire Japanese, or go out of business. The biding war for Japanese labor stopped when Japanese were paid their fair wage - more than whites. When profits collide with racism, profits usually win. This is why racists usually seek to put their attitudes into law. That way you can stop people from backsliding and paying Japanese more money to lure them away from their current job. The same principle applies to discrimination against women. Hiring men would nearly double the cost of labor. Someone who is either less sexist (or more profit-driven) could make a killing by hiring women at almost half the price. Paying men above and beyond their market rate is the fast track to bankruptcy.Another book that I would recommend isThe Marriage Problem: How Our Culture Has Weakened Familiesby James Q. Wilson. It directly tackles the research showing the primary cause of poverty is the breakdown of marriage.

In his typical iconoclastic fashion Sowell parses through the conjecture dispelling myths, shedding light on why many of the promises of the movement have yet come to fruition.One of Sowell's main points is that discrimination is not the sole explanation for differences between groups. In addition Sowell explains how the movement ran into problems when it shifted its focus from fighting for equal opportunity to equality of results.Sowell jam packs wisdom and head hurting logic in this slim volume. This work is highly recommended for anyone who not only wants to understand the major events and ideas of this social movement, but also wants a perspective free from the usual dogma and colorful rhetoric."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"This book gives a good look into the misconceptions that many people have about the Civil Rights movement. Sowell keeps his examples simple and easy to follow. Anyone who reads this book will come away with a better understanding of what the Civil Rights movement was all about. What makes this book even better is the reader will come away with a better understanding of how the topic of Civil Rights is often manipulated for political gain."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"When heavy artillery is needed in the fight against collectivist propaganda, then it's time to wheel out Thomas Sowell. Now in his late seventies, this distinguished economist and political philosopher has devoted much of his career to combating the myths of political correctness.A prime example is his 1984 book, \\"Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality.\\" In this monument to common sense, Sowell examines the disastrous turn in the American civil rights movement from equality of opportunity to equality of results.Equality of opportunity is represented by the landmark 1954 lawsuit, Brown v. Board of Education, in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down racial segregation in the public schools. The spirit of equal opportunity also was present in the formulation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sowell brings several examples of Congressional sponsors of the bill (such as Hubert Humphrey) assuring their colleagues and the public that the legislation would not introduce quotas, preferences, or any other results-oriented mandate. The only target was to be intentional discrimination, and the burden of proof would be on the complainant.It did not take long, however, before the Supreme Court began its crusade to re-introduce racial considerations into education and other spheres of American life. In the 1968 case of Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, the Court ruled that a Virginia school district was in violation of the Brown decision because its schools were still either predominantly white or predominantly black--even though families now had the choice of sending their children to any school they desired. In other words, racial barriers had been dismantled, and equal opportunity was in force.But the results of the school district's new rules were not in keeping with the vision of Brown, said the Court. And thus the decision in Green paved the way for that great social catastrophe, the forced busing of children to achieve racial balance.Three years later, in 1971, we witness the advent of quotas, as the Department of Labor issued \\"goals and timetables\\" to\\"'increase materially the utilization of minorities and women'...Employers were required to confess to 'deficiencies in the utilization' of minorities and women whenever statistical parity could not be found in all job classifications, as a first step toward correcting this situation. The burden of proof--and remedy--was on the employer. 'Affirmative action' was now decisively transformed into a numerical concept, whether called 'goals' or 'quotas'.\\"This approach was soon rubber-stamped by the Supreme Court in the Weber case, in which the Civil Rights Act was stretched and distorted to allow affirmative action as we now know it.All of this, asserts Sowell, was latent from the outset in the \\"civil rights vision of the world,\\" which interprets statistical disparity as the work of discrimination and various \\"root causes.\\" According to this view, the so-called under-representation of blacks (or women or Hispanics or the victim group du jour) in a given domain is ipso facto evidence of discrimination, regardless of the intent of the authority in question. If a department of physics at a major university does not have a single black faculty member, then racism is lurking somewhere, even if no qualified black person ever submitted a resume.Sowell thoroughly deconstructs the madness behind this obsession with statistical disparity and its endless harvest of victim claims. Aggregate statistics on income prove nothing about underlying causes. An ethnic group can be poor in conditions of complete equality, or well-to-do in conditions of extreme adversity. The &eacute;migr&eacute; Chinese communities are a classic case. Says Sowell:\\"Throughout southeast Asia, for several centuries, the Chinese minority has been--and continues to be--the target of explicit, legalized discrimination in various occupations, in admission to institutions of higher learning, and suffers bans and restrictions on land ownership and places of residence...Yet in all these countries, the Chinese minority--about 5 percent of the population in southeast Asia--owns a majority of the nation's total investments in key industries...In Malaysia, where the anti-Chinese discrimination is written into the Constitution, is embodied in preferential quotas for Malays in government and private industry alike, and extends to admissions and scholarships at the universities, the average Chinese continues to earn twice the income of the average Malay.\\"Sowell also tackles the myth that women are underpaid and targets of discrimination in the workplace. When all the feminist hype is stripped away, we see that women are paid the same wages for the same work. True, women on average earn less then men, but this is due to (a) their greater tendency to work part-time; (b) interruptions in career due to the demands of motherhood; and (c) type of chosen profession.If we compare apples to apples, that is, men who have never married to women who have never married,\\"...an entirely different picture emerges. Women who remain single earn 91 percent of the income of men who remain single, in the age bracket from 25 to 64 years old. Nor can the other 9 percent automatically be attributed to employer discrimination, since women are typically not educated as often in such highly paid fields as mathematics, science, and engineering...This virtual parity in income between men who never marry and women who never marry is not a new phenomenon, attributable to affirmative action. In 1971, women who had remained unmarried into their thirties and who had worked since high school earned slightly higher incomes than men of the very same description. In the academic world, single women who received their Ph.D.'s in the 1930s had by the 1950s become full professors slightly more often than male Ph.D.'s as a whole.\\"A particularly biting testament against the travesty of affirmative action comes from Sowell's own personal experience. In the book's epilogue, he answers his critics. One of their many attacks is that Sowell (who is black) allegedly benefited in his own career from affirmative action. The fact that a scholar of Sowell's stature must rebut such a demeaning slander is a chilling reminder of the extent to which the apostles of the victim industry--from Supreme Court Justice William Brennan to Senator Barack Obama--have polluted American culture with their intellectual dross.We can only sigh with Thomas Sowell as he writes:\\"If there is an optimistic aspect of preferential doctrines, it is that they may eventually make so many Americans so sick of hearing of group labels and percentages that the idea of judging each individual on his or her own performance may become more attractive than ever.\\""},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"If you will get one message from this book, it will be that there is no dichotomy between the innate inferiority of a group X and socially-institutionalized discrimination against group X to explain the statistical disparities between the achievements of members of X and individuals who are not included in X. If this dichotomy were true, then this would mean that the American public school system is blatantly biased in favor of students of Asian descent, as this minority group outperforms students of non-Asian descent to a statistically significant degree. However, the allegation of pro-Asian discrimination in this respect is ludicrous. Unfortunately, as Thomas Sowell so eloquently argues, the aforementioned false dichotomy forms the basis for much of the anti-discrimination legislation in existence today.Thomas Sowell refutes many of the claims that are used to justify ongoing anti-discrimination laws. For example, the claim that statistical disparities in income and academic achievement imply that current society is still inherently (and possibly subconsciously) biased against blacks. However, Sowell argues that this cannot be true, as the fact that there are no statistically significant disparities between blacks from the West Indies and non-blacks serves as a counterexample.Another claim refuted by Sowell is that institutionalized discrimination against a minority group prevents that minority group from obtaining a high standard of living. Although this claim might be true depending on the level of institutionalized discrimination, Sowell provides counterexamples to this as well, as the Han Chinese are heavily legally discriminated against in Malaysia and yet they disproportionately enjoy a higher standard of living in that region.Sowell also challenges the claim that government programs that are designed to help a minority group, such as Affirmative Action, actually help that group. For example, instead, Sowell argues, by lowering admission standards for members of certain minority groups, universities merely ensure that these groups remain below their peers.There are plenty more examples of the above nature in this book.What explains these differences if not innate inferiority or institutionalized racism? Sowell argues that volitionally embraced cultural values explains these differences. Some cultures are almost entirely confined within a certain race. For example, redneck culture is considered entirely a white phenomenon.Fortunately, since individuals have free will, if an individual wishes to be successful then they merely need to embrace values such as diligence, ambition and perseverance and eschew values that are antagonistic to such ends."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"This brief (140 pages) overview of American civil rights remains important for understanding what has gone on in the struggle to have all Americans share in the rights recognized in the Constitution.The focus of the book is the question of rhetoric (I might have called it \\"intentions\\") and reality. In other words, what's important in the struggle for civil rights? Is it that one is rhetorically correct, with \\"good intentions\\" or is it more important that concrete individuals share in economic, social, and legal improvement in their status in life.The book is somewhat dated, as it was published in 1984. But its overall review of civil rights in America remains unchanged. Reading it now can be considered a snapshot of where civil rights were over 2 decades ago, but the differing visions of civil rights and how to attain them has not changed. Sowell is insightful, thought-provoking, and cuts to the chase, arguing carefully about his subject.

Why?!What does this have to do with Thomas Sowell and Civil Rights? Well, although I am neither a Democrat nor a liberal, politically speaking, my opinion of Senator Obama was that maybe he was a candidate who deserved consideration over the alternatives of Clinton or McCain. But then came the revelation that Senator Obama was a 20-year congregant and an apparent friend and admirer of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. And once again, I found myself surprised and completely baffled, asking myself \\"why\\"-- why would Sen. Obama, apparently in the main stream of current American politics (or any reasonable American of any race) find the hate-filled racial rhetoric of Rev. Wright a source of inspiration, spiritual, social or otherwise?One of Thomas Sowell's more recent columns on the topic of race led me to the purchase his book. Written more than 20 years ago, Sowell's insights into the Civil Rights movement of the 60's, and its mutation from the ideal of \\"equal opportunity\\" to the social and racial politics of the present seem to resonate. After reading \\"Civil Rights\\", I believe Thomas Sowell clearly knows and also forcefully and logically explains, better than any other authority I have found, the \\"why\\" of our current social and racial politics.Read and draw your on conclusions.

He puts more unknow history into his books that I've learned in any history class."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"This book is typical Sowell work: using reason and evidence to evaluate a topic filled with political rhetoric and emotion. Sowell goes through the Civil Rights movement, and evaluates the truthfulness of the statements of those who wish to maintain it. He can be credited with being the first authoritative person to try to bring rationality to the topic. He points out that black leaders who cheerlead the segregation of blacks into destructive housing projects are sellouts to political machines. They would rather keep their jobs as black \\"spokespersons\\" than fight for the rights of blacks to have constructive lives in the big cities. He reveals that blacks are worse off in these segregated housing projects. Once the government got ahold of the black vote, they went with it and did everything possible to hang onto it, even destroying the black family in the process. Blacks in America would be far better off if Sowell ran the policies of the programs that are supposed to be helping poor blacks, but the power elite in control in the major cities (who are all Democrats, although Sowell stops short of mentioning party responsibility) want blacks to stay poor and under educated, they are easier to manipulate that way. Sowell stops short of saying the exploitation of blacks is now the responsibility of the power elite, but he comes close to it, ,and the information he presents leads to that conclusion. The best proof of how truthful Sowell's statements are, is that he is attacked by the power elite and those who are members of it, whether in political parties, govt controlled university political and social science depts., or bureaucrats who distribute entitlements and want to keep their customers coming. The treatment of blacks by civil rights leaders, who drifted away from Dr. King's vision to a government elite stance of destructive control, will be seen in the future as another shameful chapter of how blacks were treated in the U.S. Worse, it was done intentionally. Anyone who defends the way blacks were treated in Chicago, for example, must face the fact that Chicago never had slavery, and brought blacks up from the deep South to work in WW I, and now blacks are housed in govt built ghetto neighborhoods, and they are worse off than they were in the south. In 2000 of the ten poorest census tracts, NINE were located in the South Side black area of Chicago, NOT in rural Mississippi or Alabama, where slavery and the KKK once kept them down. Blacks are worse off under the civil rights programs, and this book proves it. My mother worked in downtown Chicago with a lot of fine black mothers, and the tragedy, family suffering and death brought into the black family by govt bureaucrats is a crime against humanity."},{"Title":"Civil rights: Rhetoric or reality?","review":"A piercing eye-opener.

Gresham, Submarine is an interesting look at one of the most fascinating yet least seen warships in the United States Navy, the Improved Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine. While steering clear of revealing such closely guarded secrets as true maximum speed, diving depth, and the layout of the nuclear power plant, Clancy and Gresham manage to give the reader an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at &quot;the boat,&quot; its weapons, and more importantly, its officers and crew. For, as Clancy has often pointed out in both his novels and op-ed columns, it's not the machine or weapon that determines success in battle; it's the operator and his/her training and morale that matter on the battlefield.Supplementing the section on USS Miami -- the boat Clancy and Gresham closely examine -- is a section devoted to the Royal Navy's smaller but still-impressive nuclear sub force. Clancy examines not only the workings and weapons of HMS Triumph, a Trafalgar-class attack sub, but he also delves into the differences in training between American and British SSN skippers. His comments may raise eyebrows among some American readers unaccustomed to even constructive criticism of the U.S. Navy, but at least Clancy is honest and doesn't shy away from speaking his mind about a branch of our military that he is otherwise very fond of.The new edition leaves the original text as it appeared in 1993: there are no updates on the featured officers (namely, the skippers and execs of USS Miami and HMS Triumph) and their subsequent careers. However, Submarine does have a new section covering the entry into service of two new classes of SSN into Navy service, and the section on Other People's Boats has also been updated.A word about the quality of this book. I like it enough to have both editions, true. It's informative (up to a point), but it's not exactly impressive, either. As an introduction to the topic of nuclear attack subs, it works. But is it as good as Clancy's depictions of SSNs in his novels The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Perhaps, perhaps not."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"Actually I would give this book 3 and half stars. This book represents an effort to give a comprehensive introduction to modern nuclear attack submarine. This effort itself is respectful. But just like most other military technical books you find in an average bookstore, Clancy's work is filled with technical inacurracies. One obvious example: the side view of Kilo sub at the end of the book is totally out of proportion. And Clancy's USA-always-No.-1 arrogance is a bit annoying. In his tatical senarios, which are entertaining to read, he just assumes too little of the enemies' intelligence in blunt statement such as &quot;the captain of the Russian boat tries the same evasion tactics as his American opponent, but they are probably not as effective.&quot; At another occasion he calls the Soviet Union a &quot;babarian country.&quot;In short, this book is adequate in providing amateur knowledge on attack submarine and is entertaining as a leisure reading. But maybe it's just not worth the money of serious collectors.

The book has a copyright date of 1993 and much has taken place since then in terms of fleets, technology and weapons, for example. Clancy should also discuss Operation Desert Fox and other recent actions and exercises involving submarines. I also believe that this book could use an index to help submarine buffs such as myself find info on various topics pertaining to submarines. Even with all the errors that have been pointed out by the other reviewers and even with much of the information being out of date, Clancy's book is still a wonderful introduction to the silent service."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"I encountered this book as I was trying to decide whether or not to join the US Navy as a submariner; one of the main things I was wrestling with was the fact that I knew virtually nothing about submarines.

I wasn't expecting a super-detailed report on every facet of submarines, but it delivered some interesting things that I didn't expect (particularly the parts about other people's navies and various combat scenarios). If you already know quite a bit about submarines, this would probably be rather boring, but as an intro book, it's an excellent choice.

I must say, though, that I found Clancy's book disappointing, not by its introductory nature -- on that level it works quite well -- but by the numerous inaccuracies and poor editing.Inaccuracies, for example, include the following:1) The side illustrations of the submarines are just plain unreliable: the SKIPJACKs are shown with a parallel midbody section, when the hull form was actually a teardrop (see Friedman p. 132 for an excellent illustration of this); the PERMIT, STURGEON, and LOS ANGELES classes are shown with exagerated sails (note that the illustration of the LA class does not match other illustrations of the LAs in the book!), and all are shown with bows that are far too square.2) Clancy states specifically in one section (p. 59) that the cylindrical midbody of the later attack boats generates less drag than the pure teardrop hull form of the earlier SKIPJACK class. This simply isn't true. Every book I have ever read on the subject, including some fairly technical descriptions (for example, Friedman, previously cited, and Burcher and Rydill, _Concepts in Submarine Design_) indicate that the parallel midbody of the later fast attack subs was a compromise designed to aid manufacture, and that &quot;it is only slightly less efficient than the true teardrop shape.&quot; This is a long way from being more efficient. Note also that what we are discussing here is form drag, the drag caused by the shape of the hull and its appendages; there is also drag caused by the friction of the area of the wetted surface, which in turn is modified by the &quot;smoothness&quot; of the skin.I must say, though, that there are some things that it appears to have gotten correct, that many other books have gotten wrong. The conventional wisdom in the civilian press appears to be that every attack submarine design has been more capable in all categories than its predecessors, when more credible sources state otherwise. Clancy does manage to notice, for example, that the PERMITs and STURGEONs are slower but dive deeper than the SKIPJACKs, and that the LAs are faster than the PERMITs and STURGEONs -- indeed, are even faster than the SKIPJACKs -- but that said speed was bought (in part) by thinning the hull, thereby decreasing maximum depth. Of course, the exact numbers are classified, but the general information is available through congressional testimony and other sources. Interestingly, another Clancy book, _SSN: Strategies of Submarine Warfare_ (released in conjunction with the computer game of the same name) does NOT get this correct, which makes me wonder how closely he supervises his ghostwriters.It also makes me wonder about his editor, for _Submarine_ has numerous flaws in that department as well. In addition to the inconsistent illustrations mentioned above, we have:1) Identical illustrations presented more than once (e.g., pages 47, 53);2) Illustrations unrelated to the section of the book being discussed; for example, do I really want to see a plan of the galley while reading about the Vertical Launch System? (page 101);3) Duplicative prose; compare, for example, two passages concerning the ship's laundry:&quot;About the size of a phone booth, it handles the laundry for the entire boat, with a washer and dryer that would seem small in most apartments.&quot; [p. 102-3]&quot;At about the size of a phone booth, it has a tiny washer and dryer that would hardly be satisfactory in an apartment unit.&quot; [p. 145]3) Typos and/or inconsistent prose: For example:Is the phrase &quot;diving the tube&quot; (p. 95) or &quot;diving the tub&quot; (p. 169)?&quot;Following the war, Italy [singular] began to build up a substantial-force of diesel-electric boats [plural] with units constructed in their [plural] own yards.&quot; [p.299] So, is the possessive plural pronoun supposed to refer to the boats or to Italy?4) Erratic prose; for example, think about whether these sentences, taken from page 111, seem to be in the correct order:&quot;The obvious one is the question of how to protect the men aboard from the harmful effects of the reactor's radiation. As we mentioned before, the early Soviet nuclear boats scrimped on shielding and became cancer incubators for the naval hospitals of that now-defunct nation. The answer, in a word, is shielding. The entire structure surrounding the reactor is layered with a variety of different shielding materials.&quot;Overall, as a cheap ($15 or so) primer on the subject, it is an okay book, as it introduces the reader to some basic fundamentals regarding how submarines operate and what it is like to live on one. It also devotes much of its length to the other premier Western submarine power, the Royal Navy, which I view as a plus. It is not as good a book as it should have been, though, and I wouldn't trust its technical details."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"I'm not a historian, but I counted a dozen errors in fact and interpretation in the first four pages.

Included were some of the details of the development of the modern nuclear navies, and the operations they have engaged in and the men who operated them.My chief enjoyment from the book came from its simplicity, and lack of technical jargon that allowed me to cruise through each page easily. Having read a bit about submarines, I was able to pick up on the occasional new item, but if someone wanting a lot of details about what it takes to be in the silent service, then I would look elsewhere.Despite these detractions, it will occupy a spot on my bookshelf and be loaned to friends if they are seeking an interesting book on today's submarines."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"I have read a lot of different types of submarine stories over the past few years like Blind Man's Bluff, The Silent War and the most recent biography of Rickover. I wanted some background information on exactly how these machines work.Well this book does more than supply that. The first section of the book tells about all the systems on a Los Angles class attack sub. It explains all the systems that are used on the craft with the exception of the nuclear power plant. It also tells why the US Navy has had no reactor accidents.The most interesting part I found out was when they launch Torpedoes that have a wire attached to them that is almost 2 miles long that they can send messages correcting the guidance to the target. I had never heard of this before or ever seen it in a movie. I suppose they could use them like sonar buoys too. There were other things that surprised me too but I don't want to tell too much.The next part talks about a United Kingdom Trafalgar class attack submarine. It was smaller but quieter than the US boats because instead of having a screw in the back for propulsion it used a pump jet which was the wave of the future. It also explained the differences between the US and UK's programs in the US Navy engineer skills are more important whereas in the UK it is command skills that are emphasis. The other thing is the UK brings along more beer with them mostly because of tradition.The next part, which I thought was the best, was the mission section of the book. This was broken up into six sections describing the different kinds of roles nuclear submarines could be used for. There were some true life scenarios along with what we could have done in various situations. The emphasis here is stealth; the tomahawk mission and the mining mission of North Korean ports show the best example of this. The weapons are much more sophisticated than I had thought.The final section on the other nations with submarines surprised me. I would have never thought that Italy and Norway would have a submarine force and that France had no nuclear submarines at all just diesels.This was very interesting material to someone who is interesting in how nuclear submarines work and the kind of men who run them along with their possible missions. Some of it will amaze you."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"It is simply not good enough. It's easy to read, sentence for sentence, but it's actually the worst submarine book I've bought, and amoung the worser I've read. Sudden statements are made, without any substantiation or reference. (Ibid. is worser than none, as it just reduce readabilty.) Some of the statements I simply can't find reason to believe. - I love Tom Clancy as a novell writer, and I think he is good to write. This could have been good, if he either had asserted a proper research for each and every postulate in the book, or got a proper proof reading. Let me instead advice the following three books: &quot;Blind Man's Bluff&quot;, &quot;Submarines (Brassey's Sea Power, Volume 7)&quot; and &quot;War Beneath The Sea&quot;"},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"This is just a wonderful book on the topic. Clancy and co have done a great job of taking the reader through the boats in question and really explaining the different types, parts, and jobs associated with a submarine. Clancy also does a good job in explaining what it is like to live and work on one of these boats. He also takes us through some of the training that takes place to get into the job. He also adds a good amount of detail of what the typical types of missions these boats have today, what they did in the cold war and the possible missions upcoming.I was surprised at the number of countries that also have submarines. Clancy takes us through a long inventory of all the different countries that have submarines today, what kind of boat they are and what are the strengths and weaknesses of the model. Another interesting part of the book was the description of all the countries currently making and selling submarines. I was under the impression that there were very few countries engaged in this endeavor but I was wrong, it looks like any country that builds any kind of ships is also building submarines.Overall this was an interesting, easy to read and very informative book. If you are interested in submarines then this should be your first stopping point. A good book well worth the money."},{"Title":"Submarine (Tom Clancy's Military Reference)","review":"Cons: Lots of speculation; photos are low quality; narrative is just okayBottom-Line: When all is said and read \\"Submarine\\" contains almost no information that cannot be found elsewhere via open sources, but it makes for an interesting read for the initiated.Despite their long and storied history as part of the world's naval fleets, the operation of submarines, The Silent Service, remains mostly a mystery. I served in the United States Navy for 15 years and considerable amount of that time was spent riding submarines in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of operation.So when a friend recently gave me a copy of Tom Clancy's non-fiction \\"Submarine\\" (written with John Gresham), I was immediately intrigued. Had Clancy gotten it right, had he blown the hatch and allowed the public to peer inside the long cramped spaces that make up a modern nuclear powered submarine? Well yes and no. While I found some of the information in \\"Submarine\\" spot on, other sections were just purely conjecture and not even close to accurate.Clancy choose the Tomahawk missile carrying (improved) Los Angeles-class submarine (boat) the U.S.S. Miami (SSN-755) as his guide to the modern American submarine and the Royal Navy's Trafalgar-class H.M.S.

The detailed descriptions of interior design, sub life, technical setups, and day-to-day routines and lifestyles is as close to the real thing as one can get w/o a VIP tour. Make-believe mission plans were just detailed enough to not to lose readers in mumbojumbo but accurate enough to make one wonder about the technical wizardry. The amazing reference of the most premier international submarines was captivating and launched my personal interest in submarine-anything.

Basically, I more or less agree with all of the other reviews regarding the value of the information Clancy provides, which is quite good and a genuine pleasure to read. Obviously, a lot of the information is classified, so about half of the book is Tom Clancy's best guesses, which are definitely more educated than mine. However, I sometimes find his writing syle rediculously all-knowing and jingoistic. I guess you have to take the good with the bad; the good being the abundance of research, as well as the overly conversational tone in which it is presented, and the bad being all the drivel you have to swim through to get it.

Not only is it a great source of information about everything related to submarines and submarine warfare, it's also an easy read. In typical Tom Clancy style you get the feeling that you are right there aboard one of the navy's most powerful undersea weapons platforms. This book is a great one-volume encyclopedia for submarines and their on board crews and equipment.Of particular interest to me was the last few chapters where the author discusses a variety of submarine battle tactics. Submarine Rescue, Mine Warfare Intelligence Gathering, Reconnoitering an Enemy Harbor, Execution of a TLAM-C Strike on an Enemy Airfield and Precision Strike: Tomahawk Attacks, are only a few of the tactics included in this revealing and interesting book.Don't be fooled because this book was published in 1993. Its contents are still applicable to most of the fictional submarine thrillers on the market today.

The book is to complicated for beginners, if you don't know basics. But you will learn more about subs after you read that book, but there is a mistake in the book; he wrote 60+ nm as ADCAP's speed but it is 55+ actually. Where did I get information? From Jane's Information group(Which is the biigest and oldest information group for military equipment in the world.) There is an idea in the book which is repeating very often &quot;America has the best stuff.&quot; In the book he made a pretty big tour in the USS Miami and talked with her crew, he also talked about the HMS Triumph and her crew which is the A Royal Navy sub.

If, like me you are a boring old fart who likes to hear grown men waffle on about submarine tactics, training methods and the highly technical load of letters and numbers that makes up the bulk of military jargon, then books like this one is a must.Another very pleasing thing about this book is that Clancy does the rare thing of praising somebody else's military. It was nice, from a British point of view, to hear about our own submarines for a change, instead of the continual American/Soviet propaganda.When Clancy says that the British Trafalgar class sub is &quot;nearly just as good as a 688 class&quot;, then you know it's ten times better!"},{"Title":"50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth","review":"I first read this book years ago as a child. Perhaps the few reviewers on here who do not like the book (and use this review as an outlet for their own personal politics) on here do not realize that parents, teachers, community leaders and religious leaders hardly shelter kids from the outside world as it is, and this book will not upset children, ruin their happiness or waste their childhood at all. As a kid, my friends and I readily accepted this book and were happy to carry out many of the suggestions. Adults seem to look down on kids a lot and think that they just want to play all day and have little care for anything but themselves. The things kids love, such as animals and the outdoors, are in danger, and this book lets kids contribute to help saving them. There are plenty of little tips in this book that do not advocate huge, drastic lifestyle changes. This book also does not come across as preachy or arrogant. Overall it is practical and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth","review":"I checked this book out from the library and we enjoyed it so much we had to buy one.

It does not suggest major lifestyle changes, just small changes that can add up over time. And it is fun to read! It contains mini-quizes for kids on each topic, such as: which of the following will a worm not eat- vegetables, dirt, or steak?(answer= worms don't eat meat). Each idea includes a question &amp; answer, a description of the concept (such as recycling), a few projects to try at home (such giving old toys to charity or having a yard sale instead of throwing them out), and addresses to write to for more information (such as the National Wildlife Federation, which can help you plan a custom made wildlife-friendly yard).

It has a lot of good, interesting facts in it too."},{"Title":"50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth","review":"I like this little book because it's realistic and doesn't try to use scare tactics. It's not put out by radicals and it isn't trying to get us to take on too much, too fast. Those who politicize the ecology bug me to death. As if taking care of this planet that we fleetingly occupy is about whether you're on the right or the left, where you stand on gun control, taxes, what defines marriage, or whether the school board should remove Huck Finn from the high school shelves. Making the earth's environment better is selfish, because we stand to benefit from it. It's a planet we share, folks, and we're not doing all we could to leave it in good shape for those who are here now or will live on it when our time is done.Let's get this straight once and for all: being environmentally conscious does not mean you're a tree-hugging liberal! What it means is, you like a planet that doesn't make you, your children, your grandma and your pet golden retriever sick. The Soviets were a leftist nation and they destroyed their ecology past the point of no return. On the flip side, the right-wing American President Theodore Roosevelt, as Republican as can be, has as one of his legacies the establishment of the National Parks System. \\"Saving\\" the planet is not the exclusive domain of leftists, nor-saying it again here--does it equate you with \\"tree huggers\\" if you try to do something that benefits the environment. I personally like clean air, clean water, a place to take a walk in nature without stepping in a nice glowing barrel of toxic sludge, don't you? I don't care if you're farther right than Sister Attila the Fourth-Grade Nun you can't honestly say you don't want there to be forests for you to go hunting in, or unpolluted rivers left for you to take your grandkids trout fishing in, am I right? And, yes, we ALL can recoil at the well-intended but self-defeating environmental fanatics who alienate the mainstream society of America by being too extreme and dogmatic. This book is not written for those who chain themselves to an endangered species of mollusk and go on hunger strikes to protest a TV show on global warming. This excellent little book is not like that at all. It presents what I think are really worthy ideas for cleaning up around the neighborhood where you live. It sets some nice projects out for kids (and grown ups) to get done and that is surely better than not educating our young people in environmental responsibility.Okay, let me put it this way: would you rather have a child dear to you outside some weekend picking up litter, planting a tree in the side yard and sorting recyclable materials, or would you rather have that child sitting in front of the TV with a PS2, becoming another statistic in the epidemic of pre-teen obesity? This book is a small step in the right direction, and if it does nothing more than makes someone, whatever the age, think about the connection between personal behavior and the state of the earth's environment, then it's a nice investment of time and money."},{"Title":"50 Simple Things Kids Can Do to Save the Earth","review":"I loved this great book on caring about the environment.

What a tremendous researcher and writer!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When Fawn Brodie began her research for this book she was an active, believing Mormon with no ax to grind. She simply wanted to write a book of the history of the Mormon church.With blessings from the church hierarch including all the apostles and prophets she was given full access to all official church history and records in the church owned vault at their headquarters in Salt Lake City.During her research of the church archives she made a shocking discovery that all Mormonism was based on a lie began by the founder Joseph Smith and his 1st vision which included the Golden Plates, the Book of Mormon, polygamy on and on.As she was about to publish her book and make public the factual findings and history of her church she was threatned with excommunication from her faith if she followed through with publication of the book.Upon publication of the book the Mormon church made good on their threat of excommunication and she was dishonorably kicked out of the church and declared persona-non-grata.Since its publication in the mid 1940's it remains one of the most definitive and accurate accounts of the actual beginnings and history of the Mormon church. Although she is now deceased her book is still used as source material in modern day independent church history publications.Try to find a copy of a recently deceased Mormon apologist's book (Hugh Nibley), where he unsuccessfully tried to discredit her and you will have extreme difficulty in locating one.Her book on the other hand is still widely available even after more than 50 years since it's 1st printing. I think that pretty much says it all.This was one of the 1st books I read which led to my de-conversion from the Mormon cult dogma.

In a way, that's a shame. &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was published in 1945, so historians have had 56 years to write a better book. For some reason, that hasn't occurred. Other books written about Smith, such as Donna Hill's &quot;Joseph Smith, the First Mormon&quot; are not nearly as critical and insightful as they need to be.Legitimate criticisms of the book include the fact that it is written more to be interesting than a strictly scholarly work. Brodie does use interesting language and sometimes draws too much on the flamboyant and theatrical parts of Joseph Smith's personality. Additionally, while its been proven Brodie reached a pretty accurate conclusion, in the first edition of her book she relies too much on the so-called &quot;Pearsall transcript&quot; of Smith's 1826 trial for money-digging in Bainbridge, NY. Although, subsequent research bears out most of the conclusions.&quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is not without a number of weaknesses. It is clear that Fawn views Smith as a fraud and an impostor. Perhaps, she didn't look hard enough to find some &quot;middle ground&quot; between &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;. Maybe, Smith really believed he was transcribing ancient scripture and had been annointed by God to be Prophet, when in fact he did not. Some people do suffer hallucinations. In fact, a number of people who are terribly rational most of the time claim to have dreams or revelations occasionally which can only be described as &quot;supernatural&quot;. Another possibility is he really believed he was inspired to lead people to Christ, but invented the Book of Mormon to get the attention of people.Brodie does not adequately take into the account the following in my estimation:1. The sincerity expressed in the writings in Joseph Smith's own journals which have been published and are available to read.2. The fact that the three witnesses to the Golden Plates, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris, never retracted their statements about the Plates and the Book of Mormon, even on their death beds. (although they admitted they saw the Plates with their &quot;spiritual eyes&quot;, as opposed to their &quot;physical eyes&quot;).3. The fact that Smith was willing to face being persecuted, tarred and feathered, and killed rather than give up what he was preaching.There is a puzzle to Smith claiming to be a &quot;prophet&quot; that has never been adequately explained by anyone. Although, there is plenty of evidence refuting Smith's claims and those of his church.The weaknesses, though, are more than offset by the research she did and the material she found. She documents the fact that Smith's father had a dream which later appeared in its entirety in First Nephi in the Book of Mormon, that Smith was tried for being an impostor and moneydigger in an 1826 court proceeding in Bainbridge, New York, that Smith routinely used to seer stones and claimed that with these stones he could see buried treasure underground, and in her 1971 edition, reported the three conflicting accounts that have been given of Smith's First Vision. Finally, she talks about the fact that Smith did not translate other scripture, the Book of Abraham, from Egyptian Papyri as claimed.However, Brodie's greatest contribution is in establishing the context and background in which the Book of Mormon was produced. She talks about the many millenial religious movements where Smith grew up, the commonly held views that Indians were really descendants of Hebrew tribes, anti-catholic prejudice, anti-free masonry prejudice, and prejudice against people with darker skins. One can find elements of all of these in the Book of Mormon if one looks closely enough at it. One who wants too, can see how the Mormon religion and the Book of Mormon arose from this context.No Man Knows My History is a classic. While it would be a mistake to read nothing else about Joseph Smith, skipping the book is missing the best biography that currently exists about him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mormonism, described by Fawn Brodie as &quot;a potpourri of American religious thinking spiced with the fundamental ideal of inevitable progress,&quot; is a religion that couldn't have planted roots anywhere other than America. Its founder Joseph Smith grew up in the eclectic religious stew of early 19th-century Vermont and New York, fertile ground for what Brodie calls the &quot;flotsam of the godly.&quot; Religious eccentrics of every stripe were springing up in his day: Ann Lee's Shakers, Jemima Wilkinson (the &quot;Universal Friend,&quot; who thought she was Christ), John Humphrey Noyes' Oneida community (who practiced free love and communal living), William Miller's Adventists, Joseph Dylks (the &quot;Leatherwood God&quot;), and many other assorted faith healers, &quot;prophets,&quot; circuit evangelists, millenialists and revivalists of varying degrees of eccentricity and ability. Most were short-lived, but the influence of this atmosphere of religious enthusiasm and innovation on Joseph Smith and the religion he invented is unmistakeable. Fawn Brodie's biography of Smith remains a classic, penetrating study even after over half a century. This book is indispensible for an understanding of this peculiar, gifted man and the peculiar religion he created.Joseph Smith was no sideshow preacher, as Brodie convincingly demonstrates against those Mormons who unjustly emphasize his lack of education to give his achievements a more divine appearance. Far from being a simpleton, Smith was a talented man. His exceptional gifts and likeable nature &quot;made the ordinary frontier evangelist seem by comparison all sound and fury.&quot; His theology, &quot;a patchwork of ideas and rituals drawn from every quarter, became in his hands a thing of color, warmth and originality,&quot; though spiritually barren at its core. Brodie rightly remarks that &quot;within the dogma of the church there is no new Sermon on the Mount, no new saga of redemption, nothing for which Joseph himself might stand.&quot; The appeal of Mormonism was then and remains today something not altogether connected with Smith himself. His was an optimistic theology tied to material success, a blend of various Protestant and other doctrines woven together and so heavily injected with Smith's own fantasies and the frontier mythology of his day that its Christianity became only a surface veneer. There is little resemblance between Smith and the religion Jesus founded.In recounting how Smith evolved from a small-time treasure-hunter and magician into a &quot;prophet of God,&quot; Brodie details his many fabrications. There's the &quot;First Vision,&quot; which changed at least three times as Smith built upon it in later years and was almost certainly a late invention to explain earlier events. There's the familiar Mormon albatross of polygamy, initially denied by Smith with great vigor but then promoted as a commandment of God with equal vigor before being conveniently abandoned (also by revelation) by his successors just when Utah was trying to win statehood. Less familiar, perhaps, is Smith's adaptation of the local theories of his day to identify the many American Indian mounds in Western New York and Ohio as the remnants of an advanced North American civilization predating Christ (not an original idea, I was surprised to learn -- many people in Smith's day refused to believe that &quot;savages&quot; were capable of building such things, similar to the modern belief of some that only aliens could have built the pyramids). And of course there are the famous &quot;golden plates&quot; from which Smith allegedly translated the Book of Mormon (seen only &quot;with the eye of faith&quot; by a few friends and family members), and the fragments of the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; later shown to be ordinary Egyptian funereal documents. Smith's embarrassing linguistic innovations got him into a lot of trouble, particularly after Champollion solved the mystery of ancient Egyptian writing by deciphering the Rosetta Stone in Smith's lifetime; fortunately for him, many of his followers were astonishingly forgiving and readily believed him over &quot;Gentile scholars.&quot; Brodie discusses all of this and much more. It's remarkable that Mormonism survived such discoveries, and that many continue to look beyond the powerful proofs of its human invention. One wonders whether Mormonism would have gone the way of so many other 19th-century sects had the early Mormons not been so savagely persecuted and had Smith himself not been &quot;martyred.&quot; Even in Smith's own lifetime the evidence against the divine origins of his religion was devastating, but as Brodie indicates, &quot;There was a great hunger in his people, and they accepted him for what he set himself up to be.&quot; The legend of Joseph Smith long ago outpaced the reality that Brodie presents, and the religion he invented ultimately got along well without him thanks to persecution and the leadership of able men like Brigham Young. Clearly Mormonism has never depended on Smith's personal credibility -- in many ways its origins are unimportant to its adherents, I've discovered. Smith's life is a remarkable tale, captivatingly told by Brodie.Given that Fawn Brodie was excommunicated by the church, one might expect this to be a venomous anti-Mormon book. Instead she produced a thoughtful, fair and balanced biography that demonstrates no small degree of admiration for Smith. Her exhaustive research made extensive use of court records, county histories, newspapers, and Smith's own writings (particularly his lengthy History of the Church, based largely on his own journals). The results are solid and convincing. Many have accused Brodie of excessive psychological speculation, but I found her conclusions sensible and balanced given the evidence; only in the Supplement added to the book in 1970 does she tend a bit toward the psychoanalytical musings in vogue at that time, but mostly she presented further evidence to support the conclusions she drew in 1945. The appendices are especially useful, further exploring the &quot;First Vision,&quot; Smith's many wives, the &quot;Book of Abraham,&quot; and other topics. Above all, Brodie's fluid and lively writing style makes this a superb biography of a remarkable man."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"For a very long time the only biographies of Joseph Smith or of Mormonism were either hagiographic, or else deeply cynical depictions of the founder as a charlatan. Fawn Brodie changed all that in 1945 with her &#8216;No Man knows my History&#8217;, which was a first serious attempt by a professional historian to understand the Mormon prophet within his context, and in a manner which did not depend on accepting his supernatural experiences in the terms in which they have been described by Smith and his followers. Committed Mormons may dispute much of the author&#8217;s evidence as Hugh Nibley, famously did in &#8216;No Ma&#8217;am, That&#8217;s not History&#8217;, and people can argue till the cows come home about who is right and who isn&#8217;t. But the important point is that Brodie&#8217;s is the work of a historian which presents plausible possible ways of viewing Smith&#8217;s life and work which is not dictated by the exigencies of Mormon proselytisation. For that reason Fawn Brodie produced what must be regarded as a seminal work. Opening up, as she did, a new and professional dimension to the study of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, led first to her excommunication and then to her depiction by the hierarchy as the Anti-Christ. When I first read the book over thirty years ago I must have read the 1945 edition. For the 1970 revision presents some information which is new to me, delving deeply into the Nauvoo period and the clandestine manner in which polygamy was introduced. Brodie writes elegantly and with a capacity to enthral the reader, at the same time reserving judgment on much that is unclear in a history of the frontier, befogged by lack of primary sources. It is essential material for anyone interested in the history of Mormonism and of the American west."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It took me a long time to finish, but I've finally turned the last page of the book the Mormon church would prefer never be read. I won't pretend to know the Church Of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints' official position on Brodie's work, nor that of the Reformed Church of the same birth; but based on discussions I've shared with Salt Lake Mormons, it's obvious that No Man Knows My History is in direct conflict with the sanitized history the LDS church and its members accept and worship.I picked up No Man Knows My History, first, because I wanted to learn more about Mormon history; and second, because Brodie is a large source of information for many other books on Mormonism, including Under the Banner of Heaven by John Krakauer.Fawn M. Brodie's writing style is dry and academic. Nearly every page features a citation in the footnotes. Most of her sources, in fact, come from church documents like History of the Church, or the published journals and letters of the characters themselves. Joseph Smith created a religion in the time of the printing press, and Brodie built a book on the evidence of the printers.She approaches Joseph Smith as a man, rather than the perfect mouthpiece of God as many Mormons view him. In some ways, this is an unfair approach. Abraham (of the Biblical Old Testament) looks like a crazy person if the reader doesn't accept that Abraham believes he hears the voice of God and acts on His words. On the other hand, Joseph wasn't a perfect man; he wasn't God. Brodie outlines mistakes and failures as well as successes, and this makes Joseph look a little more human that Mormons wish. It makes him more human, which should be a bad thing. Paul (of the New Testament) knew he was a retched sinner, but he's revered almost next to Jesus in the Christian faith (but not quite).I learned some interesting things while wading through this book. Joseph Smith was an interesting man, strange, but still interesting. He ran for President of the United States. I never knew that. He sent Parley P. Pratt, an elder in his church, on a mission to England and then married the man's wife while he was away. He was a Mason and adopted many Masonic practices and rituals into his religion. He was arrested many times, and fraud was often the charge; but on one occasion, warrants were written on the charge of murder. Joe was the mayor of Nauvoo and wrote his own laws, outside the scope of common law, his city charters, or the Constitution of the United States. Although Nauvoo was a dry community, Porter Rockwell (Smith's burly bodyguard and \\"Destroying Angel\\") ran a saloon in Smith's home and hotel until Emma (Joseph Smith's first wife of nearly fifty wives) put an abrupt stop to it. Smith had a love of the finer things in life and lusted after adventure, power, and the ladies (married or not, church members or otherwise). His death was tragic, but his actions in life may have predicted his earthly demise.Fawn M. Brodie's No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith is an interesting book. Her work, no matter how controversial is worth consideration. Although it crashes against the re-crafted history of the Mormon church, I recommend it to anybody interested in LDS history--especially present members of the LDS church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Long reviled by Latter-day Saints, Fawn Brodie's life ofJoseph Smith is still impressive for its depth, itsthoughtfulness, and its struggle with the exact nature ofSmith's calling. Her respect for the man is undeniable;what stung when the book was released in 1945 (and must stillhurt today) are her religious naturalism and her conclusionthat Smith's spiritual legacy was &quot;barren&quot;. Yet the book isfar from an anti-Mormon tract or an exercise in debunking;one finishes it with a sense of Smith's extraordinary giftsand a great appreciation for the complexity and confusionof American life in his time, a psychological and religiousferment of which Mormonism is both a product and a legacy."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A well-researched and documented book. Ms. Brodie did much of her research in the Mormon Church's archives and library, and because David O McKay (a former president of the Mormon Church) was her uncle, she had access to documents that other researchers did not. This biography portrays Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism) as a fraud, a con-man, and a seducer of women. For instance, Brodie documents how Joseph Smith defrauded his church members in the Kirtland Anti-Banking scandal, swindling them of their money and their land. Brodie also documents how he sent various men on church missions and seduced their wives while they were away. These are just two examples of frauds Smith perpetrated. The book is controversial because many Mormons feel that the book is an attack on their church founder, and they claim that it is bad history. Ms. Brodie attempted to enter the mind of her subject and explain what motivated Joseph Smith, in this regard she crosses the line between history and psycho-analysis. An excellent read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I grew up 20 miles from Palmyra NY and thought I knew about the Mormon Church, having written reports on it. Then in the '50's I lived 5 years in Salt Lake and knew Mrs Brodie's sister and brother-in-law. These girls were neices of David O MacKay, President of the Mormon Church, and after they served their &quot;missions&quot; in Switzerland, Fawn and Louise each married and Fawn attended the University of Chicage. We were told that Fawn had written the book as a disertation for the University of Chicago and her uncle had allowed her to use the church records for research. (Records not on display for the public.) As a result of her research, she lost her faith in the church and she and her sister and their husbands were what I would call excommunicated. I finally found the book to read in Rochester NY in 1960 by special order because it was not available in Utah and was out of print in other places. I'm happy it has been reprinted but I'll bet it isn't on bookstore shelves in Salt Lake City!!!!! Fawn Brodie has since died. She was a thourough researcher. Her Jefferson biography was well received and reviewed."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie, former history professor at UCLA and former Latter Day Saint, in her above-titled book gives a fair and honest history of the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Joseph Smith. From his early days using folk magic as a \\"treasure hunter\\" to his first vision and beyond, Dr. Brodie tries to present all sides of the enigmatic founder of Mormonism (which isn't always done in books about Joseph Smith). Court transcripts, afadavits of former neighbors, testimonies of faithful followers, witnesses to the golden plates, Joseph Smith's own version of events - Dr. Brodie allows all these voices to speak in this biography. Her writing is interesting, entertaining, informative, and she isn't afraid to draw conclusions based on the evidence at hand. Perhaps she reaches a bit too far in psychoanalysis of J.S., but that's part of what makes this book the page-turner that it is. One doesn't have to agree with all her conclusions to enjoy this book. Overall I would rate this book as \\"excellent.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith. I was surprised to find that it wasn't. Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so this book is written from that perspective. But I found that she was very simpathetic and offered some interesting insight into his life. I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I owe a debt of gratitude to the late Fawn M Brodie. It is largely through this book that many of my questions about Mormonism were answered. It is largely due to her that I left Mormonism.My feelings towards Mormonism are fairly neutral. I certainly do not wish any ill towards Mormons. I continue to hold many of them in very high esteem.However, this does not change the fact that there are very serious historical questions regarding the founding of early Mormonism. I've not yet seen a reasonable, balanced, and scholarly (as opposed to polemical, and Dr Nibley's work on this topic does fit in this category) response to Mrs Brodie's pioneering work."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's book was a landmark book in Mormon studies that forced Mormon historians to write their history a little different than how it was traditionally written. Brodie is a very gifted writer. The book is well written and is very readable. No one interested in the life of Joseph Smith can help but read this book. However the book does have many problems and limitations. Brodie depends on books like E.D. Howe's book \\"Mormonism Unveiled\\" and John C. Bennett's book \\"History of the Saints.\\" These are two primary historical documents but Brodie does not use them with caution as other biographers of Smith. Howe's book was suppose to be statements by the Smith's neighbors and others who knew Smith and his family written in the 1830s, but many historians believe that a lot of Howe's book are forgeries written by the same person. Bennett's book was written to expose Joseph Smith's evil doings in Illinois. The document is clearly written by a very angry fanatic anxious to destroy Joseph Smith. Most every historian knows this type of document needs to be used with caution, something Brodie does not do. Bennett was also a very shady character (see Bennett's biography \\"The Saintly Scoundrel\\" by Andrew Smith).Brodie sometimes does not give good documentation. On page 32 she says Emma probably noticed as Smith's other followers that when Smith spoke with intense feeling the \\"blood drained from his face, leaving a frightening, almost luminous pallor.\\" There is not document or any evidence that Emma ever noticed such a trait.Brodie also goes too far with the amount of wives Joseph had. She should be commended for being the first person to attempt such a thing, but recent scholarship has shown her numbers to be erroneous. She says 48, but it was likely much less, anywhere from 29 to 33 (see \\"In Sacred Loneliness\\" by Todd Compton and \\"Farms[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies] Review of Books\\" Volume 10, Number 2, 1998).When dealing with the witnesses that claimed to have seen the plates the Book of Mormon came from Brodie gets a little stupid. 3 witnesses claimed to have seen both the angel that gave Smith the plates along with the plates. 8 others claimed to have seen the plates. Over half of these 11 witnesses later became angry at Joseph Smith and left his church. But none of them during this time tried to expose Joseph as a fraud (see \\"Investigating the Book of Mormon Witnesses\\" by Richard L. Anderson). With this fact Brodie does reject the idea of the witnesses being co-conspirators, but the men became victims of \\"Joseph's unconscious but positive talent at hypnosis\\" (page 77). That has got to be the most ludicrous idea I have ever heard! I challenge anyone in the world to unconsciously or consciously to make me see a vision. She has got to do better then that. I understand that when doing secular history (the history I personally prefer) that it is difficult to deal with the witnesses. But the idea that Smith could have put 11 people, many at the same time, under hypnosis sounds stupid to anyone with a brain.A long with reading Brodie's book I would suggest also reading \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\" edited by Newell G. Bringhurst. The essays in this book both praise the book and deal with the books problems. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith: the First Mormon\\" by Donna Hill which is much more well balanced biography than Brodie's. Brodie tries to get inside the mind of Joseph Smith too much, something Donna Hill does not do. I would also suggest reading \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism\\" by Richard Bushman. This book is only about Joseph's early life but is very scholarly written. Bushman is currently writing a full biography about Joseph which will likely be better than any others written before. Bushman is a historian on a much higher level than Fawn Brodie or Donna Hill. I would also suggest reading a more recent biography of Joseph Smith by Robert V. Remini"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I'm not a Mormon, but I am fascinated by Joseph Smith, Jr. And if you want to know more about the man there is no better book than Fawn Brodie's outstanding biography. Filled with relevant and damaging facts, interesting quotes, and information the Mormon church would probably like to keep hidden, it's the book you need to read if you want to know more about the Mormon prophet. Even though it can get bogged down in detail it's still a great read. She has certainly done her research on the man and it shows on every page."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie is a scholar with no ax to grind in this fairly accurate reconstruction of the life of Joseph Smith, the star-crossed founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. For Mormons, the book has always been considered a reproach to official church biographies about Smith, but recent historical findings weigh heavily in Brodie's favor in assessing the actual motives and activities behind the polygamist prophet of Mormonism who said &quot;No man knows my history.&quot; Brodie's other tomes on historic figures constitute scholarly, careful analyses of their lives, as is also the case with this effort. The style is pedantic,and could benefit from updating, but the book is well organized and paced. For the serious investigator of Mormonism, Brodie's book is important because the story of Joseph Smith is told in an era before the current visibility and church-line biographies of Smith combined to obfuscate embarrassing or conflicting details in the life of this controversial and charismatic Mormon prophet. For anyone interested in a biography of Joseph Smith that does not have the approval of the LDS Church, yet remains respected among scholars and biographers,No Man Knows My History is a definitive, quotable, and invaluable resource."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mrs. Brodie, a highly respected historian, has written what must still be the definitive book on this charismatic and controversial American figure. Since she was raised a Mormon and had access to documents that the Church normally forbids to outsiders, she is able to separate out aspects of the &quot;official&quot; biographies of Smith from the realities of his life and times. I was struck by how admiring, in many ways, she is of him: unlike the Church's view, which paints him as completely unlearned (thereby strengthening the argument that the Book of Mormon had to be the word of God), she celebrates his energetic inventiveness, the facility with words and ideas that might have made him a novelist had he had a more conventional education. She also has meticulously researched the trends and climate of the times which inform practically every word of the Book of Mormon. A fair and admirable piece of history writing."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Picked this up at my local library after having an interesting discussion with my grandparents. One of my great grandfathers escaped from a Mormon family in Idaho. He had a very rough family life. Back in the day, the Mormons were notoriously anti non Mormon. His mother was a real witch from the accounts of my grandmother. Nevertheless, this interesting piece of family history led me to realize I know absolutely nothing about mormonism. Being a non mormon, there is no reason for me to know anything, but I was hoping this book would go over all the things I never really understood about mormonism especially the history and the rise of Joseph Smith.As a non Mormon, the book only confirms what I heard about Joseph Smith: a total crank. It gets worse or better depending on your view. Joe Smith used \\"seer stones\\" to look for ancient artifacts. He was a well known rebel rouser in the community. Joe Smith, a trouble maker, born into a life destined for farm drudgery was desperate to be somebody. That is at least how I interpret his life. Mormons may be put off by this work despite the author combining the hard facts of his early life. From my perspective, seer stones and necromancy (activities Joe Smith was routinely criticized for engaging in) spell lunatic. Now, Smith was actually a bright guy. Unfortunately, he did not have access to formal schooling. He educated himself much later on life after he could establish schools for his settlements. The fascinating part is how much help he needed to write the book of mormon. However, he routinely jumped the gun and flat guessed on some things, including trying to quote languages he did not quite understand.Every page of this book is filled with dense facts coming together as a long historical narrative. I got dizzy imagining the author combing over all the sources, looking to write a narrative without jumping over the place. I would imagine there is still facts left out. The book moves at a fairly brisk pace, despite how dense it really is. There were a few sections I thought got boring. This could just depend on personal preference, but you really need to pay attention early on. Brodie does not repeat herself. There are some sections I found confusing because I was not entirely sure who she was talking about. This was true in the beginning when she is explaining the Smiths and his family. His Father was named Joe as well as Smiths own son. She jumps from one to the other without notifying. There are also a lot of important side characters who can be hard to remember as the book goes on. There are several aids to Joe Smith, his wife, alleged mistress and side lovers, enemies, right hand men, family members, a college professor who tries to decipher egyptian documents, generals, politicians, and plenty of other people. New people are introduced throughout who are just as important as earlier ones who fade off and then feature prominently later.Overall, this is a masterful work. It's truly impressive how much research went into this. I read the original from 1963. There were some photos in that one. They don't particularly help that much but they are interesting to see. I would definitely recommend reading this."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It's fun and easy to scorn the Mormons - they never seem to want to put up a good fight back. I hope that anyone who proclaims oneself a true saint isn't in these ranks. This is a lot of beefed up bigotry disguised as objective reasoning - chucked full of conundrums that go unnoticed by those who love a lazy argument. It seems there is more history written on Joseph Smith's \\"scandals\\" than there is on all the scandals of all the presidents of the U.S. combined. I sincerely hope that those who are making the choice to criticize Joseph are enjoying themselves, and having a lot of fun while they can. Or, maybe it's just a perverted attempt to alleviate whatever cognitive dissonance they harbor inside of them. I don't know why they do it.Truthfully, I could destory every other religion I've come across with a five-second question, but I choose not to. To bash other's reasons to believe is neither productive, nor is it what the Savior taught. Shame Shame (especially if you are an author esteemed as a \\"former member\\".

In 1946, The Improvement Era, the official periodical of the Church, said that many of the book's citations arose from doubtful sources and that the biography was \\"of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith.\\" The \\"Church News\\" section of the Deseret News provided a lengthy critique that acknowledged the biography's \\"fine literary style\\" and then denounced it as \\"a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before.\\"BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist Hugh Nibley challenged Brodie in another booklet, No, Ma'am, That's Not History, asserting that Brodie had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie herself thought the Deseret News pamphlet \\"a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda\\", but she dismissed the ultimately more popular No, Ma'am, That's Not History as \\"a flippant and shallow piece.\\"Brodie's controversial depiction of Joseph Smith is in the same vein as her other Psychoanalysis works of fiction. I say fiction because the psychoanalytical babbling of the insane is just that - psychoanalytical babbling without substance or fact. Brodie incorporates in her work Freudian psychology. Psychoanalysis is a work of the devil for sure, based on dreams and unprovable and unsupported assumptions. Her psycho biography of Thomas Jefferson became a best-seller base on the same psychoanalytical babbling And most important, Brodie's study of the early Richard Nixon, completed while she was dying of cancer, demonstrated the hazards of psycho biography in the hands of an author who loathed her subject. Brodie grew up disliking the LDS religion with full support from her mother. Brodie had access to church historical records because of her family connections to the church. She deviously betrayed the trust of church historians by misusing and misrepresenting the material.Psychoanalysis is a body of knowledge developed by Sigmund Freud and his followers, devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the patient verbalizes thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the unconscious conflicts causing the patient's symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems.Both Fawn Brodie and her husband subjected themselves to psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard's employer, the RAND Corporation, paid most of the bills.) If the problems of everyday life had been insufficient to maintain Brodie's interest in psychology, there was the case of her mother, who during this period attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.One should be careful what they read and adopt as gospel truth. The infamous Mark Hofmann read Brodie's No Man Knows My History before he bombed and kill two prominent Salt Lake City residents in 1985. Hofmann set out to destroy the LDS church. Hofmann's favorite text to discredit the Mormon church was Fawn's Brodie's No Man Knows My History.

No doubt that they were written by true believing Mormons. I find it hilarious when they refer to their holier-than-thou Hugh Nibley? Who was Hugh Nibley outside of Utah? He was NOBODY! No real scholars outside the Mormon Church ever took him seriously. As for the people who really want to find out a little more about the Mormon corporation, I recommend the book \\"Leaving the Saints\\" by Hugh Nibley's daughter. In that book she explains in details what kind of man he was (he was one of those men who rape their daughters!). Furthermore, it is a very well written book - a real page turner!Fawn M. Brodie's book is very well researched and has been acclaimed by scholars throughout the world. She was a real Professor, who worked for a real university. She was not one of those puppets who teach at BYU. Joseph Smith was a sick man and there are tons of documents that prove it.The Mormon Church was founded to make easy money and it still does today. Why do you think that the Mormon missionaries are instructed to wait until the last minute to talk to their prospective converts about the law of tithing (giving 10% of your income to the Mormon corporation)?

Certainly some more than others. Mormonism stinks. Smith was just a charlatan that told his lies long enough he came to believe them, unlike some other prophets that were half a bubble off from the word go. Fawn Brodie did a good job of exposing him for what he was. The book is a bit dry, but considering the knotthead and his looney coherts she was trying to write soberly about, it is well done."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I thought that Mz.

She points out that Smith was only human with human failings. I find that knowing the TRUTH about a personage frees me from seeing that person as a god-man as Christians have done to the poor Rabbi from Nazereth.

At the time I found the subject intensely fascinating, but the writing struck me as highly fictionalized, with lengthy asides describing Joseph Smith's inner motives and thinking processes -- not biography but psycho-biography. The bottom line was that Brodie pegged Joseph Smith as a deliberate and evil-minded fraud.I recently reread Brodie at the age of 43, now much older and slightly wiser, and also having read a thing or two in my day. On my second reading I wonder if this book might really have more to do with Brodie herself -- a disenchanted and deeply bitter Mormon -- than with Joseph Smith.There is no doubt that \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has a wide influence in the world. I would caution the reader, however, to read at least one other biography of Joseph Smith along with Brodie's -- I recommend Donna Hill's unstintingly honest but affectionate \\"Joseph Smith: The First Mormon\\" (Doubleday 1977). If Brodie wrote out of hate, at least seek a counterbalance with the reading of one who has not."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"After fifty reviews, not much data can be added, but many conclusions can be reached!Moreover, like the 2000 election or OJ Simpson, most everyone already has an opinion about this book, so this probably won't do much good. But . . .1) Brodie's style is readable, which is more of a criticism of everyone else. It flows and is quite readable, which is a rare thing.2) The tone of the book is quite unusual. It is almost a fictional narrative or a speech where the heartstrings are played like a violin. She builds up suspense (which is not quite scholarly), ask questions that she never answers, and peers into the mind and motives of Joseph Smith. She, therefore, is getting beyond the manuscripts and primary sources, and becomes a &quot;scholarly outlaw.&quot; How does she know what Joseph Smith felt and thought unless Joseph Smith tells her? And if there is no journal entry, where is the data? Ascholarship!3) Many of the conclusions about the book are really conclusions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and not about what Ms. Brodie says, inasmuch as people who dislike the Church will agree with her. This is called &quot;multiplying the mirrors, but not increasing the light.&quot;4) Ms. Brodie asserts a &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot; interpretation of Joseph Smith: &quot;You don't know how you got there/You just know you want out/believing in yourself/as much as you doubt.&quot; But confidence is the one thing we see with Joseph Smith. Two Temples, several cities planned and founded, three-star general in the Militia, mayor, presidential candidate, prophet, seer, revelator, and father to boot! All this in forty-four years! I for one feel lazy!5) Logic 1: &quot;Ad Hominem&quot; and &quot;Genetic Fallacy&quot;: I am an active endowed member, and a BYU graduate to boot, but are my conclusions tainted because of may bias? Is &quot;Schindler's List&quot; biased because Spielburg is Jewish?Bytheway, I bough my copy in Provo, UT, and the BYU Library has sixteen copies!6) Logic 2: &quot;Hasty Generalization&quot;: Are you going to base all of you knowledge on Joseph Smith from one book. Yes, this cuts both ways, but still are you going to rely on one source for your understanding of Joseph Smith. I though Amazon.com patrons were smarter than that!7) Alternative books are Bushman's &quot;The Origins of Mormonism,&quot; and Madsen's &quot;Joseph Smith the Prophet.&quot; Or you could read his history on your own, and make up your own mind independent of pundits, fanatics, and *gasp* Amazon.com reviewers!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I find it interesting that sides are still being chosen both attacking and defending a work so old and obviously out-of-date.This is especially puzzling when one considers all the more current works written on both sides of the fence, using better historical methods and better research procedures that have been published since Brodie's revision of her book in 1971 [that's 39 years people-wake-up!!]There are many problems with the work Brodie did, as well as many insights and benefits to her work: Joseph Smith (1945), Thaddeus Stevens (1959), Sir Richard Burton (1967), Thomas Jefferson (1974) and Richard Nixon (1981), still generate both acclaim and criticism. The criticism usually centers on her use of Freudian psychobiographical techniques to ascertain a historical figure's experiences and motivations through a psychological interpretation of their writings.Although this seminal work is still the most analytical and provocative biography written on Smith, the following four problems are conspicuous with Brodie's research:1) Before beginning her examination of sources, she was already convinced that Joseph Smith's religious experiences were unauthentic. Thus, the volume's naturalistic perspectives (along with its limiting choices of explanatory categories) were preconceived before the research began.2) She also chose not to access the documents in the LDS Historical Archives at Salt Lake City. Consequently, her volume lacks both the balance and information available from the single largest collection on Mormonism.3) By ignoring the aforementioned collection she was ignorant of the fact that most of Joseph Smith's papers and diaries were written by scribes in first-person for him, thus, her psychobiographical theories were actually based on other people's writings; and4) Her libraries of research were located mainly in New York, Connecticut, Chicago and Missouri, which in the 1940's were chiefly anti-Mormon collections. Ergo, her book reflects an anti-Mormon attitude.A more balanced but less piercing treatment may be found in Bushman's, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling.If you really want to know the background of both Brodie and her first work, an excellent book that details both is Newell G. Bringhurst's, Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.Two scholarly LDS reviews on Brodie's volume are: Marvin S. Hill, \\"Secular or Sectarian History? A Critique of \`No Man Knows My History,'\\" Church History 43 (March 1974) 78 96; and Louis Midgley, \\"The Brodie Connection: Thomas Jefferson and Joseph Smith,\\" Brigham Young University Studies 20 (Fall 1979) 59-67."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Wow! I was really impressed with this book. I only THOUGHT I understood Mormonism!This book traces the beginnings of Joseph Smiths creation, from his beginnings in upstate New York, to his lynching in Carthage, Illinois. The author has researched her subject meticulously, as evident by the bibliography. Many early Mormon writings are quoted, including letters from Joseph Smith himself.After reading this book, I can better understand how people could be deceived into believing the Book of Mormon and other Mormon writings. It is clearer now how Mormonism got a foothold in America--it was birthed into a sub-culture filled with people who, while professing Christianity, really had little understanding of the Word of God, thus could be duped quite easliy. (This by the way, is how Mormonism maintains its grasp today.)I don't care how many other books you've read on Mormonism, or how much you think you know about the subject; you need to read this book.By the way, the author does not &quot;slam&quot; Joseph Smith (or his followers). On the contrary, she seems to have quite a bit of respect for him and what he became."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book has been around a long time. It is one of the most quoted books on Mormon history. Some of the assumptions and some of the conjectures made have since been found to be a little off, the history that was written was a wonderfully accurate look at the man Joseph Smith Jr. Fawn Brodie is a noted historian and author. In the beginning of the book it seemed that Ms. Brodie was sympathetic to Joseph Smith and the Mormons. As her research and the book progressed, the tone became more negative, just as mine did through the research I did."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"At the time of its release, Brodies work was either either a masterpiece or muckraking depending upon the vested interest one brought to the review. Time has not been kind to all of the books details or to the methods of psychological inquiry used by Brodie. Indeed Smith has proven to be far too complex a character for the biographer. Still if one is to engage in a serious study of early Mormonism or the life of America's prophet, Brodie is a foundation work if for no other reason than to set the parameters for what follows. The life of Joseph may never fully be realized in print and Donna Hill's work is actually much closer to reviving the man than is Brodies'. Still this work will hold its place in Mormon history for no other reason than that it motivated many others of all religous persuasions and scholastic ability to look seriously at the latter-day movement and attempt to explain its significance."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"To be certain I had a balanced picture of Joseph Smith, undoubtedly an American original, I bought and read a short biography sold by Deseret Press. In the 160 pages, there was so little substance for so historical figure, I caught myself thinking \\"get on with it\\".That didn't happen. So, back to Fawn Brodie. Her volume gave me at least, starting places to research. This did not happen in the Deseret volume. Although Brodie could be accused of being biased, I believe she let the historical evidence take her where it would."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am more than happy to have read this book in the middle of my LDS-philic book hysteria and during the bicentennial celebration of Joseph's year of birth. As you can see from my other reviews, I have read Signature books a lot and would like to recommend theirs \\"The prophet puzzle\\" and \\"Making of a prophet\\". In these books several new aspects of Joseph Smith Jr are described and his rather multifaceted profile is acknowledged.Fawn can easily be misunderstood depending on the ideological stand of the reader. I for example found Hugh Nibley review/criticism of her book disgusting. Hugh Nibely, whose scholarship I admire and find amazing, has written an awful attacking review, \\"No ma'm, that's not history\\". In some way, critics (mostly conservative LDS but also scholars in autobiography) has seen her book as an effort to prove her own understanding of Joseph. If she wanted to prove that he was false, than she was subjective enough to chose the sources she wanred. Of course, every biographer has to do some filling in of details. When Fawn writes about how Joseph thought or felt in some situations, she guesses of course, but there is always a novellist in the historian and especially in Fawn, with her beautiful literary style. The book should be read as a historical novel, rather than a footnote-stuffed diary encyclopedia - by the way, it has footnotes.!I believe, from what I have read about Joseph and from Joseph, that Fawn hasn't at all exagerated her sources or manipulated them. What she has done, is not believing that Joseph wanted to be a prophet. She clearly shows a knowledge of how to handle different sources. The way she has gathered all the newspaper articles or read all the affadivits, good or bad, shows that she has wanted to give an optimally correct picture of Joseph. Many scholars have agreed about her evolutionary view of Joseph and that Joseph was a child of his time.I believe - being a scholar myself - that Joseph full heartedly wanted to be a prophet and he also became one, for himself and for others! He wanted a united Christianity, a more powerful Christianity. I don't agree with Fawn about him wanting to magnifying himself thru religion, no, he could have managed well, by becoming a politician - which he also tried. I see in Joseph a boy with a spiritual mind.At the same time, she is right about Joseph being the one behind the revelation. He was sure about the fact that his feelings were the same as god's. Brodie managed to refute the Spauldig theory about the origins of Book of Mormon and also the epilepsy diagnosis of Joseph. She introduced the View of the Hebrew as a plausbile source to Book of Mormon, something which BH Robert, the great LDS historian, also had noticed some 10 years before (1930s). She has managed to create a whole person - but too paradoxal, I had a difficulty to understand Joseph thru her.Joseph becomes the one that smoked and drank, but also the one who healed, who cried and suffered with his people. The one who went from woman to woman, but kept in the centre of his heart, Emma, his first wife. The one who was afraid of dying, but who knew that the end was near. Capturing this personality is not easy and Fawn has done an excellent job. But there are answers still to come about this remarkable man.Fawn shows thru her book, that Joseph was a human, not a prophet, but a strategic master in folklore, religion and charistamic leadership. For her, he was a strategic deciever - still in 1971 she couldn't udnerstand why Joseph chose religion for achieving his leadership dreams.Even though Fawn wanted to see an irreligious Joseph behind the \\"Thus saith the Lord\\", she has for me confirmed my picture of a highly spriritual Joseph."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"An outstanding and at times exhaustive history of Joseph Smith, founder of The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, the Mormons...Very detailed and excellently researched, but it is obvious--too obvious at times--that the author, Fawn Brodie, has a very low opinion, perhaps even detests, the man she is writing about and the the church he established.One wonders if she, like Scott McClellan's book on the Bush administration, is not getting her \\"pound of (vindictive) flesh,\\" though there may be some truth is what is said.There is a feeling, a strong feeling, that balance and objectivity may be missing from this work, but even so, it is a good, worthwhile read.This much is certain: The church Joseph Smith established could never have grown and become it the church it is today until he passed from the scene. It then no longer had to defend him and his wilding gyrating ideas and visions.It makes one wonder if the Mormon Church has become the church it is today--has found its way--in spite of Joesph Smith rather than because of him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book helps the reader to know the truth about Joseph Smith, and how his story has changed over the years, revised as the LDS church sees fit. Anybody investigating the church should read this book in order to find the truth about the first prophet of the LDS church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If you are LDS you will most likely see the book as \\"anti-Mormon\\". It would be difficult for anybody who is LDS to believe anything in this book that puts Joseph Smith in a bad light. After all, he is revered as the prophet of the LDS church, and a negative reaction to this book would be expected from any believing member of the faith.Catholics do not want to read bad things about their popes, and LDS do not want to read bad things about their prophet.One does wonder what type of man Joseph Smith was. Whether Fawn Brodie was completely wrong in everything she wrote about him or not, this is a fascinating read.Another interesting read is Losing a Lost Tribe and By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus.By the way, don't waste your time on idiotic drivel from Hugh Nibley. He is merely an apologist for the Mormon cult, and his book, No Ma'am, That's Not History is as dull and unresearched a book as you will ever find."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"In studying Mormons as part of a look at some of my ancestors, I hoped to find that this book would be a purely historical account of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. While I found the information on his plural marriages accurate with other sources, some of the arguments on how the Book of Mormon was a reflection of Joseph Smith's life were bent to match the author's stance. Brodie refers to Nephi's family as a carbon copy of Smith's, but she changed the birth order of Nephi to mimic that of Smith. Brodie also claims that Smith was so concerned with the ideal world of the Book of Mormon, that he didn't include harlots or prostitutes. Funny- one of only a handful of women mentioned by name in the Book of Mormon, was a harlot named Isabel in the Alma chapter!Brodie also makes some weird conclusions and doesn't seem to focus on things contrary to her view. For example, Prof. Charles Anthon was visited by Smith's financial patron Martin Harris, and supposedly told him that the hieroglyphics of the record Smith was tranlating the Book of Mormon from were bunk. Yet Harris claimed that before he mentioned where the writings came from Anthon wrote a letter verifing their ancient origins. The letter was then ripped up when Smith was mentioned. Either way, Harris went on to mortgage his farm to help Smith finish translating the book. I think Anthon must have told him something positive, because would Harris financially ruin himself he was told by an expert that Smith was a sham? Brodie doesn't even dwell on this point, she quickly changes the subject.Another point Brodie doesn't look at is why the other men who saw the Book of Mormon (the witnesses) never recanted their statements. Most of them left the Mormon church at one time or another, but none of them ever took back what they said. Many of them called Smith a 'fallen prophet'- meaning that he was a prophet to them, just he did wrong in their eyes later. Brodie's only explanation for any of this is that Smith hypontized these men. If Smith had hypnotized these men, why did they leave his church and ridicule him eventually? Had the hypnotism been broken, don't you think they would realize that the golden plates were part of the trickery too? Again Brodie doesn't go in this direction.With these and other discrepancies, it was very hard to take anything Brodie wrote about seriously. When I later learned that she herself was once Mormon (related to Mormon President David McKay), I was not surprised at her obvious negative bias. There has got to be better books out there on Joseph Smith- more factual and less conjecture."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" was first published in 1945. On various points of detail, it has been superseded by more recent research. Also, one can debate whether or not Brodie's psychological and hypercritical take on Joseph Smith is correct or methodologically meaningful. Still, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" remains the classical biography of the Mormon prophet. Everyone who is interested in Mormonism from a non-Mormon (\\"non-faith promoting\\") perspective must read and come to terms with this book. Brodie herself was expelled from the Mormon (LDS) Church after the book's publication. Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley responded with a piece bearing the sexist title \\"No, Ma'm, that's not history\\". I'm not sure whether it's still available, or whether anyone really cares. As for Brodie, she eventually became a successful history professor and wrote biographies of Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Burton, Thomas Jefferson and Richard Nixon. I haven't read them, but apparently they are heavily dependent on Freud and psychoanalysis, which strikes me as somewhat problematic. (Many American scholars seem to have a very reverential attitude to Freud. Perhaps patricide is in order?)What makes Brodie's biography controversial is her forthright description of Joseph Smith as a fanatic and deliberate con man. In a later edition, she dubs him a megalomaniac. To Brodie, it seems obvious that if somebody makes claims that are patently absurd from an atheist viewpoint, that person must be a conscious liar. In the same manner, she writes off Joseph Smith's earliest followers as easily fooled, manipulated or hypnotized. Today, it's considered bad politic among anthropologists or comparative religion scholars to take matters quite this far. (Richard Dawkins is another case again. But then, he's a biologist.) However, I must admit that I feel a certain sympathy for Fawn Brodie's position. Smith, after all, made some pretty extreme claims!Regular prophets claim to have visions, hear voices or meet supernatural personages. The visionary might be honestly reporting a subjective, psychological experience. He may even be (honestly) delusional. But Joseph Smith claimed to have found, seen and handled an actual material artefact, the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon were \\"translated\\" through the aid of an equally material artefact, the Urim and the Thummim (apparently, some kind of spectacles). Moreover, the Three Witnesses claimed to have had a collective vision of an angel showing them the golden plates, while the Eight Witnesses claimed to have both seen and handled the plates in a strictly down-to-earth fashion. The problem, of course, is that the entire story is absurd: there never were any golden plates, no Urim and Thummim, etc. It's therefore difficult not to charge Joseph Smith with conscious fraud, and his followers with extreme gullibility.The same basic story applies to the Book of Abraham, where Smith did have access to an actual document, but where the \\"translation\\" is fraudulent. Add to this Smith's personal character, which included secret polygamy (while the Book of Mormon condemns polygamy), joining the Freemasons and copying their rituals (while the Book of Mormon condemns Masonry), revisions after the fact of published church material, etc. And what about prohibiting alcohol in Nauvoo while still running a saloon in the main building? Smith's disciples don't inspire much confidence either. The Three Witnesses all left the Mormon Church, yet insisted that their testimony about the golden plates was true. Smith's estranged wife Emma Hale Smith joined a monogamous breakaway group after her husband's death, taking revenge on Smith's polygamous successor Brigham Young by claiming that Smith had never been a polygamist.If this is how religions are usually conceived, I rather stay agnostic!Readers of \\"No Man Knows My History\\" should also consult \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History\\", a critical reappraisal of Brodie's book edited by Newell Bringhurst. Both are available through our favourite vendor, Amazon.com."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie once confided with a close friend and fellow author prior to completing this work: \\"More and more I am coming to believe that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one. There is plenty of evidence to write a book without fictionalizing, but to bring to life the man's inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex character, requires I think the novelist's perception rather than the historians digging\\".This biography does indeed read like a novel which presents Smith's life as a marvellous adventure of a man living life to the fullest, and yet deceiving thousands (and possibly himself). It is obvious that Brodie has performed many years of extensive research in producing this material. Unfortunately her content, while based on genuine historical documents, is completely biased in the way it attempts to portray Joseph Smith's life.The book presents Smith as a man intent on deceiving the world, and Brodie attempts to focus each event as being a calculated decision to further that intent. She uses both well known and also not so well known sources, but does so selectively in a way to support her viewpoint. As a result, she often omits equally valid sources and material that would counter her personal belief. She highlights each \\"mistake\\" Smith makes and attempts to identify the motive that drove him to do the things he did. This bias is her major downfall as a historian - a role I believe which should be focused on documenting historical facts, not personal supposition.Fortunately, about halfway through the book, when Smith's \\"revelations\\" settle down to only a few in his final ten years of life, the author's agenda also settles down somewhat and the second half makes for a captivating, not so agenda driven, account.On a positive note, this book contains a fair amount of material not found in other accounts, and for me personally, that makes it worth the time to read it. It covers from his birth right through to his murder with significant details of his life in between.Whether Joseph Smith was or was not what he claimed to be, can never be \\"proven\\", as there are logical arguments on his life's history that support or discredit whatever it is you want to believe. If you are looking for arguments to support he was not what he claimed to be, you will absolutely love this book.In summary, I found this book to be an easy read and a classic work on the life of Joseph Smith, with portions that cannot be easily dismissed or ignored. Brodie has produced a pioneering and thorough biography on a man you'll either love or come to despise. Just don't let the author's personal beliefs influence your own opinion on who Joseph Smith was (or was not). The answer won't be found from reading one un-objective account.N.B. For the record, I believe this statement is just as true for \\"pro\\" Smith authors like Bushman and many others.Edit: Three days after writing this review I completed readingReconsidering No Man Knows My History(see my review). It contains an essay by Newell G. Bringhurst that included comments, better voiced than my own. One of Brodie's contemporaries reviewed her work upon publication (in 1945) by stating that she quotes \\"copiously . . . from books by embittered apostates\\" asserting that \\"now and then she appears to state as undisputable facts what can only be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence.\\" That her book was \\"almost more a novel than a biography because she rarely hesitates to give the content of a mind or to explain motives which at best can only be surmised.\\" That same reviewer ended their review with \\"It is nevertheless a probing and very satisfying volume.\\"(p.49)"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is appropriately titled because it give a side of the story that is seldom heard within the Mormon religion. Unfortunately, that is also it's only drawback. Brody gives much of the \\"negative\\" information while minimizing the many characteristics that made Joseph Smith such a charismatic and popular figure. It is good that people have a place to learn about Joseph's deceitful living as a youth, the real history behind the Book of Mormon, and his philandering with married women while prophet; but the biography would be much more powerful if it included a more balanced presentation of his strengths, also.Despite the slant against Joseph Smith, this book is excellent. Brody has done thorough and well-documented research and has written in a style that makes this book a pleasureable read. It is a must for anyone interested in American, Western, or Mormon history. However, this is probably not the book that a practicing Mormon who is happy with their faith should read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Without question, Fawn Brodie has produced a masterwork of religious history with this volume. I have been passionately interested in Latter-day Saint history and theology for several years, and feel it would be improper to formulate an opinion of Joseph Smith without consulting this work. Her conclusions will, of course, be attacked by members of the Latter-day Saint faith, but I would hope you would read it and form your own opinion.It's well-written, using a style that is both authoritative and approachable, well-paced and well-thought out. Please don't number me as an opponent of the Saints; I simply investigated their theology as part of a personal quest and found difficulties with it. Certainly, you should read more than one work dealing with subject, and make up your mind accordingly.Make sure, however, that this is a cornerstone of your search-I believe you will find it well worth your efforts."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's work is the starting point for scholars who want to understand the evolution of thinking about Jos Smith. Even the latest work by Bushman owes her a debt of gratitude. Two excellent and carefully crafted refutations of parts of her work were written by Hugh Nibley and Marvin Hill both BYU professors at one time or another. Although a polemic, she does exonerate the Mormon prophet from an age old controversy. Smith had been accused of plagiarizing the Book of Mormon from a manuscript of Samuel Spaulding. Brodie is the first to demolish such an assertion. For that alone it is worth a read.Nevertheless, Brodie, who took a psychoanalytical approach to her biographical subjects often stretched her sources beyond the breaking point. Yet, although psychoanalytic (psycho-history) approaches to biography are out of favor among mainstream historians, she cannot simply be discounted because of her controversial methods. Brodie demonstrates the best and worst of the approach. You can dislike her methodology, but her works cannot be ignored. Some absolutely hated her work on Jefferson and Nixon for taking such an approach.There is a lesson for true believerss who feel threatened by Smith's biography--History is not a discipline one bases his or faith upon."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read this book while living in Idaho in the 60s. Returning to Idaho in 1999 and being confronted more then ever with Mormon society I felt it necessary to start reading the controversial history of the Mormon movement. I find Joseph Smith to be an imposter, a man hungry for recognition and a man willing to cheat his way to wealth and power. This book and the research Brodie did to write it is an eye opener. A prophet for profit."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie has helped expose the LDS Church as a cult that deserves the attention of both state and federal authorities.

SHE DID NOT REALLY EXPLAIN WELL WHY THE MORMONS WERE SO HATED IN MISSOURI. IT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE THIEVING GENTILE PROPERTY AND THIS WAS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED IN HER NARRATIVE. ALSO , AND THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT, SHE TRIES TO GUESS AT HIS MOTIVES. A VERY DIFFICULT TASK INDEED. SHE IS NO PSYCHIATRIST YET SHE THEORISES ABOUT HIS BRAIN QUITE A LOT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED HER TO EXPLAIN IN THE BOOK WHY SHE DID NOT CONSIDER THE REPORTS OF HIS TIME IN AN INSANE INSTITUTION WORTH MENTIONING IN THE MAIN BODY OF HER WORK.

Why go for more when you have found perfection and it bites you on the nose?YOu can tell this woman has done her fair share of homework since the footnotes are totally titanic.

It is extremely detailed and uses a great vocabulary. It's a difficult read because of the style of writing done by the author."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Yes, buy and read this book. You can see from the reviews that it is controversial. Reading controversial literature generally makes people more well rounded.The controversy doesn't revolve around the merits of the book. Any book that touches a religious theme has the same source of antagonism. A large number of people reading the history of Joseph Smith are doing so to ask the question: Was Smith truly the divine relevator of God or was he a charlatan?Such controversies are always mysteries.Accurate historical and scientific research has a wreckless history of messing with beliefs based on revelation. Look at the job that Copernicus did on the Catholic Church with his little diagrams suggesting the earth was round.Ms. Brodie was a faithful member of the LDS Church who changed her mind on this issue while doing her historical research. Yes, she is an apostate. She brings to the surface many of the facts that led to her conclusions.Of course, it should be noted that she is researching in a field where others have done twisting of facts to cast Smith as a living saint.Over all, it appears to be an extremely well researched work in a field where all of the research is questionable in nature. If you are interested in LDS or Utah history, I would strongly recommend the book.If your are wanting to read the accepted version of Joseph Smith's life, I would recommend reading The Work and The Glory by Gerald Lund.If you enjoy learning, I would pick up Brodie's book, it is far more interesting."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I have been intrested in Mormanism (not being one or ever wanting to become one) so I read this as background. I was amazed to see how manipulitive Joseph was and just how far people will go when they &quot;believe&quot; even when there is no evidence! The names, places and events in the pre-civil war era were fascinating"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Well I finally finished this book. This is not a book a reader will finish in a short time. Overall the book is extraordinary and certainly was revolutionary in its time.Joseph Smith was a very deceitful con artist but at the same time a very fascinating historical figure to study. It takes quite a charismatic man to have such power over other men, that men willingly let Joseph Smith \\"marry\\" their wives, and then they themseleves take the wives back again after they've had sex with their \\"prophet.\\"And poor little teen-age girls became plural wives to Joseph Smith because Smith convinced them it was their only guarantee to eternal salvation for them and their families. And of course the list of other facts about Joseph Smith that the Mormon church wishes no one knew about is extensive!Surely the Mormon church only made themselves look rediculous when they ex-communicated Brodie, as well as other authors whose only crime was telling the truth about history. Joseph Smith was an American who ran for president of the United States and who started an American born religion - he is a man who will be researched and history books will be written about him, regardless of how much the Mormon church dislikes this.And as American and patriotic and politically correct the Mormon church tries to be, they are very un-American to practice excommunication on its members who are only exercising their freedom of speech. But I'm sure Brodie and all the others didn't care about getting ex-communicated from an organization that is so weird and false. It's just a shame that the Mormon religion is so entrapping and makes it so difficult for its brain-washed members to discover the truth.Fascinating book!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's book is fantastic, and I can't believe it's taken me so many years to get around to reading it. I've read so much heavily edited history--produced by the church. Even when reading it, you can tell there are major omissions. No Man Knows My History fills in the gaps and stands as an excellent, well researched biography of Joseph Smith. The Mormon church is shown to be founded by an uneducated, charismatic loafer.The book starts by demonstrating that Joseph Smith and his father never wanted to really work hard for a living. Joseph ran around telling other people where to dig for buried treasure, even after his supposed first vision. Even though this was ridiculous and deceitful, Joe learned that people were drawn to his magnetic personality--he realized he could make things up and not have to work for a living. He invented a largely boring adventure story so he could have a nidus for his new religion; and hopefully, the proceeds might help his father get out of debt.Joseph would get adulation, money, land, unearned respect, and sexual gratification from many people over his short career before being gunned down by an angry mob. Fawn Brodie does a wonderful job of scrupulously citing her many sources! Those who wring their hands at the truth her biography brings to light should also note that many, if not most, of her quotes are from History of the Church.Leaders of the LDS church exhort its members not to read anything that speaks against doctrines or major members of the church. Though much of what disenfranchised or anti-Mormons say must be taken with a grain of salt, not all of it should be discarded.There are so, so many anti-Mormon writers--and even in Smith's day, books were being written against him, the Book of Mormon, and his church. There is a simple reason for this--he was a fraud. While subtracting some of the venom from these documents, it is clear that Joseph Smith didn't pay his debts (and probably never intended to), seduced teens, lied about fantastical visions and translating abilities, and belittled his wife. No one can read this accurate biography of Smith and believe in the church he founded. He took from others to make his life rich and fun--it caught up with him in tarrings and featherings, jailings and arrests, but these were small pains indeed when a bevy of women were anxiously hoping he'd choose their house to spend the night.Brodie should have won a Pulitzer for No Man Knows My History. Over time, and as more information has become available from historical research, none of Brodie's major conclusions can be tarnished. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is highly readable, compelling, and fascinating. It takes a subject--Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon Church--that has been written about by countless different people with countless different viewpoints, and makes it into a gripping narrative that will make you turn its pages as fast as you can read them.But this is hardly a history book. While it may profess to untangle the mess of contradictory literature produced by Mormons, Non-Mormons, and \\"Anti-Mormons,\\" all it really does is tangle that mess up a little more.The book is well researched and contains extensive footnotes and easy-to-read appendices, but the conclusions drawn by that research use a very, very questionable methodology. Where Fawn Brodie has a historical Point A and a Point B, she feels no qualms creatively filling in the spaces between them.For instance, she writes that as Joseph Smith concluded writing the Mormon scripture \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" he became troubled that the book dealt only with the ancient \\"Nephite\\" people from 600 B.C. to A.D. 400, and wanted to pay some attention to the then-contemporary speculation that people had immigrated to the Americas after the fall of the biblical Tower of Babel and then dispersed there into different tribes. \\"At any rate,\\" she says, \\"he was impressed with the probability of the 'dispersionist' thesis, for in the last weeks of writing he dictated a terse little history of a people called the Jaredites, which he appended to the Nephite record.\\"Here she has Point A--that there was speculation about the origin of America's early people--and Point B--that the last chapter of the Book of Mormon professes to be about a group of America's earlier inhabitants--but everything in the middle is total conjecture. A complete guess. A theory. It would be fine if she presented it all as such, but here it's presented matter-of-factly, as history. As undeniable truth. Stephen Ambrose, a real historian, would have probably laughed in her face about this sort of thing.The book has a lot of problems like this. It makes a ton of suppositions, and often considers a source valid when it supports her ideas of the way things were, but then renounces those exact same sources when they say something she disagrees with. It's not a perfect read, but still, things do make themselves evident that will probably make most Mormons uncomfortable, but that are hard to deny due to how many different sources back them up. I think every Mormon should read it, just to counter the neutered faith-promoting histories that are generally accepted without question within their faith, but it should still be read with a shaker full of salt. And I think anyone else that reads it should read something else to counterbalance this--either Hugh Nibley's imperfect but insightful \\"No Ma'am That's Not History,\\" or the more recent \\"Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.\\"...Because this is certainly NOT the last word on the subject."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Having been raised to see Joseph Smith as something just short of a God, many members of the LDS church are quite surprised to read the realities of the Joseph Smith story; the natural reaction is, as has been demonstrated in previous reviews, to lump Brodie in the &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; author category and defend the foundations of their faith. Interestingly enough, Brodie was still in full fellowship with the Church at the time of the book's publication, seriously dampening the &quot;anti-mo&quot; theory.Proven time and again in the decades since the publication of &quot;No Man Knows...&quot; is the veracity of Brodie's sources and research. One simply has to thumb through the pages of sources at the end of the book to appreciate how exhaustive Ms. Brodie's research was. Not only does she utilize and cite &quot;objective,&quot; non-mormon sources, but there are a number of quotes taken from church sponsored writings, i.e. _History of the Church_.As a former missionary for the church, I appreciated Ms. Brodie's own objectivity in her writing of _No Man..._. So often the material members of the LDS Church are presented with is so slanted and negative. Ms. Brodie frequently points out Joseph's intelligence, passion, and creativity. Ultimately, Ms. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith feels sympathetic towards the prophet's weaknesses and his sincere desire and urge to be a prophetic holy man.Ms. Brodie makes sense of questions that have long troubled members of the Mormon church, such as polygamy, the causes of Joseph's final incarceration at Carthage, and the continual rotation of early church leaders. In fact, I found Ms. Brodie's hypothesis on the foundations of polygamy far more satisfactory and sensible than any I have ever heard in my 23 years in the church.Though certainly not recommended for the conservative, nonquestioning member of the LDS church, this book will provide an invaluable look at the most prominent character in all Mormonism for those with an interest in the Prophet and his vision."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Wanting to know more about the history of Mormonism, I thought the obvious place to start was at the source - Joseph Smith. There are several bios, but I wanted to avoid hagiography, and so shied away from ones by church members.This bio dates from the 1940s, with a later revision in the '60's, I think. The author was a U Cal historian of good reputation. I appreciate most that she is scrupulous in not taking sides despite the problematic nature of her subject. That's especially important, I think, since Joseph Smith appears to have relished being difficult to describe.I have not finished reading but am pleased with the first few chapters, and will add to this when I've done."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I picked up No Man Knows My History because I like Fawn Brodie's work. It's not an attack on Mormonism. It's not an attack on Joseph Smith. If anything I was struck by the sympathetic portrayal of Smith and his followers. Fawn Brodie doesn't appear to enjoy writing unsavory things about her subject. I'd say the book is a fair and accurate one. The writing is so enjoyable. Brodie wrote nonfiction with a fiction author's flair. I picked it up at nine in the morning and kept coming back to it until I'd finnished it at around midnight."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I was somewhat reluctant to pick this book up, as biographies tend to put me to sleep. However, Ms. Brodie's work is without doubt the best biograpy I have read. Her subject, the Mormon founder Joseph Smith, is presented from his infancy up to the time of his death, with the social and political background also covered, and it makes fascinating reading.Ms. Brodie leaves the reader with the impresison that Smith was a con-artist of the highest order, who dreamt up supposed \\"revelatons\\" (\\"thus saith the Lord\\") at will, and I found myself saying \\"this guy can't have had the nerve to do what he did\\". In spite of his deception, the reader can't dislike the character. But it is also made quite clear that Joseph Smith, with all his personal charisma, was certainly no \\"prophet of God\\". He was a first-rate deceiver. The story Fawn Brodie writes reads as an adventure tale of a colorful conman who, sadly, met his end before he mended his ways.Verdict: don't be put off by the fact it's a biography. It's an enthraling read. Especially recommended to LDS readers, who will find out a bit about Smith they won't have known before."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is the definative Joseph Smith autobiography, Brodie is famous for the portraits of men of power and Joseph Smith is far more interesting then Richard Nixon. Brodie really is viewed as an absolute evil in the Mormon church, there is no doubt about that, I remember hearing her name sworn at long before I ever heard of the book. Arguing about religion is a long and no-way street, one can only enjoy the book as a great introduction to the most interesting part of American history. The book reads like a charm and is really entertaining, and regardless of that entertainment value- Brodie has you wondering what is to be believed from her sources, and she certainly succeeded in luring me in to Mormon History, after four years of continual reading, still not able to reach conclusions about Polygamy and the nature of the early Mormon church. These questions Brodie raises throughout her book. I didn't give the book a five star rating simply because I am really annoyed when the author tells us what Joseph Smith was thinking, on the basis of her Freudian analysis. I really don't buy it, and honestly don't know what place that technique has in legitimate history.I recommend this book to those who are willing to keep reading."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I first read this when it first came out based on Ms. Brodie's reputation as a researcher and biographer and a historian. As much as the LDS church has tried to discredit her and others who write truthful albeit unflattering books about them and their faith, one has to wonder if having an objective quest is to be avoided at all costs?! This book will open many readers' eyes as to the unvarnished portrait of a very charismatic man. There is no Joseph Smith bashing here: the author lets contemporary, eyewitness accounts stand on their own. One person who knew Joseph Smith might give a rancourous version of something, but Ms. Brodie found many accounts of the same events by various people, including those adherents to theis new religion, even from his wife. If you want to see what this man was all about, where archeological and historical facts bolster or diminish this intriguing person, read this book. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie was light years ahead of her time. She was by no means some whacked out disgruntled female liberal rebel without a cause, as the Mormon Church would like to paint her. She was a credible scholar, Ph.D from UCLA. A master of history and a person who had the mega courage to expose the Mormon Church as a Fraud! As an EX Mormon of over 46 years, a former High Priest and former Mormon Temple worker, I thank God that I finally had the courage/curiosity to read this landmark book on Mormonism. Written over 60 years ago in the 1940's, Fawn Brodie NAILS Mormonism founder Joe Smith to the cross of truth. The Mormon apologists can only make desperate agonal jabs of ignorance in an attempt to counter punch the world class fighter arguments of Fawn Brodie as she systematically dismantles Joe Smith and his fraudulent Cult."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie wrote the definitive biography of Smith in \\"No Man Knows My History\\".. extensively researched, with a complete set of annotations and bibliographies. Many other books on the subject refer back to Brodie for much of their source material. A must read for those interested in the subject."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I just finished reading this poignant, rich and riveting look into the life of a man who was driven by his ego. A very talented story teller and a masterful charmer, he converted thousands in his day to following his church. The self proclaimed \\"one and only church\\". Brodie does her research thoroughly and completely, giving us a look at Joseph Smith the Man. Not a diluted form of history - or a sculpted version, but the facts. It's a must read. From a boy's curiosity about the Indian mounds and treasure seeking, to a man who marries over 50 women and runs for President of the United States. Whether you are a historian buff or just have an inquisitive mind regarding the mormon roots, this book is by far the best book I've read yet. Brodie was consequently ex-communicated from the church for NOT leaving out key components that the church wanted her to - thus giving us a true account of this historical man. A bright, eager, greedy and fallible man."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Outstanding book, and one that's caused a fair bit of consternation among the Mormon faithful. I'd take their criticisms with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I found this to be an excellent review of the life of Joseph Smith and a great read. It was written with candor and let the chips fall where they may. I do not believe that the Mormon church would agree with the many unflattering comments made about their prophet but it seems to be very well researched with supporting documents for each chapter. It also discounts many of the detractors of Joseph Smith as their comments were viewed as possibly coached by his enemies or unreliable due to the passage of time. This only adds credibility to the facts that were included. While this generally paints a very damaging picture of the prophet it does not seem to be a deliberate attempt to smear him or the Mormon church. It appears to be a straight forward well documented historical account. The author was also very sympathetic to the followers for the hostile treatment they suffered in Missouri and Illinois. The author also alludes to the numerous other prophets of the early 1800's. This is a fascinating treatment of an often overlooked aspect of American History. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Sixty and more years have passed since its publication, and \\"Know Man Knows My History\\" remains the best of the biographies of Joseph Smith, founder of THE quintessential American sect, predating Scientology in its (wildly) successful exploitation of human credulity. It should be required reading for all students of American history."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I have returned to read this book as a long-time favorite. I loved it for its readability, detailed scholarship, and intensely interesting history. This book makes an excellent gift. I have bought several copies, but none through Amazon."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"No Man Knows was an astounding read, fair, informative, at turns humorous. Been years since I read it and I seldom reread a book but this one is on the list of candidates for a second go. Reading biographies has never been my first choice which is another reason why No Man stands out as such a strong work. Timely reading."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie gained international renown for her landmark work on the life and teachings of Joseph Smith. She is even-handed and fair in recounting the positive, as well as negative, qualities of Joseph Smith. Some of the negatives include his \\"revelations\\" compelling women to marry him lest they incur the wrath of God as well as numerous \\"prophesies\\" that didn't come to pass. Her sources are firmly documented and she provides excellent footnotes, which allow the reader the opportunity to conduct further research. As is so often the case, when one lifts the veil on the early history of the Church of Latter Day Saints, one cannot avoid a convoluted, confused, and sordid picture. Like many other impartial scholars before and after her, her sincerity earned her excommunication from the church, which does not feel historic truth should be pronounced unless it is \\"faith-promoting.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am an active LDS member and proud to be called a Mormon. I read this book quite a few times, and I am glad I did. After reading this book, I still believe Josepth Smith was called of God to be a prophet, and my opinion of him has not changed. I encourage other faithful Mormons to read it because it tells the story of Joseph from the historical point of view and from a non-believers perspective. Although I question some of the historical facts that Mrs. Brodie used to state Joseph Smith's psychoanalysis, I think she does a good job with most of the historical data and resources she used.I am not embarrased by the origins of our church. I am not embarrassed by the life of Joseph Smith. I think we should embrace our past, the history of our religion, and it will help us understand the times and epoch under which Joseph lived his life in Missouri, Ohio, New York, and Illinois. Yes it is a little odd that Joseph Smith was crowned \\"King\\" in the Kingdom of God by the Council of Fifty, but they are opinions of people who said it many years later. The reader needs to know and understand what is real historical data and what is not. There are a lot of statements and affidavits signed by people. The question remains, did they hate Joseph? Of course, all is understandable, and the reader needs to read this book with an open mind intellectually, and be a scholar in its thorough analysis.I personally liked Brodie's book. I have read other books critical of Mormonism and I think its very healthy to know the church's true origins, past, and the conditions from which it arose.Everything in this life is carried out by FAITH. Where you believe in God or not, whether you are Christian or Muslim, Catholic or Mormon, or Protestant, FAITH is not necessarily based on facts. How can we prove God exists? How can we prove Christ existed or that He was the Messiah? How do we prove the Holy Ghost exists? How do we believe what's in the bible? How do we believe God? ......It's all FAITH. We walk by FAITH. You are either secular or spiritual. You either believe in God or you don't. We all have the freedom to choose, to believe. I for one believe Josepth Smith to be a prophet. I believe Jesus was the Messiah. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. Could I be wrong? Of course! But yet, I have FAITH and I choose to believe, and that settles it.But the book is a great read. I recommend you read it together with (and compare) to Bushman's \\"Rough Stone Rolling.\\" Both are very intellectually stimulating. It makes me appreciate Mormonism more."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It's not the salacious tale some reviewers would have you think, and it can drag in spots.Still, it's fascinating to read about this man, and the author does her best to find every scrap of information on him, and his family, and his followers. I didn't find this to be a \\"bash Mormons\\" book at all. In general, it was interesting to see how a very charismatic, creative, and charming poor kid built an empire.From this book, you get not only specific and detailed information (as much as there is available) but also a pretty balanced look at how the LDS Church began, but more specifically, what was it about this man, and this time, that created the powerful entity that is the LDS church today? Why did HIS church succeed when so many failed?It made me wonder about the founding of other churches. Would we call them \\"cult leaders\\" today, if they hadn't been a product of such recent history, and so much easier to document?So, for me this was a thought-provoking book, and I learned much more than I thought I would when I purchased it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Having been born and reared in the Church, it was not merely a \\"church,\\" but it was \\"The Only True Church on the Face of the Earth.\\" It was my identity, I served a misson, Branch President, H.P., Stake Mission President, sending my son on his mission next week, so imagine my sense of betrayal, and the helplessness and confusion I felt after reading this book. My three (3) pillars were: (1) a young man may spawn a lie, for personal motivations, but he can still be a Prophet, and nobody would carry a lie so far as to be killed for it; (2) No man could have written the Book of Mormon; and (3) the Temple Ceremony is so sacred and unusual that it could not have been imagined or contrived. Well, this most carefully documented, carefully written, carefully researched book, has all but destroyed my pillars. Fawn Brodie, Niece of the Prophet, David O. McKay, has done meticulous research and I have searched for but never found or read an official LDS Church response or debunking of it; I've searched the BYU F.A.R.M.S. site hoping for an academic, honest review of her evidence and hoping to find that Ms. Brodie's research was flawed or dishonest. But despite my motivations and wide-spread search, I have never read a criticism of her sources, or documented proof that her research is false, or that her conclusions are false, only that she had an agenda and some of her conclusions are specious and not well supported. Well, that is simply disengenuous criticism. To say that Ms. Brodie can only prove \\"A, B, C, and D,\\" but \\"jumps\\" to a conclusion that \\"E\\" exists, is simply blind faith ignorance and dishonest academia. This book constitutes the \\"mysteries,\\" that the Church teaches its members to stay away from. But it is hardly a mystery. This book explains with a clarity and insight never-before heard by an LDS member, how Joseph Smith wrote the Book of Mormon, how he practiced polygamy before receiving the alleged revelation; why he was tarred and feathered; exactly where the Temple signs and symbols came from; the extent Joseph would go to protect his power and authority, and many more \\"mysteries.\\" No active member of the Church should read this book lest their eyes be opened. It hurts! Truth is not pleasant sometimes, why should it be. I just wanted it \\"straight,\\" I didn't want to be lied to any longer. If the Church simply said, \\"we're a good church, doing good deeds, helping the poor, please give your tithes to help us, I would most certainly go. But the Church says, \\"we are the only true and living church on the face of the earth.\\" To me, that's a challenge to find out for myself, which I did. Now, I am a \\"mormon in recovery.\\" My entire belief system, every single word I've ever been taught, is a lie. I am undone.

McKay, who reprimanded her for using primary source LDS documents to write a less than favorable review of the founding prophet's life. Brodie later became a history professor at UCLA.Published in 1945, yet still a classic, her psychobiography was the first work to hint that Smith was a narcissist who used his vivid imagination to create the Mormon religion. Her book remains the best analysis of the facts giving birth to Mormonism and of the key events that took place in its founding prophet's life.Kay Burningham, Author of \\"An American Fraud: One Lawyer's Case against Mormonism.\\""},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I don't have a problem with Mormons. Unlike other proselytizers, they're polite, not condescending, and they don't ask you if you think you're saved. One also can't help but be impressed by Salt Lake City, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, their willingness to spend a year as missionaries and their elaborate social structure.However, I do have a small problem with Joseph Smith's claim that an angel told him where to find the golden plates on which the Book of Mormon was inscribed. I wanted to know what there was that tempted Smith's followers to embrace this sort of fantasy. Brodie, who was raised as a Mormon and was eventually excommunicated because of this work, does an excellent job answering that question. I thought she bent over backwards trying to be fair. Smith was born of a very poor family in Vermont and spent much of his youth in Palmyra, New York, where he became a treasure hunter, something like a \\"diviner.\\" People were willing to pay him to hunt for treasure because of the rumors about gold and sliver being buried in the Indian mounds native to the area. Smith used a stone to help him \\"see\\" where the treasure was buried. Eventually this idea morphed into the discovery of the golden plates which became the Book of Mormon. Naturally, no one else could see the plates under threat of death if they tried (Eventually he did find three men to testify they'd seen them, but it took some \\"persuading.\\" Even Smith's parents believed the plates were real, and he knew he was on to something. Here's where the fairness comes in. Brodie credits Smith with amazing talent in respect to improvisation and persuasiveness. Brodie credits Ethan Smith's VIEW OF THE HEBREWS; OR THE TEN TRIBES OF ISRAEL IN AMERICA as an \\"inspiration,\\" for the Book of Mormon, but she also shows him dictating it to his secretaries, so, either he had an amazing memory or he wasn't faking. She also dispels some of exposes regarding Mormonism, namely The Spaulding-Rigdon Theory.Once Smith accumulated a wide following he moved his flock to Kirkland, Ohio, where he built his first temple. This was also where he received his first \\"revelation\\" regarding polygamy. Apparently the more wives you had, the more credit you received in heaven. His wife, Emma, however, was not convinced. She caught him with the poetess Eliza Roxey Snow, one of his first plural wives, and \\"flung her down the stairs and drove her out into the street.\\"In some respects Smith was his own worst enemy. He antagonized the Missouri settlers, where some of his followers set up Zion, by forming a militia, and he took to calling himself Lieutenant General Joseph Smith. Smith was also unable to control a number of apostates who turned against him, publicizing the polygamy as well as some suspicious land deals.Brodie never does use the term megalomania, but there was no doubt Smith had a high opinion of himself. When the otherwise trustworthy William Law left the church and formed his own newspaper which was critical of Smith's dillydallying (This was in Nauvoo, Illinois, where Smith and his followers went after being driven out of Missouri), Smith had the press destroyed. Once again the settlers were outraged. They also weren't that fond of Smith's militia which he claimed was 100,000 strong and which he bragged would help him form a theocracy.Brodie has been accused of being one of the first psycho-biographers, but she doesn't do a whole lot of that until the Supplement, where she refers to something called \\"pseudologia fantastica.\\" From this she infers that Smith was not necessarily a fraud, but a very conflicted man. In other words, Smith had sort of a split personality. On the surface he was a supremely confidant man, \\"focused and strongly assertive,\\" underneath he was still the crude diviner who preyed on people's naivet&eacute;."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book may be considered &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; by some. I can't say that I agree with everything that was written in the book, but most of it, yes. Contrary to the belief of many LDS church members, Joseph Smith was not a 100% perfect man. He was human, this is something that sould be realized. This is what the book talks about, it is the very, very human, imperfect side of Joseph Smith. And I appreciate Ms. Brodie for having enough courage to write the book. She doesn't seem bitter at anything. I think she did excellent research, she has many quotes from Mormons and Non-Mormons in the book, journal entries etc... from the people who were alive and knew Joseph or knew about him during his time. I recommend this book to people who want to see the church from both sides of the fence."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Although published in 1946, this book remains the definitive biography of the Mormon &#34;prophet&#34; Joseph Smith, Jr. Fawn Brodie's research and detailed footnotes make this an excellent reference book. Ms. Brodie was the grand-daughter of the president of Brigham Young University and niece of the &#34;prophet&#34; David McKay. This gave her unprecidented access to Mormon documents unavailable to nonMormon writers and historians. This is a book for those interested in history. It is absolutely facinating and makes history fun to read. Sadly, Ms. Brodie,s honest exploration of the life of Joseph Smith, Jr. led to her being excommunicated from the Mormon church. However, she has preserved historical truth for future generations.

But first and foremost, Brodie was a meticulous historian who built a national academic reputation of unqualified integrity. In this early work she is no less thorough, letting the facts speak for themselves."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Written originally in 1945, this book survives the test of time in it's relevance to Joseph Smith's history.

Brodie is well-known for five other biographies, most notably for Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History.

I have been a fool. I thought I could prove whether the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was true by reading a history book and I am not even a professional historian. I have learned that real historians know that anything more than the facts is bias. The vast majority of facts are unknown by everyone on Earth. Without the facts we cannot draw solid conclusions. We must be careful because what we desire can cause us to make unfair judgments. Do you desire that Joseph Smith was a fraud? Or do you really hope that He told the truth?Apparently, the author of No Man Knows My History also wrote a biography about Thomas Jefferson. This work was largely criticized for being unprofessional. The author, seemingly ignorantly, projects her speculation into the subject of the biography, and presents as fact, intimate psychological analyses, that as a historian, she could not reasonably know. It is interesting that initially, No Man Knows My History mostly received praise from critics. I wonder if these contrary responses have anything to do with the fact that, in general, Thomas Jefferson is well respected while Joseph Smith is not?More importantly, I wish to express the pain I brought upon myself through my casual rejection of goodness, by reading this book, just so I could think of myself as more clever then everyone else. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Before I joined the church I had no self-esteem, I blamed everyone but myself for my problems particularly my mum and dad. I had given up hope of ever being in a relationship. I only cared about myself. I was addicted to dwelling on unchaste thoughts, self abuse and looking at pornography. But when I begun to receive the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ my life began to change. Through faith, I gained the power to exercise self-control. The sense of purity this virtue gave me felt much sweeter then the momentary pleasure of masturbation etc. I also began to understand how to love other people better. I started to love my mum and dad and desire to be theirs' for ever. I gained confidence and felt happier then I ever had before. I even started entertaining the idea that one day I would get married. But, unfortunately I insidiously abandoned my faith in God so that I could gratify my desire for intellectual superiority and other lusts. I read No Man Knows My History and spent many hours pontificating about ultimately insignificant facts. Meanwhile I was careless about more important things in life like being loyal, treating people with respect, developing faith in God etc. Because of my bad attitude I got hurt badly. (This is to do with non-member and anti-Mormon friends but is another story). I found myself alone and on my knees with no one to turn to except God. Miraculously, He was still willing to show me love even though I had offensively ignored Him and created problems for others.I love the church founded by Joseph Smith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There I am taught how to do good and love others. The gospel of Jesus Christ as received by Joseph Smith is very precious to me. No Man Knows My History led me to doubt Joseph Smith and my decision to join the church he started. Ultimately, these doubts were injurious to me. I pray that you will appraise your values before you choose to read this book. Instead, read a biography of Joseph Smith that is kinder to the subject e.g. Rough Stone Rolling by Richard Bushman. Avoid making the same mistakes I have.Let me quote from The Book of Proverbs 3:5 \\"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.\\" My Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, knows I am ignorant like a little child. I do not believe He would lead me to progress in righteousness by trusting Joseph Smith, as He has, if Joseph Smith really was not a prophet of God."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Is this tired old book still around? Serious scholars of the LDS faith are wasting their time on this. If you are sincere about understanding the Mormons' beliefs you would be better served to read their Book of Mormon. For those who waste their money on this book: Brodie and her ilk are laughing all the way to the bank."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book was written, using anti-Mormon documents as sources for the propoganda. Ms. Brodie was not writing this book as a true informative study of the LDS church. She was writing this as a way to spread intolerance. This book may be a convenient way for people to disprove Joseph Smith and the LDS church, but it is completely ignorant of the facts.Honestly, would you want to trust someone who started writing a book convinced that she was going to find out that the church isn't true and that Joseph Smith was a liar? Why would she even want to &quot;research&quot;? She already knew what she wanted to find, so she was basically wasting her time.This book is definitely one to AVOID!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book clearly shows who Mr. Smith was. Mr. Smith was merely a con artist and like a good con artist he was able to convince others to follow him. Unlike, as other have point out in the reviews; he is nothing close to a profit or a preacher. Yes, he was human, but he chose to manipulate others in his \\"quest\\" to be perfect. The fact that he was human clearly says that he was never perfect and now that he has died shows that he will never be perfect in any stretch of the imagination. I have read book upon books about the Mormon cult (both for and against) and this is not a book that I would recommend to someone. I would especially not recommend this book to someone who would like to be apart of the cult as it is more one sided. A great book to read would be The Kingdom of the Cults By Walter Martin. Not only does this book tell the complete store of Smith but it also tells the changing history of the Mormons."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I find it amazing that so many praise atheist Fawn M. Brodie's anti-Mormon screed and assume that it is well-researched and well-documented. A reader (not even an historian) cannot know how well-researched and documented a book is without, first, doing his/her own research and carefully checking the documentation. Brodie picked and chose her sources, which means that her book was highly slanted. In 1946, BYU professor, Hugh Nibley, briefly critiqued Brodie in a booklet, \\"No, Ma'am, That's Not History.\\" He wrote, \\"Brodie begins her study with the observation that though there is no lack of documents for the history of Joseph Smith, these documents are 'fiercely contradictory.' In that case, it is necessary for a writer to pick and choose his evidence. Now, by the simple process of picking and choosing one's evidence, one may prove absolutely anything. For which reason it is important to ask what principle Mrs. Brodie follows in making her choice. This is not hard to discover. [She] first makes up her mind about Joseph Smith and then proceeds to accept any and all evidence, from whatever source, that supports her theory. The uncritical acceptance of evidence from all sources gives her work at first glance an air of great impartiality. At the same time, she rejects any and all evidence, from whatever source, that refutes her settled ideas.\\"In other words, the lady was 'out to get' Joseph Smith. Nibley's critique is very brief, not the book-long review that Brodie's book deserved. Years later, Nibley provided this update referring to his original pamphlet:\\"When the writer [referring to himself] first read Mrs. Brodie's book 13 years ago he was struck by the brazen inconsistencies that swarm in its pages, and so wrote this hasty review. At that time he had no means of knowing that inconsistency was the least of the author's vices, and assumed with other reviewers that when she cited a work in her footnotes, she had actually read it, that when she quoted she was quoting correctly, and that she was familiar with the works in her bibliography. Only when other investigations led the reviewer to the same sources in ensuing years did the extent of Mrs. Brodie's irresponsibility become apparent. While a large book could (and probably should) be devoted to this remarkable monument of biographical mendacity . . . more than a decade of research abetted by correspondence with Mrs. Brodie's defenders has failed to discredit a single observation made in our 1946 review. . . .\\"Most readers probably won't realize that Fawn M. Brodie's book, published in 1945, is very much outdated. The more recent book, \\"Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling,\\" written by historian Richard L. Bushman and published in 2005, is vastly superior to hers, both in research and comprehensiveness, and uses the scholarship accrued since her publication. Bushman's book is available on Amazon.com.Actually, Brodie's book didn't need but one page. All she needed to write was that she was an avowed atheist and therefore Joseph Smith could not possibly have been a prophet of God, because there is no God. Therefore he was a fraud - an impostor. Her atheist glasses colored every page of her book.It is unfortunate that she didn't take the time to write a book about Moses who also claimed to have talked with God, and Jesus who claimed to be the Son of God. She could have exposed them, both, proving them to be charlatans and frauds by reading their minds.On the positive side, Brodie was an interesting writer with truly excellent writing skills."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"For a more accurate and more complete biography about Joseph Smith, I recommend Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling by Richard Bushman.

I hope when people want to find out something about Joseph Smith that they don't look at this blasphemous book. It is put across as an objective book but page after page and chapter after chapter Joseph Smith is made to look like a charlatan in every sense of the word. He's blasted for everything and it sounds like a very embittered person such as this woman who wrote this sorry excuse for a biography on the Mormon Prophet. Don't waste your time because there are other sources out there that one can find something about Joseph Smith that is more fair. If this was meant as an agenda to discredit the Prophet and the Church then the word objective shouldn't even be used. I tell you what if you want to get a bad view of Joseph Smith and the LDS Church then go ahead and read this piece of trash. I have been a member of the Church all my life and I have never heard of such a heartless, unforgiving portrayal of the Prophet than I have heard in this book. Watch the excellent documentary &quot;American Prophet&quot; or read Truman G. Madsen's book on the life of Joseph Smith. Sure Joseph Smith had faults but I know for a fact that he did not make up the Book of Mormon and that it was divinely inspired of God. He was a simple farm boy who had a fantastic experience. He was not a mythmaker and no fake but probably one of the most fascinating individuals ever to grace History. He was faithful to one woman and that was Emma Hale.

Hence the Book of Mormon may have been a cult classic that became so big people believed it to be true.This is not entirely unplausable seeing that Poe was able to manufacture a ballon travel hoax at the same time that the general public believed to be true. This is not to mention Orson Welles \\"War of the Worlds\\" hoax which so many people initially believed it was a scandal.Brodie has written a classic and it was written 50 years ago.i particularly liked the picture of the Canopic Jars used by the Egyptians for storing mummified organs.According to Smith's telepathic interpretation these jars are representations of biblical beings.No mention of organs.Caught red-handed in a speculation presented as a pronounced truth.And this is just a surface observation,Brodie goes alot deeper and even more probing..Then every other page as the book progresses later on someone is being denounced who 3 pages earlier was proclaimed a saint.(How can this be)?The big draw for Smiths followers as i see it from reading this book was free land and a fresh start in the American west for working paupers of old Europe and the new world.Security and family first. Theology? well maybe later.By the way I was turned on to this book by an Amazon reader!I read the new Bushman book but it was too sanitized and when there are only a limited number of primary sources available any omissions can present a completely different portrait in a biography.Then instead of reading a bio,you get a source book,and that's a bottomless pit.If you can only read one book on Smith,read this because it is a genuine attempt to portray the whole Smith family from people who lived with them.There are some good pictures of Joe's kids by his multiple wives and on some of them,the baby face of Smith is so obvious that a DNA test would be superfluous.I would like to see more info in a biography about Smith regarding the Great Awakening period in American History(1830's),apparently religious fervency was heightened by an expectancy of the \\"final times\\".Stump speakers and prophets were a dime a dozen,rising and disappearing equally as fast just like the 1980's in the USA.I get the feeling it must have been amusing hearing those preachers barking their condemnations with the animation of a circus carney.Smith was THE MASTER,pulling off his own Greatest Show on Earth,complete with a book and an organization, still intact when he was assasinated.After reading Brodie you would have to conclude that Smith was either a prophet or a sophisticated,calculating,charlottan,who may have slighty miscalculated in regard to himself, but he couldn't be both.But Brodie never answers the why of Smith's subterfugic polygamy.The most simplest answer:so the others don't find out-at least until they're already captured.The true caliph's collection --how ego flattering."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie is very fair to Joseph Smith and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It's a real and amazing look on how Smith became the prophet and seer of his own church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is the very first book to take a detailed look at the life of Joseph Smith. It is ground breaking and it revolutionized the way Mormons study their history. Unfortunately it is a deeply flawed work and there are now many far better works. Instead, I would recommend the book \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" by Richard Lyman Bushman which has been described by numerous (non-Mormon) critics as the best or the definitive biography of Joseph Smith.Meanwhile, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has flaws in the following specific areas:1. Sources and Research2. Methodology3. ObjectivityI will discuss each one of these problems, but only in summary fashion, since most people do not want to read a big long report here on line.RESEARCH AND SOURCE CRITIQUESThere is no doubt that Fawn Brodie wrote a detailed blockbuster of a book. She researched very hard and because her uncle was a leader of the LDS Church she was given access to very private records. It was the first book about Joseph Smith to be so carefully researched. The depth of the footnotes makes the book large and impressive. Unfortunately not all of this research is honest.Almost immediately after the book was published, a brief response to it was also published. Hugh Nibley, a famous Mormon apologist wrote it and in that critique he gave many instances where her research was simply not as it appeared. She intentionally misquoted her sources and ignored statements from sources that did not agree with her theories but then used those same sources when they did agree. And of the book's popularity he said, \\"Having been presented to the world as a work of literature Mrs. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith enjoyed with its reviewers the license of creative writing (which it was) and an indulgence that would never have been accorded it had those reviewers been historians and not literary men.\\" (You can read his full critique at http[...]) He meant, of course, that the reviewers who praised the book did not have a grasp of the true history or historical methods; they enjoyed its writing style, which Nibley admitted was good.Another problem with her sources is that although she had access to a wide variety of sources, she relied most heavily upon sources that were enemies of Joseph Smith. While no historian should reasonably disregard an enemy's perspectives, they should not give them undue credit. To paraphrase Art Linkletter \\"Enemies wills say the darndest things!\\". One of those few historians that Nibley said should review the book was Vardis Fisher. Even Dale Morgan, Brody's good friend and virtual co-author agreed that Vardis was one of the three most competent men to discuss Mormon History (Dale being one of the other two). But when Vardis reviewed the book he found it flawed because it relied almost exclusively on the statements of apostates and enemies. (Vardis' review greatly distressed Brodie at the time).METHODOLOGY CRITIQUESIn the 20th century a new process for conducting history was developed that goes by the name of psychohistory or psychobiography. This is a process that is supposed to use psychological insights to understand the motives of historical figures. I am not sure that it is possible to read the minds and motives of living people around us, much less people who are dead, so I have some problems with this whole notion anyway. But even if you accept this concept as valid, Brodie has problems. She was only in her 20's when she wrote this book; hardly an age with great and deep experiences from which to inform a \\"psychological\\" imagining of what Joseph Smith was thinking. This shows in her writing, where, not finding enough to work with in psychological speculation, she just removes the psychology and goes right into shear speculation and fantasy with theoretical ideas. But this is where her writing skill combined with selective sources helps move the book along. She simply *asserts* things as true that cannot be known or worse... are known to be untrue! So she just out and out says things like this without any substantiation at all:o Dream images came easy to this youth (She states but has no knowledge)o He was immune to religious influence of any sort (She imagines, but contradicts herself later)o He did not have the inner turmoil that preceded the spiritual fervor of so many great religious figures of the past. (She reads the minds of both Joseph Smith and other unnamed Religious leaders here)o The Book of Mormon must have been a source of secret worry (Yet he never indicated it was)o He knew that (Emma) thought him a coward. (How on earth did he know that - it probably was not true -- and how does Brodie know?)o Mormon ritual doubtless had its roots in the same unconscious drives that led the prophet to polygamy, (note the word \\"doubtless\\". She affirms something but it is absolutely unsupported.)She also writes her history by insinuations that are her way of letting her imagined events get told. For example, tells a story of an attempt by Joseph Smith to walk on the water. She admits the story is not true and was never told by any Mormon or Joseph Smith but still, though it is false, she says \\"Baseless though this story may be, it is none the less symbolic\\" The reader is told that though no justification exists for believing the story, Joseph Smith must always have been doing silly things like that, and that makes it \\"symbolic.\\" She does that sort of thing a great deal, often quoting stories that even she admits are false or untrustworthy but then using them to draw conclusions. In another example she quotes a bitter enemy of Joseph Smith, and draws conclusions from those statements about Joseph Smith's character, but she admits that her source is an \\"unreliable witness to say the least\\". It is perhaps reasonable at this point to mention that Brodie herself said that she \\"always wanted to write a book of fiction\\" and \\"More and more I am coming to realize that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one.... To bring to life the mans inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex nature, requires I think the novelists perception rather than the historian's digging.\\"When she wrote her biography of Joseph Smith, she was plowing relatively virgin territory. Not even very many Mormons were familiar with that history, so if she said something, it was taken as truth. But with her book on Thomas Jefferson, she ventured forth into territory where hundreds of recognized scholars already knew a great deal. And her technique of psychobiography was roundly criticized:Michael Kammen who was actually a friend said that she was: \\"a historical gossip incapable of distinguishing between cause and effect.\\"T. Harry Williams said that Fawn Brodie had \\"badly set back the calling of psychobiography.\\"The most biting and accurate critique was from Gary Wills: \\"Two vast things, each wondrous in itself, combine to make this book a prodigy --- the author's industry, and her ignorance. One can only be so intricately wrong by deep study and long effort, enough to make Ms. Brodie the fasting hermit and very saint of ignorance. The result has an eerie perfection, as if all the world's greatest builders had agreed to rear, with infinite skill, the world's ugliest building.\\"OBJECTIVITY CRITIQUESPsychobiography requires a degree of objectivity. But Fawn Brodie admitted many times that she was far from objective. Her writing of this book was not the work of the ordinary historian, writing about an historical figure. It was instead an act of rebellion (she called it liberating) on her part. She admitted that she wrote the book looking for ways to prove that Joseph Smith was a bad person and to destroy the beliefs of the Mormons. Here are some quotes:\\"Writing the biography of Joseph Smith was a *desperate effort* to come to terms with my childhood.\\" (emphasis is mine)\\"I was convinced before I ever began writing the book that Joseph Smith was not a true prophet.\\"\\"I was angered at the obvious nature of the fraud in his writing of the Book of Mormon; I felt that the revelations all came out of the needs of the moment and had nothing to do with God. \\"\\"Just as the autobiographical novel serves many other writers, (writing the biography) has been a kind of catharsis (for me).\\"\\"I am trying to make a move against (the Church)\\" (said about an earlier effort before the book was written).She said that Joseph Smith \\"Did not deserve\\" his good reputation. Later, when writing another biography of a person who had been badly treated by history, she made an overt attempt to historically rehabilitate him (another obvious example of her bias leading her history) and she said that she was doing \\"a total about face\\" vs what she had done to Joseph Smith.Thus we see that Fawn Brodie created a work with a goal. That goal was to be as negative about her subject as she could be. And so she selectively uses sources. And she allowed her imagination to run away with her and then called this research. An historian does not have to believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but a good historian will suspend personal beliefs and work for accuracy. Fawn failed to do that. It was too emotional for her.SUMMARYIt is a deeply flawed book, but it has been extraordinarily valuable. Brodie's efforts caused a great many Mormons to re-examine the history of their Church and Faith. This has led to greater openness and honesty and a greater level of true and accurate research in the origins of their beliefs. Even though Brodie;s work is flawed, it had a good influence. Because it is so flawed as a history it would get zero stars. But because it is influential and it is a fairly good read, it gets 3 stars.Incidentally, to understand at least some of the root causes for Brodie's slanted view of Joseph Smith, the following incident may be helpful.M Wilford Poulson, a psychology professor at BYU had studied the secret coded writings of J.J. Strang, a rather unusual character, He was a renegade Mormon who who crowned himself King of Beaver Island in Michigan and was shot and killed by his followers. Fawn Brodie knew Poulson well and was interested in his research. From this research Brodie read about Strangs dictatorial and licentious ways. At this time, Brodie applied Strang's attitudes to Joseph Smith. So, in some ways, the biography of Joseph Smith is a conflation of the historical Joseph Smith and the imagined Shadow of JJ Strang cast upon Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am only 70% through reading this book and I would like to say that I already learned a lot of details about the background in which the Mormon religion was invented and modified over the years by Joseph Smith.

He also loved life. He loved women. He was not a conventional prophet.Brody's book will take you through all this. I believe the journey was as long for her as for Smith. Read the Epilogue.

No, the author does not &quot;slam&quot; Joseph, as many Mormons who review this book seem to imply. Sometimes she tries to explain how she thinks Joesph may have been thinking, and/or his motives for certain things he says or does. This is quite helpful, because she is very well-aquainted with his life, being able to use her knowledge to help us understand him. I enjoyed this book quite well. Only thing I don't like is the &quot;older&quot; style of writing, but the book was written in the 1940's, so what do you expect? Great reading!-Bill Smith"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The first line of Brodie's 1945 biography of Joseph Smith (1805-1844) alludes to the New England in which the prophet was born in 1805. Raised in Vermont to dirt poor farmers he and the family moved to Palmyra New York. His poor schoolteacher father and mother were odd. They enjoyed hunting for buried treasure! From an early age Joseph enjoyed dreaming and fantasizing schemes regarding the finding of treasure and empire.It was in Palmyra that Joseph Smith claimed the angel Moroni appeared to him bearing huge golden plates covered in Egyptian script. The revelation he received was published as the Book of Mormon in 1830.Brodie who was raised in an LSD home but later renounced the religion claims that Smith actually wrote the Book of Mormon. He used Masonic and mystery religion cultic language mixed in with huge portions of the Bible. The book claims that Jesus Christ came to America; the North American Indians are descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel and the Nephites lost to the Laminites in an apocalyptic battle on the North American continent. The Book of Mormon became a bestseller with thousands of converts to Mormonism in the United States and abroad.Smith was always involved in numerous law suits dealing with everything from bank fraud, polygamous charges, disorderly conduct and treason to the state.Smith married many wives (Brodie says we don't know the exact number but he probably had over 50 spouses). He was interested in land speculation, banking and military affairs. In 1844 he ran for President of the United States. Smith died as a mob shot him down in Carthage, Illinois along with his brother Hyrum in June 1844. The Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy in 1890 in an effort to qualify for U.S. statehood and keep peace with the faith's many vocal and hostile critics.Charlatan or great religion leader? He was probably a mixture of both elements. Smith had a massive ego, brooked no opposition and was an authority figure to thousands of early Mormons. He fought with factions within his church as well as state and local officials. He was anti-black but held the American Indians in high regard. Smith could be friendly, jovial and forgiving but he could also be harsh, judgmental, jealous and bellicose. He was poorly educated but made schooling an important belief in the Mormon faith lexicon. Smith and his followers enjoyed secret and elaborate rituals in their various temples.Whatever your beliefs might be this will nevertheless be a book of interest to anyone seeking to know more about the Mormons, Smith, nineteenth century American history and religious persecution.Smith's dream of an empire in Kirtland Ohio and Nauvoo Illinois failed but his successor Brigham Young led the Mormons on a trek to a glorious future in Salt Lake City Utah. Joseph Smith was an American original who is deserving of study and reflection."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn Brodie is one of my heroes. Daring, smart, and relatively neutral, Brodie unveiled the true story of the origins of Mormonism through the life of its original prophet, Joseph Smith. When I first read No Man Knows My History, it launched me toward change I could never have imagined. Now that my life is changed, and with the eyes of a writer, a re-read of this material gives me new appreciation and respect for Fawn Brodie's genius and courage. Joseph Smith was just a man, not a prophet. He was a remarkable man, however, and the timing of his life and death sparked the fastest-growing world religion ever known. Fawn Brodie captured it perfectly."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"As an ex-mormon I feel this book has many claims that are true and many that are most likely not based in fact. It is a decent account of the man. Hugh Nibley's Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass does not deal handily with the issue however as mentioned above. Dr. Nibley ignores many of the issues Ms. Brodie brings up, he only negates the few that he can (and we know there are a few misinformations).

She is a very talented writer with the ability to share historical facts and still be gripping.I sense from some LDS responses that there appears to be a level of doubt relating to the truthfulness of her text.In looking at the evidence, the foundation of the LDS church risks being likened to one built upon sand whereby, the floods will come, and the winds will blow, and will beat upon that house, and it will fall, and great will be the fall of it. Sand would represent contradiction in \\"scripture\\" and historical cover up of events, practices and documentation.Truth will be the ultimate test for Joseph's work.Fawn's research appears to be in line with truth, and she was very faithful to carefully include resource information and excellent documentation. Her coverage of Joseph's multiple wives proved to be very eye opening for me. I was taught (as a Mormon) that Joseph and Emma were a law abiding, plutonic and family oriented couple, providing THE example for faithful members...I was poorly taught.\\"In Sacred Lonliness\\", by Todd Compton adds further and deeper understanding about Joseph's wives for those who are interested in the polygamy subject.Fawn's book is an interesting biography of Joseph Smith and his story.I appreciate her work, which has helped me in some ways to further understand my own history.Very informativeE.

Hoff"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This was my first (and so far, only) foray into what the LDS would label \\"Anti-Mormon\\" literature. Brodie has done some good research into the life of the founder of the LDS church.It also describes an early LDS church that was quite charismatic - certainly different from the gerontocracy that governs the church today.Although this book does specifically refer to accounts that are damning to Joseph Smith, I did not find this book to be a total character assassination of him. The book portrays a very human person in what the LDS believe to be a true prophet. I particularly find warming such accounts as Joseph caring for babies that he and Emma agreed to take care of or coming short of promising to cure an ailing infant during the many blessings he gave when the church was first established. Even Brodie's assertion that Smith was writing the Book of Mormon to try to save his family's farm provides the reader with an even-handed explanation of his character. The book of course stops short of extolling him as a great prophet who restored \\"God's kingdom on earth\\", and that's what I imagine does not sit well with the LDS faithful."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is a very well written book, which accounts for some of its considerable impact. Readers should know, however, that it was written from a profoundly naturalistic perspective. Some, of course, will love that. Others, however, will (or should) find it troubling. It's amusing, for instance, to see some of the apparent evangelical Christians below praising the book. They don't seem to realize that Mrs. Brodie's attitude toward their beliefs would have been essentially the same as her attitude toward the beliefs she herself had rejected. She was an outspoken agnostic or atheist. The other fundamental flaw of this book is its practice of psychohistory -- the same technique that she used in her approaches to Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard Burton, and, rather disastrously, to Thomas Jefferson. In the cases of Smith, Stevens, Nixon, and Burton, Mrs. Brodie was dealing with marginal, unfashionable, or even unpopular characters, who had no influential constituency to defend them. When she took on Mr. Jefferson, however, many scholars (my personal favorite is Garry Wills) came down on her like the proverbial ton of bricks. The methodological flaws that they identified in her Jefferson book were precisely those that her earlier critics had noted in her earlier books -- when nobody was willing to listen. Final verdict: Well written, worth a read, not to be trusted as the final word. Nor anything close thereunto."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's book is a MUST-READ for those interested in Mormonism. She provides information about Joseph Smith that the Mormon Church doesn't want you to know."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Have you noticed who hates this book? Why do you suppose that is? Those in the Church will naturally rail against Brodie's sources and facts--if that's possible. How do you rail against someone who cited everything she has written? Say nothing for the fact that it's a little difficult to get your hands on things written 200 years ago. However, the FACTS are (and you may not like them), but Fawn Brodie left no stone unturned. She listed everything that we have to document the life of Joseph Smith, so any unsuspecting Mormon inquirer could form his/her own conclusions. Fawn Brodie has written a wonderfully detailed book that capitvates the reader. She cites every single source, including those from the LDS church itself. Perhaps Mormons would prefer the kind of History one can find in the \\"Book of Mormon\\" or the \\"History of Mormon Church,\\" published by the LDS Church. But if you're interested in ALL the facts, not just the ones that the LDS Church wants you to know, read this book. And more importantly, if you're thinking of joining the LDS Church, I beg you, please, READ THIS BOOK first."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Ms Brodie's book is an important book to read if someone is wanting to understand mormonism and its founder Joseph Smith. Her scholarship is fair and balanced. With her access to the LDS church's archives,(her uncle was one of church's &quot;prophets&quot; ) she was given and invaluable look into that church's history .The substanciated information and details she gives in her book is something that the church prefers that its membership not know about.If someone is truly and objectively looking at the LDS church, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is one book that is a must read as they consider what the LDS church has to offer."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It's not often that a book's first few paragraphs confirm its vaunted reputation, but Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is one of those works whose greatness is obvious from the very first page. With tight, artistic prose, and the masterful use of evocative, archaic American words- gazetteer, midwives, scryers, schoolmasters- she transports us, almost as involuntarily as Joseph Smith's powers made the faithful see his visions, to a distant setting, to the beginning of our story in old New England. The cast of characters are not, however, made up of those stern Pilgrims or Revolutionary icons in powdered wigs so familiar from shorthand history, but of a different and lesser known people- those sturdy Anglo-Saxon farmers, from whom Joseph Smith descended, who cleared the western forests and, in the freedom of their isolation, discarded time-honored religious orthodoxies and made their own terms with God. Some became skeptics and rationalists. Some practiced magic, dreamed dreams and lost themselves in the delirium of ecstatic Christianity. Some, like Joseph Smith, went completely beyond the boundary walls of the imagination and birthed entirely new cosmologies on the American frontier. Surpassing all other such homegrown seers, gurus, and shamans, in the breadth, beauty, and continuing vitality of his universe, Joseph Smith is the apotheosis of the American mythmaker, in a country that practically breeds them. In Fawn Brodie's classic biography, we are treated to the authoritative study of the man whom I regard as perhaps the most fascinating character in American history. If, as some impartial scholars estimate, his church might claim over 200 million adherents by the end of the century, he may well be regarded as America's most influential figure as well.As excellent as the prose is, as previously mentioned, it is matched only by the author's research. Being the first non-LDS biography of Joseph Smith (although as an ex-Mormon, the author had a natural understanding of the more recondite LDS concepts and controversies), this book is no regurgitation or compilation of other authors' works. Mrs. Brodie blazed a trail through a mountain of diaries, letters, newspapers and public records to paint an original biographical portrait of beating, breathing vitality. Scholarly, scientific and painstakingly thorough, I can't conceive that very many details were missed. You will know the facts of Joseph Smith's life to the last available jot and tittle, and gain some understanding of his mind to the extent that it is possible to extrapolate theories from the evidence.I don't know Mrs. Brodie's religious beliefs, besides the fact that she was an ex-Mormon, but never for a moment in this biography does she give the slightest credence to Joseph Smith's supernatural experiences. That's not to say, as some online sources have, that she is necessarily \\"secular\\" or \\"atheistic.\\" Even the most credulous theist must dismiss Joseph Smith's claims after examining the weight of evidence. The contradictions and absurdities of his Scriptures and prophecies are just too overwhelmingly damning. However, it's hard to resist some speculation, psychological and historical. Was Joseph Smith a complete fraud? After all, his own friend testified that Smith admitted to him that his story about the golden plates started out as a prank on his family. Did he start to really believe his own story (as Mrs. Brodie conjectures) or was Smith fully aware that his revelation was a pure imposture from the beginning to the end?Or, to be even more provoking, is it possible that Joseph Smith actually did experience \\"something\\" on that hill in New York? Demonic influence or even possession can't be discounted, especially considering Smith's youthful necromantic experimentation. If one wishes to be completely rationalist, we can still wonder whether he might have found \\"something\\" on Cumorah Hill. Mrs. Brodie briefly muses that he could have found a bronze (I think) breastplate, as such artifacts were not unheard of in the region. What if he did find some sort of engraving? Surely not the Book of Mormon, but some tangible artifact around which he chose to weave an imaginative and profitable story, rather than submit it to the prosaic interpretations of linguists and scholars? After all, the evidence for a pre-Columbian European presence in North America, from Washington to Minnesota to New England, is too numerous and compelling to ignore. Eight witnesses testified that they had seen the golden plates, not in a state of \\"entrancement\\" as had the Three Witnesses, but in reality. Did Joseph Smith show them some Viking carving or Irish engraving? It's a fact that even though most of the witnesses broke with the Mormon church, they never denied the existence of the golden plates. On the other hand, John Bennett testified that Smith asked him to go to New York City and have golden plates secretly made so that they could be exhibited for profit. What accounted for all the visions and supernatural experiences of people close to Joseph Smith? Was the Prophet an expert on the effects of psychedelic mushrooms, as is common with shamans? Did he use them himself or surreptitiously have his friends ingest them? Or did he merely possess an unnaturally strong power of hypnotism? Or was the whole thing a moneymaking conspiracy? None of these explanations can be ruled out.One criticism I have is the author's rejection of the Spalding-Rigdon theory, which posits that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized in part from an earlier work of fiction. I agree with Mrs. Brodie that, based on the chronology, Rigdon probably had no part in it. However, I disagree that Spalding's influence should be ruled out. Let's not forget that it was the people of Conneaut, OH who approached Philastus Hurlbut with their suspicions and rather specific memories, not the other way around. Also, the discovery of the \\"Manuscript Story\\" is irrelevant; the Conneaut witnesses specified that the story they heard Spalding read was entitled \\"Manuscript Found\\" and contained many distinctive parallels with the Book of Mormon that just couldn't be a mere coincidence, such as the unique names of the protagonists Nephi and Lehi and other uncanny similarities in names and incidents. We don't know how Joseph Smith got a hold of Spalding's manuscript, but I think we can be sure that he did. It's also likely that \\"Manuscript Found\\" is lost forever, as there was probably no more than 1 existing copy of Spalding's handwritten novel, and Joseph Smith would surely have destroyed the evidence of his plagiarism.To sum up an overlong review, never mind the condemnation of religiously-motivated critics. This is a masterpiece of biography. This book is a necessary component of any education about Mormonism."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"While it was an interesting read, though to be fair quite negative of the Mormons, further research into her sources reveals that she does appear to pull some of them out of thin air. Some of the sources simply do not exist that I can find. A few are quoted accurately. Others are quoted out of context or misquoted entirely. Some are second-hand accounts from people who felt slighted or were disgruntled. Such accounts do not make for very objective research.I did read Hugh Nibley's rebuttal, and while it is somewhat polemical, it does answer ms. Brodies half-hearted effort to discredit the Mormon church, which she belonged to as a child. While some Mormon practices do seem weird, they are no less peculiar than those of any other faith, such as Islam or even Reformed Presbyterianism.What strikes me most is the virtual absence of any positive information about the Mormons founder Joseph Smith other than a token \\"he meant well.\\" Despite her access to official Mormon archives, ms. Brodie failed to bring out any original material from the single most authoritative source. The Mormons have spent tens of thousands acquiring documents, some true and some discredited forgeries, regarding their history, and have perhaps the most complete history of any church, so far as original documentation is concerned.When reviewing this book, don't simply look at the fact that she cites everything, look into those citations to ensure that they really are accurate, and that they truly exist.If you are looking to educate yourself about the Mormons, use a balanced approach. Read material from both sides, preferrably that which is written from an objective point of view. I would also recommend reading from Hugh Nibley's extensive writings (particularly \\"Tinkling Bells and Sounding Brass\\") if you are interested in Mormon theology. While it is geared for the Mormon believer, it can offer valuable insights to the Mormon church.Don't take this book at face value."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read this book because of it's notoriety. With both staunch Mormons and anti-Mormons screaming bloody murder at each other over this (as can be seen in previous reviews), I knew there was something to discover. What I found, however, was extremely disappointing.I read this book thinking it was history--it's not. That thought was quickly dispelled from the start when I read, with no small degree of wonder, just how much Brodie claims to have known from inside the mind of Joseph Smith. Where true history relates the event, Brodie touches upon it and then proceeds to tell why Smith did it, what he was feeling, and just what he hoped to accomplish by it. What's even more disturbing, she has the arrogance to present her wild speculations as facts.Whether or not you believe that Smith was a prophet, Brodie's story is too much. Does she really believe that he could have dictated the entire Book of Mormon, without stopping or revising, and in the sentence structure in which it now appears, and do it so fluently that those writing for him did not know he was just making it up as he went along? That's fine if you don't believe in the veracity of the Book of Mormon, but at least come up with a more plausible story than that one. By making this allegation, she attributes to Smith a literary talent above most any other person in history. Who else can write a 500 page book that lasts over 150 years without revision?Of course, those who see Smith as a fraud anyway will see this as a wonderful standard under which to rally. But those of us who seek real history, without the zeal of religion (or anti-religion) will be utterly disgusted by the author's blatant negligence of sources. Many quickly praise that she has \\"done her homework\\", and, upon scanning the bibliography, it appears she has. Upon closer examination, however, it is easy to see that the bibliography does little more than take up space.The majority of her allegations, as well as the inferences she draws, have no source. They are either not documented, or simply products of Brodie's imagination. When she does give a source, it is many times the testimony or work of a bitter enemy of Smith which, though such testimonies may be useful, should not compose the bulk of the work. As for her other sources (Church History, newspapers, etc.), they leave much to be desired.As I was reading, I was so shocked by some of her claims that I checked up on some of her sources. What I found was a great example of document-splicing. In many cases she manipulated her sources to an almost unrecognizable extent, often insinuating things the author clearly did not intend. Sometimes, she misquoted the source altogether. Come now, Mrs. Brodie, did you really think that noone who ever read your book was going to have access to any of your sources?In my opinion, this book was nothing more than a feeble attempt of the author's to lash back at the society by which she felt restricted. The work is so saturated with the author's bias and speculation that it can scarcely pass as non-fiction.Mormon and non-Mormon alike should avoid this book, simply because it's a horrible attempt at biography. In giving this book one star, I take none of my personal feelings on the subject into account. It simply is bad history.

Depending on which camp the reviewer is in will dictate their review of the book. Anyone who tells you they are indifferent is simply avoiding the truth. Only Mormons or anti-mormons would take the time to read this worthless book.Anti-mormons will point to Ms. Brodie's scholarly reputation. Because this book wasn't written by Ed Decker or (Dr.) Martin it somehow doesn't fall into the anti-mormon category. Rather, this now becomes pure history. Please keep in mind that just because Ms. Brodie attempts to be scholarly doesn't actually mean that she is scholarly. Putting worthless footnotes after every sentence doesn't make you a historian or a good writer. But being able to discriminate between reliable and unreliable sources does. Ms. Brodie, from a scholastic perspective, fails miserably.Some have argued that she didn't have an axe to grind or that she was still a friend to the Mormons even after publishing this book. Yeah right. I have yet to meet a Mormon who has read her book and thought that it was an unbiased review of the life of Joseph Smith. It sure sounds good to claim that Mormon's in high places have read and enjoyed your book. I just want to know who those people are.The moral of the story is simple. If you want to &quot;debunk&quot; the LDS church then go ahead and drop some change on this classic. It is full of things that aren't true, but they sure sound good. The information can prove to be very useful in writing a good anti-mormon sermon or gearing up for a crusade night.If you are a latter-day saint don't waste your money on this. It is the same old recycled garbage that has floated around about the church for almost 200 years. Rumors, stories from apostates, anecdotes by individuals who had a clear agenda to bring down the church line every page of this book. If you want a truly critical and accurate review of the life of Joseph Smith there are a hundred books better suited for your sincere quest for knowlegde.Ms. Brodie has succeeded in one thing. This book, above all else, shows just how pathetic scholarly attempts at bringing down the LDS church have been. When you have to resort to half-truths, lies, and fables, it only verifies and validates my belief. Christ always taught by truth. Those that oppose him taught with hate and inaccuracies. Christ doesn't need to support his position by making things up or by relying on people that lie at every chance they have to distort the truth. In the end the ultimate source of truth won't be found in the books written by man. In the end an answer to a prayer will lead the pure in heart to our Heavenly Father's truth."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I'd compare this book to the movie, Shakespeare in Love. It's based on a lot of facts, but she's used some creative liberties. Fawn Brodie is totally inept when it comes to real scholarship. For example, one of her sources was a group of people who had claimed to see ghosts and claimed that Joseph Smith was some sort of sorcerer... she also uses a source from a man who described Joseph Smith as short and dumb-looking and claimed Joseph Smith used phrases like \\"can't not.\\" (Joseph Smith was over 6' tall and very distinguished looking as well as extremely articulate). Both sources were proven liars, but she used both of them even though their stories completely contradicted other reliable sources that she left out! Furthermore, she ignored countless first-hand witnesses and simply took from a grab bag of contradictory testimonies, even though yellow journalism and discrimination were rampant. Her novel is entertaining, but that's partly because of her amazing mind-reading of those who died 150 years ago and her intuition about what people REALLY meant when they spoke. Fawn Brodie is a nerd and is obviously an atheist/agnostic. She's not even a scholar... she could probably write fiction or work for Enquirer magazine. If one wanted to buy this, one might check the ridiculous book she wrote about Thomas Jefferson... critics spotted that one as a sham immediately... the exact same scholarly follies are practiced in this novel as well. She's a rotten scholar, but her writing is interesting in a Jerry Springer sort of way. Don't get me wrong, she takes a lot of facts and things that people ACTUALLY said. However, Joseph Smith was the target of so many contradictory reports, you can make up just about any theory and simply pick and choose sources at your leasure. At least she put something coherrant together, which is almost a mircale. That's the only reason this book is highly regarded. She was apparently the first to figure out that as long as you had a theory about him, you could put a coherrant book together using evidence... however, the evidence could support about ANY theory, strangely enough. Joseph Smith is still a mystery to historians and will continue to remain so, unless they are believers. If one were to follow the trail, like the skeptical Martin Harris mortgaging his property right after showing Professor Charles Anthon the Book of Mormon, or actually including the testimonies of those closest to Joseph Smith (all of which were believers), one would be writing like a historian. If your book about Joseph SMith is believable to atheists, you didn't utilize proven scholarly methods. Proven scholarly methods would be forced to go to people like David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdry and Joseph's immediate family, all of whom directly contradict Fawn's central thesis and unproven theory."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When this author somehow supplies what Joseph Smith &quot;must have been thinking&quot; and puts together a senario from that, as to why things happened instead of looking at what he and others said is the reason, then readers should take care. If you have read other non prejudiced books then you will be able to see the distortions here. If anybody REALLY wants to know facts, get The Encyclopedia of Mormonism by McMillian, it is only four volumes and was not put out by the LDS (they took a year to review it before they endorsed it!) though many LDS were asked to submit articles (only makes sense if it is about them) there is even a whole subject on Anti-LDS of over several pages which gi ves titles of Anti-LDS books and authors!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"How tiresome.

Brodie is a master at brushing by events that do not support her agena. Much more than her poor presentation of facts, I am concerned that Brodie seems to &quot;know&quot; what Smith and others were thinking when the events unfolded.

If you're happy in your religion you might just prefer to stay away from this book.For non-Mormons:If you're interested in religion, charasmatic leaders and movements, or just like biographies I think you'll find this book very interesting and readable. Joseph Smith is an interesting historical character who was able to raise up a religion with thousands of followers around him which has grown into millions of adherents today. Much of that religion still gathers strength from Smith's charisma and personality. Understanding him better can help you learn so much more about personality, religion, and psychology. It's worth your time if you have any interest.For ex-Mormons and Mormons who aren't happy in their religion:This is the group that I fit into. This book helped me to finally break away from the Mormon church. There were so many things that never made sense, but once you can better understand Joseph Smith and how he founded his religion you can better understand Mormonism today. Knowing the truth about Mormonism makes it so much easier to to leave because when it comes down to it Joseph's stories were lies and he constantly did things to better his own position in life. Joseph Smith was the first major cult leader in America and understanding that can help you get away. So I definitely recommend this book for people who are having a difficult time leaving the church or have had a difficult time staying away."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith.I was surprised to find that it wasn't.Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so the book is written from a &quot;secular&quot; perspective.However, I felt that she was simpathetic and offered some interesting insights into his life.I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not.He is a vivid individual, and Brodie reflect him as such in her writing."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I was a lifetime Mormon till I went through a divorce and decided to take a critical look at my own beliefs. Having been born in the Church, serving a full time Mission and marrying in the temple I thought I knew all about Joseph Smith and the history of Mormonism. This book changed my life more than the Book of Mormon ever could have. For the first time many missing parts of the Mormon puzzle began to fit together and my life, as I understood it came crashing down. I literally threw up as I discovered what a bastard Joseph Smith was. No, this book isn't perfect, but having been written in 1945, it has proven itself to be the definitive expose of Mormonism's founder. I bear witness it has more truth in it than you will find inside the whitewashed history of the Mormon Church. I found myself unable to return my copy to the library and chose to pay the replacement cost. It is one of my most cherished possessions."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"How I wish I had read this book 35 years ago before going on a mission.

Fawn Brodie grew up as a Mormon, and I'm sure it pained her to uncover the facts that she did in her extensive research. (She was later excommunicated from the LDS Church, which I think is the wrong thing to do. She merely wrote a historical book; did the LDS leaders truly want her to repress the facts?) In No Man Knows my History, she uncovered the real Smith, the one who wanted to be prophet/military commander/president, etc. He is not the same person many Mormons have perceived him to be.The research is sound and, while very historical (obviously, since that was Brodie's specialty), extremely readable. It kept my interest throughout the book. I think it behooves a person to be very critical when it comes to following any leader. If the leader is from God, I think this will prove itself. If he is not, then common sense says to leave and search after what is real truth. This truth is only found in the God of the Bible, not the God that Joseph Smith said was &quot;once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned on yonder heavens.&quot; I think Brodie has gotten many followers of Joseph Smith to rethink their faith, and I am glad it is so very popular today."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn McKay Brodie, trained historian and wordsmith, was raised in the LDS (Mormon) church. During her scholarly study of Joseph Smith's early writings and those of his contemporaries, she was given special access to historical archives of the LDS church - probably due to her relation to LDS general authority David O. McKay. The resulting history, with its rich and enjoyable literary style, easily qualifies as the first truly full biography of Joseph Smith, Jr. Mrs. Brodie gives credit where credit is due: &quot;The Prophet&quot; is credited with an aversion to violence, a genuine love for people (especially tender affection for children), manful behavior during his lengthy Liberty Jail incarceration, the power to win over even many of his enemies once personally introduced, and a powerful, driving imagination and energy. Proper criticisms are levelled against his lack of financial acumen, his inclination to see apparently fictional &quot;historical evidences&quot; in the things around him, his likely inability to constructively examine himself, and his extra-marital dalliances which more likely served as the cause of &quot;plural marriage&quot; rather than the effect of it. Her pointed examination of the Book of Abraham appears to have been vindicated in later years. (I have the 1954 edition.) And so on. While not a perfect work (is any writing of man or woman?), its strengths are sufficient to make it a must-have, must-read for anyone interested in Mormon studies."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mormonism is said to be one of the fastest growing religions in the world, and No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith provides a fascinating and detail look into the life of Mormonism's founder. Detailed alongside, is the formation and growth of the early church and its key players.Mormonism is the only major religion to have its early, formative days chronicled by local newspapers, government and court records. Virtually every movement of the church and its principals--both controversial--were not only chronichled widely but histrionically editorialized about.The author, Fawn Brodie, maintains the hard-to-balance line of even reporting for such a controversial subject. The early church leaders could have been labeled either opportunistic whackos or divinely-inspired men of God. She does neither.Mormonism is quite popular and very widespread in the American West, and the United States has its very first Mormon presidential candidate. As a westerner, myself, I have a number of friends and acquaintances who are Mormon. After reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Do these people really know this history of their church?\\"This reading experience left me somewhat doubting the validity and veracity of all orgnized religions. Read it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"For me, a non-Mormon living in Utah for many years, this was a fascinating look into Joseph Smith's life and origins of the Mormon Church.It will never be popular with the Mormon faithful (see the many 1 star reviews here) because it is simply an honest account of Smith and his new church. And that honesty exposes Smith as a charlatan. The book is scholarly and well-documented, though Mormons have put a great deal of effort into making it seem otherwise."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I've consummed a library of books on Mormon studies, and had held off on reading &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; because I had already read a considerable quantity of biographical material on Joseph Smith. I capitulated at last only because it is among the most well known books on early Mormon history. I am so glad I did. No book could have pulled it all together and made sense of it all as well as Fawn Brodie's book. It is as valuable today as it was when it was first written over half a century ago. None of the objective scholarship of recent years contradicts her conclusions, but rather validates her, page after page after page. Her insight is piercing, her style is almost poetic, and her message is powerful.It is not any easy book for a Mormon to read, as is evidenced by some of the reactionary attacks Brodie receives in some of the reviews already written. The faithful do not want to hear that Joseph Smith was an &quot;evolutionary revolutionary,&quot; his doctrine growing with his ego and sense of personal magnificence. But this is no mean swipe at the character of Joseph Smith...if anything, you come away with a sense of awe at the creative genius, the charismatic giant that he must have been. If he brought scorn and violence upon himself and his people, it was a measure of the power he produced and the fear that he struck in lesser men with whom he shared his time and space. Nevertheless, Brodie's exploration of the world of Joseph Smith and the context within which his doctrine evolved is brilliant. She is adept at recognizing the role that projection has played throughout his career, beginning with the Book of Mormon, and continuing on through all of his other writings, including the History of the Church. Ms. Brodie says it best herself in the opening lines of Chapter 19: &quot;A man's memory is bound to be a distortion of his past in accordance with his present interests, and the most faithful autobiography is likely to mirror less what a man was than what he has become.&quot; Or as is so often the case, &quot;less what a man was than what he wished he had become.&quot; To one who has studied the role of paradigms in shaping the way we interpret our world, Brodie's book makes the most beautiful sense. To one who's faith is at stake, however, her book may serve to threaten the idylic, heroic legend of Joseph Smith that has been carefully nurtured since his murder in 1844.This is among the finest pieces of historical literature I have had the priveledge of reading. Her scholarship and writing and fearless approach to tackle controversial issues with objectivity and sensitivity is matched only by Juanita Brooks in the realm of Mormon studies. This is a book not just to read, but to consume."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"After hearing about the \\"controversial\\" nature of this book amongst my peers and how \\"horribly\\" written it was I decided I would read it for myself.Needless to say I was enthralled from the very beginning of the book. I found the book and the subject matter fascinating. I had expected the book to have a clear bias, but I felt Brodie presented the information very fairly and in a suprisingly unbiased way... oftentimes giving both perspectives and the information where both sides claims come from (i.e. she'll present people's claims that Joseph Smith was a moneydigger and occultist, and than show the court documents where he was on trial for doing so, and than she would show the other side's argument.).In fact the only part of the book that I felt had a truly negative biased tone was the \\"afterword\\" that was added several years after the author's excommunication.In the end though, I would have to say that the part I enjoyed most about the book was that it not only gave a detailed account of Joseph Smith, but of other church history figures such as Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, John D. Lee, etc. I felt like a picture of what life was like back then was painted.Granted true blue Mormons will be offended when reading this book because they haven't heard anything but the filtered down version, AND they will gnash their teeth and bash on Fawn Brodie... BUT give her a break! It was the first biography of its kind and it was written in the 40's for heaven sakes. All the teeth gnashing looks ridiculous as if you're trying too hard to prove your obedience and faith.A good product will sell itself, and this book has sold suprisingly well despite being restricted to a small fraction of the world who actually knows what a \\"mormon\\" or who \\"Joseph Smith\\" was. I enjoyed the book very much, thank you Fawn Brodie."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I will spare the reader of this review another exhaustive summary of the book contents, since the contents are well-documented and reviewed by innumerable other reviewers (the book was initially published in 1945). At any rate, I found the book well-written, the material neatly couched &amp; contextualized into the era it occurred, and a conscientous effort given to both 'official' mormon history and 'unofficial' mormon history. In spite of one's religious beliefs, this book ought to be required reading for both the scholar of mormon history and the devout mormon churchgoer. Ultimately, this book should serve as a springboard for further investigation and research by BOTH earnest mormon scholars and pious mormons alike."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"As a Mormon, I expected to find myself offended by this book, but it simply wasn't the case. Granted, Brodie approaches Smith with the assumption that he was not a real prophet...but once you understand that, her true facination and, yes, admiration for the man comes through.On the downside, she does try to psychoanalyze Smith using 20th century standards, and loses much of her credibility in the process. On the other hand, though, I've never read a more riveting account of the Missouri period. This book gives a flavor for what a truly remarkable man Smith was...whether one believed his claims or not.My advice to Mormons is: Read this book if you truly have an open mind and can appreciate a non-believer's point of view. To non-Mormomns I'd say: Remember, this book doesn't tell the whole story.All authors on Mormon history approach the subject matter from preconceived notions of belief or unelief, and that orientation clouds whatever comes after. Contrary to other reviewers, my feeling is that a book of this kind will never help someone to understand whether a religion is genuine or not. Those decisions come from other places in one's mind...and heart."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Like Ben Franklin, Kit Carson, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, Joseph Smith was incandescent in a uniquely American way. The church he founded is America's most successful home grown religion. A century and a half after Smith's murder by an Illinois mob, the Mormon Church flourishes, with over 12 million members worldwide. You don't have to believe he was divinely inspired - and Fawn Brodie clearly doesn't - to be impressed by his vision, energy, resilience, entrepreneurial skill and improvisational brilliance. Smith was undoubtedly a religious \\"genius\\" - William James' term for charismatic founders of new religious movements. This superb biography gives us the life in all its tumult and glory while skillfully refuting the larger than life myths it spawned.As Brodie shows, even as a semi-literate farm boy in upstate New York, Smith was a magnet for the social and theological currents whirling through 1820s America. His Book of Mormon, a mythic tale of warring tribes in the primordial American wilderness, drew upon magic, folklore, superstition, Masonic ritual, the old and new testaments of the Christian bible, racial prejudice against blacks and Indians, and the crude anthropology of his day. He grounded its authenticity in the Angel Moroni, who allegedly led him to the golden plates on which the book was inscribed in ancient hieroglyphics. He, Joseph, claimed only to be the messenger.Brodie has less interest in the mysteries of divine revelation than she does in the mysteries of human charisma. Smith's powerful voice, penetrating gaze and bluff, good-natured personality drew men and women from all walks of life into his orbit. His followers loved the man, according to Brodie, and saw in him the physical embodiment of their church. He was also shrewd enough to custom fit his religion to the character of his time, making Mormonism an ingenious meld of the secular and the spiritual. To a people eager for miracles, he proclaimed several. He gave Mormonism a patina of democracy, creating governing councils and making each member accountable for the overall health of the church. He also played on the willingness of Americans to see evidence of God's favor in the size of their bank balances. In Smith's religion, there was little friction between the good life on earth and the one that comes after.As the Mormons migrated west through Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, Smith updated his theology through periodic revelations from the Almighty. His most controversial revelation had to do with the taking of multiple wives. Interestingly, it wasn't the practice of polygamy that led to Mormon persecution during Smith's lifetime. Polygamy was too explosive for even Smith to sell to his followers, so he kept this revelation a secret outside his inner circle. The persecution the sect endured in Missouri and Illinois had to do with local fears that Smith's religious army would tip the balance of political power. That the prophet and his followers were cruelly persecuted, particularly in Missouri, is beyond dispute. By being tone deaf to their neighbors' concerns and by proclaiming themselves above secular authority, they created a decent portion of the resistance they encountered.At the time of his death in 1844, Smith was in the middle of a run for President of the United States. He was presiding over his church, the town of Nauvoo, a private military army, a vast financial and real estate empire, and a secret squadron of \\"fifty of so\\" wives. As he said in a sermon to his followers, \\"I don't blame anyone for not believing in my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself.\\"His was one of the most thrilling high wire acts ever seen in America. Brodie tells the life clearly, does an outstanding job of documenting her assertions, and gives credit where it's due. While not overlooking his tendency to claim divine justification for all too human urges, she has sympathy for the struggle he waged between \\"what he really was and what he most desperately wanted to be.\\" If you believe Smith had an actual pipeline to God, you'll probably see this book as a hatchet job. If you see him as a brilliant but flawed human being, you'll appreciate this balanced, clear-eyed biography."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Whether you believe Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God, a complete charlatan, or some mixture of the two does not change the fact that he is one of the most fascinating and underrated figures in American history. His life and the religion he founded say a lot about this country.This is the most famous (or infamous) biography of Joseph Smith. At the time of its publication it was a watershed event. No one with an 'outside' perspective had been given quite the access that Historian Fawn Brodie had.So after hearing all of the praise and condemnation heaped upon this book, what do I think? Pretty good, for the most part. Mrs. Brodie is a compelling storyteller. As a narrative, it has great flow and keeps your interest. From my perspective, the book's greatest strength is placing Joseph Smith's life within the context of the world views and cosmological theories prevalent in the United States in the early 19th Century. Some of Mrs. Brodie's sources ('Mormonism Unveiled' for example) have been largely discredited, so a careful reading is required, especially when considering the quotes of the some of the more vociferous opponents of Smith.Is Joseph Smith a true religious prophet or not? You definitely get the feeling that Mrs. Brodie does not think so, but even she is amazed at Joseph Smith's life and transformations.Historical books about religious figures are bound to be controversial. My advice would be read this book, as well as other about the life of Joseph Smith. But this book, although imperfect, is still an valuable and compelling part of the history of the history of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is the second edition of Fawn M. Brodie's classic 1945 biography of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Brodie is well-known for her other highly respected biographies on Thomas Jefferson, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard F. Burton, and Thaddeus Stevens. The book is a detailed dispassionate factual narration of Joseph Smith's life and the early days of the Mormon Church until his murder by a lynch mob at age 39 in 1844.While Brodie is careful not to disparage Joseph Smith, she presents him as a human with normal inclinations and faults, and Mormons might not like to think of him in this way. In fact, the Mormon Church excommunicated her because of this book. She writes that the \\"major original premises of this biography was that Joseph Smith's assumption of the role of a religious prophet was an evolutionary process, that he began as a bucolic scryer, using the primitive techniques of the folklore of magic common to his area, most of which he discarded as he evolved into a preacher-prophet.\\"Brodie offers evidence showing that Joseph Smith began his career offering to help gullible farmers find buried fortunes on their land. He originally intended to compose a fictional novel about buried treasures but then altered it into a true account of a revelation delivered to him on golden plates in a foreign language with tools to translate them. Brodie discusses the belief that much of this Book of Mormon was plagiarized from another person's novel. Joseph Smith claimed that he had his first vision of God and Jesus, who had human forms because God was once human, in 1820 when he was fourteen. Brodie shows that this dating is \\"sheer invention... he dictated at least three different descriptions of the \`first vision' between 1831 or 1832 and 1839, and these descriptions differ strikingly in detail.\\" The revelation states that American Indians descended from Israel's \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\" who sailed to America around 600 BCE. (Actually, the ten tribes were driven out of Israel in 722 BCE.)The Book of Mormon disparages all people of color, although Indians are better than blacks. Women are also belittled. Their role both in life and in the after-life is to care for their husbands. A wife cannot enter the after-life unless her husband allows her entry.Joseph Smith called his new religion Mormon saying that the word is Egyptian and means \\"good.\\" But he didn't know Egyptian. Brodie describes a trick pulled on him where he was told that a document apparently contained Egyptian writing, and he was asked to translate it. Smith didn't know that the person was an Egyptian scholar and gave a totally wrong imaginative translation. He later called his church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Shortly before his murder, Smith and some of his saints began to practice polygamy, while publically insisting that the practice was wrong. Brodie names and describes over forty women that he married. Over a dozen were married to other men and their husbands apparently knew nothing of the liaisons. These included five pairs of sisters and one mother and daughter. Some women whom he approached turned him down. His wife was opposed to polygamy and claimed that he never engaged in it. She married a non-Mormon after his death.Smith was charismatic and able to draw thousands of people to his new religion. Because of repeated vicious persecutions, he had to lead his saints to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. He was imprisoned for treason when the lynch mob stormed his jail cell and murdered him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A nice fluffy series of reviews, but it's time to honor Ms. Brodie's excellent work and call a spade a spade. Joseph Smith was certainly a remarkable human being, but as anyone with a clear objective mind can see, he was a charlatan of the highest order. He made up a religion from whole cloth, or rather, from a patchwork quilt of what he had at hand. His \\"scriptures\\" had a resonance in his day, but his writings and his church derive from brazen and bold lies and fantasies, plain and simple.The Mormon church now consists of some millions who deeply believe that Joe Smith was a \\"prophet of God\\". They are convinced that the hilarious mish-mash of biblical, masonic, and early 19th century historical and world views that make up the sacred doctrines and rituals of their Church are a sufficient explanation for the wonder of life and human existence on this planet and in this universe.Don't misunderstand me, Smith's Church is no worse than any organized religion. But in this case (not unlike Scientology), too much has been documented for a rational mind not to expose it. Moreover, the well documented beginning, expansion, and solidification of Smith's church into the Fortune 400 economic powerhouse that it is today (faithful member must pay 10% of their pre-tax income)is extremely illuminating as to how all \\"great\\" religions get established."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I have an original copy of this book because my grandfather purchased one in 1945 in Salt Lake City, Utah. My grandfather told the family that in 1945 when the book was first published it appeared with great fanfare at the LDS book store, Deseret Book, in Salt Lake, which is still in existence.It was heavily advertised as a great work and a must read due to the fact that it was written by an LDS scholar, was well researched and of course was written by one of their own. Those in charge of the book store at the time apparently trusted that the book would be a great and positive write and did not review the contents of the book. It only took a very short time for the reports to flood into the book store concerning its contents, and just as quickly the book was removed from that particular book store.My grandfather, having left the LDS faith as did the rest of his once converted family, had to have a copy and bought it immediately from one of the many other non-LDS book sellers that quickly picked it up to sell. Another book purchased by my grandfather, Lights and Shadows of Mormonism, which is an interesting read, but is more of a one person perspective of life in early LDS Utah. Both books are fascinating reads for anyone wanting to research further information involved in the early LDS Church and early Utah in general."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The best things about Brodie's work:1)She is accurate. Even though it's been decades since this book has been out, it is still a widely-read text. She is a competent historian, which is a must if you want to learn about things as they reflect reality.2)She is readable. You can actually -enjoy- reading this one! It makes things much easier when a historian can write well, and Brodie does.3)She has a fascinating subject. Joseph Smith is one interesting fellow, as evidenced by the successful church that has sprung up in Utah. For some orthodox Mormons, reading this may even be quite adventuresome, as they learn about Smith from another perspective! I think everyone can read this and be intrigued by a complex person.If I have any complaint, it's that Brodie tries to psychoanalyze Smith too much. Obviously every biography is going to involve some speculation - unless you can actually interview the person yourself - but I thought she went too far at times in assuming she knew &quot;why&quot; Smith did certain things.Overall I highly recommend the book and I think it is still after all these years the best biography on Smith you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I was a Mormon for 30 years so I feel I know what I'mtalking about.Groundbreaking book about the life of Joseph Smith.Traces his life both inside and outside of the church hefounded.

I dont believe I have ever read a more thoroughly footnoted biography.

Wixom says Brodie is an eloquent novelist, a bankrupt historian. Wixom gives many examples. Even Brodie admitted in her 1945 \\"expose\\" that if she speculated in her work that it had condescended to fiction. Yet, she has these statements in her supposed work of historicity: \\"He [Joseph Smith] knew that she thought him a coward.\\" No footnote. So, Brodie knew that Emma knew that Joseph knew what Emma was thinking.Or we have this: \\"Joseph stood proudly before his men betraying nothing of the tumult and anxiety raging within him.\\" And \\"Nancy [Rigdon] threatened to scream.\\" Threatened? Even if Brodie was there, which she wasn't, how does Brodie know Nancy threatened?Brodie might have gotten away with saying, \\"it might have been,\\" or \\"considering the results\\"...but Brodie knows much more than she could know 150 years after the fact. She may have done considerable resource on Mormondom's prophet Joseph Smith but has few sources for her conclusions. In fact, Wixom found that one of Brodie's \\"documented\\" sources attributed to a St. Louis newspaper didn't even in existence in the year given by Brodie.Prof. Hugh Nibley very ably dissected Brodie's \\"No Man\\" with \\"No, Ma'm That's Not History.\\" But His pamphlet was lamented by some historian in that it was too brief; it did not go into detail. Lou MIdgely of BYU's FARMS did go into great detail investigating Brodie's troubled life and marriage, as well as her highly controversial biography of Thomas Jefferson. Midgely noted that the same criticisms leveled at the Jefferson work (speculation and unfounded conclusions) could be aimed at the biography of Joseph Smith. These were, indeed, darts in Brodie's balloon.But Wixom's major contributions as a former investigative reporter for several daily newspapers and post-graduate work in history at two universities , was this: he cited the many eastern newspapers and magazines (including TIME) which acclaimed Brodie's \\"objectivity.\\" Wixom's master's thesis was on the topic of objectivity as it was expounded by such creditable entities as the Associated Press. \\"Tell both sides; keep your own opinions out of it; use reliable sources; avoid unfounded speculation.\\" Under these guidelines, Wixom labels Brodie's \\"objectivity\\" as selective, a disservice to credible historicity.As Wixom points out, Fawn Brodie took the position from the beginning that she was going to expose Joseph Smith. As the niece of LDS Church president David O. McKay, she showed bravado in going against her family; but what did it avail her if she could not prove her point?Even anti-Mormon author Vardis Fisher lamented that Brodie relied mostly on blatant enemies of the LDS Church. Her work was one-sided. Bernard De Voto praised Brodie for \\"avoiding the supernatural.\\" That would also toss the Bible in the trash can. But how does DeVoto explain the accomplishments of Joseph Smith if he did it all by himself? (The Book of Mormon brought forth by Joseph Smith at age 23-24 is now embraced by 14 millions Mormons). De Voto, like Brodie, does not try to explain it. Neither one make any valid attempt.With all of the above, it would seem that neither Marvin Hill nor anyone can continue to say that No Man Knows My History has \\"gone so long without effective criticism.\\" It is the opening of a new era. Let Brodie be recognized as a creative genius with a slant toward Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. But historian? Hardly.Note: Hartt Wixom has written three other books dealing with LDS history in addition to Critiquing the Critics of Joseph Smith: Profiles in Mormon Courage, Edward Partridge, Jacob Hamblin. Wixom has bachelors and masters degrees in communications from Brigham Young University and 50 post graduate hours of history from the University of Utah."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Is the real author Peter Dimock or Fawn Brodie? I find the bait-and-switch on authorship somewhat disingenuous to start with. Of course it's Fawn Brodie. No, I didn't buy the book. Neither do I intend to. I've read enought to know that it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.\\"No Ma'm, That's Not History,\\" by Hugh Nibley, came out shortly after Ms. Brodie published her book originally. Previous reviewers have listed other debunking sources. I used to lump anti-Mormon literature into three categories: outright lies, half-truths and truths made to look foolish. Ms. Brodie's skillful blend of all three have caused me to wonder if I should maybe establish a fourth category.

The book is far from perfect, but don't take a Mormon's word for it when they claim that, &quot;She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas&quot;. Although this statement may be partially true, the reality is that the conclusions of those who objectively study Joseph Smith are very different from those of true believing Mormons who &quot;tend to ignore information and resources that don't support their preconceived ideas&quot;.

I have read many reviews of this great book calling it tripe and that it is a rag written by a someone with an axe to grind. Sorry, but if you read, REALLY read this book, then you will see that it was not put together on a whim and that it was footnoted and researched to the nth degree. The only reason that this book gets negative reviews is that the people reading it giving those reviews do not WANT to accept the truth and want to keep their minds closed. I have not seen one valid argument from an opponent of this book other than to say it is trash and is full of lies and half-truths. Well, back those statements up with facts as Ms. Brodie has done in her wonderful book. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to people wishing to know the truth about the birth of Mormonism. Don't take my word for it though, read it through and make your own judgement, but I think you will see that at a a time when America was gullible and open to new religions, Joseph Smith took advantage of that and preyed on the minds of those people and many an individual, myself included, have been lured into it since that time."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is a good book for anyone looking for a historical understanding of Joseph Smith.

I got exactly that. It wasn't a real page turner though. In fact, I had to force myself to continue reading it about half way through.Mrs Brodie seems to have done a lot of research and presents it pretty well. There were a couple of instances where I thought she was reaching a bit, but she indicated herself that these instances were only theories, or possibilites, so in that regard I have to give her a lot of credit. These instances were also very trivial matters, in my opinion. The more substantial claims, such as the \\"translation\\" of the plates, and the polygamy can be verified through LDS sources, and are much more damaging to the church's credibility than this book could ever be.In fairness, I attempted to read \\"No Ma'am, that's not history\\" by Hugh Nibley. I say \\"attempted\\", because like most apologists, Mr Nibley seems to dance around issues rather than addressing them directly. I got tired of waiting for him to make a point and quit reading.In conclusion, if you want to learn about Joseph Smith, and read a very credible explaination for the circumstances regarding the foundation of the LDS church, read this book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is considered anti-mormon by many but reading it I didn't feel that way. I felt it was very comprehensive. Many say that her sources are distorted to produce a negative image. However most people have only read info from second hand sources while Brodie used first hand sources.

References to newspapers of the time or personal letters are found on nearly every page. The author dives deep into the humanity of Joseph Smith, a true con man of the day.

In this book, Ms. Brodie includes not just quotes from Joseph Smith and his followers, but also three appendixes full of reproductions of nineteenth century documents dealing with the life and court record of Smith. Ms. Brodie also manages to make it a very interesting book, in spite of the fact that there are more names and dates contained in it than any average history book. (Proof, I suppose, of the author's exhaustive research.) The book is not completely objective; it takes the viewpoint of the skeptic investigating the Mormon Church (she even includes quotes by Mark Twain regarding the Mormons!) This biography is essential reading for the person interested in the LDS Church, as well as LDS members.

She was a faithful Mormon at the time she wrote it and her reward was to be excommunicated by a panel of authorities which included her uncle David O'McKay (future prophet). Well researched and much vilified by church leaders, this is an excellent book for people unfamiliar with the Mormon church and its beginnings. Clint Lauricella"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Much has been written about this classic biography of Joseph Smith, and even after sixty years, the writing is fresh and brilliant. If she were writing today, however, Brodie's book would be twice as long because so much new information has come to light--especially about Joseph Smith's involvement in magic. See D. Michael Quinn's massively documented, yet very readable, \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View.\\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World ViewLike Brodie, Quinn was excommunicated for telling the truth about Joseph Smith.You know that Fawn Brodie has come a long way when even Mormons can praise it. In \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism,\\" the distinguished Mormon historian Richard Bushman wrote:\\"As notable for its journalistic brilliance as for its scholarship, \`No Man Knows My History' presented Riley's arguments and findings in a form more palatable to twentieth-century tastes\\" (p. 191).The critics of Brodie have also failed. In \\"Critiquing the Critics,\\" Haart Wixom (p. 120-121) writes the following about an article Brodie quoted from the \\"St. Louis Bulletin\\" about Martha Brotherton who left polygamy. It \\"appears Brodie made up at least part, if not all, of the Brotherton story. Whether she knowingly gave a wrong reference or not, it is nevertheless bogus.\\"Just previously, Wixom condescendingly refers to Brodie as \\"the woman,\\" and he denies that the newspaper even existed. It does exist.Actually the name of the newspaper is the \\"American Bulletin,\\" published in St. Louis--a minor error on Brodie's part, and one that I discovered in two minutes of research on the Internet.The article describes the methods used at Nauvoo by early Mormons, including Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, to get young women to marry them (Smith married a daughter and then her mother--Patty and Silvia Sessions; Young two sisters).In another case, Wixom erroneously writes: \\"She (Brodie) says Joseph probably got his idea for a higher priesthood from a book written by James Gray, giving no title or footnotes\\" (p. 177). On the contrary, Gray's book is footnoted on page 111 of Brodie's book. Nevertheless, this is an odd criticism for Wixom to make because he doesn't mention the title of Gray's book. The title is easy to find. Just google \\"James Gray, Melchesedec.\\"Brodie wrote: \\"It seems likely that Joseph that Joseph concept of duel priesthood came directly from James Gray's \`Dissertation on the Coincidence between the Priesthoods of Jesus Christ and Melchisedec' (Philadelphia, 1810). Her comment is reasonable: it does seem \\"likely.\\" The title of Gray's book will catch the eye of anyone familiar with Mormonism.My criticism would be that Brodie could have made a stronger case by putting the name of Gray's book in the text rather than in a footnote. She also could have quoted from Gray's 121 page pamphlet-book. In just an hour of reading, an intelligent person would have a complete scriptural justification for the Melchisedec priesthood in a church--not just an idea for the Melchisedec priesthood, but detailed justification.I would say this in criticism of Brodie. She completely dismisses the Spalding theory. While I believe that Brodie is correct in saying that Joseph Smith composed the Book of Mormon himself, the similarities of the plot elements in \\"Manuscript Found\\" are troubling. They insure that Solomon Spalding's ghost will never rest.It seems possible that Joseph Smith could have heard about Spalding's story without actually having seen it. Thus, it could have had an influence on Joseph Smith.Nevertheless, here are the plot elements of \\"Manuscript Found\\" compared to those of the Book of Mormon (plot elements never listed by Mormon writers for fear of opening a can of worms--Brodie did not list them either).In about 1812, the Reverend Solomon Spalding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. Spalding lived in Connecut, Ohio, less than 200 miles from Palmyra (on the Great Lake's trade route, so traveler could have told Joseph Smith about Spalding's story).Spalding described an ancient American civilization in as much detail as is found in the Book of Mormon (1830). Spalding even read passages of his novel to his congregation (thus insuring that it was spread far and wide).So we have two stories, each purporting to be a history, and each featuring a \\"translator,\\" who finds an ancient account of a lost white American civilization.In each story, the civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has \\"epistles\\"), \\"Censors\\" are the rulers (\\"Judges\\" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands.The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). In both works, the white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher (\\"Bosaka\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In this last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Each account also claims that the ancient Americans possessed the modern knowledge that the earth rotates around the sun, rather than vise verse. Both stories feature an item of technology consistent with the 1800s, rather than thousands of years ago. The Book of Mormon has submarines; the American Robert Fulton built his famous Nautilus in 1800; Spalding's story has a hot-air balloon (note the famous French balloon flights of the 1780s). These hot technologies of the day were story elements of the newly-born American literature. Spalding and Smith were perhaps the first American writers to include them in a novel.There are other coincidences. The world's first reconstructed mammoth skeleton, \\"the ninth wonder of the world,\\" went on display in Philadelphia in 1802, and coincidentally \\"elephants\\" are found in the Book of Mormon (1830) and \\"mamoons\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" (1812).One would think that the plot elements of the two stories would at least be discussed by Mormon writers out to disprove the Spalding Theory. But no, they shift the focus to how did Joseph Smith come to read Spalding's manuscript? Some critics said that the link between the stories was Syndey Rigdon, the first major convert to Mormonism. Rigdon had lived in Pittsburg and was known at the printshop where Spalding sent his manuscript.Although I believe that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon, the \\"Pittsburgh coincidence\\" has never set well with me. Like a detective investigating an unsolved murder, the possibility that Smith in some way borrowed from Spalding story will never be laid to rest.Curiously, one Mormon writer in criticising the Spalding Theory said there are \\"no complex Chiasms appear in MS (Manuscript Found).\\" See \\"Refuting the Critics: Evidences of the Book of Mormon's Authenticity,\\" by Michael Griffith, p. 81. Griffith's statement is an admission that \\"chiamus\\" (parallelisms in Hebrew poetry) were around in 1812. They have been pointed out by proponents of the Spalding Theory. See my review of \\"By the Hand of Mormon,\\" by Terryl L. Givens. Click here:By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World ReligionRobert Silverberg in the \\"Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth\\" is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. \\"Neutral observers,\\" he writes, \\"generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding\\" (p. 96).Silverberg's book is a must-read for anyone interested in the world of Joseph Smith and the great Mound Builder myth.

However, I must say it was a fascinating read and also well-documented. The heavy footnotes are essential in a book of this nature as the Mormons are notorious for having a selective history. An excellent book from someone who experienced the religion first hand."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If there had been no Fawn Brodie, Mormons would probably have had to invent her. Ever since she published \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet\\" in 1945, calling into serious question most of the faith claims based on Mormonism's early history, an enormous amount of energy has been expended by Mormon historians, apologists, and critics of all backgrounds and persuasions either to defend or to deny her conclusions. The themes explored by Mormon historians since that time have often responded to Brodie's analysis.When Brodie published \\"No Man Knows My History\\" in 1945, she analyzed Mormonism's founder using the standards of secular scholarship. She interpreted him as a charlatan at first motivated by self-serving desires but gradually coming to believe in his own prophetic mission. She also acknowledged his very real accomplishments in forming an important religious movement in the United States. In many ways it was a seminal study that served as a transition point between what has been inaccurately called the old and the new Mormon history, the \\"old\\" generally viewed as polemical while the \\"new\\" was considered less concerned with questions of religious truth and more interested in understanding why events unfolded as they did. It is a measure of the success of her biography of Smith that it is still considered more than fifty years later the standard work on the subject and the starting point for all analyses of Mormonism. A second edition of this book, published in 1971, revised some of her earlier conclusions, especially her contention that Smith had been a charlatan, and incorporated recent trends from psychohistory to explain him more as a self-deluded imposter.Brodie, perhaps intentionally, dealt a damaging blow to many of the Mormon foundational beliefs when she questioned most of the basic assumptions about Mormon origins in her biography of Joseph Smith. In \\"No Man Knows My History\\" she systematically dealt with five basic issues that have challenged Mormon historians ever since. One of the most important was Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" for which she emphatically denied that there was any valid evidence until Smith fabricated it in 1838 when he began dictating his history to provide a starting point for his prophetic career that would counter charges that he was involved in treasure seeking. A second was the whole issue of treasure seeking itself and its relationship both to Smith and Mormon origins. Third, Brodie questioned the origins and content of the Book of Mormon, asserting that it was a product of Joseph Smith's vivid imagination and not an actual history of any group of people who came to America. Fourth, she explored in depth the origins of plural marriage and the duplicity Smith registered in originating it to justify what she thought was his licentious nature. Finally, Brodie interpreted Smith as a would-be tyrant seeking to take over some or all of the territory of the United States to create his own theocratic state with himself in charge.She provides an in depth analysis of each of these themes in her biography of Smith, and those perspectives still hold a powerful sway over Mormon historiography. One cannot begin to understand the development of the Mormon religion without grappling with the issues raised by Fawn Brodie."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I don't know how any knowledgeable, educated person can read this book and not conclude that Joseph Smith was a fraud who pulled off a whopper of a scam.

I'm a former Mormon who found this book to be an eye-opener."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"As a non-Morman living in Utah, I am often confronted with Mormon rhetoric. One hears propoganda about the religion and, without the knowledge base, one can't help but believe what many Mormons are so earnest about...their religion. However, after reading Brodie's book, I am now armed with questions, facts and details that refute what Mormon's are raised to believe. What I can't understand is how so many Mormon's refuse to read this factual, well-documented history of the man they basically worship? If they don't buy into Brodie's actual words, why don't they dig through the references she readily supplies? I am so intrigued that a man of such proposterous ethics can create such a following? And, how can so many truly intelligent Mormons not question the integrity of this man and this religion? This book is very, very insightful."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Like all good history, this book's chief aim is simply to provide the evidence as best as it can while leaving readers to their own conclusions.To the over twenty million Mormon faithful, Brodie readily concedes that Joseph Smith gave birth to a religion that now spans the globe, spreading word of its good news.And to the \\"gentile\\" non Mormons, this book asks by its history the very pointed question of how such a religion could have come to be and survived its not inconsiderable obstacles were it not ordained of God.For my part, all the history relating to Joseph Smith's all too human frailities...his 1826 conviction for disorderly conduct (essentially a fraud charge), his sometimes contradictory revelations from above and of course his documented plural marriages...do not cast him and his movement in a light less than other religions but rather reminiscent of them.In rallying against those who would do violence to Mormons I was reminded of Old Testament vitriol against nonbelievers. In practicing (if not necessarily espousing) plural marriage I was reminded of course of that other prophet Mohammed. And of course, with with reference to its historical tendency to bring all too Earthly suffering to those for whom it sought to give eternal deliverance, I was reminded of all religion.While Brodie's book for its part enigmatically refuses to answer that ultimate question of the verite of Joseph Smith's prophetic status, a careful reading of it does suggest perhaps his limitations are one with all religion.And as long as our celestial witnesses are human, we will be left seeing that great eternity through only the limitations of their refracted mortal gaze."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The last US Presidential elections came and went. President Obama won a re-election, the Republican contender, Mitt Romney, lost. Mitt is a Mormon and this would be one of the books he could have banned if he were the President. This book reveals the true story behind the man who created American's biggest corporate cult that poses as a \\"religion\\", successfully usurped an entire US state, and whose members have no qualms investing in vice to enrich themselves.This classic biography of the insane founder of Mormonism takes you behind the scenes of a disturbed man, who spent his time dabbling in the dark with peep stones, communication with ghosts and spirits who led him to treasures. The founding of a new American religion grew out of Mr. Smith's wild imaginations and charismatic personality, so prevalent in Protestantism.Mormonism is just another off-shoot of Protestantism, holding the same principles, and changing them as the times see fit. Their self-declared prophets talk like elementary school children, with absolutely no depth in theological knowledge. Then again, what can you expect from a Prot by-product that creates a god out of their fantasies. Oh, do remember to contribute at least 10% of your monthly income to your local \\"church\\", no wait, Mormons don't have a church, they've a stake house that doesn't even display a decent cross in sight!Now, how many wives can I now legally have if I were a reformed or fundamentalist Mormon? Once upon a time, Mormon men could marry multiple women, they changed that view not because they received a coded message from God, but because their cult wanted to survive for another generation and had to play by decent moral codes of conduct. Once upon a time, Mormons were totally racists, accepting only blue eyed blondes (and some brunettes), now they just had to change that Nazi \\"theology\\" so that they can swindle more money from non-Americans to enlarge their Utah corporation. So very Protestant in nature!When Mormons can't give a logical explanation to their \\"theology\\", worldview and history, they resort to FEELINGS as a vindication of their \\"truth\\". What a form of Prot escapism, often seen in Prot cults and sects. They can't think or reason in a coherent fashion and when they can't answer questions, always resort to violence or feelings as proof of their \\"truths\\".How can 14+ MILLION adherents of Mormonism be do DUMB as to believe in a cult whose founder founded his new religion on personal lusts for women, ghostly spectres and a mishmash of Protestantism?

I think the words \\"trashy\\" and \\"amateurish\\" would best describe this book that includes long lists of footnotes that are in some cases outright fabrications and in other instances refer to fabrications printed by some other author who also fabricated information regarding Joseph Smith when they couldn't find anything bad.If you are truly interested in Joseph Smith or the origins of The Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) I suggest Donna Hill's (author is not a Mormon but an Historian) \\"Joseph Smith:The First Mormon\\". Even better would be to read Joseph Smith himself in \\"The Book of Mormon\\" or \\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith\\". The Library of America, in a volume entitled \\"American Sermons\\", has included a complete funeral sermon given by Joseph Smith just prior to his murder called \\"The King Follett Sermon\\". (King Follett was a friend of Joseph Smith's and Smith gives an overview of theology that is nothing short of astounding.)

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has enemies both inside and outside of the Church who delight in tearing it down. While Fawn Brodie was a member of the Church when this book was written, that in no way should imply that this was a fair and accurate study. For various reasons there are a certain number of people who stay in the Church, even though they don't believe it is true any longer. There are also those who leave the Church but who can't leave it alone.Some... eager individuals... lecture the rest of us about Church doctrines in which they no longer believe. They criticize the use of Church resources to which they no longer contribute. They condescendingly seek to counsel the Brethren whom they no longer sustain. They leave the Church but they cannot leave the Church alone.-Neal Maxwell, Ensign, May 1996, 68.Lest you think I digress, I tell you these things to put this book into perspective. Miss. Brodie, an acknowleged agnostic, and many like her who are critical of the Church, write and love books like this which justify their apostate sympathies or actions. I suspect that is why there are so many favorable reviews of this book. Faithful Church members have no reason to want to read this book, which they know is filled with half truths and inuendo, so they don't come here to review it.Fawn Brodie pretends to know what was in the mind of Joseph Smith when he supposedly did what he did. This book comes closer to being a novel than an historical text. Her methodology was also terribly flawed. While at first glance it looks like her efforts have merit. All one has to do is look at her much discredited work on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;) and compare it with this work to see the parallels.For a critical rereading of this book, see &quot;Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass,&quot; an excellent deconstruction by Hugh Nibley of Fawn Brodie's methodology."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is an example of an anti-mormon trying to write an historical account and remain sitting on the fence. This cannot be accomplished and Fawn Brodie failes. This is not the history of Joseph Smith the man or the prophet. The background resrearch is horrible and the commentary leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the reader. The only message I got from this book is that Fawn Brodie is bitter and cannot write without this bitterness coming out in here book. One of the worst biographies on Joseph Smith that I have read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"My entire life has included constant exposure to this attempt to capture,beat and bury poor old Joe Smith.She is a many decade favorite with those who like to throw rocks at all things LDS.Living in VA,in the shadow of Monticello,her horrible,discredited \\"biography\\"of our beloved Mr.Jefferson,should show the casual reader that her scholarship is extremely suspect.Reading her book is like going to a Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi press party for ALL your info on the Bush administration.Her view of Smith is so twisted,so fabricated,so devoid of actual truth, as to make one wonder why anyone would care.But itching ears go for what fits their desires.Many desire to dismiss Smith as a charlatan,fake,fraud-Keep trying.Ain't gonna happen.In this bicentennial year of his birth,there has been a huge amount of scholarly research released,symposiums conducted,including one at the library of congress.The picture of Smith that emerges is one that paints a better portrait, that shows more of the depth of this giant on the American scene.His status as one of the most important figures in US history is undeniable.His influence in the US and,indeed,the entire world just grows.By their fruits,ye shall know them.The fruits of the life of Joseph Smith are sweet and welcome by those who know truth from gossip,something Ms.Brodie did NOT.The fact that most historians agree that he is the most important American religious figure ever produced, shows the futility of those who killed him,as well as those who continue to slander him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Seeking to be primarily an exposition on Mormonism's founder, Joseph Smith, and his life, this biased and typically unscholarly work depicts the life of Joseph Smith as anything but prophet-like. Her twisted and oft times distorted view makes this book completely unreliable and, therefore, not quite the &quot;brilliant&quot; work some may suppose.At the time of its original publishing, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was considered the best anti-Mormon literature around. Ms. Brodie attempted to disclose supposed &quot;secrets&quot; about Joseph Smith's life and whisked away any notion of a his prophetic calling. With deceit in her heart, she believed it was necessary to perhaps logically explaining every condition, circumstance and story with more believable worldly circumstances. She even used psychoanalysis as a justification of her distorted views. Just as science sometimes attempts to explain there is no God, Ms. Brodie wants to show there is no such thing as a modern-day prophet!I was significantly disheartened to hear from some that this book of blatant untruths is probably the best reading material on Joseph Smith around. Obviously, not too inept to study, ponder and pray, these multitudes of ignoramuses are too quick to judge and probably not willing to seriously study in-depth (and from different perspectives) the life of a man too great in personal stature and unique spirituality to be told all in one book. No one book completely encases nor sufficiently explains the sheer virtuosity and dynamic life of Joseph Smith.I hope that others may know Ms. Brodie's book is not the end-all-discussion authority on Joseph Smith, nor will it ever be. I would recommend other reading material, but this book by no means gives a proper perspective!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The author proves the title statement made by Smith and further extends it: No woman knows his history, either. The conclusive leaps are laughable to anyone who thinks them through, and too much information in the book is already outdated and disproved.

I gobbled up the book in two sittings (again it's very nicely written) and I was fascinated by Fawn Brodie's revelations of Joseph Smith as a confidence man and generally lovable rogue whose schemes succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.Also, her theory that freemason ritual provided the basis for Mormon Temple ceremonies is particularly interesting.However, after carefully pondering the book, I reached the conclusion that, for whatever reason, God had raised a Prophet on the New York frontier. After struggling with this belief for a few years, I finally joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I'm very glad I did. Today, as I've learned more about him, I easily acknowledge Joseph Smith as a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.Who knows?

It's called argument from authority. (My God is right also, so were does that leave us?). It's not accepted in accepted discussions. Also standing behind Nibley as an unofficial spokesman for your church instead of the policy makers in the western Vatican isn't kosher. Maybe you can get Nibley to show the genetic connection between the American Indians and the Israelites which is the main theme of the Joe's book anyway. (Mormon supercession ). The Mormons themselves can't even with the new genetics department at BYU. Even with the largest and most costly archeological expedition launched anywhere to Central America the efforts have been unable to substantiate his contention. Brodie, an often-overlooked fact, was a professor at one of the better universities that study folklore and cults. Her book is not only well written, but historically accurate, by way of research and not just genealogical connections. But why stop here. Read \\"Joseph Smith and the Orgins of The Book of Mormon\\", by David Persuitte. \\"By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus\\", by Charles M. Larson is a must. Both of these validate Brodies claims.

Although she did discredited some of the stories sensational stories about Joseph Smith, her book suffers from two major flaws.1. She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas.2. The book reads more like a novel than a true history. She knows more about what Joseph is thinking than any biographer can know. This criticism was dismissed by her supporters, but when she used the same technique on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, then those who knew better were strong in their denunciation of her work"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Joseph Smith is probably the best-documented &quot;prophet&quot; of all time, and this book traces his career in highly illuminating detail.But first, let me try to get one question out of the way. That question is: &quot;Did Joseph Smith REALLY receive a divine revelation which he set down in the Book of Mormon?&quot; If your answer to that question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then you get to explain how the Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel! This is, of course, impossible to do, since the Native Americans are now known to be of Asian origin -- through studies of linguistics and DNA. And that's one of the big problems with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; -- its claims are so specific that they are actually falsifiable (unlike e.g. the generalities and moralizing found in the Koran).That question set aside (hopefully), this biography documents with meticulous detail Smith's exact sources for his holy forgery, including Ethan Smith's &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; and the contemporary political uproars over Freemasonry.This view of the Native Americans may have seemed plausible in the 1820's, but why would anyone follow Joseph Smith, whose previous line of work was divining and gold-digging? The only answer seems to be: this is embedded in human nature. There are a lot of people out there who have a need to believe, and they flit from one cult to another, never for a moment imagining that they could have an independent life outside of a cult.The story of Joseph Smith is also the story of Muhammad. In just the same way, an uneducated man &quot;received&quot; a divine book and created a whole new religion. And the adherents of that religion argue that it must be true because &quot;so many&quot; people believe in it. Well, there are 3 million Mormons. :-)This is also the story of what I have seen in my own lifetime: the Hare Krishnas (still going in Australia, by the way), the Moonies, the Rajneeshies, the Branch Davidians, and -- most recently -- the Islamic suicide cults led by the likes of Osama Bin Laden. (Not to mention Jonestown, or those weirdos in Rancho Santa Fe who committed mass suicide over the arrival of a comet.) In every case, we find a leader who fits the &quot;imposter&quot; psychological pattern, and who has the charisma to attract followers, associated with a group of &quot;believers&quot; who apparently have no standard of truth whatever, but rush around looking for imposters to follow.

It lucidly and coherently explains the rise of the cult of mormonism and spares no expense in trying to hide its occult beginnings, Joseph Smith's megalomania, polygamy, bizarre temple rituals, racism, and all of the other nonsense found in the beginnings of this non-Christian religion. Surprisingly, the author refused to kowtow to the whims of the cult when she wrote this masterpiece; one that clearly exposed the brazen hypocrisy behind its basic tenets.One can't but wonder why any thinking human being wouldn't be swayed from joining (or remaining in) the cult after reading this dazzling biography that so eloquently details Smith's flagrant charlatanism and barefaced deceit as he gazed through seer stones, created stars (such as Kolob) where gods have celestial whoopee, \\"revelations\\" designed to pray upon the feeble minds of his followers, secret holy underwear (still worn by cult members), and a whole plethora of other nonsense.Of course, the cult also can't stand the fact that this book is remarkably well-documented and researched. This masterpiece has already withstood the test of time (originally written during the 1940's) and for good reason: it provides a solid foundation upon which all other studies on the cult must not ignore."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"There are few biographies of merit regarding Joseph Smith. It seems difficult for biographers to be neutral on him. Although the author genuinely attempts to be unbiased, she often takes facts from his life and comes up with a negative interpretation of his actions: much the way a church member would take the same events and come up with a positive interpretation.The book is very readable and there is factual information in the book that is difficult to find in other places. These are the highlights of this biography.The downside is the author's unintentional slant against Joseph which leads to many assumptions that may or may not be accurate.In sum, to better understand the life of Joseph Smith this would be a good book to read, but the reader should certainly get more than this one view point before making any firm judgements."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I found this book to be greatly informative and interesting. Great book!No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book, now nearly 60 years old, remains the definitive source on Joseph Smith and serves as a key source for more recent works, notably John Krakauer's \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\". The book provides a remarkably tangible portrait of Smith, from his early days in Vermont and New York through the growth of his church and his murder in Carthage. A fascinating character, Brodie's Smith is a far more human and fallible character than the sanitized version in official LDS histories (the LDS church has offered pointed rebuttals to this work). Brodie's work remains definitive in large part because official church records and documents are off-limits to unofficial (read: non-LDS-sanctioned) historians.For a 60 year old biograhpy, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" reads beautifully, a testament to the author's superior writing. This, as is noted by a reviewer on the book jacket, is an outstanding example of the biographer's art.Anyone who has an interest in the world's fastest growing church should read Brodie's book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"You may get the impression, from many reviews below, that \\"No Man\\" is a work of angry polemic, \\"twisted\\" and \\"fabricated\\" with hardly a word of \\"positive information\\" about Joseph Smith. It did not seem that way to me. Brodie's tone seemed far more judicious and moderate than that of most critics, and her research extensive and thoughtfully sifted.If you expect a white horse, a zebra's dark stripes will surprise you, but if you look for a black horse, his white stripes will likely catch your eye. My impression of Joseph Smith was pretty negative, before reading this book, which may be why it seemed more positive to me than to many Mormon readers. I had noticed parallels between Smith and \\"religious revolutionaries\\" like Mohammed and Karl Marx; Brodie persuaded me though that unlike them, he was not a violent man by nature. I knew Smith manipulated women, and (like Mohammed) quoted God to justify hoarding them; Brodie showed that he also seemed to really care for his (first) wife, and defer to her at times. From the Book of Mormon, and one rather wild sermon, I got the impression that Smith completely lacked literary talent; Brodie again argued me wrong. (\\"Now he was developing into a preacher of uncommon talent.\\") All in all, while I still think him a scoundrel, Brodie forced me to modify my prior impression of Joseph Smith in a more positive direction.It is human nature to make excuses for successful tyrants: criticism of Marx or Mohammed usually draws the same ire as many reviews below display. Brodie is mildly affected by this weakness. Brodie tells of disreputable deeds, or quotes words that sound a bit mad, then follows with a paragraph that says in effect, \\"Boys will be boys,\\" insisting on (and arguing for) Smith's greatness despite such contrary evidence. But for her, the facts seem to come first; interpretation is kept distinct. All in all, she has written a fascinating, readable, and fairly believable work of historical narrative.And what a story she has to tell! If you doubt truth can be wilder than fiction, ponder this tale of the \\"peep stone\\" artist who invented a theology, founded cities, recreated polygamy and polytheism almost from scratch, wrote an alternate history of the Americas and persuaded twenty million people to believe it, and died in a shootout with a lynch mob, leaving dozens of grieving widows.While Brodie shows that Smith was not inherently violent, the story does confirm other commonalities that struck me when I studied Marxism, Islam, and the Tai Ping Rebellion in China. She describes Smith's theology as a \\"potpourri\\" of influences; true of the ideological genius of Mohammed and Marx as well. She relates the evolution of Smith's thinking on economic \\"communism.\\" Parallels between Smith's \\"revelations\\" about the use and control of women, and those of Mohammed and the Chinese visionary, Hong Xiuquan, also emerge. Lyman Wight's description of unbelievers as \\"devils, infernal hob-goblins, and ghosts\\" is also closely paralleled by the dehumanizing language of the Cultural Revolution and the Tai Ping movement.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"First, let me say that I am a 'recovering Mormon.' This book helped me open my eyes and step into the light, and out of the darkness in which I was raised. The light of truth is invigorating and refreshing.... I think it must have been similar for people in the former Soviet Union when their blinders were finally pulled off, and they saw that they had been living... and believing in...the fiction that was the USSR and its banckrupt ideology/false history since they were children.And I'm sorry if it will offend believers, but Mormonism really is 'out there' on the fringe, if you will, with Wicca and Scientology. A close reading of this book and other non-apologetic works on the development of the church, as well on the character and personality of Joseph Smith, shows that the Mormon religion is essentially rooted in magic and the occult. There are many 'cult-like' activities and practices established within the church and among its adherents as well.No Man Knows My History by Fawn Brodie shows that the emperor (Joe Smith, the great American heretic and apostate) has no clothes. It's the one book Mormons don't want the rest of the world to read, because it conflicts with the official, sanitized, fictionalized version of Joseph Smith's life promulgated by the LDS church.It saddens me that so many unknowing Christians are drawn to the Mormon religion through its hyper-intensive missionary (marketing) tactics.... and it saddens me even more that the future of Christendom will be tainted and vitiated by the heresy of Joseph Smith.Hopefully Mormons will read it too.

It shows what someone with a great but warped imagination, charisma can accomplish with some theatrics. On the already established credibility of Christianity, this guy invented his own religion out of thin air."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Let's play three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. Said elephant is Fawn M. Brodie's biography of Mormon prophet-founder Joseph Smith, Jr., NO MAN KNOWS MY HISTORY. Some readers gravitate to Smith's optimistic vision of a human nature capable of infinite perfectibility; others gnash their teeth over Fawn Brodie's reading Smith's mind, somewhat as Smith allegedly read Egyptian texts at the bottom of his hat. For my part, I am fascinated by the biography's following passage:\\"... [T]he book is one of the earliest examples of frontier fiction, the first long Yankee narrative that owes nothing to English literary fashions. Except for the borrowings from the King James Bible, its sources are absolutely American ... nothing can detract from the fact that many people have found it convincing history.\\" (Chapter V).American frontier fiction? I thought that that flowed from New England narratives of Indian wars and Cotton Mather's sermons on the wilderness as the seat of all evil. I thought world-class American frontier fiction came of age with Indian-sympathizer James Fenimore Cooper and characters in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, WYANDOTTE and THE WEPT OF WISH-TON-WISH.Fiction? Prophecy? Truth? Whatever the BOOK OF MORMON, THE BOOK OF ABRAHAM and other Smith writings are, they are products of a powerful, assimilative imagination. Smith was only 38 when he died violently in 1844. His formal education had largely ended when he left New England for New York as a boy with his family. But he had a hugely retentive memory and read widely. He had sensitive antennae for what bothered the frontier people around him. One contemporary observer said that Old Joe Smith exemplified every major truth and error agitating New York in a particular decade.One such national and frontier preoccupation was with American Indians. Their high mysterious mounds were being ransacked. And buried Spanish treasure was thought to be everywhere. Writers, one actually got it right, were theorizing that Indians had come to North America from somewhere else, from Israel -- or from across the Bering Straits. Joseph Smith picked these ideas up, along with notions in the air about healthy eating and drinking, living in communities, plural wives, Masonic rituals, etc. and wove them into his various writings and translations.Smith sent early missionaries westward into Indian Territory with the \\"good news\\" revealed to him by God about their pre-history, which they should find religiously, culturally and politically liberating. What strikes me is that Joseph Smith liked and admired Indians at a time when all too few other Americans did. His were the years of Georgians grabbing Cherokee land after gold was discovered on it. This was the era of Andrew Jackson and the Indians' \\"Trail of Tears.\\" These were also the years of war, uprooting or trouble for Creeks, Choctaws, Seminoles and other \\"redskins\\" -- years in which another writer of the frontier, James Fenimore Cooper, wrote religion-flavored frontier fiction and clearly loved and admired American Indians. Not many Americans had anything good to say about those \\"merciless savages.\\"So I say three cheers for that fun-loving wrestler Old Joe Smith and dour, serious, at times ponderous James Fenimore Cooper! If there had been a million more articulate Americans who were pro-Indian, then America today might be a more just nation. -OOO-"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"One theme that emerges from reading the reviews of this book on Amazon.com is that almost all of the non-Mormons appreciated the book and thought it was worth a read. Most, if not all, of the reviews by Mormons were scathing reviews of both the book and Ms. Brodie's personal character. This is no doubt because the author writes of Joseph Smith's life, the gold-mongering, the rampant polygamy (justified by a revelation-of course), and the other very human desires and actions of Joseph Smith factually and without bias. If an unbiased look into the life of Joseph Smith is what you're looking for, then this book is for you. If you wish to believe that the character of Joseph Smith is unmarred by greed, power-mongering, murder and adultery, then you should stick to LDS-sanctioned biographies; since this bio will leave the honest reader seeing Joseph Smith as, very much, just a man; who, although full of charisma, charm and vision, certainly lacked in honor."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"To say this book is a riviting account of an outlandish American character is an understatement. Brodie's work is still the standard by which all other biographies of Smith must be measured. Having unparalled access to LDS archives gave Brodie a leg up on all other biographers (other than official LDS &quot;historians&quot; assigned the task of whitewashing the life of their church's founder). Since this work no one has been allowed the access to official LDS records which Brodie enjoyed because of her pedigree as the descendant of an LDS President. Brodie's writing style is professional and interesting. I will fault her with speculating on the feelings and thoughts of Joseph Smith's mother at the time of his birth (1st edition). Other than that Brodie does an excellent job of sticking to the facts and setting forth the character of Joseph Smith more thouroughly than any historian before or since. History has proven Brodie right and her critics wrong concerning controversies on some of her writings. This book is the type of tour de force one expects from a University of Chicago scholar, which Brodie is. If only all biographies were this well researched and written. LDS apologists will not like this book because it presents the shaddy side of Smith (conviction for disorderly conduct, what we would today describe as fraud, his illegal banking scam in Ohio, having affairs with married women and then latter coming up with the doctrine of poligamy)and the politically maniacal side of Smith (organizing a 6,000 member malitia and terrorizing his non-Morman neighbors by marching around the county, attacking and destroying private property because a newspaper pointed out the facts of his doings in the church and city). Brodie is fair and points out the positive aspects of Smith as well. Smith's great intelligence and familiarity with the King James Translation of the Holy Bible is very evident from this biography. The problems with the official LDS account of the discovery and translation of the book of Mormon become evident because of Brodie's thourough handling of this area of Smith's life. If you only read one book on Mormanism or Joseph Smith in our life, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is a classic, and is generally recognized as such. The topic, which is the life of Joseph Smith, found its ideal author in Fawn Brodie, a Mormon who was on the verge of excommunication and who as about as sympathetic to Smith as an honest historian could be. One is tempted to say that Smith is presented, warts and all. But it would be more helpful to say that Smith is presented, virtues and all, because a man who concocts what purports to be holy scripture, who fakes divine revelation, who organizes three Waco-type compounds, who institutes militias and secret societies to kill his enemies, who decrees polygamy to satify the lusts of himself and his male colleagues, who orders the destruction of his enemies and who lies about most of these things probably has more warts than virtues.Brodie wrestles constantly with the issue of how a man of such limited education and rather obvious fraudulent intent could attract thousands of dedicated followers. It is no wonder that Brodie in her later works became so attracted to psycho-history. She advances a rather attractive hypothesis which suggests how Smith could have deluded himself into believing his own nonsense: Since all our thoughts are the product of previous states of mind, and since these states include all the factors which go into our perceptions, concepts and mental \\"programs\\", there is no essential difference between our control over our waking thoughts and our control over our dreams, reveries, and other semi-conscious states. We just think there is, because the illusion of control is part of the nature of the mental state we call \\"consciousness.\\" If that is so, then it can be argued that a \\"revelation\\" which derives from our past state of mind is no more originated by our own will than the conscious perception that we are being visited by the angel Moroni.Of course, this line of thought comes dangerously close to solipsism, and solipsism comes dangerously close to autotheism (if there is nothing else in the universe but oneself, then everything there is must be an extension of oneself, and hence one must be God). Toward the end of his life, Smith's megalomania was indeed headed in this direction.Brodie does a wonderful job describing how Charismatic Smith must have been. To have persuaded people of real intelligence and ability like Brigham Young and his own wife Emma into believing and supporting him throughout his career, and to have, as she puts it, \\"Caused men to see visions\\" is no mean feat. And to have created a religion which, for all its faults, is far more admirable than its own founder bespeaks one of the most fascinating characters in American history. Everyone interested in religion, psychology, and American History should read this book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read and enjoyed this book. This book is worth reading although it must certainly read with a grain of salt and a critical mind. It contains historical fact frequently mixed with the author's own opinions and interpretations. The author promotes the sponge theory of the Book of Mormon- simply that Joseph Smith absorbed what was in the air and squeezed it and out came The Book of Mormon. To me this seems a bit far- fetched. If this is true, then The Book of Mormon has been one of the most successful hoaxes in the history of the world. The author does provide some interesting and detailed information about Joseph Smith and his polygamous activities in Nauvoo- information that the average Mormon probably does not know about and would probably find quite disturbing if they did. The current policy of the LDS church is to basically ignore parts of church history which are not faith inspiring. LDS church members are fed a very edited version of the history of Joseph Smith which is specifically intended to be faith inspiring. The average Mormon also probably does not know about Joseph's campaign for President of the United States. This book can help you to know who Joseph Smith really was although it must be read with a critical mind like I said before."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is a brilliantly researched history of the life of Mormonism's Prophet, the charismatic and gifted Joseph Smith. As a nonbeliever, myself, I approach almost everything from a secular level, as does Brodie, therefore I'm bound to agree with her approach, recognizing, at the same time, that some of her sources are questionable, in that they are derived from people who hated Josph and/or his strange religion.Brodie seeks to understand the young Joseph growing up in hard-scrabble Vermont and Western New York. We see a talented, ambitious and highly imaginative young dreamer trapped amongst largely uneducated people who were both superstitious and, oftentimes, painfully gullible. Young Joseph, who isn't enamored with farming, is fascinated by Indian mounds and treasure finding. He finds a stone thru which he claims can divine the location of hidden treasure. He is persuasive enough [alternatively, people are so gullible] that he makes a modest living from selling his talents although there is no evidence that he, or anyone else, was ever enriched by them. As a matter of fact, he is successfully sued by one angry man who regards himself as cheated.Over a period of time, and unlike Mormon preachments, Joseph morphs into something like a religious mystic. He claims he has found a 'Golden Bible' although the circumstances of finding it are initially vague. The Golden Bible has some interesting characteristics. Smith generally keeps it--whatever it is--hidden in a box or under cloth. It seems that few people can visualize it, except himself, although--according to witnesses--it has weight and heft. Also, despite the fact that others can't see it, Joseph reports hiding it from place to place so that it won't be stolen for its golden value.Using magical implements, including stones, Joseph 'translates' his golden plates into the document later known as the Book of Mormon. Joseph's tale of visions of angels, God and Jesus seem to have, for the most part, post-dated the translation of the gold. The nature of these visions, the number of angels, personages etc. seems to have morphed over time.Joseph is now well on his way to becoming a prophet and world-shaker. He gains increasing number of adherents. The question is, 'how much of this does Joseph believe, himself?' We'll probably never know but, I suspect that over time and with increasing adulation, that he comes to believe that he is the true instrument of God's Power on earth. Like most powerful men, women flock to him as bees do to honey. He has additional 'revelations' including the desireability of faithful men taking multiple wives. This revelation has the force of a commandment and Joseph, without the apparent consent or even knowledge of his wife, Emma, takes on multiple women as religious wives.The newly-founded sect finds it persecuted for its communistic and polygamist practices. They are forced to move, almost en masse, from one place to another, until founding the city of Nauvoo, Illinois on the banks of the Mississippi. The city is successful, perhaps too much so. Joseph sets himself up as General of the militia and orders the destruction of a printing press that has criticized him. He is arrested by secular authorities and, while imprisoned in the upper floor of a jailhouse, he and his brother, Hyram, are shot to death by an anti-Mormon mob. Joseph is dead but a martyr is born.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"The Firebird in Full Score (Original 1910 Version) (Dover Music Scores)","review":"The score is wonderful to follow along with. As easy as it is to follow it is as easy to read. Outlining the entire Ballet, each section of music has a title on the page where it begins, in both Russian and English.

If you like the rites of spring or petrushka, this is a great score to own NOTE: this is not the 1919 Firebird Suite that is most popular - this is the full score - it has probably a half hour more of music and some much more interesting orchestrations!

Stravinsky's teacher was Rimsky-Korsakov, the unequivicol master of orchestration during his time, and one can see how he employed his education into this work.The Firebird is based on a Russian Folktale describing an adventure of a young man who frees the mystical Firebird and defeats the evil King Kaschei. The work premiered in 1910, performed by the famed Nijinsky, Sergey Diaghilev the impressario. This is truly and brilliant work and is so colorful. It is much longer then the suite as it is presented as the full ballet.The score is large and easy to read. Text is included with English translation as well as a brief sonopsis. It lies flat on a desk or music and is inexpensive -- ideal for the starving music student.

Because it's only in their original form that they retain the poetry and power of Chaucer's intent. I read these stories with a professor who could passably read Middle English and it was a revelation. Before, with translated versions, I had never quite understood why Chaucer was considered so great, so necessary to the canon. Hearing them in the original form, I suddenly understood. The tales are funny, dirty, odd stories (like an English version of \\"The Decameron\\") told in striking, blood-stirring rhyme and rhythm. Hearing them read aloud was like music to the ear. Which makes the smoothed-over versions feel flat and dead to the ear.Buy this edition. Try to learn enough Middle English to get along. Discover for yourself the power of Chaucer's poetry."},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales: Fifteen Tales and the General Prologue (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"Writing a \\"review\\" of The Canterbury Tales is difficult, not because the book/collection isn't worthy of a review, but because it is so widely variant and has so many nuances to be discussed.For those who don't know, The Canterbury Tales is a book containing a bunch of stories told by individuals traveling together on a pilgrimage to Canterbury. The book is written in the late 1300s with the pilgrimage set in the same basic time. It begins with a \\"General Prologue\\" providing a description of each of the characters in the group as well as the \\"game\\" they'll be playing (that of telling stories on the way to Canterbury). Each pilgrim tells a different tale (well, not \\"all\\" of them...the work is \\"unfinished\\" in the sense that we're missing tales from some pilgrims). Some tales are set in their contemporary England while others are set in exotic lands, romantic settings, or ancient cultures.So what do you say in a brief review of The Canterbury Tales?To start with, I would suggest you try reading it in the original Middle English. The language/spelling/pronunciation can be a problem, so be sure you get an edition that's glossed (unless you're proficient in Middle English). During the semester, I found a \\"children's\\" edition of the tales at my local library. It included Modern English \\"translations\\" of a couple of the tales along with some illustrations. It was kind of fun to read, but it lost some of the rhythm and drive of the tales by having them in a modern format.Secondly, there are some bits that can be skipped, but it's difficult to identify which ones. For example, some might suggest that the entire Pardoner's Prologue (and much of his tale) can be ignored altogether and that you should just focus on the actual \\"tale\\" part of his tale. While his tale is entertaining and the reading would be much shorter if that's all you read, you would miss a TON of social and religious commentary which is very interesting. Similarly, the Wife of Bath has lengthy rambling passages in her Prologue and the Merchant includes numerous lengthy lists that have little bearing on the plot. It's difficult to create a good synopsis of what can safely be skipped, because it depends in a large extent on what you want to get out of it. Worse still, if you're reading in the unfamiliar Middle English, it's harder to quickly scan the text and get a feel for when the narrative has gotten back to the 'heart of the matter.'The writing is fun and clever (once you get through the 'translation' issues with the Middle English). For a common reference, it's like reading Shakespeare, only more archaic by a couple hundred years. The language of the narrative varies depending on the narrator of the particular prologue/tale, but with Chaucer at the helm behind the scenes, the writing is generally very good, descriptive, layered, humorous, inspiring, etc. (except for when he's trying to illustrate 'bad writing', and then it's good in that it's so bad).The messages presented are widely varied as well. The Knight's Tale was an intriguing tale of romance and chivalry with lots of courtly intrigue...but at times it felt a little dry. The Miller and the Reeve were hilarious tales and introduced me to a new (to me) genre in the fabliau. The Wife of Bath had an interesting prologue and a fun tale, again with a semi-romantic style and an interesting moral. The Nun's Priest gave us a fun little animal fable. The Prioress presented a strange little tale about miracles or anti-semitism or devout love or something else?Overall, I would definitely recommend having a copy of The Canterbury Tales on your shelf. Some tales are easier to read than others. Some tales are more fun while others are more thought provoking (as stated in one of the prologues, a tale has one of two purposes, to educate or to entertain...and there are examples of each). Once you get your teeth into the language (probably the biggest hurdle) I suspect you'll enjoy these.*****5 stars"},{"Title":"The Canterbury Tales: Fifteen Tales and the General Prologue (Norton Critical Editions)","review":"This is an excellent version of this classic.

Loss of innocence leads to moral corruption, but eventual personal growth to dignity and worth"},{"Title":"Not as a Stranger","review":"I just finished reading Not As A Stranger. The story begins with Lucas Marsh chasing doctors as a young boy and ends with him continuing his practice in a small town during the early part of the Great Depression. The basic storyline is relatively simple - Lucas is self-serving and doesn't have too many social skills because of his somewhat abnormal childhood. He is bound to become a doctor at any cost, and does what he has to do to make money to pay for medical school. Throughout the book it's clear that the only two things he really cares about is medicine and getting action whenever possible - hence a dip into the world of adultery. His long-suffering wife (Kristi) puts up with his emotional abuse time after time and never, as some reviewers have claimed, puts him in his place. The book would have been more interesting if she were less of a doormat. Also, some reviewers have claimed that Lucas gets into trouble when he kills a patient - which is not true - he never makes a single medical mistake for, in the story, he is the perfect medical technician. It would have been a better read if Lucas had committed malpractice and showed his human side more. One other thing - Morton Thompson gets windy at times and there are lots of passages that you can just skim over without losing anything. The book is long enough as it is without this excess that doesn't add anything to the story. As it is, this was a best seller in the 1950s, and I would really like to see the movie version come out soon on DVD."},{"Title":"Ten Little Ladybugs (Includes Flying Ladybug Toy)","review":"my grandson loves it when I get this book out for him, as he is very intrigued with the disappearing ladybugs and loves to finger he button-like little plastic bodies. There are several editions of this book on amazon, the newer ones having many reviews. I got mine used, and I think it is this edition which I am describing. The outer part of the book--the front and back covers are like any hardback book, and the pages are made from doubled stiff paper-board-pretty sturdy, but not as thick as board book pages. The illustrations are colorful and silly. There are plenty of holes for the little one to stick his or her fingers into, and the lady bugs are very solid and firmly glued into place. This is great for a kiddo who loves to explore and touch everything. Mine loved this book when he was still a crawling infant and had little patience for most books.As he grows to be a pre-schooler, this book will serve to help him count. Backwards, I guess, because each page has yet another bug (really they are beetles, to be scientifically correct) disappearing with the appearance of each new animal. Hmmm, the frog, duck, turtle, fish, etc, would seem to be natural predators of the insects, but this apparently is too harsh of a lesson for such tender young babes because on the last page you can see all of the bugs afterall, uneaten, with the larger animals sweetly smiling at them. How nice.(Actually, ladybugs purportedly taste so nasty that they have few natural predators, so the book is not SO off-base. I don't really know that they make good playmates for other animals, though.

Even Edward, who does not remember the events of that day due to a drunken stupor, feels he must have murdered Diana. Since that fatal day, Edward has lived inside a bottle of Madeira. In spite of the rumors and his sordid lifestyle, mothers constantly toss their virgin daughters at him as he is still considered a prize catch.His sister Catherine constantly nags him to remarry and though he does not want a new wife, he heeds her pestering. He barters with a tavern owner, selling his horse in exchange for the man's niece. Edward figures that Jenny Wilton is a filthy, ugly, and moronic individual who would make the perfect spouse for someone like him. She could not demand things like love and family, and he would stop the parade of young ladies being thrown at him. However, underneath all that filth lurks a beautiful, intelligent, and determined young woman, who plans to become his fair lady and perhaps earn his love during the transformation.THE LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS is a marvelous retelling of George Bernard Shaw's PYGMALIAN, however, this being a historical romance the novel ends much happier for the lead protagonists than the play.

He appreciates the distinctiveness of different religions and how they're practiced, and considers how they can be accommodated in the workplace to everyone's advantage. His critique of the spirituality in the workplace movement is an important contribution; an overly generalized concept of spirituality can actually discourage individual religious freedom.

Lewis's argument that the Hudson river has been central to shaping American history and culture is compelling and evocatively set forth.My main criticism is the lack of visual accompaniment. This river has inspired extraordinary maps, documents, photographs, and paintings - a whole \\"school\\" of art for goodness sake - giving us just handful of postage stamp black and white reproductions in the book is a missed opportunity.

Lewis takes us through a series of vignettes that tell the history of the changes to the river. It was first to be the way in which trappers and traders were able to get into the interior of the continent for furs. Later it became the source of bringing lumber down to the mills. It was a major battlefield during the Revolution and by protecting it we were able to keep the British from splitting the colonies in two.With the building of the Erie Canal it became the conduit to and from the Great Lakes region for raw materials and finished products. The steamboat and railway made the whole area of the hudson river valley available for settlement and the burgeoning of industry along it's shore. Unlike most east coast rivers, it was navigable for hundreds of miles; with great natural resources of streams for mills, wood for charcoal, deposits of clay it became a major industrial area in the nineteenth century (and a major source of pollution).By the early twentieth century, the river was a polluted nightmare, with large areas unusable and without fish. The river had been polluted with PCB's and the discharge of raw sewage from many of the surrounding towns and cities. In the 1960's when the electric supplier wanted to build a retaining pond for eight billion gallons of water and destroy half of Storm King mountain, people finally began to take notice. The Hudson was the first big victory for the forces of environmental protection that would lead to the creation of the \\"Superfund\\".Today the water is cleaner than its' been in a century and can be looked at as an example of how man and nature can live in harmony again."},{"Title":"The Hudson: A History","review":"Every student remembers the famous sale of Manhattan Island by the Indians to the Dutch for a few dollars worth of trinkets, but what you may not recall is the native Indians lived in an expanse of territory that strected throughout the Northeast and to them, it was amazing that anyone would pay for one small island. They may have gotten the better deal at the time.The booked is filled with fascinating pieces of history and you will soon learn that the Hudson River is linked to the very foundations of our country.

Trapped in the ultra-sleazoid world of eighties rock, the former Zodiac Mindwarp embarks on a rampage of misogyny, self-destruction, alcohol, drugs, hardcore pronography and more. What saves the book is that it's not boastful at all - Manning's self-disgust and self-loathing overides all the evil things he has done and he even emerges as being charming. Quite bizarre all in all, a book that should turn your stomach but ends up being too compelling to put down. It's illustrated by the author too, which is a treat."},{"Title":"Crucify Me Again","review":"Mark Manning, aka the legendary Zodiac Mindwarp, rock god and idol to millions (well, at least a few hundred) shares with us his skewed memoires in this fine tome. Is it fact? Is it fiction? Does it matter?

Is the road to Hell truly paved with good intentions? Will the world really end not with a bang, but with a whimper? Ms. Spiller offers her answer to all of these questions in her dark and poetic look into the end of mankind.The narrator, my personal favorite aspect of the book, is a mysterious omnicient poet, who speaks directly to the reader much like the Muses in an ancient tragedy. The narrator looks back on the events of the book some time after The End has occurred. At the opening and closing of each chapter, the narrator offers insight on the characters, pointing out their flaws, their decisions, and the inconcievable consequences of each.The story shows a how one choice can begin a downward spiral of despair and hopelessness. It begins when one young man decides he must follow in his militaristic father's footsteps in a misguided decision to join the Marines. His actions cause a chain reaction of unimaginable consequences, ironically weighted by good intentions. The characters only want to help, or protect the people around them, but as Ms. Spiller explains, it is not *what we want* that matters in life, because it doesn't change the reality of what *is* and what *will be.*The book is full of ironies and symbols. The story of The End takes place over the course of seven days, an ironic paralell of The Creation. Ms. Spiller's concept of Hell is portrayed as a shattered and broken world, yet shockingly similar to the world around us in the present day. The End of the World, we find, is not caused by a nuclear holocaust, or global warming, or an incurable disease; but rather the simple but deadly combination of good intentions, and misguided decisions.The concept and the story are excellent. My only gripe is the editing job. There are a few obvious language and gramattical errors scattered throughout the pages, but not so much as to disrupt the continuity of the insightful and hypnotic story. This book is a quick read, but it will make a lasting impression. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Seattle Green","review":"Living near Seattle animates the book for me with its historic references. The ever-present battle between \\"progress and development\\" and preservation of some of the green, wild spaces for our sanity, resounds to this day. This is an epic story and probably could easily have been twice as long in length and kept my interest. It is enjoyable to read about strong-willed, determined women, especially back in those days, when women were supposed to marry well, have children, keep house and keep their noses out of \\"men's business\\". Not a comment to male-bash, simply nice to read about women who influenced the development of the Emerald City of today, i.e. think Thea Foss and the dynasty she started. An enjoyable read - I would recommend it to anyone visiting our fair city of Seattle or simply wanting to know a bit more about its history, albeit in a novel format."},{"Title":"Seattle Green","review":"What a lucky find, and one I would have missed but for the fact that the sales clerk pulled the wrong book, had to go back for the right one and I was perusing the closest shelf (travel) and found this little gem in the wrong place...Seattle Green is a multi-generational tale of three women, beginning in 1866 and ends in 1962. When she turns fifteen, Maddy finds herself receiving some very unwelcome attention from her step-father, and with her mother's health failing she doesn't have many options and signs on as a Mercer Bride, a group of women recruited by Asa Mercer to sail to Seattle as brides.Sound rather similar to a certain television show in the 70's?\\"What he wanted was for her to look after the boy, and keep the house, and cook his meals, and warm his bed at night, and for all that he supposed she looked fit enough.\\"Maddy weds widower Abel Blanchard, but realizes too late she's married the wrong brother. Duty calls and she makes the best of it and she and Abel build a dynasty of land and wealth for future generations, despite the increasingly heated disputes with his younger brother over his prime piece of land called Caleb's Bluff (West Seattle).Maddy's youngest daughter Catherine is the next to stand guard over Caleb's Bluff, which does cause a wee bit of tension with her brothers who are bent on development and greater wealth. The Blanchard fortunes have their ups and downs along with the city as the impacts of the labor strikes, the threat of communism, World War I and the Great Depression forces change to the financial climate. Catherine's daughter Natalie is the focus of the latter third, as the Second World War rages and the city's financial landscape is changed once again - aviation. Natalie fights for her dream to be a photojournalist, but can she come home again and take up the battle to keep Caleb's Bluff unspoiled?I know I'm not doing the story justice with this recap, but I really don't want to ruin it by saying more. Probably my only real complaint is that it wasn't longer, at only 300 pages there wasn't room for as much character development as I like to see in a book. As much as this is a story about three strong-willed women, it is also about the land and the city and how it changes and grows - I especially loved the last part where we saw through Natalie's eyes how much it had changed after a long absence. As a lifelong resident of Seattle, I absolutely adored the historical references and characters and working them with the fictional Blanchard family, names that most residents now know as major streets through the downtown core. Nice to see Mr. Boeing and the airplane industry worked into this as well, about the only one missing was John W. Nordstrom and his shoe store at 4th and Pike, and of course the story ends much too soon to bring Mr. Gates into the storyline. Used copies are very reasonable at the moment, and I heartily recommend this for those interested in Seattle history."},{"Title":"Daily Guideposts, 2007","review":"Another significant year in my life and so I decided to purchase the Daily Guideposts fo 2007 and enjoy reading the significant days out of this book...it arrived on time and in good shape."},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"It was nice to read something that doesn't have me trying to skip over curse words two and three times a page! I consider the entire Georgia Trilogy worth reading. The Christian background is inspiring; plus, the novels were based on the life of a very real woman (supported by indicating places of burial and names of decendants in the Afterword of each book). The Christian theme and romanticized diction may seem boring to some, but read with an open mind and I'm sure everyone will find a point to enjoy."},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"This particular book is a little slow, but still romantic and based on a real personality which makes it worth a read -- when we read about a person depressed/self-absorbed today (the way they are dealing with losing nearly everyone in life in a short time span...and reality check -- some people do go through great periods of personal loss in their life) I don't think we'd be quite so judgemental as many folks in these reviews. It's important when reading historical fiction to keep a perspective for timeframe the book is taking place, life is not a bed roses and not everyone in a book/history is happy all the time. I find it refreshing to read truthful books, historically based and well researched -- while this one isn't Eugenia Price's best work, do yourself a favor and try the St Simon's Triology or the Fla triology -- all six well-written, historically based, well researched and well written."},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"If you've read more than a few Price books, it becomes visibly apparent here that she's losing her touch.

The St Simons Trilogy: Lighthouse, New Moon Rising, and The Beloved Invader; The Florida Trilogy: Maria, Don Juan McQueen, and Margaret's Story; and the first three of the Savannah Quartet: Savannah, To See Your Face Again, and Before the Darkness Falls (I can't personally recommend Stranger in Savannah, I didn't care for it).

I just really enjoyed reading about how these southern cities all came to be settled and history changed."},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"After reading the first two of this triligy, I was mildly looking forward to this book. Boy was I disappointed! This was a terrible book. Not only was it very very boring. But Anne was very self centered, pestering and depending on her very very elderly and dying father until he died. She really needed help- running around at night screaming for her dead husband, while here young and terrified kids looked on. It also seemed like everyone in the book died, or almost died. Anne's husband, sister, mother, father, brother and father-in-law, daughter, only son, and best friend, are all killed off. There's barely anyone left but Anne, and her daughter Pete, who almost marries a drunk, but at the pre-wedding reception dumps him, and Anne's bossy maid eve are left. They all buy a white house and live in it. that's about all to this book. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. If you have- I'm sorry!!"},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"Can't believe I waded through all three of these Georgia trilogy books. The main character, Anne Couper Fraser,is about 18 when the first book begins, and is emotionally 18 when the third book ends in her late 60's. She is one of the most selfish characters I've ever encountered and I certainly hope this woman was not that way in real life. No matter what happens to anyone in these books, her first reaction is what effect it will have on her. This is my first exposure to Eugenia Price and I believe her writing style is sophomoric. Could people have really talked that way to each other? (Sugar-y sweet). In addition the author is VERY repetitive. Each book could have easily been 100+ pages less. What could have been a very interesting account of real people in one of my favorite historical eras was a total waste of time."},{"Title":"Beauty from Ashes","review":"I love books about the old south but I couldn't even finish this book.

However, I was a little shy of having a real person teach me (possibly because of my race) so I bought a book called, &quot;Swimming Basics&quot;. This novel taught me the simple facts about how to stay afloat and how to move your arms and legs in sequence so you can swim through the water. Since the novel was written by the excellent swim coach of Princeton University, I felt reading the book gave me enough confidence to jump in the water. So, at the next swim party I was invited to, I went off the diving board, sunk to the bottom, and had to be saved by the lifeguard. I found out that swimming was, in fact, not so basic and that certain people, like me, should never swim. My brother Casey tried to read the book and then swim but he was unfortunate and drowned. However, if you don't have a learning disability like myself, then &quot;swimming basics&quot; is an excellent book to get you started swimming."},{"Title":"Swimming basics","review":"I TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE COVER ON THIS BOOK, AND I KNEW HOW TO SWIM LIKE A SEA URCHIN!HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"},{"Title":"Swimming basics","review":"I TOOK ONE LOOK AT THIS BOOKS COVER, AND I KNEW HOW TO SWIM!HIGHLY RECCOMENDED"},{"Title":"The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: An Insider's Perspective","review":"The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) has had a long and interesting history. It was painstakingly negeotiated over a period of many years and signed ten years ago. Then a whole series of countries: China, India, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea and the United States refused to ratify it. At the same time, they announced that they would abide with the main provisions of the treaty.It's also interesting that the treaty doesn't ban the bomb itself, it only bans the testing of nuclear devices. That's not exactly the same thing, but almost. If you built a bomb, you would never be certain that it wouldn't fizzle when you tried to use it for real, so you'd want to test it. Likewise the technology of bomb making advances and this too needs testing.This book is a general overview of the treaty, how it was negeotiated, and what's been happening towards ratification. It also includes a copy of the treaty.It's strange that a majority of the world's countries, a majority of the world's people want the treaty to be in place, but it appears now that there is little chance of it being passed. This is a very interesting book as it gives a good overview of how such treaties are negeotiated at a world wide level."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"Well, sure, it's good. Wurman did come up with the term Information Architecture (as he reminds us), and has some good insightful stuff to say about it. Too bad that much of this book is pretty much the same kinds of information that you find on the web about IA: Mark Hurst and Nathan Shedroff have pieces nearly identical to stuff on their sites, and there are copious quotations from familiar online voices and sources. A chapter about online commerce as &quot;conversation&quot; is derived pretty much wholesale from the Cluetrain Manifesto. In the end, it all pretty much boils down to listen to your customers, take some risks, ask the right questions.Some of Wurman's opinions sound a little disingenuous in light of his own online work: a chapter which contains the standard complaints about high-bandwidth sites that don't offer useful information (useless plug-ins, over-reliance on graphics instead of text, etc) also points us to Wurman's Understanding USA web site, which starts with a Flash intro animation, is built almost solely from graphics, and even uses a Java applet in its Site Map.It's too bad, but this really comes across as an entry-level text about presenting information in multiple contexts, including online. There's more about management style than I'd care for, and less about what kinds of visual presentations support what kinds of information. It's admirably up-to-date: it's impressive that he managed to include the Florida ballot in a book printed in November 2000, for example.Finally, I could have done without the frequent and lengthy references to TED, Wurman's own annual conference of designers, businesspeople, and entertainers. The thing sounds like fun, but in the context of the book, the relevance is rarely clear."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"I am taking the unusual step of rating this book &quot;1 star&quot; to express my extremely high level of dissatisfaction at its quality and usefullness. There is no question that Richard Saul Wurman is a highly gifted individual, and his ACCESS books are fabulous. But this poorly-edited, disorganized book fails to capture or convey any of the insights that went into that or other successful Wurman projects.My guess is that this project was conceived as a quickie update to the original Information Anxiety to take advantage of Internet mania, and as such much of the work was delegated to others, but without sufficient review and editing. (There are too many editing mistakes to list here, but suffice it to say that probably few books have a misspelling in the Table Of Contents as this one does -- &quot;Informatgion&quot; instead of &quot;Information&quot;.)RSW tells us that it's important to always start off with what the question is. Problem is, he doesn't follow his own advice in that book. He careens uncontrollably from gushy predictions about the future, to cataclysmic warnings of information deluge, to superficial suggestions on software and web design, to facile pop management advice, The only thread connecting all these disjointed pieces is that he strictly limits himself to talking about how important something or other is, without ever giving specific advice about how to approach it.I am personally interested in the field of localization and globalization. So naturally I was curious as to what insight RSW brought to this area. What I found was a single, lonely page on the topic, with a few lines of simplistic patter, and a strange, unexplained diagram of various fountain pens with country names associated with each.I am also interested in the combination of text and graphics to present information and in fact bought this book thinking it might have some insights in that regards. So I was quite happy to see in the Table of Contents a section Design in the Digital Age, summarized as &quot;In this Digital Age we need to focus on the connections among all design elements: medium, words, pictures, and sound.&quot; Alas, true to form, all the section in question does is repeat that we need to focus on this, with no clue as how we might actually do that, nor a single example in sight. To get an idea of the poor editing quality of this book, consider the following paragraph from this section:&quot;Where words meet pictures meet sound creates understanding. Are you a value-based organization? A service-based organization? A quality-based organization? Are you all three? We test communication by conveying a message and having the recipient understand it, be interested in it, and remember it. Any other measure is unimportant and invalid.&quot; Does anyone else wonder how the stuff about organizations fits in here? It's just random cut-and-paste content that accidentally found its way here, never to receive the benefit of the editor's pen. Signs of rampant cut-and-pasting abound throughout the book.Although not really the fault of the author(s), the book is also seriously dated, having come out while there was still some degree of dot-com mania going on (although the peak was passed). So you can read this book on sort of an archaeological level, to recall all the bizarre things people were saying back in those heady days. Internet refrigerators, anyone?I probably don't need to summarize; let me simply say you are best off spending your time and money on virtually any book on this topic besides this one."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"The basic theme of this book reinforces my long-held belief that the next killer app in computing will be some new way to visually display relationships between information. A new discipline is also going to spring up and those good at it will be in great demand. That new area of study will be a knowledge distiller, someone expert in taking the enormous amount of information about a topic and reducing it down to a base form. We see the initial steps in this trend with the extraordinary success of the \\". . For Dummies\\" series of books. Their appeal is based on the basic formula of making things as simple as possible but no simpler.As Wurman points out, while there is an information explosion, the real problem is a malinformation (my term) explosion. In other words, information that does not inform. This is not just a reference to that which is inaccurate, but information that is correct but so malformed or obscure to be misleading. He also argues that a critical rethinking needs to be done concerning how we learn. The premise is that the rewards for asking the right questions need to be improved rather than the continued emphasis on answering questions. We also need to rediscover much of our inner child.At some point in our lives, we \\"mature\\" to the state where we will do almost anything to avoid embarrassment. This trait leads us to ignore inconsistencies and sit in silence when we don't understand. The childlike innocence that causes us to ask \\"obvious\\" questions goes away, replaced by fear of failure, which leads to an aversion to risk. Without the willingness to take a chance, many new things are not attempted, which limits the options for us all.This is a book that you must think deeply about. The world is changing rapidly, and the most successful people will be those who know how to cull knowledge down to the true essentials. There are an enormous number of ideas in the book that can be used to assist this process. If you value the future and want to have a significant part in creating it, then you should read this book. Proper implementation of some of the ideas presented here will change the way we do things in the future."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"I read Wurman's first Info. Anxiety years ago and hungrily gobbled up the great reviews of this sequel. The book, however, is a crashing disappointment. While Wurman evinces the appreciation for the obvious that makes all high-priced consultants worth their fees, he hasn't stretched himself with this work.Wurman offers nothing new either to expand upon or address his theories of Information Anxiety. Strangely, I have found this book to be all but unreadable except in very short bursts. The marginalia are rarely illuminating, occasionally thought-provoking, and frequently distracting. Even the book's size, weight, and the design of it's massive-flapped cover make it difficult to handle -- issues which one would think Wurman would have addressed.This guy's past his prime."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"I was about to give book two stars. As several reviewers have pointed out, IA2 wanders off into superficial discussions of self-help and managerial principles, and is full of self-promotion from cover to cover (literally). You expect a conference registration card each time you turn a page.But just as RSW must have been trembling in his black turtleneck with the prospect of receiving such a low rating on Amazon, I realized that it is precisely his ego that made the experience great. The undiluted point of view stemming from genuine interests, with ample random and not-so-random diversions, raises enough questions and opens enough doors to be more than worth the baggage.The book is like one of those flights where you skip ordering cocktails until you pass out, because you have been seated next to someone interesting -- it requires a bit more effort, but is ultimately more rewarding too. So four it is."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"If you want a kind of phone book full of thoughts and grousing and preaching on information and how to handle it, \\"Information Anxiety\\" is for you. But don't expect something you can actually \\"read like a book.\\" A mishmash indeed, and disappointing. Wurman seems to project his own information anxiety onto the reader, assuming the reader suffers from it, when that may or may not be the case. I personally have no trouble passing up reading newspapers, magazines, websites, etc. I read what I want or need to read. If I don't read everything that I could possibly read, so what. Life goes on, and has other sources of fulfillment. In fact, maybe people like me are just not in his intended audience. I can see how his books might be valuable as a source of ideas for improving various communications. But, *very* ironically, the format he uses screws up what could have been much more useful material if it were organized better, and streamlined, and easier on the eyes. For the life of me, I don't understand why someone who wants to reduce information anxiety would put non-linear information (e.g., quotes) in the margins, so the reader doesn't know what to read first, and may easily lose his or her place. It's like he throws information at you compulsively and without restraint while telling you about the woes of being deluged with information.

Excess visual noise is a major cause of Information Anxiety. Its a trait so endemic in websites, tax forms, technical manuals and... now this book from Wurman. Its such an anti-thesis to good information design.And then there's the material itself. A convoluted, pastiche of personal anecdotes, home remedies for organizational management, random musings and dazed observations on the subject.If you are genuinely interested in addressing the problem of Information Anxiety, this book will NOT provide with you with meaningful insights and solutions."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"If you or someone you know CARES about the issue of communication, this book is a must read.

Wurman dares to stand up and point out the differences between &quot;data&quot; and &quot;information&quot;. The way the text of this book is formatted even speaks volumes. He shows us how to do more with less and jump over hurdles that bar us from understanding"},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"This is a substantially revised and updated version of a book first published in 1989. In fact, it has been 26 years since Wurman formulated his concept of &quot;information architecture.&quot; The primary focus in this version, however, is the same: what amounts to the equivalent of ADD at a time when &quot;information overload&quot; continues to create problems with the recognition, differentiation, digestion, and application of data. (Davenport and Beck also have much of great value to say about this phenomenon in their new book, The Attention Economy.) As Wurman explains, he offers &quot;new maps for navigating through a stream of bytes that leaves us inundated with data but starved for tools &amp; patterns that give them meaning.&quot; He asserts that there has not been an &quot;information explosion&quot;; rather, an explosion of &quot;non-information&quot; or data that simply do not inform. What to do? Within 17 separate but interdependent chapters, Wurman suggests dozens of strategies and tactics which are guided by &quot;new maps&quot; and implemented with new &quot;tools&quot; inorder to organize data in new &quot;patterns.&quot; The result is an eloquent as well as insightful &quot;manifesto&quot; for the 21st century.Here is a consolidation of Wurman's key points in the first chapter: &quot;We live in an age of alsos, adapting to alternatives. because we have greater access to information, many of us have become more involved in researching, and making our own decisions, rather than relying on experts. The opportunity is that there is so much information, the catastrophe is that 99% of it isn't meaningful or understandable. We need to rethink how we present information because the information appetites of people are much more refined. Success in our connected world requires that we isolate the specific information we need and get it to those we work with. If information is the product of the Digital Age, then the Internet is the transportation vehicle. That means more misinformation. The sheer volume of available information and the manner in which it is often delivered render much of it useless to us. The best teachers give us permission to get in touch with ourselves and become more of us. Everyone needs a personal measure to distinguish useful information from raw data. To entertain the radical idea that understanding might involve accepting chaos threatens the foundations of our existence.&quot; Wurman and his associates explore and develop other equally important ideas in each of the other 16 chapters. By indulging their interests throughout their own lives, &quot;and perhaps because rather than despite many failures&quot;, they have been able to design their lives. They invite their reader to become engaged, not merely involved, in the same perilous but ultimately fulfilling process. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Davenport and Beck's new book (identified earlier) as well as Borgmann's Holding On to Reality, Drexler's Engines of Invention, Hamel's Leading the Revolution, Locke et al's The Cluetrain Manifesto, and Nielsen's Designing Web Usability. From my perspective, the new century is rapidly becoming what could be characterized as a new &quot;Renaissance&quot; or (if you prefer) &quot;Enlightenment&quot; which these and other contemporary thinkers are now in the process of establishing."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"Some readers may not understand that this was the FIRST book that gave those of us with information architecture 'leanings' evidence to support our posture. While Lou and Peter's book is always referred to as a 'primer' for the field of Information Architecture that evolved out of the internet boom, there are key concepts in Richard's book that are imperative for 'thinking'.I recall a review of his first publication where the reader lamented that Richard told a great story but gave no concrete examples of what he was talking about. I was screaming mentally, &quot;But his entire book is a living example of his concepts.&quot; I kept writing his office, begging them to issue a reprint because I had already lost 2 copies of the first edition book and feared loaning out the last one I had scrounged up. That copy is my classic...whenever I have time I run through the highlights and notes I have throughout the book. I will often find concepts that I consider part of my core beliefs and am reminded where I originally adopted them from.As for one of the recent reviews 'dissing' this book, making reference to Nathan Shedroff's writings, perhaps the contributor didn't realize where Nathan, who used to work &quot;for&quot; Richard, originally got his endoctrination!"},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"This review is mostly in relation to the 1989 edition, but also this one too.I don't know any easier way of saying this but this book is horrible. The page layouts are brutal: thick black quotes in the gutters that distract away from the main body text. And the actual book content? Terrible. Just a bunch of philosophical ramblings intertwined with way too many quotes. It's tea room talk, and barely that.After reading through this book, I feel like I just finished listening to a 90 year old British Philosophy teacher run on about some lesson in life.Paragraph after paragraph of the same old garbage (paraphrasing): \\"There's too much data, and not enough knowledge. Information isn't knowledge unless the data is turned into something meaningful.\\" On and on about the same stuff. People don't want to read stuff that makes you feel like you're being spoon fed lessons in life. They want to read inspiring stories that engage, packed with up-to-the-minute research. This is written in a very dated fashion where the author pontificates assuming the reader has no knowledge. Well, the reader has a lot of knowledge in today's information age, and even in the late 80s... the audience in relation to information age stuff must have been informed.My advice to authors today. Assume the reader knows almost everything, and challenge yourself to tell him something... he... doesn't... know.It's literally insulting reading this stuff when you feel like the author assumes you know nothing. It's old school.Richard Wurman, the author of this book, supposedly founded TED, what's now famous for TED Talks.

I have since then become more fascinated by the subject & have read widely on it. A few good books come to mind. \`Information Anxiety' is just one of them.I have read \`Information Anxiety' in the late eighties, just before the internet era. I went on to read the follow-up edition, \`Information Anxiety 2', about a decade later. The latter edition captured the impact & ramifications of the internet, desktop computing & advances in digital technology. Personally, I still think the first book is a comparatively much better book. Although I have also read the author's \`Follow the Yellow Brick Road' as well as \`Information Architects', I still like his \`Information Anxiety' very much.From my personal perspective, I reckon \`Information Anxiety', although intended as an exposition on information anxiety, covered a relatively broad spectrum particularly in terms of critical lessons: learning, understanding, creativity, problem solving, questioning, information processing, information design, and stress & anxiety management. As a matter of fact, an adequate understanding of each of these aspects will readily help one to deal with the complexities of life in the information age. Putting them together, they generally reflect the principal message of the book.The author defined \`information anxiety' as a condition \\"produced by the ever widening gap between what we understand & what we think we should understand. It is the black hole between data & knowledge, & it happens when information doesn't tell us what we want or need to know.\\"His definition did not emphasise \`information overload' as a cause of \`information anxiety' but portions of his book did so. He cited several situations likely to induce \`information anxiety', including \\"not understanding information; feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information to be understood; not knowing if certain information exists; & not knowing where to find information.\\"For me, there had been many vital lessons from the book. I would like to say that two vital lessons, at the time when I had read it, had cast a very strong imprint in my mind, which subsequently became my guiding philosophy in helping kids & teens to succeed in school.One came from Chapter 8: \\"You only learn things relative to something you understand.\\" (This is sometimes known as Richard Saul Wurman's Law)The other: \\"Learning can be seen as the acquisition of information, but before it can take place, there must be interest; interest permeates all endeavours & precedes learning. In order to acquire & remember new knowledge, it must stimulate your curiosity in some way.\\"I had also enjoyed reading about the author's approach to problem solving:\\"Before any solution to any undertaking can be developed, a movement must begin to discover its beginning. Understanding the vein of the problem is the course to solving it. The best way to accomplish any endeavour is to determine its essential purpose, its most basic mission: What is the endeavour supposed to accomplish? What is the reason for embarking on it? This is where the solution lies.There are two parts to solving any problem:- What you want to accomplish;- How you want to do it;Even the most creative people attach issues by leaping over what they want to do & going on to how they will do it. They are many HOW's but only one WHAT.You must always ask the question \`WHAT IS...?' before you ask the question \`HOW TO...?\\"The author's personal comments about asking questions were revealing:\\"When you sell your expertise...you have limited repertoire. On the other hand, when you sell your ignorance, when you sell your desire to learn something, to create & explore & navigate paths to knowledge - when you sell your curiosity - you sell from a bucket that is infinitely deep, that represents an unlimited repertoire. My expertise has always been my ignorance - my admission & my acceptance of not knowing. My work comes from questions, not from answers!\\" This reminded me of the spiritual insights of Zen Master, Suzuki - Beginner's Mind vs Expert's Mind: \\"If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind, there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind, there are few.\\" I fully concur with this learning attitude.Lastly, the author outlined the following tell-tale signs of information anxiety?- chronically talking about not keeping up with what's going around you;- feeling guilty about that even higher stack of periodicals waiting to be read;- nodding your head knowingly when someone mentions a book, an artist, a news story that you have actually never heard of before;- refusing to buy a new appliance or piece of equipment just because you are afraid you won't be able to operate it;- giving time & attention to news that has no cultural, economic or scientific impact on your lifeThe author also warned that \`information anxiety' would limit people to being only seekers of knowledge because no time was left for them to be reflectors of knowledge. This is very true.At the time I had read this book, I had actually distilled & jotted down more than fifty useful & workable insights, some of which have already been revealed in this review. Many of the insights had already been assimilated into my life & my work.In my end analysis, \`Information Anxiety' had been a very stimulating book. The book is very easy to read as you can breeze straight through or peruse in random bites. Even the many marginal notes in the book are real gems on their own![Recommended readings: For professionals, 'Survive Information Overload: The 7 Best Ways to Manage Your Workload by Seeing the Big Picture', by Kathryn Alesandrini; for everyone, 'Surviving Information Overload: The Clear, Practical Guide to Help You Stay on top of What You Need to Know' by Kevin Miller, are definitely worth exploring!.]"},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"Ten years ago RSW said that data was the source of &quot;Information Anxiety&quot;; he went on to explain ways for people to put data into meaningful displays.

Only for this fact he already deserves 5 stars.For the title of this book he deserves another 5. The book is written in a very interesting way, it really reminds an information explosion. It is organized and chaotic at the same time, presenting opinions from different authors in the sidebars and reminding an interactive dialog.The subjects discussed are diverse and rich, including corporate behavior, information (organization, communications, usage, design, and importance), creativity, technology, and many more.It is an insightful and interesting book; I think it is underrated with 4 stars."},{"Title":"Information Anxiety","review":"This book is not like any other book I have ever purchased or read in my entire life. It does not follow the rules as one may put if for books, it bends them and even reinvents them.The book has lots of marginalia throughout it, little distractions appearing allover the book in the margins with lots of little bits of information related and sometimes not related to the bit you are reading in the book.Also it does not follow the normal format you find in a table of contents; but rather has the table contents set in a stylish setting with bits of text, comics, pictures and other bits from the chapter they are highlighting on the page.Once you get inside the book you have quite a read on your hand. With so many topics related to information this is clearly an overload. The book has so much information, and interesting additions, and theories on dissemination of information such as illustrating text in a 3-d space, it dismisses myths about the way information will be distributed in the future, and how people learn.The book also talks about how and why directions and information and projects can fail, how people plan there lives around a few major events, and mistakes made in the past. And lots of ideas, concepts and pictures appear in the book.The book is just such a good read with so much information, and a good format and its just absolutely amazing and is by far one of my newest favorite books.There is just no way to explain it (hence such short review).

It is \\"real-world\\" philosophy set in a business context.Wurman demonstrates that not only have times in fact changed, but we can change with them and even flourish. Rather than a threat to our old, familiar \\"modern\\" way of thinking, the new \\"Information Age\\" can be an exciting opportunity for creativity, relationship, and learning.This book is an example of how we CAN get over our anxieties or doubts about postmodernism and start engaging the world and people around us in a more meaningful way.And one more thing,... as a person working in Information Technology, I wish more people in IT would read this book.

She's fondly ranking right under the middle of the pack, though.However, I am so starved for golden/silver age comic reprints, I decided to give this a shot! And you know what? I'm very glad I did! BLACK CANARY'S earlier adventures are kind of cool. Also, kind of weird, in a way, because I'm so used to the modern version of BLACK CANARY and here, within these archives' pages, she doesn't have her trademarked \\"CANARY SCREAM\\" yet!I also had no idea that BLACK CANARY got her start as a \\"semi-villain\\" and was using her sex appeal to play the JUSTICE SOCIETY'S most goofiest and most unnecessary member,JOHNNY THUNDER, for a \\"fall guy\\" sap. I wished the writers back then would have turned the romantic heat way up between Johnny Thunder and the Black Canary!(For one thing,it would have made, the painfully corny and chronically lame, Johnny Thunder way more interesting!..Lol..Lol..)And speaking of love interests, it's really funny watching Larry Lance, a crack private detective who's head over heels in love with our heroine, but be just so clueless and so unable to figure out that DINAH DRAKE is really the BLACK CANARY underneath a blond\`wig.What's also funny is that no villain ever slaps or even punches BLACK CANARY in a fight within this volume. They bad guys always shoot at her and miss. Yet, I count at least eight times in this book where BLACK CANARY is hit on the back of her head with a gun or a fist and is knocked out cold. ..LOL..LOL...You'd think that after two blows to the head by men twice her size, that BLACK CANARY would start to check behind her self every three seconds...LOL..LOL..However, where the BLACK CANARY really sizzles is when legendary comic artist and illustrator, ALEX TOTH, draws BLACK CANARY! Man, has she never looked hotter or sexier under TOTH'S pencils!Still, all in all! This is a very cool collection of classic BLACK CANARY stories and adventures spanning various decades.Just one thing, though....This volume one was printed in 2001.

Then she bacame a hero fighting, early on, with Johnny Thunder (Who should get his own volume to. Email DC and say you want one!) Canary then went on to do a solo gig in her own feature in Flash comics.

The Judo-chopping , Ju-Jitsu-tossing crime fighter was always into heavy conflict with the criminal underworld and was, in many ways, a lineal ancestor to the tough-as-nails Cathy Gale and Emma Peel of t.v.'s \\"Avengers\\" years later. She also shared some commonground with t.v. detective Joe Mannix (Mike Connors) and 50's pinup legend Bettie Page. Like Mannix she was always getting bonked on the head by the baddies, and, like Bettie, she was always getting tied up.Somehow, over the years, the Canary always managed to get herself un-tied in time to save her life and catch the crooks, and, like Mannix himself, fortunately all that head-conking never resulted in permanent brain damage. so our heroine never got \\"punchy\\" on us.These charming, exciting \\"old school\\" comics stories are lots of fun and showcase some fine artwork by some of those artist icons that are well remembered by long-time fans (certainly by \\"boomers\\"). A great deal of the work is by Carmine Infantino, who later would become a DC \\"staple\\" with his work in the Silver Age \\"Flash\\", as well as \\"Adam Strange\\" in Mystery In Space , the recurring \\"Space Museum\\" stories in Strange Adventures, and the \\"New Look\\" 60s \\"Batman\\".Also putting in an appearance is Murphy Anderson, a very gifted artist in his own right, as well as Infantino's best Silver Age inker (apart from Infantino himself).A special treat at the end of the volume is a two-part adventure illustrated by the late, legendary Alex Toth (world renowned for his late 50s-early 60s \\"Zorro\\" work for Dell), arguably the best graphics design/layout artist in comics. Toth's bold blacks and panel designs are always a blast and he is really clicking on this particular contribution.Black Canary Archives, Vol. I ....get one.

It's all good stuff; not too substantive on the writing side of things, but nice light fun nonetheless. The best part is Carmine Infantino's artwork, which was highly imitative of newspaper cartoonist Milton Canniff, with a rugged yet stylish flair -- very different from the fluid, slapdash style Infantino adopted later in the '50s and '60s. I really enjoyed reading this one, and found it less repetitive than other volumes in the series... It's also nice to see one of the lesser, neglected Golden Age characters finally get their due, particularly one as foxy as the Lana Turner-ish Black Canary...

Do the opposite of that. Forget I even mentioned it. The point I was trying to get across is that these stories remind me of the old black and white b mysteries from the 30's and 40's, movies like The bat and the Crime Doctor and Bulldog Drummond series, or any of the Monogram or republic mysteries. Like the best of those movies, the stories in this volume are atmospheric, fun and feature some snappy writing.To the world at large Dinah Drake is a mild mannered florist, but we the reader also know her as her crime-clouting alter ego, Black Canary!! The Canary started out as a jiu-jitsu expert and master thief who stole only from other thieves and who eventually dropped the whole thieving bit and concentrated on clouting crime. She had a few partners along the way, including Johnny Thunder and his Thunderbolt, Starman, and private detective Larry Lance, with whom she traded quips and eventually marriage vows.The Black Canary is tough savvy and sexy and so are most of her stories. I'd put this volume right up there with the Golden Age Sandman, the Specter and Dr. Fate as some of the best of the DC Archives.Here's a peek at some of the stories inside:Flash Comics #86-The Black Canary!! -In the Canary's origin she sweet talks Johnny Thunder into helping her pilfer a valuable jewel from criminal \\"Socks\\" Slade. Just what kind of criminal is known for his socks anyway?Flash Comics #88-The Map that wasn't There! -The Black canary slips an actual black canary along with a map showing the location of some hidden loot, into a pie and mails it to Johnny Thunder in case blackguards capture her. She does get captured and now her life is in Johnny's hands. Wuh-oh!!Flash Comics #92-The Huntress of the Highway! -This is the first appearance of Dinah Drake's flower shop and private detective Larry Lance. The Canary starts out trying to K.O. a gang of truck hijackers and ends up tied to a log, drifting over a waterfall!Comics Cavalcade #25-Tune of Terror! -A mailbox, a fire hydrant and a street lamp attack a young man. Black Canary agrees to help him and ends up tied to something again, this time a giant spinning phonograph record! She foils the bad guys with her jiu-jitsu and her spell-casting abilities. Spell-casting abilities? Maybe the writer confused her with Zatanna?Flash Comics #93-Mystery of the Crimson Crystal-Dinah teams up with Larry Lance to show up a sneaky swami who is bilking rich folks out of millions. Will B.C. and L.L survive when the swami decrees they serve as a blood sacrifice? Are you new?Flash Comics #94-Corsage of Death!! -There's some great banter here between Larry Lance and Dinah Drake. L.L. and the Canary tackle some armored car bandits who use something called a Photon Smasher to crack open the armored cars they rob. But what will happen to Black Canary when the Photon Smasher is aimed at her?Flash Comics #95-An Orchid for the Deceased-Black Canary fights a death match with a murderous imposter high atop the titular gargoyle at Gargoyle Head Lake. Plus more priceless badinage between Dinah and Larry!Flash Comics #98-The Byzantine Black-Black Canary faces blazing .45's, death traps and a wise-acre partner as she tries to recover a rare and priceless stamp.Flash Comics #103-The Mystery on Ice! -Larry and Dinah go on an ice skating date in hopes of finding romance and as usual wind up caught in an insidious death trap instead. Won't these crazy kids ever get together?Adventure Comics #418-The Canary and the Cat!! -It's the ultimate bombshell throw down, Black Canary vs. Catwoman! Chick fight!! Chick Fight!!!Robert Kanigher, Carmine Infantino, Denny O'Neil, Gardner Fox, Alex Toth and Joe Giella among others handle the creative chores.Side note: If you're a Wildcat fan like I am, you'll want to know that there's a great sequence in a later story where Wildcat boxes a polar bear and a kangaroo (separately, of course)."},{"Title":"The Black Canary Archives, Vol. 1 (DC Archive Editions)","review":"Another one of DC Comics' excellent Archive editions, this volume centers on the Golden Age female superhero, the one and only Black Canary( the one that appears in the Birds of Prey comic book is her daughter, and is thus Black Canary II).

I need a list for a head count, to make sure we didn't miss anyone and to keep track of all of the correspondence (read: invitations, thank you's, etc.).

What I found most annoying is how outdated the lists seem, though. This is especially true in the Photography/Videography category. Most photographers today are strictly photojournalistic in nature and do very few formal poses, if any. Furthermore, we are in the digital age! Dark rooms are practically a thing of the past; film is unheard of, so lighting and imperfections can be proofed on the photographer's computer screen. And video tapes for the videography? Please. Here's a quote from page 117 of the book: \\"KEEP IN MIND...After you've received your wedding video, be sure to remove the appropriate tab at the edge of the cassette so that you don't accidentally tape over this special feature presentation.\\" Sorry, but you'll be dealing with a DVD these days.Truthfully, there are times when going through this book that it feels very 90s, and this includes the cover art as well as the contents. I truly would recommend either the author updating it or for customers to buy a more up-to-date planner.

Through this story they can see themselves, each other, and how they place in the history of this country. They also have read and expressed that it's truly the first book they have ever read, and wanted to read!!!! This is a story to be shared and read together and discussed, because IT MEANS BUSINESS. This is a story that must be understood. People must be understood! It teaches how when we look at our personal circumstances, and then have the opportunity to look outside our life,&quot;hood&quot;,and prison life, particularly through books, and then we can find our FREEDOM, our HOPE, our POSSIBILITIES, our ANSWERS, our WISDOM, OUR TRUE POWER IN UNITY. My students know that I care about them and demonstrate it by my fierce committment to AntiNiggerization. May the Youth of America read this book! May the people who work with Youth read this book! May the Prison Staff read this book! May our Spiritual Leaders and Activists read this book! May the High Schools and Colleges put this in their adopted book lists for VIOLENCE PREVENTION coursework and THE RESOURCE MANUAL for all students on how to help our youth coming up with the Community Work they can do to CHANGE our World for the better!!! And so May the Politicians read this book! May the Parents [who understandably worry about their childrens' safety and future] read this book. My students all know now that there are people all over this country changing things for the better, people just like them, and they have our support!!! My students are learning that the Womb is Sacred, we all as Equals are Sacred."},{"Title":"Convicted in the Womb","review":"Carl vividly describes his life beginning as a young child. The challenges he faced growing up in this society are dramatically expressed in the first paragraph of the book. This is clearly a story of hope and inspiration as it shows the struggles one endures in making positive changes in one's life. Carl shows how God worked in his life and how the impact of the Holy Spirit in one person's life can impact the world. Many inmates identify with Carl's life experiences and view him as a role model. Carl's story quickly invites the reader into his life and is difficult to put down until the last page is read."},{"Title":"Convicted in the Womb","review":"This is a well written biography which shows how one man can turn his life around with the help of a few concerned and dedicated individuals."},{"Title":"Convicted in the Womb","review":"Carl Upchurch and I were born into very different circumstances. Until I read this book, I'd never been able to understand. I'd never been able to understand how a young person, even one raised with poverty, drug abuse, crime, violence, & involved in gangs, could believe that a life of violence leading to an early death would be okay, even more noble than the lives many others live into old age. Upchurch's account reached me & gave me a significant enough mental shift in point-of-view that I experienced what was, for me, a huge expansion of the world view I carry around in my own head.In some way, this book also helped me understand the process of shifting one's understanding, if that makes any sense, and I'm much less likely to dismiss what I don't understand without first trying to find & use that same path through my mind that Upchurch enabled me to discover.Books and movies about people conquering horrific circumstances & finding private & public fulfillment is not a new or unique theme in fiction or non-fiction. One may strike a chord with one person, and another with another person. The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass stands out in my mind as the first to really snag me in so many ways. The themes of reading as a door, THE door, to the world, & the importance of ideas, education, wide intellectual exploration - Frederick Douglass and Carl Upchurch both valued all that & made use of it all in practical application to their lives & both felt compelled to reach out & share what they'd learned with others. Those lessons cross all lines of time & place, race, class and circumstance."},{"Title":"Convicted in the Womb","review":"Well written & well defined story documenting what life is really like for inner city person & how he changed for the better."},{"Title":"Convicted in the Womb","review":"I bought this for my son.

Grenoble and Lindsay J. Whaley, is an introduction to revitalizing smaller languages in danger of disappearing. The authors have firsthand experience with the Tungusic languages of Siberia and they refer to an enormous amount of literature.Grenoble and Whaley explore the whole range of language revitalization schemes through case studies, and they advocate a certain kind of approach. In my field, Finno-Ugrian linguistics, the Soviet Union's initial support of minority languages is seen as a positive thing, but the authors believe that this effort was doomed because it was instituted by the central government by fiat without adequate participation by locals. Successful revitalization, they argue, must come from the grassroots and be community-driven at every step of the way. There's also debate about the role of linguists, with some projects advocating that, as useful as linguists are for creating orthographies and grammars, they should not participate in the active teaching of the language.There's ample coverage of the legal challenges to language revitalization, which is the most dismal part of the book. In my own experience, I often feel that certain languages don't have a real shot at survival without some kind of revolutionary movement first, regardless of the enthusiasm of some of their speakers. Advice is given on teaching methods and the creation of orthographies, the updating of the lexicon for modern society, and dealing with skeptical members of the community or their neighbours.SAVING LANGUAGES feels somewhat lightweight. Perhaps a bit over 200 pages doesn't permit such substantial coverage and guidance. Nonetheless, it's an entertaining introduction to this field and its polemics, and the bibliography invites further reading."},{"Title":"The Whale (Ready-for-Chapters)","review":"Pandora the cat; Seabold the dog; and Whistler, Lila, and Tiny, the orphaned mice, make-up the wonderful, Lighthouse Family. Together they live amongst each other in an old Lighthouse on the water, where they help to direct ships. However, one day Whistler and Lila hear the cries of a whale, a baby beluga whale named Sebastian, to be exact. Soon they have found that poor Sebastian has lost his Mother, and doesn't know where to find her. It's now up to Whistler and Lila, with the help of the rest of the Lighthouse Family, and a cranky old cormorant named Huck, to find Sebastian's Mother, and bring mama and baby together once again.In this wonderful, adorable new series by Cynthia Rylant, we are introduced to various wonderful new animal characters, who are sure to rival those found in classics such as THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS. Each character is unique, and possesses his or her own quirks, yet they all share one thing in common, their love for each other, and caring nature.

Maxwell exceeds at conveying deep personal emotion, and this book is suffused with the joy he felt during his first few years with his otters Mij and Edal.Fans of this book should take pains to search for the two out-of-print sequels: &quot;The Rocks Remain&quot; and &quot;Raven, Seek Thy Brother&quot;. Neither is as joyful or cohesive as &quot;Ring&quot;, but you will indeed find out what the life of a reclusive-yet-famous nature writer can be like. I also highly recommend Maxwell's autobiography of his childhood, &quot;The House of Elrig&quot;."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Gavin Maxwell's Ring of Bright Water is a much-deserved classic. It tells the tale of the author's time on the coast of Scotland devoting the first half to his learning to live in this isolated paradise and the second half, slightly better, to his time consecutively with two otters (as well as other creatures, my favourite being the geese). As anyone who loves animals will know, tears will factor into this tale, but never at the expense of the joy and laughter. They are some very funny bits. It would almost be enough to get me to exhange my cats for otters (almost, but not quite enough). Some of the writing is a litte florid at times, particulary the brief section on killer whales, but, otherwise, this is an astounding and beautiful example of nature writing."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Maxwell's &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; is not a book about otters alone. It is the story of a man living near the Hebridies and taking up the life of a naturalist. He describes the sea and the land with equal relish. Those who read &quot;Ring of Bright Water&quot; for the otters alone may miss the haunting atmosphere of northern Scotland, and, having been there for some time, I can say that Maxwell recalls it rather well. As for the otters, they are endearing and facinating. However, as someone involved in animal handling and educational programs, I strongly urge the reader not to desire to have such an exotic pet. If one truly loves the wilds that Maxwell lovingly details, one would not subject a wild animal to such stresses, or introduce a non-native predator to such a rich and rare place."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Forever after you read A Ring of Bright Water, the beauty, wonder, and humor of this book will gently surface with a ring of bright ripples in the waters of you mind. I am never able to remember this book without simultaneously wanting to laugh and to cry-and always with a sense of awed wonder. This is the true story of Gavin's befriending of otters (or perhaps we should say of the otters' decision to befriend Gavin.) In one scene, on the first night Gavin has one of the otters in his home, the otter carefully watches Gavin get into bed and pull the covers to his chin. The otter then crawls in beside Gavin, lies on its back, and pulls the covers to its own chin. Other scenes describe Gavin's losing efforts to make certain parts of his cottage off limits to otters. Gavin never for the rest of his life produced prose that so translucently coveys the beauty of the waters around his cottage, or the sense of his own evolving life and emotions. Reading this book is giving a gift to yourself. It is one a dozen that I always look for used to give to friends."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Despite being a book written 40 years ago, the delightful stories are perfect to read over and over.

I've seen the movie version several times since, and just recently decided to re-read the book. I was not disappointed. It starts off kind of rocky, but once the otters enter Maxwell's life, it's pure magic. He's an incredibly good writer with the ability to make you \\"see\\" everything he describes.Staci Layne Wilson"},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"In Ring of Bright Water, a man discovers to his delight the endearing, playful, and intelligent nature of otters.The first third of the book traces his introduction to Camusfearna, an invented name for a real place on the Scottish coast. This part of the book drags a little if you're waiting impatiently to get to the otters, but there are some shining spots in which Maxwell describes life where the green hills and cascading falls meet a wind-swept sea; for instance, he describes in welcome detail how incomputable numbers of elvers (eels) struggle mightily up the burn (river) and falls near his remote country home, the eels facing stalwartly a long, difficult battle coming at the end of unending miles of swimming through hunted waters.The rest of the book brings a smile, because it recounts Maxwell's introduction to the antics and fascinating viewpoint of otters, whom he finds are &quot;extremely bad at doing nothing . . . (being) either asleep or entirely absorbed at play&quot;. The pages where the unprepared author learns just how raucous, intelligent, joyous, persistent, and dextrous otters can be, especially in situations requiring the author and his slithery new companion to be inconspicuous, are alone well worth the price of the book. This book should be on the reading list of any pet lover, especially those who love ferrets. There are a few places where we are sobered and saddened by the fragility of our loved ones in the face of unexpected danger. This book begs the question of whether it is correct to domesticate more wild animals, but does not address the question signficantly.The book seems a little incomplete in that it ends by the author simply ceasing to tell the story, which leaves one with a feeling of lack of resolution. One might like to know how the second half of Edal's life went, but then one might have to read of her end, and it might be better to end with the images of her playing good naturedly on the sofa by the fireplace."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This is one of those books that will stay in your mind long after you finish it. Maxwell was a masterful writer who penned in this book both a love song to Scotland and a primer on otters as pets. In one word, after you read this book, don't. Don't try to pin down an otter. Even if your home is on a craggy little island in the north of Scotland and surrounded by a ravine. Don't. Read the book and you'll see why not."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I read this book many years ago and felt I needed to read it again; I think this book has become a classic. This is the story of a man's love for his two otters, Mijbil and Edal plus all else in nature.I enjoyed the beginning descriptions of northwest Scotland. Mr Maxwell's land was located on the mainland but Gavin could view Skye and the Hebrides from his home. Camusfearna was the name he gave his house (not it's real name) and a little eden it was. It was surrounded by beautiful hills. In this place Gavin could live in nature which was his desire. He was wealthy so did not need to work. He could pursue his interests plus write. He was lucky that he could follow his dreams. This book is his most popular and his word pictures show readers much about this beautiful section of Scotland. His writings about the surrounding ocean and its occupants are good. Plus he also writes about seeing the northern lights and how he was affected by seeing the lights.When Gavin Maxwell was very young he enjoyed hunting, a sport I do not like because I like animals. He found a young wildcat and shot birds to feed this animal though he states he didn't like killing birds. He wanted to keep the cat alive. Possibly the cat could eat something different than birds. Dog feed perhaps. At one time Maxwell went with another man to kill foxes that were killing the other man's new born lambs. The two, plus the dogs, killed a whole fox family. Foxes, plus other preditors, also like to kill fawns.Mr. Maxwell lived in the cottage with his dog Jonny. Jonny was getting old, became sick, died. Gavin was lost without an animal. For some reason, he felt he should adopt an otter. He never wanted another dog. Jonny was special.Mr. Maxwell went to south Iraq to the Marsh Arabs where he was introduced to a tiny otter cub, Chahala. She died, but Maxwell felt he needed an otter. Then came Mijbil. And was Mijbil spoiled as was his other otter, Edal. Gavin carried Mijbil on a plane from Iraq and other areas to England. Both otters redecorated his home, but those two were his kids. There are pictures throughout the book, both otters are cute. Maxwell obtained a lemur, but a wild one, Gavin thought she wanted to kill him,she tried hard to. He had to get rid of that one. Otters made the best pets for Gavin Maxwell, but not for everyone. Many people feel otters should remain wild.My mother was born and grew up in Scotland and always loved her native land. My patenal grandmother was also born in Glasgow, Scotland but came to the United States as a baby. She remembered nothing about living there. My mother was born in part of Scotland which was called the gateway to the Highlands, close to Loch Lomond. I did appreciate this book with its vivid descriptions of the country and its animals."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I read this book years ago and have never forgotten it. When I started ordering books on Amazon this was one of the first. I am reading aloud to my husband and he is enjoying so much. I ordered one on tape for my son.

At first his voice seemed off-putting: upper-crust snob. But when, on page 4 he admits to once being an arrant snob, his admission won me over,and I fell hopelessly under his spell, madly in love with his otter, his puppy, and his passion for the environment including all the creatures within it, from eels to gulls. Too, I expanded my vocabulary with words like littoral, cygnet, meniscus, spate, and beyond. Finally, he had me laughing out loud when he described his Air France flight with a live otter in his carry-on. I thoroughly lapped up this book."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"I absolutely fell in love with Mij the Otter but how in the world can the writer say this is entertainment for children when the loveable otter gets killed by being hit over the head with a shovel!!

The first third is mostly dull description of a Scottish shore area. The rest, well, i\`m of two minds about that. I\`ve had multiple dogs for many years and could , myself, bear criticism for my former efforts at not well balancing their freedom and safety. That being the case I still have real problems with the way the author handled animals : he did not attend the death or funeral of his dog, did not give his first otter a funeral, was so impractical and for such an amount of time about the way he allowed Mig ( beloved 2nd otter ) to run wild that he caused his death despite several incidents that should have made him rethink what he was doing. Worse yet he took on more wild animals after Mij\`s death because he \\" had to have animals \\" which really trashed the memory of Mij ( whose body was not recovered ) in my opinion. More otters died before he acquired another and he even justified shooting wild birds to feed a baby wildcat ! I know the miserable fate of Edal ( 3rd otter ) he had at the end of ROBW and I\`m aware of the efforts he made to accomodate Mij , but he disappointed me. I\`m about to start the remainder of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Ring of Bright Water (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal \\"pet\\" trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild!"},{"Title":"Politics:The Basics","review":"It is a serious ouvrage on politics and its main aspects.

I wanted to read this because I had heard that Muir too felt the same that I feel of the glaciers. I was NOT disappointed! His trek to seek out the glaciers reminds me very much of how I would like to seek out each and every glacier. To me climbing the face of a glacier is just a dream, a dream that you can almost live out while reading this book. I felt like I was a part of the glacier crevices or part of the ice flow. I was traveling in the canoe right along with Muir. This was the first book of his that I read, and now I am hooked!!!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Travelling Alaska with John is to see, hear, feel, taste, smell, experience the response of a God-intoxicated man to almost unearthly splendor. Muir's passions were elemental: apprehending the Divine through an understanding of nature, and hence, the protection and preservation of this voice of the sublime.He travelled to Alaska five times over a 30 year period. This book, only completed a few years before his death, polishes the field notes of his earlier trips and offers almost unedited, his journals from the last journey. Muir's interests begin with geology, specifically how the U-shaped valleys of both Yosemite and the Alaskan fjord-land resulted from glacial actions. Beginning with ice, they include the land, the trees, the waters, the fish, the First Americans living in the harsh beautiful world, the scientists, the missionaries, transportation, food, and in a chapter that cries to be read aloud, Muir's experience of a sunrise like the eighth day of Creation and of the Northern Lights.One remembers vignettes of one's own travels. So vivid, so immediate are these stories that they become part of your own memories. Raining is it? Experience laying your already soggy sleeping bag down in a bog so wet you strip off and shiver your way through the night, then arise---not like new-made bread---but to wring the water from your clothes and bag and slog on. Thinking of what it would be like to walk across that glacier? Start out early, accompanied by a dog who had more loyalty than brains and got over jagged ice frise-de-cheval points, across crevasses, up treacherous slopes----to get to the other side, and then come back at night, having to encourage the now-alarmed dog to leap those widening chasms, risking your own neck to get the crittur home.Those going to Alaska could hardly have a better companion. The book is portable and a bargain. And those who travel widely through the frigates of books, like Emily, will find their world enlarged and enobled in the company of this good and brave man who did so much to preserve our wild, beautiful places."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"\\"Travels In Alaska\\" is, essentially, a diary which John Muir kept during his three visits to Southeastern Alaska from 1879-1890. In the course of his travels he describes the Indians, plants, wild life, mountains and glaciers. He is especially interested in his explorations of the glaciers. He provides the reader with an insight into pristine Alaska. His comments about retreating glaciers are of interest given the current claims of man-made global warming.The reader comes to respect Muir's love of nature and his bravery, as he paddles around ice bergs, camps on glaciers and enters the domains of bears and whales.The downside of this is that there is very little analysis beyond what he recorded at the time of his journeys. While his observations hold your interest, Muir's writing style adds little to the narrative. This book pales in comparison to Ranch Life & the Hunting Trail by his friend, Theodore Roosevelt (see my Amazon review).Overall I enjoyed \\"Travels In Alaska\\", but have read better nature books. Perhaps a reader more familiar with the Alaskan Panhandle or outdoor adventures would have a greater appreciation with this work."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Nature is a beautiful and highly complicated phenomena of this world. Many have sought to understand it and capture its essence in writing. The nature writings of John Muir succeed in capturing the beauty of nature as well as the scientific aspect. I have to be honest, I wasn't that enthused about reading a book about science. I expected Muir's book to be identical to a science textbook, definitely not my idea of enjoyment. However, his book was actually full of detailed descriptions and creative uses of similes, metaphors, and analogies. In fact, it completely changed my perception of a scientific novel.In his book, \\"Travels in Alaska\\", Muir brings alive the magnificence of the vast expanses of unexplored Alaskan territory. His prose reveals his enthusiasm for nature, and he weaves clear and distinct pictures through his words. Muir's writing is very personal. His favorable feelings toward the land are very apparent, and reading the book is like reading his diary or journal. He avoids using scientific jargon that would confuse and frustrate the average reader; his words are easily understood.Muir also uses very detailed descriptions throughout \\"Travels in Alaska\\". Although at times his painstaking description is a plus, at others, he seems to take it a little too far. Numerous times throughout the book, Muir spent a paragraph or two talking about something slightly insignificant. He would go off on a tangent of enthusiasm for something as simple as a sunrise or the rain. While his careful observances make the book enjoyable, the sometimes excessive detail tends to detract from the point he was trying to make. The description also reveals that his heart and soul was in his research; this became very evident upon reading the long and thoughtful descriptions.\\"Travels in Alaska\\" can be appreciated by a wide audience. Muir shines light upon the Alaskan territory, and he is detailed in his account of the many people he meets. Anyone could read the book and find enjoyment learning about Alaska when it was for the most part unsettled. Muir shares with the readers his keen insight upon the various Indian tribes that lived in Alaska. At one point in the book, he gives a very detailed description of one tribe's feasting and dancing. His observances capture exactly what he saw and the feelings these observances evoked in him.John Muir's writing is of high quality. He incorporates beautiful and creative similes, metaphors, and analogies. His prose is very poetic, which makes it an enjoyable read. For example, Muir says that \\"when we contemplate the world as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.\\" His work is also very organized. The book is divided into 3 sections, or parts of his trip, as well as separate chapters devoted to specific subjects. Muir spends one chapter describing his trip to Puget Sound, another on Wrangell Island, etc. The book follows a specific format that ensures that everything is easily followed and understood.Truthfully, I was impressed with the writing, and the fact that it was nothing like a textbook. It incorporated the literary aspect so well, that the book held my interest whereas a textbook would not have. I had the wrong impression of a scientific novel, and I urge anyone unfamiliar with the genre, to give \\"Travels in Alaska\\" a fair try. It may just change your mind about scientific writing."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I am enjoying reading all I can about Alaska lately and this one is just one to add to that list!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Having been to Yosemite multiple times, I was very interested in his book about Yosemite. He is an English teacher's dream, the way he expresses himself and the descriptions he uses to tell about his journeys. So, when we went to Alaska, I bought this book and couldn't put it down. I was never \\"bored or unhappy\\" with the story. I think Yosemite was one of John Muir's favorite places. I remember him saying, in this book about Alaska, that \\"someday I think of Alaska being a lot like The Yosemite as the glaciers have been melting for 200 years\\", and this was written in the 1800s. I think one of the other reviewers mentioned this also. So, what's global warming? Also he tells of how he feels when he sees the Northern Lights, as if the Savior was coming to earth. Many things impressed me about John Muir and the way he sees the earth and how he would protect it, without being preachy. I read some good reviews here and they touched my heart as I feel the same way as do they. Thank you for this opportunity to view my thoughts."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"John Muir's diaries and stories are enchanting - and especially welcome during my long, hot drives around Los Angeles this time of year! Just hearing narrator Lee Salibury talk about the glacier formations is refreshing - and the sound effects and music add so much to the ambience! The six hours of reading seem to FLY by, and make summer traffic bearable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"No doubt about it, John Muir was one of America's greatest citizens. He founded the Sierra Club and was instrumental in starting the ecological movement in the United States. In this book Muir recounts three journeys to Southeast Alaska that he took in the late 1800's. He writes better about glaciers than any writer who ever lived. There are flaws: Muir's attitudes about native peoples are simple-minded and ignorant, and his prose is sometimes dry and dull. Also, one cannot help but call Muir's credibility into question when he writes than he and his dog Stickeen walked fifteen miles across a crevasse-riddled glacier in three hours and then had nothing for dinner but a moldy cracker. But these are important records from a man who truly loved the natural world, and it's essential reading material for anyone traveling to Southeast Alaska or anyone wishing to learn more about glaciers."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"If you're new to John Muir's writings, please don't start with this one. It's a worthwhile read in its own right, don't get me wrong. But read _My First Summer in the Sierra_ or a Muir biography like Michael P. Cohen's _The Pathless Way_ before you move on to this one. Get a good dose of what the naturalist is like and learn some of his background, and then you'll be in the proper frame of mind to tackle _Travels in Alaska_. Otherwise, this book is just one glacier after another. And bless his heart, Muir wants to see them all. And climb them and explore them and sketch them and hike their entire lengths and write about them ad nauseum. He leaves his companions in his wake and puts himself squarely in the face of isolated danger over and over again. Read this book first, and you'll think he's insane. Know his roots in Wisconsin and his good work in California, and you'll be better able to appreciate what he thinks of and does in the Alaska of the late 1800s."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I confess up front, it's been a few years since I read Muir's Travels in Alaska. Yet significant aspects I remember well. Given Muir's exuberance for life and almost everything he encounters in his travels, one almost looses view of Muir the botanist and geologist. But not quite. Here we find the author contemplating the activity of glaciers and documenting the flora of southeast Alaska. Muir (who tended strongly toward vegetarianism) gleefully entertaining himself by foiling duck hunters. Baffling the locals by happily wandering out into major storms.The book is a journal of Muir's 1879, 1880, and 1890 trips (he wouldn't mind if we called them adventures) to SE Alaska's glaciers, rivers, and temperate rain forests. He died while preparing this volume for publication.I remind myself, and anyone reading this, that Muir isn't for every reader. And, as other reviewers have stated, this may not be the volume in which to introduce oneself to the one-of-a-kind John Muir. One reviewer doesn't think that Muir is entirely credible in these accounts. I won't say whether or not this is wrong, but I tend to a different view. For some of us -- and certainly for Muir -- wilderness is a medicine, a spiritual tonic, so to speak. For the individual effected in this way, physical impediments and frailties rather dissolve away when he is alone in wildness. I once heard Graham Mackintosh (author of Into a Desert Place) speak of this. In all of his travels alone in the desert, he doesn't recall having ever been sick. This may not sound credible to some, but I strongly suspect it is true.If you like Muir's writings, read this book. If you like the stuff of Best Sellers, perhaps you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"From the title, one would think this a type of travel journal, a panorama of episodes along the way, a sequence of stations between the starting off point and the destination. Instead, the overall weight of the book is given to glaciers, their descriptions, their influence on the landscape, their geological record, the discovery of new glaciers, and other characteristics of these moving rivers of ice. While Muir offers descriptive powers unequaled among authors on nature, never repeating himself though constantly repeating his subject, the sheer repetition tends to bog the work down. Two whole pages might contribute to our view of a particular glacier, and suddenly Muir reports that he's finished a 200-mile leg of his journey on foot. He tells us when he's climbed a glacier, and along the way we've missed an entire week. Time and space almost have no medium in this publication, utterly lost when gazing upon a glacier. For nature lovers who will never go to Alaska, the descriptions in this book make the ranges and glaciers come alive in print, but as a dramatic journey, a travelogue, or a field manual for the Alaskan bush, this book forms only a vague shadow."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"The beauty of this wonderful reprinting is how it shows John Muir as a person, how it helps us to understand the dynamic and overwhelming beauty of Alaska, and the changes in the people of Alaska. Muir's complete, tireless, and joyful commitment to nature comes through on every page. The book unintentionally provides an excellent portrait of the kind of inexhaustible devotion it takes to change the world as did Muir. The book also provides a stunning portrait of Alaska in the latter part of the 19th Century and allows one to compare the Alaska of those days with Alaska of earlier times and of today. The biggest changes are in the glaciers and in the people. The glaciers have receded dramatically as a natural part of their centuries' long retreat. It is interesting to compare what Muir saw with the experience of Vancouver almost exactly 100 years earlier (ca. 1793). Vancouver could hardly enter Glacier Bay. Muir could enter quite some distance, but the glaciers were still the dominant features. Today, the glaciers have largely receded into deep valleys. Muir encountered people in Alaska living largely as they had for centuries. They were hunters and fishermen and lived in small groups along the shore line. As Jonathan Raban points out in the intricately woven fabric of his sublime book \\"Passage to Juneau,\\" the people of southeast Alaska considered the sea to be the real environment of their lives while the land was considered dangerous and unknowable. They lived along the shore and knew how to live off and with the sea year round. The lives of the Alaskan people are very different today but greatly influenced by the past. Raban often characterizes Muir's writing as overblown and florid. However, it is a portrait of a man, a maritime land and a people. To do justice to those three, the book had to be what it is - an astonishingly colorful and detailed portrait in words."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"John Muir's \\"Travels In Alaska\\" is his accouts of his trips to Southeast Alaska in 1879, 1880, and 1890. Southeast Alaska 125 years ago was sparsely settled and poorly explored; Muir's adventurous spirit and enquiring mind led him to investigate the numerous inlets and glaciers in the area, including the magnificent and much-celebrated Glacier Bay.Muir's simple, muscular prose weaves a fascinating narrative out of descriptions of the people, wildlife, and geology he encounters on his journey, suffused with his endless sense of wonder at the landscapes in which he saw the hand of God. The reader can hardly help but be carried along by Muir's enthusiasm. Muir's descriptions may be most relevant to those traveling Southeast Alaska by cruise ship, for a sense of what the landscape looked like before the population reached today's size and spread. Those not interested in the travel aspects of the book and in numerous descriptions of glaciers may find this book less interesting.This book is highly recommended to fans of John Muir's writings, and to those planning a trip through Southeast Alaska."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I have read most everything that John Muir wrote and agree with Corinne H. Smith's review that if you are new to the works of John Muir, this isn't the best book to start with. You really need to have a working knowledge of Muir to get the most out of this book.However, once you get into the mindset of Muir, you'll enjoy his insight and perspective on nature. To be completely honest, I hold a degree of envy for John Muir for having the opportunities to do all he did, what an incredible life. At least I can be there through his eyes and in my imagination.These works are meant to be absorbed through the heart and soul by contemplating on Muir's thoughts. His writings can get deep if you allow yourself to let go and get lost in them."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"Some of the reading got sluggish for me, but all in all great. Having been to Alaska, it is fascinating to imagine traveling there back in the early days. Was and still a magnificent place beyond words. A masterpiece of nature."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"I highly recommend this book. I was somewhat familiar with John Muir's conservation work. I wasn't familiar with what a deep man of faith and daring that he was. His descriptions of Alaska make you want to go there. His crazy willingness to risk life and limb to explore God's Creation makes this book both entertaining and inspiring."},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"First of all, I love Muir and Alaska, so the fact that this book was free blew me away. What a treat! It is so interesting to read about his style of mountaineering through Alaska, basically a little bread and his ice climbing gear. What a man!"},{"Title":"Travels in Alaska","review":"John Muir is an interesting fellow - and in a way, these books are about him as a person just as they are a description of his journies in the world. Having been to Alaska, it's truly a sight of beauty that may make you believe in a higher power to create something this amazing.It's hard to add something original after so many reviews other than I'm glad that I sat down and read this book, and go to see Alaska through the eyes of someone there over 120 years ago.For the Kindle version, there's no Table of Contents, so you can't skip around between chapters. Other than that, it's a free book, and worth downloading if you're interested in Alaska, glaciers, or Muir himself."},{"Title":"Pottery by American Indian Women: The Legacy of Generations","review":"Susan Peterson has done a fabulous job highlighting the matriarchs (Nampeyo, Maria Martinez, Lucy Lewis, Margaret Tafoya), matrilineal line (Fanny and Dextra Nampeyo, The Lewis Women, Lu Ann Tafoya, Nancy Youngblood Lugo), and avant-gard (Alice Cling, Nora Naranjo-Morse, Jacquie Stevens) women artists who have maintained and expanded this ancient art form into the 20th-century.

Reading it is essential in understanding that time and why the revolutions of the masses failed during that period. What was missing from the intellectual movements influencing the masses at that point was not the \\"right plan\\", but the right philosophy of revolution which posits the masses as the agents in their own struggle for freedom.The structure of the book is chronological, as the title states. Beginning from the period of the bourgeois revolutions, it leads up to the 1950's tracing how \\"post-Marx Marxism\\" lost its way in fetishizing vanguards, bureaucratic structures, and other un-dialectical constructs that they placed before the masses of oppressed people fighting for liberation. The main lesson of the book is not that intellectuals and Marxists need to come up with a means to create socialsim, but that the movement of the masses for liberation is socialism, and that one cannot substitute the actions of individuals from some vague collective determined from the top down.In this age of capitalist crisis, this book needs to be seriously contemplated so that a new philosophy of liberation can lead humankind to cast off the shackles of capitalism."},{"Title":"The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology","review":"It is so cool to read old stories. Some of the references are to things that have been forgotten by most people. These stories are generally enjoy so it may not be able as any good story is, it is just that these have another facet that is interesting for me. I have a paperback edition, so it may not be the same as other editions available.'Nightfall' by Isaac Asimov - This is one of the great short stories because it imagined another world with their own lifestyles and culture, etc. It does not involve a lot of science, just imagination of what another world might be and how the inhabitants would react to the setting of the sun once every couple of thousand years.'First Contact' by Murray Leinster - It is amazing that even fifty or sixty years ago they were worried about the first time the human race encounters aliens. The cool part of this story is that it happens so far away from here or there that both ships feel comfortable trying to figure out how to get away safely without destroying the other first. Given the time, they figure out a way both crews can go home safely'Eternity Lost' by Clifford D. Simak - Humanity has developed life lengthening technology, but it is limited to a chosen fewfor good and obvious reasons. One of the lucky ones finds he is due to be denied further life. He gets rather distraught about it.'Vault of the Beast' by A. E. van Vogt - A ship has visited Mars and returns to Earth with a magical creature created for one purpose. The creature does its thing and in the end helps to save the world. The wonder of this story is the descriptions and the ending math.'Invarient' by John Pierce - Homer Green is constantly interviewed because he is a relic. This is another story of immortality gone wrong.'When the Bough Breaks' by Lewis Padgett - New parents of a whiz kid are visited by tutors from the future. The tutoring backfires.'Cold War' by Kris Neville - A story of how Mutually Assured Destruction became the beacon of peace in the world, though of course no one knew it was coming.'Over the Top' by Lester del Ray- For me this is the most interesting story because of the reference to \\"hundred ton electronic slipsticks\\" (does anyone know what one is?). A midgit is sent to Mars. He was chosen for various reasons: sex, intelligence, healthy, etc. and stature. He was small so he would not need the space a normal man would need, air use would be less, etc, etc. The challenge is that he crash hands, his savior is a Martian, and humanity also comes to his rescue. Wild story."},{"Title":"The Art of Amazement","review":"Contrary to the apparent Judaic framework in which the author tries to fit this book, the content goes far beyond any particular culture or religion. The whole thread of the book is about introspection and starting to get into serious \\"meditation\\". Meditation is this process of going inside our beliefs, and questioning and reconsidering all choices we make in our life. This is the path of \\"mysticism\\", which is nothing else than going back to our human sources, those we knew while being kids, and which we covered with all sorts of social and cultural learning that makes us forget who we are.Amazement is being able to see the beauty of Life in all its aspects, which is the achievement of any mystic path. If you seriously try to grasp fully the content of this book, you might be able to change your perspective on life for good."},{"Title":"The Art of Amazement","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I should start this review by saying that Rabbi Seinfeld sent me a copy of the book to review on Amazon.Pros: Rabbi Seinfeld's writing style is engaging and colorful; it's a nicely written book. Also, the ideas presented therein, particularly after the first few chapters, of being mindful of and grateful for the sublime in our lives in specific ways is touching and important both to Judaism and to modern life. He also ends each chapter with specific exercises - both meditational and Jewish - that can help increase mindfulness and Jewish observance.Unfortunately, I don't think I'm the ideal person to read - or review - the book. I have never been one to connect strongly with Eastern philosophy, for example, so the first few chapters - intended to draw in those who are perhaps so-called \\"JuBus\\" - were not appropriate for me but may be great for you.I'd recommend the book strongly for anyone Jewish who has been interested in the mindfulness aspects of Buddhism and who feels he or she is lacking that feeling about Judaism, whether or not you're already observant. The mindfulness is there; we just weren't taught about it."},{"Title":"The Art of Amazement","review":"Imagine a cake.

And that's what Judaism tastes like for most Yids. We call it chocolate cake, but most shuls taste like a bowl of four.The Art of Amazement provides numerous theories/practices/ideas to instill profound meaning into the day to day activities of our lives. Rabbi Seinfeld's book provides tools that could, if read, absorbed, practiced, shared and taught (at both the individual and organizational levels) revolutionize the way we live our lives as Jews.

Lots of beautiful glossy photos (color and B&amp;W) with opinionated reviews of all the original (British) LPs, EPs, singles and solo releases through 1975. The authors genuinely love the Beatles. The tone of their text, while occasionally harsh, is overwhelmingly objective and accurate. (They reserve their most brutal criticisim for solo LPs such as Paul's &quot;Ram&quot; and George's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. I'd be willing to bet they've changed their opinions with a quarter century of hindsight). Whether or not you agree with Carr and Tyler's views, you'll undoubtedly find them to be witty and almost always amusing. Also included is a rudimentary review of the Liverpool/Hamburg years, a great photo montage of the legendary Shea Stadium show (August 15, 1965) and a summary of popular Beatle bootlegs. Overall, &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot; stands out because of its magnificient array of photos and the authors' brief, but well-written text.

I begged my mom for it, and a short time later my specially-ordered copy arrived.I can't say much for the text. I was a kid at the time and wanted it because it was so chock-full of great, large-sized, color photos. Being an artistic type who gravitated towards pictures more thant words (haven't changed a bit!), this book was a visual treasure trove for a budding Beatles fan.I do recall reading some harsh reviews of some of Paul's and George's albums. The one that stands out in my mind is the review of George's \\"Living In The Material World\\"... where George is lambasted for forcing his religious beliefs upon the poor listeners! LOL.I also received an updated copy, this time in paperback, a few years later. It had an additional section in the back about the death of John Lennon.I'd not mind seeing this book updated and re-released.

A &quot;US Disography&quot; is provided to help American fans relate the jumbled US releases to the originals. The book could have been much longer.

I had a very large Beatles collection growing up that unfortunatly I lost when I went on my first tour with the United Stated Army in the 80's. I have replaced most of my collection and finally secured my copy of this great book. What is intersting about Beatles books in the 70's was that they were written only a few years after the GREATEST ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD broke up,so there were always hints of a Beatles reunion. What I loved about this book was the easy reading way it was written and the the great photos. I remember two great shots of John during the Get Back/Let It Be sessions. One shows him sitting with his Ephiphone Casino looking down with sadness. The other is from the roof top of the Apple Building and he is looking over his shoulder and smiling.

Both critique each album, extended play, and/or single by Harrison, Lennon, McCartney, and Starr then relay to those of us who read such reviews the artistic value this entity possessed.

The various example robots and programs in the book gave me great practice on the whole creative process. NQC (a new RCX programing language) comes with the book on a CD. That too was a god send. The programing software that Lego provides is quite limited. Now that the book has given me and taught me NQC I can build much more interesting and complex robots.

The author demonstrates how to connect the touch sensors and light sensors physically and then add programming code to control the logic that produces power from the central processor to a motor that powers a gear. The basics are simple to understand and the project increase in sophistication and complexity.The book explains explains different types of gear ratios, differential gear combinations, power and speed gear ratios, pulleys, power connections, stop latch, levels, frames, sound, and how to simulate an actuator like a grabber.The robotic behavior can be either conditional or remote controlled. I'm a programmer and this book helped me break into the world of robot programming, signal programming, multitask abstraction, and signal processing without having construct the hardware.Lego Mindstorm is a much easier and faster way to build simple robots verses trying to construct all the hardware on your own.

These are decent projects, on the less ambitious side, and Baum ends up discussing some important ideas in the course of them.But it isn't really a \\"guide\\" -- much less \\"definitive.\\" The smattering of topics is somewhat haphazard, and it could certainly not be used as a reference. The intended audience seems to be a beginner, but basic programming/engineering concepts aren't introduced, so one would have to get that elsewhere.Baum admirably tries to explain his design decisions, but I was frustrated that some of the programming is not explained as thoroughly (e.g., why use a messier \\"repeat-while\\" instead of a simpler \\"wait until\\"?).I would recommend this over many other, sillier, project-based books I've looked at.

Dave Baum demonstrates several principles for building Mindstorms 'bots in each project. The mechanical engineering part of the 'bots is carefully explained, as well as the programming part - using both the RCX code and Mr. Baum's own NQC language. The book provides several great &quot;sub-assemblies&quot; and tips and tricks that are useful in your own projects. As a programmer, the programming part was interesting to me, but not an eye-opener. Instead, I learned quite a bit on mechanical engineering. The book probably works the other way around for people familiar with mechanical engineering but not familiar with programming. However, the construction diagrams are not always clear. Because there is no list of parts to be added at each step (as is done in Lego's own construction diagrams), you run the risk of missing something. Because the diagrams are all black and white, it is often hard to determine the color of a particular piece - which sometimes makes it hard to find it. Perhaps the renders could be included in color on the accompanying CD-ROM in a future edition. The CD-ROM itself is excellent, since it contains everything to get you programming in NQC."},{"Title":"Definitive Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS, Second Edition","review":"If you buy a LEGO Mindstorms buy this book. The construction information is excellent and very necessary for a useful robot. The book is good for an 11 year old (my son) as well as an adult. I have found using NQC, the programming language that comes with the book, to control the RCX was much more effective than either the software that comes with the Mindstorms or the ROBO LAB software from Dacta. Over a year ago my son started programs with the RCX with NQC, I wish I had the book then. This is a great way to introduce students to programming because it is fun. The true results of the programming along with the results of the construction techniques provide a great learning environment.

I am a junior in high school, and this book gave me the ideas to go and put together an award winning robot for our school systems science fair. In fact, it gave me the key to a full scholarship at the local engineering school, since I am the first and only person to ever make a robot for the fair in their 20+ year history, AND the fact that I attracted people to my booth, judges and all with my playing the Matrix { THE BEST MOVIE } on my internal dvd. It so impressed the judges, I was even offered a job, but the guy didnt realize I am only 17 ( and got 2 already :-( ).

He starts with basic concepts (frames, gearing, pulleys) and builds on those to develop a repertoire of construction and, later, programming techniques.Baum introduces his own language for LEGO Mindstorms, NQC, included on the CD-ROM that accompanies the book. NQC provides a traditional text approach to programming LEGO robots that's superior to LEGO's own graphic RCX language. For those who actually like RCX, Baum includes RCX versions of many of the programs in addition to NQC. The CD-ROM also includes a Windows version of RCX Command Center, giving a virtual &quot;remote control&quot; to the Mindstorms RCX brick. This makes experimentation with different building ideas a breeze since it requires no programming.Juvenile readers should have no problems approaching the material. Unfortunately, though, Baum writes in an unven style, often relying on passive voice. The conclusions to each chapter sound excruciatingly forced. An extra editing pass might've helped with consitency.There are certainly no lack of figures depicting step-by-step instructions of each robot. But I hope a future edition prints the figures in color; it's sometimes difficult to see what certain models require since many of the parts meld together in a sea of dark gray.Baum gives a nice section of obtaining additional interesting parts in an appendix, and leaves the reader with other new developments to explore in the LEGO Mindstorms universe.Overall, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Definitive Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS, Second Edition","review":"I really liked this book - even more than the O'Reilly book.

The textual content, including appendices, is good. Unfortunately, the illustrations have inadequate contrast, and are difficult to interpret even under very bright light. This is due to extensive and unnecessary use of gray scale, both in assembly drawings and flow charts(!). While it is quite possible that Apress printed the grayscale much darker than Mr. Baum intended, I believe the decision to use gray scale at all was flawed. On the other hand, the use of isometric (&quot;3D&quot;) projections is entirely appropriate. If reprinted with isometric line drawings (no gray scale) I'd probably rate it 5 stars (especially if I could trade in my gray scale version)."},{"Title":"Definitive Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS, Second Edition","review":"This book was, and still is, a pure pleasure. It ranges from the very basic gear-up gear-down and bracing / support constructs to the more complex inter-RCX communications. Dave Baum has done a wonderful job of bridging the basics to give the reader the tools to build more complex creations. The book points out many tools and resources for mindstorm aficionados and is not self centered on the author's creation, NQC. Many diagrams help with the actual construction on the robots, and engineering trade-offs are covered for each design. All in all, this book is a wonderful supplement to the mindstorms experience."},{"Title":"Definitive Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS, Second Edition","review":"My major complaint with Mindstorms was the fact that the documentation that came with it was so poor. I purchased the mindstorm product when it first came out and never was able to make anything nearly as nice as the projects in there book. (Which by the way don't come with detailed directions)This book makes a great addition to anyone who has the mindstorm set. My thanks to Mr. Baum for giving instructions and tips for some neat projects."},{"Title":"Definitive Guide to LEGO MINDSTORMS, Second Edition","review":"When I opened Baum's &quot;Definitive Guide&quot;, I expected a description of how to build and program a few simple projects. The book did that, and did it well, but what I did not expect was the depth of insight into mechanical engineering and computer science principles that it provides.For example, Baum gives a careful and clear explanation of how a mechanism works (such as a worm gear or differential, to name but two), and then presents experiments that you can build with Lego. These experiments will give you an invaluable feel for the principles involved. And I mean &quot;feel&quot; literally; after you build and try them, you will understand how these machines work on a gut level that's unforgettable. It's a lot of fun to build and operate even the simplest of Dave Baum's models.On the programming side, his NQC language is a nice stepping stone to the syntax of today's most widely-used programming languages (C and C++). But, as with the mechanical side, Baum -- without getting preachy or teachy about it -- introduces computer science concepts that will help make a youngster (of any age) a better and wiser programmer. Because you do them instead of just read about them, this is the kind of learning that tends to stick with you.NQC, which comes free with the book (and is free on the Web), is a better way to work with the Lego RCX unit. My kids, from 9 years old and up, prefer it to the tedious and somewhat weak Lego-provided method. As a tutorial to the language alone, the book would be a five-star recommendation. But Baum's work is a lot more than that, and a lot more than the shallow building guide to a few toys I originally expected.Buy it, build it, and program it: This book succeeds at being both toy and tutorial, a rare achievement."},{"Title":"How to Flirt","review":"I was working for Chase Manhattan Bank in NYC at the time and happened upon this book on my lunch hour in the WTC bookstore. At the time I was simply feeling that my love life needed more and I needed to somehow meet more women. I also picked up a few of Susin Rabin's books and even went to one of her seminars at the Y in NYC. Rabin's are also great books but at times too wordy. This book was very precise and changed my perspectives in 3 main ways. First it taught me to relax and enjoy myself while flirting. It taught me that flirting is a very natural action that we have all done since childhood in different ways. It made very clear- through words, examples, and exercises - that flirting should be and must be fun to be successfully received. Interestingly enough as I made sure I was having fun flirting and NOT trying to PURSUE - women naturally became very interested in me. Second it helped me to understand the types of women that interest me most and the types of environments that I am most comfortable in. This was important because it helped me to focus my flirting with those I was most interested in and in the environments I most likely to be more &quot;comfortable&quot; and consequently &quot;more successful&quot; in. Lastly through exercises and great humor the book helped me to become more comfortable with myself and the opposite sex. In fact I occasionally re-read the book when I am feeling down to remind myself to just relax and have fun - as you will see, great things often happen when you do. There is no book on Flirting I would recommend higher."},{"Title":"How to Flirt","review":"This book is a perfect gift to buy for people who are young, old, newly graduated, newly broken up, newly together, you get the idea.

Carl Mitcham, in a review that also lives on this site, has done an even-handed job of highlighting particular articles and their merits. I would agree with and refer you back to his observations, but for one point. Mitcham's own essay is not a weak link in the collection, but, in fact, brings up the central concern of the volume eloquently:\\"Rather than being hyperactive cheerleaders for the future or sullen critics of the present we must attempt to think it, to recognize ever more clearly what has happened and what is at stake--in part, through a studied dialogue with ancestors and alternatives...\\"\\"Earth Matters\\" provides a quality forum for studied dialogue, alternative ways of thinking through and naming things, and collapsing traditional boundaries in search of progressive, adaptive and compassionate responses to what most see as a precarious state in environmental affairs. Reading it is entering the forum and participating in the dialogue, for many of the questions begin with an examination of self. These authors are indeed \`the adults-in-the-room'-deeply respected and serious writers from across several disciplines. There isn't a hint of brash extremism here, but rather, a disciplined, contemplative and often poetic approach to subtle and complex issues."},{"Title":"Earth Matters: The Earth Sciences, Philosophy, and the Claims of Community","review":"First, in the interests of full disclosure, I should note that an essay of mine is included in this volume. However, I think my contribution is among the weaker in the book, and I give this volume the rating I do because of the high quality of the other contributions. Also, I am one of two people to whom the editor graciously dedicated the book, a compliment for which I am grateful but which I have tried to set aside as an influence on this review.What makes this book outstanding is its attempt to advance philosophical reflection on the earth sciences. Martin Heidegger once made a remark to the effect that the sciences do not think, they simply analyze and re-present. This book attempts to move beyond Heidegger by engaging in interdisciplinary philosophical reflection on the nature and meaning of the geosciences. These reflections range from hydrologist Victor Baker's semiotics of the earth sciences and philosopher Kristin Shrader-Frechette's critique of positivist epistemology in geological modelling to Bruce Foltz's careful phenomenological attention to how the geosciences can help provide human orientation in the world and Albert Borgmann's expressions of concern for the implications of the digitalization of information in geology. Christine Turner provides an introduction to the experience of the field sciences. Daniel Sarewitz critiques excessive attempts to rely on objectivity. Scott McLean, Eldrige Moores, and David Robertson examine how geology is manifest in the poetry of Gary Snyder. Alphonso Lingis examines &quot;ecological emotions.&quot; And more. This is, truly, a most remarkable book, that advances not just the development of a philosophy of the geosciences but the philosophy of science.Weaknesses: The book deserves a much more robust and programatic introduction; and a good annotated bibliography would have been a very serviceable addition."},{"Title":"The New Holistic Health Handbook: Living Well in a New Age","review":"Although this book came out over 25 years ago, it contains so much timeless wisdom that it is still very much worth having.

The book is a compilation of dozens of leaders in the holistic health field covering every imaginable field - from body and breathwork to herbal medicine, shamanism and integrative medicine. The chapter by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Death Does Not Exists, alone warrants purchase of the book.

Not since Mary Renault's 'Last of the Wine' have I encountered such a complete telling of the life of a man in Ancient Greece.Born to a Spartan General and his beautiful wife; who maintains that her son was truly sired by the God Dionysus, Ariston discovers his true parentage, and his first love, only to lose them to cruel fates.Surviving these loses, Ariston is then sold into slavery, taken to Athens, and given over to a brothel to have his 'favors' sold time and again. Here in his life he develops a deep, loving friendship with Orchomenus; who remains a constant figure in his life for many years to come. Ariston and Orchomenus' friendship is reminiscent of many others that I have read of from the time period; in terms of the depth of the love between two men, and how once their lives were tied together by their great affection for one another, the bond was difficult, if not impossible, to break.Once Ariston is freed from his service to the brothel,and adopted by a wealthy figure in Athens; his life takes a more favorable turn. Ariston; through virture of his unparallelled looks or kindly nature, draws many friends and loves to him. Danaeus; Autolykos; Chryseius; all people who will play important roles in his life.But Ariston; too haunted by the loss of his first love, finds himself unable to return their affections fully. Though he takes Chryseius into his home and bed, his is not free to marry her; under Athenian law, as he is a 'metic', or free citizen, but not of birth, to the city of his residence. Therefore he builds his life as a businessman, philanthropist, athlete, and student in Athens, all the while hoping for eventual citizenship to fulfill his promise to Chryseius and one day marry her.The book is sweeping in its scope; and epic in it's storytelling capability. The first few chapters virtually turned me away, as the tone and 'repetition' of Ariston losing his first love, Phryne, were tedius to say the least. The discovery of girls in general to him, as well as Phryne herself entering his life, seem contrived, as if they were hastily added to give Ariston a foundation for the 'loner' quality he maintains throughout most of the rest of his life.However, once through these few almost unpalpable chapters, the story unfolds; page after page, without ever slowing. Yerby's pacing is excellent; his character development full and believable; and his painstaking attention to the everyday detail of life in Athens and Sparta in classical times is rich and rewarding to read. Ariston's own character and character flaws are well played out against the backdrop of the supporting and secondary players to the story. And while the 500 page novel is full of well-developed, interesting persons, Yerby never loses sight of his protagonist, even against such famed historical figures as Sokrates, Sophokles, Alkibiades, etc, etc, etc.....each of these persons influences Ariston, but never overshadows him.For that I give Yerby 5 stars, and label the book as almost perfect. Although a bit difficult to involve myself in it initially, I was greatly rewarded for my tenacity. Hopefully other readers will agree. I highly recommend this story along with my other favorites written about the time period; Mary Renault, Homer himself, and newer author Steven Pressfield. Though Yerby leans more toward Renault in overall tone, his style and quality of storytelling are all his own."},{"Title":"Goat song: A novel of ancient Greece","review":"The story of a young man that suffers all kind of pains in his life and remains incorruptible in his mind, with capacity of loving and learning. Yerby makes a unforgetable story of the life of young Ariston with a master style. I have read a lot of Yerby's novels, but this one is on the top, in my opinion. Iam very sad to tell you that this book was stolen from my house almost ten years ago and that it has been imposibble for me to find it again.

This novel covers ancient Greece, a facinating time when the ground rules of Western democracy and society were formed.Ariston is a pubescent lad from Sparta. He is captured by the Athenians in one of the wars that dotted this period in history. Trained from birth in the Spartan tradition of enduring physical hardships, he will need all of his strength to survive in Athens.He is sold into slavery as a boy prostitute in a brothel. Comely of body, he becomes a star attraction for the customers. Yet while his body is broken, his mind remains whole. His life in the brothel is authentic, such were the customs of ancient Greece.Eventually he is purchased by a rich man for his personal use, saving him from the tortures of the brothel. Ariston grows up to become an actor on the Greek stage, where his physical beauty is appreciated.Yerby's novel is a good read. It is sweeping in scope, set in interesting times, with strong characters. All of the minutae of ancient Greek life are captured here. This one is for all lovers of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Goat song: A novel of ancient Greece","review":"Frank Yerby's 1967 novel \\"Goat Song\\" is an odd mixture for today's reader. From the Frank Yerby site:\\"Ariston, a young heroic Spartan, is cursed and blessed by the Hellenic ideal of male beauty. The time of the Peloponnesian War is a period of dynamic energy, of burgeoning culture and festering decadence. Greeks witness Sparta's excessive cruelty and Athen's male sexuality. This is ancient Greece. On battlefield and slave market, temple and brothel, are found Socrates' discourses and Alcibiades' revels. The brutalizing code of Sparta competes with the brilliant sophistication of Athens. Caught between these contradictions, Ariston is enslaved and brought to Athens where these competing philosophies force the Spartan youth must choose between his home and his passions.\\"Yerby clearly did his historical and literary research on ancient Greece for this novel. He weaves in even more history (accurate, too) than Mary Renault's Greek novels, but without the subtlety. With an excess of excesses - of violence, death, gore, heroism, desirability, depravity - it sometimes borders on an adult comic book sensibility. Yet it is fascinating, like a train wreck is fascinating. I haven't read other books by the author, so I don't know if excess is a general characteristic of his writing, or if it is an ambiance that he wants to attribute to Socratic Greece.The hero's homophobia is at once off-putting and incongruous. I don't usually indulge in psychoanalyzing an author, but one can't help but notice the lingering descriptions of male beauty, the hero's infatuation with another adonis-like teenage boy at the beginning of the book, the near-sexual intensity of his later male friendships, and the unaccountable venom toward homosexual and bisexual characters, both in the narrative and out of the mouth of the hero.The homophobia would be inexcusable in a modern writer, but it is possible to disregard it as a chronological tic in a black writer (bi-racial, actually) born in 1916 in the American South. Publishing from 1946 to 1985, Yerby was the first black writer to appear on the NY Times best seller list, and the first black writer to have a story put on screen by Hollywood, with three other novel adaptations following. An expatriate to Spain in 1955, with 60 million sales, yet he is virtually unknown today in the U.S."},{"Title":"Goat song: A novel of ancient Greece","review":"Frank Yerby was an outstanding author and this is another example of his great writing."},{"Title":"Goat song: A novel of ancient Greece","review":"This is the only Frank Yerby I've ever read. I first read Goat Song in 1973, & recently found it at a yard sale & figured I'd see if it had held up. I was very happy to see that this has stood the test of time, and since far more is now known about the ancient Greeks and their neighbors than there was in the '70's, I think I may have enjoyed this even more than 35 years ago. My best friend is a Mists Of Avalon series junkie, & I'm looking forward to her reading this. This would really be an great movie, just without a Steve Reeves or other talentless Hollywood Hunk-Ra as Ariston."},{"Title":"Goat song: A novel of ancient Greece","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager & instantly identified with the hero & the characters.

Even if you didn't enjoy the movie \\"300\\" still read this book.

I would highly recommend this epic tale to everyone."},{"Title":"Papa Bear : The Life and Legacy of George Halas","review":"This is one of two books which I have read recently, the other being Let Me Tell You a Story: A Lifetime in the Game, John Feinstein's account of his close association with Arnold (\\"Red\\") Auerbach. Both Halas and Auerbach were obviously great coaches but also outstanding CEOs, each building a successful and profitable franchise while playing a key role in a multi-billion dollar professional organization. In this instance, the National Football League. Born and raised in Chicago, I was especially interested in what seems to be the definitive biography of Halas, the longtime owner and coach of that city's NFL team, Duh Bears. It must have taken someone with both his most attractive qualities (e.g. vision, generosity, perseverance, self-confidence) and his most unattractive qualities (e.g. duplicity, arrogance, stubbornness, and -- at times -- paranoia) to accomplish what he did...which was indeed a great deal.For example, Halas played as a right fielder with the New York Yankees until replaced...by Babe Ruth. He then concentrated on a career in football, playing for as well as coaching the Decatur (IL) Staleys which he organized in 1920. It was one of the 11 original teams in the American Professional Football Association, of which Halas was a co-founder and its driving force. The APFA became the National Football League in 1922. Thirty-five (35) franchises folded during its first ten seasons. It was also in 1922 that Halas relocated his team to Chicago and re-named it the Bears. From 1920 until 1929, he was a coach/player and then concentrated entirely on coaching during three periods (1933-42, 1946-55, and 1958-68), during which the Bears won seven NFL championships and Halas was credited with a then league-record of 325 wins. Only Don Shula has won more.With all due respect to his achievements as a coach, Halas deserves much (if not most) of the credit for keeping professional football alive. At least until the emergence of television, baseball really was the national pastime and college football was much more popular (and credible) than was the NFL and the All-American Football Conference which challenged it after World War Two. It is debatable when all this changed. Many cite the the Baltimore Colts victory in overtime against the New York Giants in the NFL championship game (December 28, 1958), others Pete Rozelle's leadership as commissioner (1960-1989 and especially during his first years in that office), and still others a program which CBS televised in 1960 as part of its Twentieth Century series, \\"The Violent World of Sam Huff.\\" Having personally observed the NFL's exceptional growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s, my own opinion is that there were many factors which certainly include these three. Point is, there would have been no NFL as we now know it without the contributions which George Halas made.That said, there are many (including several who played for Halas) who would agree with then Chicago Daily News columnist Mike Royko that Halas was \\"a tight-fisted, stubborn, willful, mean old man...[adding that] there isn't a famous Chicagoan in or out of jail who generates such intense dislike.\\" Unlike Arnold (\\"Red\\") Auerbach who frequently claimed that he could forgive but never forget a perceived grievance, Halas often seems incapable of either. Davis examines this in several of Halas' relationships with various assistant coaches and players as well as with several owners. However, it is most evident in his relationship with son-in-law Michael McCaskey who married daughter Virginia. Near death, as Halas considered who would next head the franchise, he sighed \\"Anybody but Michael.\\" That deathbed wish would be denied.Davis cites numerous examples of Halas' generosity, notably the fact that he paid for nearly all of the immense medical expenses during Brian Piccolo's losing battle with cancer. In the Foreword, Gale Sayers observes, \\"I love George Halas. When I talk about George Halas on speaking tours, I always say that. I thought that way about him. He made me a better person. He made a young man a better man just by talking to him, offering his advice. I always listened to him. I will always remember him. I appreciate him.\\" Many others share their own fond memories as well appreciation of Halas' often concealed kindnesses.Davis's research seems exhaustive. He conducted hundreds of in-depth interviews with those who were most closely associated with Halas, including many with whom Halas had serious, at times rancorous disagreements (e.g. Dick Butkus) This is probably the definitive biography of the Old Man but it also offers a wealth of information about the process by which professional football evolved to its current place in American society. As Davis asserts and I agree, no one played a more prominent role during that process than did Papa Bear."},{"Title":"Papa Bear : The Life and Legacy of George Halas","review":"Some men stand on the shoulders of giants to get a good look at God. Not football legend George Halas. He was a God, and here's 534 pages of proof in Jeff Davis's stunning biography Papa Bear. Halas could play the game. Oh, man, could he play. He was an MVP at the Rose Bowl AND an outfielder on the New York Yankees in the same year. As offensive end with the Bears, he stripped Olympian Jim Thorpe of a ball, recovered the fumble, and ran it back 98 yards for a touchdown, a record that would stand for almost fifty years.He could coach, too, an understatement Halas certainly would appreciate. During his forty-year tenure, he perfected the T-formation, won an astonishing 8 NFL titles and 324 games (second best record in football history), and pioneered innovations like holding daily practice sessions and broadcasting games on the radio.If Jeff Davis's Papa Bear were simply a laundry list of Halas's accomplishments, it would still be a fascinating read. Fortunately, it's a lot more. Davis spoke first hand with Jerry Vainisi, Dick Butkus, Mike Ditka - the gang's all here - and what develops is a gripping narrative of a taciturn man who could be surprisingly philanthropic. He was a miser during contract negotiations, yet covered Brian Piccolo's astronomical medical bills during his tragic bout with cancer. Davis's skillful command of a story that virtually spans an entire century is an impressive feat.Davis is a native Chicagoan and long time sportswriter. The Bears are his turf, and what you get is an unvarnished yet articulate summation of Halas's contributions to football, along with the tragic way Halas was unable to defend his legacy from the barbarians in the front office. In football's version of the Corleone saga, George Halas said on his deathbed, \\"Anybody but Michael (McCaskey).\\" Look at the way the Bears played for years after their triumphant Super Bowl Season in 1985 and you'll understand why. He knew the poetic simplicity of directness, and why his grandson Michael, a former Harvard Business School professor, was too flaccid and indecisive a leader to follow in Halas's gargantuan footsteps.Halas's story is, in essence, football's story, and by extension the story of professional sports in America. How did the NFL become, in Davis's words, the \\"richest and most powerful sports organization on Earth\\"? Read this and learn why you go to two churches on Sundays."},{"Title":"Papa Bear : The Life and Legacy of George Halas","review":"George S. Halas was, depending on who wrote the piece that you're reading, either the cheapest, back-stabbingest skinflint who ever threw nickels around like manhole covers, or a visionary who had the foresight to see what the NFL could become and ran his family business and associations (read: NFL) to the top of the sporting world heap. You can find both sides in this book, which is a reason that it ranks as high as it does.To understand the man, the book starts out with his parents, from the old country, Bohemia. As new immigrants, they worked in ways that we don't seem to do any more, like thrift, saving for something better, hard work at odd jobs to get that extra change. This is how George Halas operatered because he was \\"programmed\\" to do this at a young age. Subsequently, when he owned the Bears, that was how he operated his business. He saw the possibilities of growth of his team and the NFL through the media. He saw the wealth could be generated, mainly in terms of the league as a whole. He was determined to make his franchise the best, and that meant applying those principles that he learned when young (i.e., thrift). But he could also be extremely generous with his money, especially in family/business tragedies like Brian Piccolo, Willie Galimore and others. His line of succession, to take over the Bears, was also something learned from The Old Country, and thrown into pandimonium when his only son died and his son was estranged from Halas. Therefore, it fell to the McCaskeys to carry on the Halas-nurtured Bears into the 21st century, something G.S. Halas would conceivably be turning over in his grave about.The book does no favors at all concerning the McCaskeys; they are depicted as rather ignorant of most things concerning football and especially about the Bears, and greedy, controlling the Bears only for the money and prestige. The accuracy of this, since it was laid on so thickly by the author, makes you wonder if it is really true, but the record and gaffes committed by the Bears over the last 20 years tend to bear the author's characterization out. \\"Papa Bear\\" is a good, absorbing book for the history of the Chicago Bears and how the league got to where it is today, and hits much closer to the heart, mind and soul of George Halas and how he lived that many other biographies and autobiographies that one may find."},{"Title":"Papa Bear : The Life and Legacy of George Halas","review":"What a treat this book is, not only for Bears fans but also for anyone who loves the NFL.

He hasn't forgotten that articles (a, an, the) are parts of English speech, along with other words that make sense in normal conversation. He organizes them all into endearing rhythm and rhyme so personal they grab you and don't let go. I've never been to Alaska, but my imagination was pushed and prodded \\"north 65 latitude degrees\\" so that during that one sitting with his book (cover to cover) I was there.I was there, man, freezing and itching and stinging from the biting flies and mosquitoes, flogging frozen fog at Iditerod, fishing for reds and silvers and kings, soaring over glaciated rivers, working in the villages with my hands while working the bush with my mind, and loving every moment from my easy chair here in Virginia. A fun book. And I loved continuously chuckling and even was surprised by several real belly laughs, all too rare experiences for me these days.

Avoiding the anecdotal short phrases of knowledge that leave the reader open to any interpretation or distortion, Dobson draws from the main areas of everyone's life--whether you be a parent or student--and gives deep and insightful wisdom that has true spiritual substance to it. The values are usually at most a paragraph in length, but one must give credit to the way the words are arranged about pages filled with beautiful and therapeutic pictures of people and breath-taking scenery. As a person, it will give you practical guidance with the capability of changing your life-view, and as a coffee-table book it will probably leave some unsuspecting guest speechless. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A life on film","review":"This isn't just well-written (& no ghost writer!), it's also a wonderful tour of the history of movies from the early 1920's through the mid-60's, when Mary Astor retired from film.She was beautiful and her parents, especially her father, noted early that her looks could be worth money. At the point when it looked like she'd have a shot at the movies, her father quit working and packed the family off to New York to push her career. It was 1921 and she was 15.Astor paints a vivid portrait of herself as the obedient, eager-to-please daughter of a classic pair: stage father/stage mother. She describes the making of movies in detail: the actor/director relationship, the performance process, the role of crew members. She writes of the strict caste system on the set. She relates the good and bad aspects of being under contract: the good was the security, the bad was being assigned to pictures with little say in the matter - and being typecast (MGM cast her as \\"the mother\\" for years).A couple of details are particulary interesting: Astor was able to make the transition from silents to talkies and discusses what that was like for herself and other silent era stars. She also reveals that she was more suited to being a \\"featured player\\" rather than a star because she was never comfortable with the idea of being the one responsible for carrying a picture. Considering she had a domineering father who ran her life with an iron hand, that's not surprising.This is an intriguing inside look at the movie business during more than one Golden Age. She worked with many legendary stars over the years - John Barrymore (who became her first lover), Humphrey Bogart (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\"), Bette Davis (Astor won her Oscar for \\"The Great Lie\\"), and James Dean, with whom she performed on live TV.Highly recommended. Extremely well-written. Intelligent. Insightful."},{"Title":"A life on film","review":"Whether you are a fan of Ms. Astor's work (I am) or not, this book is one of the definitive works on the film industry in it's most influential era. From the 20's into the 1960's Ms. Astor, worked in films along side the legends (Bogart, Barrymore, Davis, Garland, Colman, Robinson etc.)and the contract players alike in everything from classics to everyday potboiler B pictures. Her insights into the art of putting a movie together are fascinating as well as her witty stories about the films she appeared in. If anything, she is overly critical of herself, dismissing some fine work of her own along the way. The hardcover of this book is also loaded with great pictures from the films which show up clearly in this edition. The paperback uses smaller type print and much smaller pictures which diminishes them a bit. The book is out of print now, which is really too bad, (Publishers: are you paying attention here?)but worth seeking out for anyone who would like an insider's story for how films are made as well as the people who made them. It's witty, well written, and a lot of fun to read!"},{"Title":"A life on film","review":"This is a good book, but the Dell paperback edition I bought provided obviously shrunken typeface from the hardcover edition, and it is hard to read, hard on the eyes.It's worth paying more to get OK typeface when paperback editions are not re-set so the typeface is OK in the smaller binding format.This is a real issue people should consider. It's important to be comfortable when reading a book and the size of the typeface is important."},{"Title":"A life on film","review":"My habit seems to be that I have my favorite actors whose films I will watch and collect. Most of the time, I'm only paying attention to the actor I'm interested in, the storyline, the costumes, and the set design. It's those treats you receive when a co-star you hadn't taken the time to notice before, does something that makes you sit up. Case in point is Mary Astor. She did it to me in Red Dust. It was Jean Harlow and Clark Gable I was interested in, but it was Ms. Astor who left an impression. It was the infamous kiss; anyone could ask what the big deal was? To me, she stood out by the way she acted/reacted to Gable's character. I actually felt as if she was really surprised and it was pre-code hot! She did it again in The Maltese Falcon. I watched because of Bogey and I liked the Dashiell Hammett book, but because of Ms. Astor's portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy, I was intrigued by her lying; and she did it again as the aging hooker in Act of Violence (thanks to the great Robert Ryan - who I discovered the same way - for prompting me to initially watch this film). After that, I went back and reviewed all her other films and realized this woman is a very good character actor. She's also a very good writer. After reading her autobiography My Story, I was excited to read her follow up A Life on Film.A Life on Film is Mary Astor's deeply engrossing journal of filmmaking and self-examination on and off camera.Ms. Astor never wanted to be a star and take on the responsibility of carrying a film; she was more comfortable with being a featured player because it was almost a guarantee of longevity and growth as an actor. She grew up before the cameras and progressed from a \\"sweet girl\\" to more mature roles (unfortunately, someone's mother). I think of Myrna Loy who started by playing exotics to becoming \\"the perfect wife.\\" One always had to be labeled. While she recognized the seriousness of filmmaking, she also saw the absurdities of those who made the films (herself included). She was shy, sensitive, perceptive, and very self-deprecating. She calls her early films \\"easily forgotten dreary movie magic.\\" She writes of the boring and formulaic themes that ran through those early films: encountering obstacles but everything comes out all right in the end, the unsexy pairing with milquetoast actors, and the publicity machine one had to deal with (nothing's changed there). But while she pokes fun at her early films, there are chapters where she pays loving tribute to the films that not only made her well-known, but she truly enjoyed making: Red Dust, The Maltese Falcon and another of my absolute all-time favorites, Dodsworth. I was very pleased she had good things to say about favorite follow actors Walter Huston, Ann Harding and Bogey (of course). There is nothing gossipy here; it wasn't needed and she was too much of a lady for that. When she writes of the technical side of films, it's never dry (thank goodness), especially the harsh make-up techniques they had to endure, and special effects (\\"Klieg eyes\\") and I feel it's because of her deep love of the craft. She explains it to you in a way as if she's actually talking to you. The book is chock-full of great photos from her collection and is an excellent read for fans of Ms. Astor, film historians, and anyone interested in the early days of filmmaking.Now, I want to read her novels."},{"Title":"The white calf;: The story of Eagle Child, the Piegan boy, who found a white buffalo calf said to have been sent by the Above Ones","review":"Yesterday I was playing &quot;Indians&quot; with my two boys, 5 and 3 yrs old, and I remembered a book I read back when I was, oh, 7 years old or so.

Yang explores--not the religions or philosophies in China--but rather, their sociology, their development and the impact on the Chinese.Ancestor worship was the fundamental building block long before any other religious influence. \\"The worship of ancestors...contributed substantially to the integration and perpetuation of the family as a basic unit of Chinese society\\" (p 29). Every home had an altar to ancestors, with spirit tablets on which were recorded the illustrious accomplishments of those who had died. Even atheist Confucian philosophers insisted on performing elaborate funeral rituals as an act of piety \\"without belief in the existence of the soul\\" (p 48).At the same time, the dead were abhorred by the majority of Chinese, and even the long, involved funereal rites for a family member who had died were thought of as tainted by evil and considered unlucky, at least by the common man.This is not logical, but the Chinese tended to have little regard for logic, and a great deal of regard for harmony. This is in contrast to the west, where monotheism argued that there was a single God and, therefore, absolute truth in the universe, a truth that could be discovered and applied to life. This explains why modern science developed only in the west.The other fundamental building block in Chinese development was predetermination. A man could not be blamed for the way his life evolved, since the day and hour of his birth had predetermined what would happen to him. \\"The notion of fate tended to breed...resignation even under adverse circumstance\\" (p 55).The Chinese in general were polytheistic, with a wide panoply of agricultural gods, house gods, spirits, and even temples to deified men and heroes.\\"Buddhism was mainly a magical cult, the claim to magical power for Buddhist deities being a major reason for its ability to attract patronage\\" (p 117. In particular, \\"Hinayana Buddhism emphasized attainment of magical power to ward off demonic influences\\" (p 118). Buddhist monasteries grew as people fled taxes and military service. Buddhism also contributed to a belief in the transmigration of souls. And since the state you were given in this life was a result of your earlier behavior, this sanctified the concept of fate.Yet another fundamental building block in Chinese thought was the idea of the 'Mandate of Heaven' (p 128). The ruler held this mandate; heaven had decreed it. This theory was \\"developed in Han times (206 BC to AD 220) by men like Tung Chung-shu\\" (p 139). This, also, bred resignation. \\"Political calamities were not interpreted as a result of defects of the moral ruler, but instead could be explained as expressions of the gods' anger at the misconduct of a certain group of men\\" (p 176).Yang argues that \\"the cult of Confucianism was an important factor in the power of the state and the ethicopolitical order\\" (p 164). Confucianism was strongly antagonistic towards Buddhism, due to Buddhism's renunciation of family ties. Originally it was a philosophy, not a religion, but the Chinese blended Confucian ideals with \\"a subsystem of religious ideas based on belief in Heaven, predeterminism, divination, and the theory of Yin-yang and the Five Elements\\" (p 247).Even the examination system was aided by Chinese belief in fate. \\"Unfairness, favoritism, corruption, and mediocrity of the examination officials\\" (p268) tended to be only part of the equation in Chinese minds. The major part was the will of the gods, the fate, of the person taking the exam.For the common people, Yang says, magic was religion. A poor farmer might pray to Buddha, a Taoist deity, or even scold a child for not living up to Confucian morality. All beliefs were held at the same time, with no effort made to build up a logical theory of religion.Priests tended to occupy a low social position, especially since priests, from whatever cult or sect, rarely had the educational background of a scholar. \\"By functioning as a part of the social institutions religion became a pervading influence without having a strong independent structure itself (p 340)."},{"Title":"Religion in Chinese society: A study of contemporary social functions of religion and some of their historical factors","review":"Yang does a very good job in not only pulling together subject matter for the scholar interested in the subject, but leaves it clear and concise for the layperson as well."},{"Title":"Where Is Grandpa?","review":"This is a largely autobiographical story that is meant to help young people cope with the death of a loved one. (I don't think this point is made in the book, but it was made in a letter I had from the author.) The illustrations have a surreal quality, and remind me a little of Maxfield Parrish's work. When a boy's beloved grandfather dies, he reminisces about the things they did together, the places they went, about what Grandpa meant to him and the family. He struggles with his feelings and finally says, &quot;Where is Grandpa now?&quot; The answer is not very original, but is as good as anyone has ever offered, and it's an answer that may help other young (and maybe not so young) people deal with the death of someone they love. But this is a book that needs to be read to or with a boy or girl, and not merely handed to them to read on their own. Whether it will be of any value to youngsters who have not yet seen Death's work is questionable, but I think it would help those who have."},{"Title":"Where Is Grandpa?","review":"This is the touching story of a boy who has lost his grandfather.

In addition, font and color variations in the Examkrackers books are used to emphasize the most important material. It also helps to break up the monotonous task of reviewing... My only complaint is with the &quot;1001 questions...&quot; volumes. While EK's pick the toughest stand-alone questions, there are no passage-based questions in the &quot;1001 questions...&quot; series.

This text touches upon only the most applicable subjects for the test.I now use the audio osmosis cd's to listen to the lectures while reading the charts and brief text in this book to study bio. While I think the book is pretty and a fast read I think the audio osmosis CDs are important to use with the book - but this is just my learning style.

At precisely the correct level of detail, Orsay takes the reader through each part of the MCAT Biology curriculum, emphasizing the important elements, breezing through the minutiae, organizing everything so that it is easy to process and remember.

Ted may not have had the sophistication of a Joe DiMaggio but after this read you'll respect Williams a hell of a lot more than Joltin Joe. You'll love this book"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have always been intrigued by Ted Williams. As a baseball fan, who can't? My college baseball coaches played for Williams when he was manager of the Washington Senators and Texas Rangers, which made this book all the more interesting to me.I am glad that Montville didn't spend the majority of the book on his baseball days, though, because other books have done that. Try &quot;Hitter&quot; if you want details of the baseball career. I was more interested in his post career life and since much of the book is about that and the writing style of Montville is so readable, I really enjoyed the book.In my opinion, Ted Williams is an American Hero, an icon. Very few people can ever boast of the accomplishments that Ted achieved. Yet to me, Ted is a tragic figure. With all his accomplishments, he was a bad father and a bad husband, but his giving to those in need helped so many people. He really didn't think very much of his mother, but I can't help compare ted's life to hers. Both gave themselves over completely to their own desires and passions while ignoring family. Ted hated his mother for this and yet he did the same thing, only the passions were different.To me, Ted's life was an enigma. I agree with the other reviewer who wrote about how disturbing Ted's views of Jesus were. As a Christian, they disturbed me too. But at the same time, I can understand why he was so angry. His mother basically was never around. Ted and his brother were practically abandoned because their mother spent SO much time doing God's work, that she had no time for her own kids. I can see where Ted viewed God as the enemy. I believe he felt unloved and neglected because of God. I believe the anger (especially toward God) began right then, as a child and carried all the way to the grave. To me, that is tragic! It grieves me that Ted presumably never found peace with God and I wish he had.As a ballplayer, I'd want him on my team. As a soldier, I'd want him on my side. As a fisherman, not many better. As a giver of his time and energy to the needy and the &quot;small person&quot;, terrific. Most every other part of his life had warts, but who doesn't. This book covers it all and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get to know the life of Mr. Williams. I give high regards to Leigh Montville's work here. Therefore, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This is a fascinating and illuminating book about a talented baseball player, a military hero, and a cantankerous curmudgeon - Ted Williams. Montville does a terrific job of encapsulating the Splendid Splinter's eventful 83 years into a fascinating 500-page book, complete with nearly a hundred black-and-white photographs, many never before seen. If you're looking for a biography of Ted Williams this is probably the one to get; it covers his entire life, something that his 1969 autobiography doesn't do (obviously).Montville doesn't shine much new light onto the Public Ted - any true baseball fan is already familiar with his battles with the media, his 406 average in 1941, his weak performance in the 1946 World Series, the two military interruptions to his baseball career, his storybook home run in his final at-bat, etc. We already knew that stuff. Where the book truly shines is in illuminating the Private Ted...The selfish Ted, who'd drag uninterested wives along with him on fishing trips, and who'd rather be alone in a boat somewhere than be present for his children's births; his lustful enjoyment of his hobbies was more important than his family. The angry and blasphemous Ted, who'd spit at fans and frequently (and colorfully) take the Lord's name in vain with a smattering of the f-word and his favorite modifier, &quot;syphilitic.&quot; The lonely Ted, who married three beautiful trophy wives, had teammates and friends all over the country, yet still lacked the unconditional love he desperately needed. Somehow Montville manages to paint Williams as sympathetic, lovable, and even heroic, while still telling the story of a bitter and cranky man.Thankfully, there were at least a few caring people in Ted's life to help diffuse his negativity and give him unconditional love: Louise Kaufman, the grandmotherly woman who became Ted's longtime companion after his three failed marriages to younger women, and the male nurses who took care of him during his final decade on Earth.Sadly, the book (like Williams's life) ends on an unavoidable down-note. Montville frightens us with the awful tale of Ted's money-grubbing son, John-Henry. Here the author fairly throws objectivity aside, painting the younger Williams in tones reminiscent of Shakespeare's Iago. John-Henry's underhanded machinations and obvious treatment of Ted as a meal ticket rather than a beloved father left me feeling sad and depressed at the story's end. Junior was more concerned with his progenitor's ability to sign and sell valuable autographs than his comfort and welfare during his declining years. The demon seed of Ted Williams kept his father's friends and loved ones from calling and visiting, and then - in an act which violated Ted's wish for cremation, as per his will - John-Henry had his father cryogenically frozen after his death. Thus began the fighting and infinite court proceedings between Ted's offspring - an embarrassing and surreal coda to a life otherwise lived with integrity and dignity.A great book about a great man. As sports biographies go, it's surely one of the best - just like Ted.(News update: John-Henry Williams, 35, died of leukemia in March 2004. Perhaps now the legal maneuvering will stop; perhaps Ted can at last be cremated and have his ashes spread across the waters of Florida, just as he wanted. Meanwhile, thanks to John-Henry, the decapitated head of Ted Williams remains in a frozen vat in Arizona.)"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"A must read for any Bostonian, or New Englander for that matter.

And frankly, I was not even a Ted Williams fan before I picked it up. I knew very little about him and didn't remember him, having been born in 1961.

This book goes beyond the person and gives glimpses of the times."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"A 2007 summer reading list mini reviewTed Williams had a simple hitting philosophy: get a good pitch to hit. In Leigh Montville's riveting biography of the splendid splinter we learn about his legendary patience at the plate. We infer that patience translated in his life long love of sports fishing. Ultimately, we do not see that same patience in his personal life: swinging and missing in 3 of 4 marriages, not connecting in fatherhood much better.Mistakes in baseball especially for a career .344 hitter with over 500 homeruns don't have many residual effects. Relational miscues are less static and often lead to more consequences.

This is not to say that the story is sugar-coated: Williams flaws and foibles are presented, along with the things that made him great. Ted Williams is shown as a man who was very self-centered, often immature, impulsive, bad-tempered and difficult to get along with (some of the detail around his 3 failed marriages is painful), but also a hero marine pilot who saw combat in 2 wars, a good friend to many, a generous person with both time and money (especially when it came to kids), and probably the greatest hitter in the history of major league baseball. I heartily recommend this book. Thanks Leigh!"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Greatest Hitter ever, and this gbook tells who his story and how serious he took he craft. Very intersting and worth buying"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Perhaps the first important thing to understand about this fine book is that it is not principally a baseball book. Only roughly one-third of it covers Ted Williams's major league career. The rest of the book focuses not only on other events - his fishing expeditions, his struggles in family relationships, his financial entanglements among them - but also on painting a vivid personality portrait.Much of the book is built upon oral interviews Montville conducted with people who personally knew Ted Williams. Montville does not attempt to hide or significantly transform those building blocks in his narrative - a great deal of the book consists of direct quotes from those offering their personal remembrances. In one place a transcript of an interview with Ted William's third wife Dolores (this one not conducted by Montville) is reproduced entirely verbatim, though extending for several pages. By contrast, much of the day-by-day of Williams's playing career is presented in highly summarized form. In some places whole seasons are condensed into very brief, cursory treatments.The book is no less interesting for this, though I as a fan wanted more material about the drama of baseball games and pennant races. I found myself feeling that my wife (who is not a baseball fan) would enjoy it. This is basically a portrait of a man who comes of age having developed one passion - to be the best in the world at what he did, which in his case was hitting a baseball. Essentially abandoned by his father, ignored by his mother, the young Williams took refuge in obsessing over how to hit. He received tutelage from friendly older male figures (and indeed never seemed to learn fully how to relate to the opposite sex). The young Williams practiced hitting endlessly, even working constantly to train his visual skills when away from the baseball diamond.He mastered certain things in life - how to break down a problem, analyze it, master it, practice it, excel at it - but never fully understood the rudiments of critical human relationships. He never learned to control his temper. Nor could he understand the ways of those journalists who made sport of tearing down those of high athletic achievement. Sometimes one recoils from Williams's personality, but I felt mostly empathy for him. He was clearly a highly intelligent man even if largely uneducated, as evidenced by his ability to analyze problems ranging from hitting to fishing to combat aviation. He gave generously to family members even when he had little to offer in terms of personal guidance. He was relentless in his determination to comfort afflicted children, from the kids who benefited from his Jimmy Fund, to a young lady he met late in his life who had suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage.Sadly, Williams' failure to form strong family relationships meant that he was ultimately betrayed and exploited by his own kin in his final years. The last few chapters are painful to read, as he is made to sign endless autographs for his son's financial purposes, is dragged to a baseball function practically from his deathbed, and is finally placed in cryonic storage and his remains brutalized. The whole story reads as a terrible tragedy, a genuine hero undone by his flaws. I came away from the book appreciating Williams for the rare excellence that he represented in his chosen areas, and believing that his life had shown him little of the mercy he warranted for his entirely forgivable mistakes."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This book follows the life of Red Sox legend Ted Williams. It starts with Williams as a kid in San Diego, and follows him even after his death. Along the way, it gives an intimate, behind the scenes look at his life. It discusses his relationships with his family, the media, his friends, and the Boston fans. It follows him as a minor leaguer, a fighter pilot, a superstar, a manager, and as a living icon. It adds fresh interviews to the mountains of information already out there on the Splendid Splinter. Along the way, the reader can see how all these experiences wove into the person many people thought they knew.I am too young to have been a Ted Williams \\"fan.\\" By the time I came around, he had even finished his managerial career. I was certainly aware of Ted Williams the legend, but never had the connection to him that those of previous generations would. So, I enjoyed this book a great deal do to all the information it provided. It was fascinating to see how everything built. I had always heard he hated the media, and now I knew why. I had heard he was booed at Fenway, and now I know the reasons. Ted was an immense talent who was seen as selfish by the fans, not a real team player. He detested the media intruding into his life. But, he sure could hit. As with any biography, you'll probably like Ted a little less after reading the book than you did before.

His antics on and off the field were legendary, as were his breaks from baseball to serve in both World War II and Korea. And, of course, his relationship with his children, especially son John Henry, led to headlines long after his career and life were over.\\"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero\\" by Leigh Montville is a wonderfully written look at the colorful Williams. Montville covers all aspects of Williams's life, from his childhood and troubled relationship with his parents (especially his mother), his career in Boston, his tumultuous relationship with Boston sports writers, his life after baseball, his troubled relationship with his children, and of course his controversial freezing after his death. Williams was a complex man and Montville does his best to show what made Williams tick. It's not an easy task, Williams was prickly and had two sides to his personality - the public Ted and the private Ted. By the end of the book you will both love and hate Williams - you'll love the public Ted that associated so well with fans (at least off the field and especially the young ones - Williams was instrumental in helping the Jimmy Fund, which supports young cancer patients, get off the ground) and hate the private Ted, who made life difficult for those around him.For the most part, Montville is objective in his writing, treating both the private Ted and public Ted even-handedly and making no excuses for his behavior. But his objectivity slips near the end of the book when he discusses Williams's son John Henry. It's clear that Montville doesn't like John Henry. As much as your feelings for Ted may waver throughout the book, by the end you can't help but feel sorry for him and the way his family treated him the last few years of his life.\\"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero\\" is an interesting look at a complex man."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Leigh Montville digs deep into the life of Ted Williams to discover what it takes to become the best. As we find out Williams' case, it was at the expense of his family and Montville gives an honest portrayal of a true baseball icon. Ted Williams was larger than life -- but he was still human and Monville isn't afraid to show the flaws. Williams was a complicated man for people to understand and mostly because he wasn't going to conform to what he was 'supposed to do'. This book is a must if you're a sports fan and even if you're not its good story of success against the odds."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Growing up in the 1950's in a suburb of Boston, I was a huge Ted Williams fan. I had read Ed Linn's earlier book about Williams so I figured that Montville was simply going to rehash all the information of which I was already aware. That turned out to be a huge mistake as Montville got into a great deal of description of Willams's personal life off the ballfield. In fact, Williams is through as a ball player half way through the book. Williams was always portrayed as a war hero who willing went off to serve his country. Montville develops a more balanced approach, particularly with regard to the Korean war. Montville also sheds a great deal of light on Williams's three marriages and his relationship with a fourth woman whom Williams did not marry but probably understood Williams better than the three women he did marry.I came away from the book with a different perspective of the man. He was seriously flawed in some respects - especially with regard to the treatment of his two daughters. And yet he could be unbelievably generous to people, giving time and money to those who suffered from afflictions. The book confirmed my boyhood impression that Williams was larger than life.This book is a great read about a fascinating character. You don't even have to be a baseball fan to enjot it - although that will help."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"The problem with most sports books is that they come off as one long box score, with just the most basic personal information, usually written at the Jr. High School level.Leigh Montville has a home run(pardon the pun)with this book. A real, complete, mature biography. Williams from birth to death bed, in a fair and balanced fashion--what a biography is supposed to be. It is too easy to either idolize the subject of a biography, or to tear them down by airing all their diry laundry. To his credit, Montville does neither. Ted Williams comes off as an amazing athlete, pilot and fisherman. A perfectionist man's man, who often jumped to the aid of the sick and down and out. A lousy father and poor husband. A cranky individualist who didn't always like people around, but who nevertheless would be there for you in a second if times were bad.In short, a human being, a man. Telling that life story is what a biography is all about.With the people who knew Ted in his prime growing old, this will probably turn out to be the definitive Ted Williams book. Thanks to Leigh Montville for getting it right."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I enjoyed the book and would buy it again. Having said that the book only rates 4 stars because the author spends too much time - in my opinion - on non baseball issues after Ted Williams had retired.Here is my rational. This is a detailed biography written by the former Boston Globe sports columnist Leigh Montville using a combination of many interviews and lots of background research. He puts it all together with a nice selection of photos to produce a detailed and comprehensive biography of Ted Williams. It is about 500 pages long and remarkably fair. Although the book is 500 pages long the author dedicates only about 175 pages or 1/3 to his actual playing career. The rest covers a lot of detail on some crazy subjects such as the \\"Refrigeration\\" and his other marriages or many fishing trips. I think the book would have been better with more baseball and less post baseball, but that is my opinion that it deserves just 4 stars for him as a player but maybe 5 stars as a \\"personal\\" biography covering his whole life. But I bought the book as a baseball fan so as a baseball book it gets 4 stars.I have read and posted reviews on other baseball books from David Cone to Pete Rose, Babe Ruth and DiMaggio, and on the Oakland A's, Cooperstown, and the Cal Ripkin's book on baseball skills recently published. This book is similar in quality and scope of the DiMaggio book \\"The Hero's Life\\" - a book that I thought was excellent and sparked controversy about DiMaggio's personal life - and interestingly covers the same time period including that famous 1941 season when Williams broke 400 in Boston while DiMaggio had the 56 game streak with the Yankees.The book is somewhat similar to the DiMaggio book - in that it gives a fairly well researched and informative picture on and off the field. There is much to discuss about the book such as his exhibition game with Babe Ruth, the 1946 world series, his days in the marines air corps, Korea, etc. But again, the book covers a lot more than baseball. It is 500 pages long and by page 260 the vote is in and he is on his way to Cooperstown, so it covers him to the end of his life in detail with about half on his post playing career. His actual MLB playing is covered in about one third of the book and for myself those sections where he is playing for Boston are the most interesting parts of the book, and I skipped a couple of late chapters, I had read enough, and did not need to read 35 pages on the \\"Refrigeration\\" episode at the end of the book and similar stories about fishing or other marriages.In comparing him to DiMaggio it is clear that Williams was more of a loner on the field than even the reserved DiMaggio, no matter what either did off the field. Williams has a complex and thin skinned personality. He takes time to help many young fans and sick children and for that he is loved and admired. He is bigger than life. Unfortunately, and even though in some ways Williams is likeable in the book, Williams reminds me of some modern players that are often surly around the press, sometimes poison in the dressing room, and seem more interested in their personal contract than the win loss record of their own team. We are told in the book that sometimes it was clear that team's winning came second to his personal performance in determining his post game mood in the clubhouse. But taking that to the next step and saying that is why they never won a World Series is not 100% clear since Boston did not seem to have the player roster depth of other teams like the Yankees, and Williams had an elbow injury during the 46 World Series - the best Boston shot of winning that championship when he played - and when he had his so called \\"choke\\". So it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion from the book. In any case, he is one of the best hitters to have ever played, and if he had been a Yankee I am sure he would have been on many winning teams.Quite good and I learned a lot about Ted Williams and baseball, but I skipped most of the last half, the personal trivia."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Ever since my Little League-youth, when my grandfather used to regale us with tales of the Splendid Splinter, I've always considered Ted Williams my favorite of the Greats. So I was excited to see this book released but found it disappointing.Montville tries to be too artsy with his style: one-word sentences, one-word paragraphs, lots of repetition. For the most part, the prose is readable, but it clashes with the book's subject, who was many things, maybe even a bit of a rebel, but not artsy.Worse, for a book that approaches 500 pages of text, it is surprisingly superficial. Williams's World War II service gets a chapter, as does his more eventful Korean War experience; both chapters are thin and barely scratch the surface. Even the 1941 season (.406!!) gets lean treatment. I like the parallel he tries to draw with Joe DiMaggio (The Streak!!)--Montville writes, \\"Edge: DiMaggio\\" or \\"Edge: Williams\\"--but I wish he would have explored it more.Before the book is halfway through, Williams retires from playing (the chapter on his last game is probably the book's best; Montville nicely captures the atmosphere of The Kid's famous last at bat--and no tip of the hat), and the book then focuses on his marriages, his fishing, his work for Sears, as well as a fair amount of gossip-type stories. The main character of the second part is Ted's son John-Henry. At times, Ted drops out entirely as Montville recounts the life and despicable behavior of the son, who used his father as a money-making machine.I finished knowing more about John-Henry than Ted. Too often, Montville lets his sources speak for themselves rather than crafting a narrative from his interviews. The end result is a very distant portrait of Williams; we see him mostly and explicitly through other people's eyes. I'll stick with My Turn at Bat."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Leigh Montville has compiled a wonderful biography of one of baseball's most enigmatic players, and perhaps the game's greatest hitter of all-time---Ted Williams. Clearly, the author has a great deal of respect for Williams' hitting prowess; however, he gives a balanced perspective on the human side of the player; a man with a short temper and generally sullen attitude towards his teammates, fans, and sportswriters. Certainly, this attitude probably cost him the MVP Award on at least a couple of occasions, most notably in 1941, when all he did was hit .406 that year.Williams was driven by a passion to be the greatest hitter to play the game, and amassed an impressive .344 lifetime batting average, with a tremendous amount of raw power; his productivity as a hitter was nothing short of incredible. Unlike a guy like Ty Cobb, who hit for a higher average, but used his blazing speed to beat out many hits; Williams hit slashing lines drives with startling consistency throughout his career, which was shortened substantially by his frequent stints as a Navy fighter pilot. This was a true war hero and a man's man.Certainly, Ted Williams could be an unpleasant guy to deal with, especially when anyone questioned his character or his desire to play hard. He was frequently at odds with the fans, especially during his tumultuous early years, and his gruff personality didn't endear himself to the sportswriters covering the team.But to the people who were close to this man, Ted Williams was a man of strong character; possessing a level of honesty & integrity seldom seen in anyone. He simply lacked tact; not good moral values. Anyone who didn't see that, didn't matter, as far as Williams was concerned.Whether or not you liked him as a person, it's clear this man was driven with a passion for excellence and had a moral fiber that few men possessed; the sad truth is, few truly understood that fact.Montville's biography sheds some light on the true character of this baseball legend, who played the game at a level very few have accomplished; and who truly was a good man, down to his core; and a true American hero."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Leigh Montville paints a brilliant portrait in words of the man who wanted to be remembered as the greatest hitter who ever lived. Ted Williams deserves to be on the short list of baseball's greatest hitters, and he easily deserved his hall of fame induction, where he was the first prominent white man to publicly call for recognition for negro leaguers Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson.Ted WAS a great hitter, and he had many other desirable qualities as well, giving generously of his time and money to charity and serving his country TWICE during the peak of his baseball powers, losing five major league seasons to WWII and Korea. We can only speculate how many more hits and homers Ted might have had if not for those lost years.But Montville shows us the warts as well. We see an arrogant young Ted who cared ONLY about hitting and only took the field because that got him his turn at bat. He considered pitchers contemptuously and Montville gives several examples where the great hitter gave priority to HIS individual achievement over less important matters, such as his team winning.Gifted with an extraordinary mind, Ted was nonetheless minimally educated and when he had opportunities to \\"get away with things\\" because of how well he could hit, Ted took every opportunity.I agree with another reviewer who wrote that Ted's career is not chronicled as well as his later years. The last hundred pages are about the pathetic final years of the great hitter's life when son John Henry used his father's name and money to finance one failed business venture after another. After Ted's death Montville describes John Henry's nearly desperate efforts to have Ted frozen at a cryonic center in Arizona, for the speculative reason that there might still be another buck in it for John-Henry. In a cruel twist of fate, John-Henry was stricken prematurely with leukemia and joined his father in frozen perpetuity.To present a biography of such a man is a daunting task, and Montville succeeds admirably. No doubt some of the unwieldy nature of this volume comes as a result of the volumes of research done by the author and an unwillingness to pare the passages that could use a prune.Universally acknowledged today as one of baseball's greatest - the last man to hit over .400 and one of the small number of players with over 500 home runs - before steroids and with five years lost to the Marines, Ted nonetheless had the personality that made baseball writers, for example, choose Joe Gordon as MVP in 1942, even though Ted won the triple crown, leading the league in batting average, home runs and runs batted in. How ticked off would the writers have to be to give such an award to someone else when you've led the league in EVERY major hitting category? Ted Williams did that to some people.A baseball hero - but a cautionary tale also of a man who was often not a role model."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"What Richard Cramer did for a biography on Joe DiMaggio, Leigh Montville has done for a biography on Ted Williams. The book is nearly 500 pages long, and I remained riveted to it until I finished it in a few days. All facets of Ted's personality, warts and all, are included in providing us with information on Ted's dysfunctional family, his love of fishing on the Florida Keys and the Miramichi River in New Brunswick, his initial success in managing the Washington Senators, his hair trigger temper that produced a string of profanities, his difficulties with his marriage partners, and his experiences in World War II and the Korean War. In regard to baseball his obsession with hitting led to his goal of being known as the greatest hitter that ever lived. Ted paid the price to reach his goal in studying hitting as no other hitter has ever done before. He enjoyed picking the brain of Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby who told Williams the secret in hitting is getting a good ball to hit. By this he meant getting ahead in the count (2-0 or 3-1) so the pitcher was put in a situation where he would throw the pitch you, the batter, would be looking for to hit. The book is full of anecdotes of Williams's teammates and opponents from his playing days. It also includes the controversial freezing of Williams's body by son John Henry and sister Claudia while Williams's first child, Bobby-Jo opposed it. Whether Ted, himself, approved of this is left open to question. To me, an interesting story is told by one of his nurses, Virginia Hiley-Self, a Christian, said that Ted Williams accepted the fact that God forgives and provides eternal life. \\"He prayed,\\" Hiley-Self says. \\"He knew that Christ was his savior.\\" I have read other biographies of \\"Teddy Ballgame\\", but this effort by Leigh Montville stands above the others. Williams's last few years were marred by poor health, but he lived a full life serving his country in two wars, carving out a Hall of Fame baseball career, and fishing for game fish on the Florida Keys and for salmon on the Miramichi River. His was a life fully lived and Leigh Montville has done a wonderful job in presenting all sides of the personality of Ted Williams. To me, this rates as the top baseball book of the year, and maybe even the top biography of anyone for the year."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Leigh Montville's biography of Ted Williams is exhaustive in its analysis of one of baseball's greatest hitters. At times childish and self-absorbed, but always focused upon his art, Ted Williams emerges as a troubled genius in this wonderful book. Some of the anecdotes about Williams' intensity evoke a character who loves a few things in life to obsessive delight while ignoring almost everyone and everything else. An absolute master in the science of hitting a baseball, Williams loves his talent and nourishes it in a way that illuminates how beautiful, powerful, and fragile is the human desire to achieve greatness. A must for baseball fans.Donald Gallinger is the author ofThe Master Planets"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"There's no part of Leigh Montville's biography of Ted Williams that is not excellent. In a baseball literature field typically dominated by vapid autobiographies (speaking of which, I just finished Don Zimmer's second book), few third-person bios merit repeat readings. In the last 30 years, books about Babe Ruth, Mo Berg and Sandy Koufax probably own the top of the field. Of course, each of those books used wildly differing approaches. Robert Creamer took an almost mythical approach to The Babe (\\"The Legend Comes To Life\\"), and hurries through his final, post-baseball years in literally a dozen pages. Nicholas Dawidoff's take on Moe Berg, on the other hand, uses baseball almost as prelude to the heart of the book, Berg's bizarre late-life wanderings.The strength of Montville's meticulously written book is that any random chapter is equally fascinating, whether it's about baseball, World War II or Korea, Williams' active role as a Sears spokesman and board member, his fishing life, or his prolonged demise. The baseball chapters are refreshingly free of prolonged statistical parsing. The accuracy of many anecdotes is left up to the reader; the book, as fits a popular biography, is not footnoted, and it seems as if Montville relies heavily on probably embellished stories from Williams' acquaintances and their children. This provides the same mythical air as in Creamer's book (and the Babe himself makes a ghostly cameo here as well).For my money, though, the creepiest, and therefore most memorable, part of the book is the final three chapters, covering Williams' troubled final eight years. This equals the closing chapters of the Mo Berg book. Montville, whose writing occasionally verged on the florid or melodramatic, has a clear intent here -- in an almost literary device, he introduces John-Henry Williams to the story by way of voiceover. John-Henry did not provide an interview for the book, and was dead by the time it hit the stores. His lone representation comes from his lawyers, who spend more time assailing his betrayed half-sister Bobbie-Jo Ferrell than in justifying (or even explaining) his unusual actions. Therefore, you can't walk away from this book with any ounce of sympathy for John-Henry. I tried to feel sorry for him at the end, truth be told. Almost did, but not quite.Ted Williams' head in a freezer. There's more to the story than just that -- Montville spends most of three chapters covering the extended decline and fall of John-Henry's media empire, and sometimes seems to go out of his way to find people to declare John-Henry a creep even based on limited interaction from two decades ago. However, Montville allows another creepy, ghoulish episode -- one of Ted's nurses declaring that she delivered him to Jesus and saved his soul, even while Ted was near to death and, based on other evidence in the book, long past his final moments of lucidity -- without the critical comment it so richly deserved. John-Henry was not the only one trying to write himself into the Williams legacy.While the last three chapters are dark, \\"Death of a Salesman\\" dark, the epilogue, a selection of Williams anecdotes, will definitely bring a smile. Now out on the market is a book and audio CD from John Underwood, who co-wrote Williams' own books. That becomes a must-own item, but Montville himself writes so clearly that you can practically hear Williams' booming laugh rising from the page.An astonishing read."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This is a magnificent book.It is difficult to delineate why this book is so special. Perhaps the book succeeds based on the fact that Ted Williams was a much larger than life person, with great achievements, extraordinary character, heroic courage, and tragic flaws. Or, the book could be so wonderful because of the writing talents of Leigh Montville. Either way, this book is appealing to a wide range of readers: Red Sox fans, baseball followers, or even those who have a general interest in the history of 20th century America.As a sports book, this is a gem. And as a biography, it is exceptional.Although not as well known as a David Halberstam or David Remnick, I feel confident in saying that Leigh Montville is as great a writer and biographer. Among those who have followed his work for decades with the Boston Globe and Sports Illustrated, Montville is known as the sportswriter's writer. When you want to see a very unusual feature story, or a conventional story with a unique point of view, Montville is the writer to read. This is a \\"sports\\" book which could well qualify for all of the biography book awards this year.You will not regret putting this book at the top of your reading list. Wonderful work! TEN stars!"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Ted Williams was the greatest hitters in baseball history. But there is so much more to him than baseball. Leigh Montville's biography is comendable on many levels, though far from perfect. Four and a half stars would be more adequate rating than I gave the book. Still the book is worth the price.The books starts out jumping all over the place, making the story hard to follow. But once it begins the chronological story of his life, the book is well written. Montville plainly writes of the childhood neglect that influenced Williams life. The absence of his parents is largely the reason he behaved so immaturely early in his career. He was not used to living with rules, so the structure of professional baseball was an adjustment that caused a talented player to spend an extra year in the minors. Ted's only focus was baseball during his youth and career. He always picked people's brains, learning from anywhere he could about hitting. His dedication made people take notice. It is also how he developed his philosophy of hitting. Winning triple crowns and hitting .400 were among his great achievements. He would have hit .400 more than once if batting average were figured as it is today with sacrifices and walks not hurting the average. John Wayne was an actor, but Ted Williams lived the role. He served his country during World War II and the Korean War. Had Williams not sacrificed those years for his country, we would surpassed Ruth's home run record and no doubt other records as well. Yet he is still recognized as the greatest hitter in baseball history.During his career the media gave the public the impression that Williams was a bad apple. But during his late career and in retirement, the public saw otherwise. Williams did have a foul mouth. His works of charity tell where his heart was. Knowing the good human being he was, it is unfortunate to read how his final years were spend. The way his son manipulated him is beyond shameful.Despite the somber note most biographies end with, Montville had a different approach. He ended the book with an epilogue that is a collection of humorous antidotes with Williams as the star. It is wonderful that the book did not end on the same note as Ted's life."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Leigh Montville's biography presented quite the conundrum for this reader. Quite extensive (weighing in at just over 500 pages) the book is crammed full of wonderful anectdotes that give a great look at both the positive and negative aspects of Ted Williams the man and player. It also contains more information on his post-baseball life than most biographies do. What bothered me about the book though was the numerous mistakes in key dates from Williams' life. Montville's book lists the wrong month for Williams' birth, the wrong date for his first homer, his first 2-homer game, opening day 1942, and even the wrong date for his wedding to Doris Soule (just to name a few). If you are only looking for a book that brings you a closer look at Ted Williams personality, then this is the book for you, but, if you are a stickler for details, then perhaps stick with the earlier biographies by Ed Linn and Michael Seidel which do not suffer from so very many errors."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Throughout his 19-year career with the Boston Red Sox, Ted Williams was perpetually in quest of the perfect batting stroke. Wherever he went, Williams would be swinging a bat. Or a cardboard tube. Or a hotel pillow. Or a rolled-up magazine.In his mind, he could see the ball approaching from 60 feet, 6 inches, spinning and cutting and whirling toward home plate until -- thwack! -- Williams swung away. His friends understood. That was just Ted. Crazy Teddy.The thing is, Williams was chasing the impossible dream of a 1.000 batting average. Though he expected to drive the ball every time he dug into the batter's box, the best he could do was hit .406 in 1941. No man has batted above .400 since.Much like Williams' successful pursuit to become known as the best hitter who ever lived, there has long been an effort to write the definitive Williams biography. Throughout the years, no fewer than 10 authors have taken cracks at Williams' life. The best -- Ed Linn's &quot;Hitter: The Life and Turmoils of Ted Williams&quot; -- is fantastic. Others -- Michael Seidel's &quot;Ted Williams: A Baseball Life&quot; and &quot;I Remember Ted Williams&quot; by David Cataneo -- come up short for one reason or another.In &quot;Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero,&quot; Leigh Montville reaches a threshold even the mighty Williams could never touch: perfection. If his book is not the best baseball biography ever written, that's only because there are a handful (Jane Leavy's &quot;Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy&quot; and Richard Ben Cramer's &quot;Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life&quot; come to mind) at an equally outstanding level.Montville interviewed more than 400 people for the project, and it shows. &quot;Ted Williams&quot; leaves absolutely no stone of its subject's life unturned, from his boyhood in a modest San Diego neighborhood to his final hours at a hospital in Inverness, Fla., three years ago. The beauty of Montville's work is that it is not a baseball book, per se, so much as the life and times of -- like DiMaggio, Williams' greatest rival throughout the 1940s -- an oft-perplexing, always fascinating man.We are presented a Williams who is as loud and obnoxious as Babe Ruth at his inebriated best, who strings together four-letter words with impressive indecency and wages a career- long battle with the Boston media that borders on militant. Williams could be biting and irrational and childish, as well as unforgivably selfish. How else to describe a person who intentionally missed the births of his three children to go fishing?Yet Montville makes it impossible to hate Williams. There is a genuine decency to the man, and it has little to do with his work as a U.S. Marine pilot during World War II and Korea (Williams, Montville tells us, did everything he could not to fight) or his three-year tenure as a cuddly major league manager. No, what brings the likeability to light are the little things. Williams, who refused ever to wear a tie, once ordered lunch at a stuffy country club dining room -- tie required. Writes Montville: &quot;He tucked his napkin into his V-necked T-shirt. ... The soup arrived. He picked up the bowl and started drinking. The excess soup rolled down the napkin, across the front of the T-shirt. He finished the bowl, walked out and never returned.&quot;When he wasn't barking at pitchers or slurping soup, Williams could often be found at hospitals, visiting children's wards for hours on end. Unlike DiMaggio, whose good deeds were always accompanied by a price tag, Williams never refused the chance to sit bedside and chat with a dying kid.In painful detail, Montville recalls a time when a young boy grabbed Williams' finger and wouldn't let go. Instead of pulling away, the legendary hitter stayed the night. It is impossible not to recall this goodness late in the book, when we learn that Williams' money-obsessed son, John-Henry, is having his dad's body preserved in a cryonics factory, the hope being that one day people will purchase his DNA for cloning. How, Montville asks the reader, can such a grim fate await such a great man?The book is something of a career homecoming for Montville, who grew up near Boston worshiping &quot;Teddy Ballgame&quot; and vividly recalls receiving an autographed postcard from Williams in the mail. In Beantown, Montville is considered one of the great all-time newspaper columnists for his 21 years at the Boston Globe. He was, however, an odd fit at Sports Illustrated in the late 1990s, when the magazine's stories got shorter and shorter and there was less of an emphasis on athletic nostalgia.Since leaving SI in 2001, Montville has turned exclusively to authoring books. The move was a good one. He is a writer who likes to stretch out a paragraph with longer than usual quotes and vividly painted portraits. In the world of chop-chop print journalism, such attributes (sadly) don't seem to have a place anymore. But here, on the pages of &quot;Ted Williams,&quot; Montville is at his very best. It's a good thing. The legacy of Ted Williams deserves nothing less.Jeff Pearlman is the author of &quot;The Bad Guys Won!&quot; a biography of the 1986 New York Mets."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"When I sat down and asked myself what I most remembered from this biography, my very first recollection involved a lizard and a spider. To put this in perspective, the lizard was consuming the spider in the Washington Senators' dugout during a Florida spring training game. Manager Ted Williams, fascinated by this, commanded all the players on the bench to join him in watching this little drama of nature unfold. The Senator then batting, Mike Epstein, struck out and was berated by Williams--not for striking out, but for scaring away the lizard when he returned to the dugout.Although the comparisons between Williams and Joe DiMaggio have been beaten into the ground, it is hard to find another player like Williams in the history of the game. Throughout this work I found myself comparing Williams to Mickey Mantle. They have much in common, the greatest similarity being the \\"what if?\\" factor. What if Mantle had not injured his knees? What if Williams had not missed so many prime years in the service? What if both men had devoted themselves to becoming well-rounded players?The baseball player Williams comes across here as somewhat one-dimensional. His batting feats are well known, of course. But he was not particularly fast, and his outfield play was a subject of some concern. He was switched from center field to left field early in his career to make room for the far superior fielder Dom DiMaggio. He was a moody player who on occasion did not run out grounders or chase batted balls aggressively. He would never be confused with a Joe Morgan or a Derek Jeter, men who mastered every aspect of their game and understand the playing field as a giant chessboard.But in fairness to Williams, he played for an organization that was somewhat unfocused itself. Montville portrays the Boston Red Sox as something of a family operation, an easy going boozy ownership and management that lacked the crisp, businesslike demeanor of their greatest rivals, the New York Yankees. Montville contends that when Williams joined the Sox in the late 1930's, the organization exploited him at a time when he could have used a Tony LaRussa or a Joe Torre to explain the reality of life to this young star. Instead, the Red Sox manipulated its lineup and the park dimensions themselves to milk more Williams home runs from his mighty bat. Expectations were set by the hard boiled Boston press and ultimately the fans, putting Williams in a no win situation. Even his 1941 phenomenal .406 season never warmed public sentiment. After World War II, when the Red Sox roster included Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky, among others, the Sox were perennial bridesmaids to the Yankees [or occasionally to the Indians], a highly talented team without the killer instinct. When Williams returned to the team after the Korean War, the veterans were gone and for his last seasons Williams played alongside bonus babies who never developed star potential.Born in San Diego to a guitar-strumming mother on perpetual evangelical crusades, Williams never received appropriate adult focus and structure as he grew up. A creature of impulse, he developed into a demanding young man who liked his gratifications promptly and his will unobstructed. He was capable of prolonged grudges against individuals and organizations. His three marriages were by all accounts unmitigated disasters, and it is fair to say that Williams' cruelties toward his wives was repaid in kind by their offspring in his twilight years. His cursing was as remarkable as his hitting; the blasphemous edge to it shocked even veteran players.This is not to say that Williams was a scoundrel. He was highly patriotic and served his country twice with distinction. He had many friends among the players. His charity work for the Jimmy Fund and lesser known causes went far beyond the call of the average player. Aside from philandering, his recreations were generally healthy, his greatest passion being his fishing. While he was not a tree hugger, by any stretch, he was deeply disturbed by the commercialization of the Florida Keys [though one suspects his concerns were more about the disruption of good fishing than, say, global warming.]. Montville reports that Williams did have a successful long term relationship with one lover that endured through several marriages.While the quality of this work is consistent from cover to cover, the treatment of Williams' old age merits special attention. Williams had fathered three children, two of whom seemed contented to ride their father's gravy train. But the third, his only son John Henry Williams, demonstrated a peculiar talent for cashing in on his father's name and bringing disgrace to the Williams legacy. A rather unfocused young man in his early years, John Henry turned his attention to the marketing of his father's signatures. The senior Williams suffered from several strokes and was growing increasingly blind and dependent upon those around him. John Henry Williams made him a virtual prisoner of his own home, isolated him from his old friends like Pesky and Dom DiMaggio, and installed video surveillance throughout the residence to make sure that no autographs were spirited away for old friends or acquaintances. It is a sad ending for the Hall of Famer, reduced to the level of the absurd by John Henry's cryogenic nightmare of freezing his father after death.It is through this final portion of the book that one feels some sympathy for Williams, though the reader will also be forced to face the realization that the apples do not fall far from the tree. Williams was indeed a great hitter, but like \\"Casey at the Bat\\" he brought little joy to Mudville in the process."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I picked up this book shortly after the Red Sox improbable comeback against the Yankees and their World Series victory more our of curiosity than any great love of Ted Williams. After all, Williams played before I was born. What I had read before of him was interesting and being a fan of baseball I realized that there are few people who rank higher in baseball lore.This biography changed many of my opinions. It takes an exceptional writer to captivate the interest of a reader when the reader is somewhat ambivalent about the subject. After the reading the book, I can now say that I'm better informed about Williams (Both good and bad), understand the basis for his legend as a hitter, and am interested in reading more about him from other sources.The bottom line is that I would recommend this book along with Montville's biography of Dale Earnhardt as well. Montville makes dull subjects interesting and interesting subjects fascinating.My only quibble with the book is that he fails to mention a Sports Illustrated Article in the mid 1980's that Peter Gammons wrote about a meeting that Williams had with Wade Boggs and Don Mattingly. The article was a recounting of a night when the three great hitters talked about the science of hitting. I was only 12 or 13 years when I read that article, but it always stuck with me because at one point Williams claimed that on rare occaisons when you hit the ball perfectly, you can actually smell a burning or smoke smell from the bat. Until I read this book, it was the best thing I ever read about Ted Williams but Montville, a former Sports Illustrated writer never refers to it in the book.Nevertheless, it's a great baseball book that makes great reading."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Sports biographies are usually the weakest version of that otherwise interesting genre, the celebrity biography. The weakness can usually be found in three areas. The subject didn't do much more than play a sport well. The biographee is a thoroughly loathsome person. The author didn't do his or her homework to talk about much other than sports. Even when all of those weaknesses are overcome, the book can still disappoint because the author is really just another sportswriter with starts in her or his eyes.Ted Williams -- The Biography of an American Hero has none of those problems. As a result, I cannot recall a biography about a sports star that is nearly as good as this one.But what can you say that is new about Ted Williams? It turns out that there's quite a lot that can be said because Mr. Montville went to the trouble to unearth much material that was previously unpublished. I could tell that I was in for a treat when the section on Mr. Williams's youth in San Diego included a detailed description of his family home based on a recent tour by the author. It also turns out that what people had to say about Mr. Williams was often so tough and painful that the material was suppressed until after he died . . . lest a lot of hard feelings follow. So you have pages and pages of things you've never read or heard about Ted Williams.Mr. Montville also takes us into the room with Mr. Williams . . . both when he was on his good behavior . . . and when he was not. You get a sense of what it was like to be his friend, his teammates . . . or his enemy. Most painfully, you get a sense of what it was like to be in his family -- something you probably wouldn't wish on your worst enemy.Most biographers have some big theory about their subject and skew their arguments and examples to make those points. Mr. Montville does you the honor of letting you decide. He sneaks up on you. Suddenly, when you least expect it (as happened at the time), wham you find out something new . . . such as during Mr. Williams's Hall of Fame speech. Mr. Montville then goes on to explain and elaborate on what it meant, including reactions of others. It's a very fine way to present the material. Nice job!Ultimately, we have a problem understanding the sports successes of those who mostly labored before the days of televised games. There are few objective measures of what they did. Mr. Montville painstakingly tries to sort that out. For example, did you know that there was no sacrifice fly statistic when Mr. Williams batted over .400? If there had been, his performance would have been measured at a much higher number.The bulk of the book covers the previously hidden side of Mr. Williams's life, which he sought to keep private. That is certainly right, and makes this a great biography.Like many heroes (his was deserved for his war-time service and his devotion to helping those in need), Mr. Williams had feet of clay. Mr. Montville doesn't try to cover up for that. In fact, he finds a reasonably inoffensive way to remind you of Mr. Williams's appalling language and behavior throughout the book. Mr. Williams had rabbit ears, a hair-trigger temper, and kept grudges. You see how those weaknesses often related to his inherent intelligence and perfectionism which caused him to be too hard on others . . . and himself.I came away feeling like I understood who Mr. Williams was . . . and why he was that way. That's more than I can say from most biographies I read . . . whether the subject is a sports star or a former president of the United States.But ultimately, I think I came away feeling that Mr. Williams was blessed in many ways -- not least of which was by who his biographer turned out to be. I have enjoyed Leigh Montville's columns in The Boston Globe and Sports Illustrated for decades, and have always considered him to be a writer first . . . and a sportswriter second. In this book, that gap has widened even further in favor of the writer. I hope he will favor us with many more biographies in the future.The book includes Mr. Montville's famous SI obituary of Mr. Williams and Mr. Montville's recollections of when he met Mr. Williams in person. I thought the latter was an especially nice touch since it helped put his role as observer in perspective.\\"Didja hear about the alligator?\\""},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This book is a must read for Williams fans, Red Sox fans and baseball fans in general. I felt this book was one of the most balanced books I have read aboout Williams. Not only does it pay tribute to his success on the field and in the air during WW II and Korea, but also decribes his many faults. I have always been a fan of Montville and this book, simply put, is a great one."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I recently read Cramer's bio of Joe DiMaggio and thought this would be a good complement. And it was. While the more one finds out about DiMaggio during and after baseball, the less one likes him; the more one reads about Williams, the more one likes HIM. He was the anti-Joe with his time and genuine concern for people, especially those less fortunate (in particular, children and the Jimmy Fund in Boston).For baseball fans, this book is not too deep on his accomplishments on the field. But then again, his career is so well-documented that baseball fans are probably very familiar with it. Montville does shed light on his early days in the minors, the majors, the .400 season, the service years, his bad relationship with the Boston sportswriters and his refusal to tip his cap when he homered in his last career bat. All things that we are familiar with, but about which it was good to know more.For those who are not baseball fans, the book offers more of a look at this man who had achieved so much in his profession, served his country in the middle of his career (in two separate wars) and delved into the complex relationship he had with his family yet how easy it was to be his friend...on his terms.I think the author gives a good and balanced account of how this man went from a not-so-popular player in his own hometown and even with some of his teammates, to the much-adored icon he was in the last 10-15 years of his life. There are some truly touching passages about his innate goodness that was sometimes overshadowed by occasional and irrepressible bouts of anger. Looking around at today's ballplayers, once hopes for someone like Barry Bonds to have the same fate. To be misunderstood and unpopular while putting up one of the best careers even seen in the game and to be redeemed in the later years of his life. Might be too much to hope for in that case..."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I enjoyed this biography (except for a glaring typo in an early chapter that gives TW's birthday as April, 1918 instead of August....where was the editor??!). I have to wonder, however, if the personality &quot;quirks&quot; that TW displayed would be accepted in today's world. His on-the-field persona was one thing, but the verbal abuse of his family was often over the top.

If you want to get an idea of who Ted Williams really was, read this book. You always here about Ted Williams as a \\"hero\\" in the sports world. This book delves into both Ted Williams' professional life & his personal life. With that being said, I am no longer able to think about Ted Williams with the same kind of respect I once did. I would not be happy to have any of my children look to him as some sort of role model. This book was well written, but took me further into the rabbit hole than I wanted to go."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"There's no doubt this is probably THE comprehensive book about Ted Williams. For what it's worth, I \\"read\\" the audio version, which was unabridged and consisted of around 15 discs. The author did a bang-up job of really getting relatives' and friends' views of Ted Williams. I think what surprised me the most was that while the title states that this is the \\"Biography of an American Hero\\", he was less of a hero than I realized. I knew that Ted lost his prime baseball years to fighting in WWII and the Korean War, but I didn't realize that while other ballplayers were volunteering for WWII, he was really dragging his feet. In fact, according to the author, Ted could have cared less about leaving the minors and heading to the majors. Much, much later, the book talks about many positives at the end of Ted's career, especially when it came to visiting sick kids. Still, he's painted as an absentee father with his own kids (not present at any of their births, and beyond), an uncaring husband, and he expressed great disdain for nearly every sportswriter and had a love-hate relationship with the fans who pestered him from their seats near his left field.The book was still good, but it didn't paint a portrait of the hero that I had hoped it would. About 10% of the beginning of the book and 10% of the end of the book are less interesting, especially as they dive into rather boring fishing trips that Ted took or basic aspects of his youth that don't relate to anything later in his life."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This book might be more appropriately titled \\"Ted Williams: Memoir From A Fan\\" than a biography. While Montville obviously did his homework when researching the book, he has a personal bias of Williams and it frequently shows. Often, it feels like he's holding things back because he doesn't want to shame the legend of Williams. The books greatest fault is the end; Montville spends hundreds of pages badmouthing John-Henry, the son of Ted Williams. Yes, John-Henry was obviously a jerk, but the author should give the reader enough credit to come up with this on his own; by the books end, I felt like I was reading more a biography of his wicked son, than Ted Williams."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"If I read a biography of a U.S. president, I expect that a vast majority of the content deals with his work as president. Similarly, when reading a biography of one of the all-time greats in baseball history, I expect detailed analysis of his baseball career. Oddly, Leigh Montville's new biography of Ted Williams disappoints, with precious few new insights into Williams' extraordinary career. Instead, Montville appears more interested in William's dysfunctional family life and fishing exploits.In addition to these problems, the writing style Montville utilizes is choppy and haphazard, jumping awkwardly from topic to topic while seemingly attempting to provide a historical and cultural context for Williams' life and work. Unfortunately, this only serves to give the impression that the edition is quirky and unorganized.This is one of the largest collections of stories and anecdotes of Williams' life outside of baseball. But if you are a baseball fan you will likely be disappointed in this biography."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Ted Williams is most deserving of an excellent biography and in Leigh Montville, he could not have found a better biographer. This has to be the definitive biography of one of baseball's finest sluggers, and it certainly is one of the best I've ever read. Williams was a fascinating, complicated person, with larger-than-life positives and flaws. Montville, who interviewed more than 400 people in his research -- gives us a portrait that is almost painful in its thoroughness. There is hardly an aspect of Ted's life that the author does not explore, nor does he pull any punches about the people who populated Williams' life. He particularly skewers Ted's son, John Henry, whose tawdry, opportunistic and cynical behavior disgusts the reader. It was John Henry who engineered the obscenity of having Ted's body frozen, clearly against his will, and stored even today in an Arizona cryogenic warehouse. There is no sports biography like this one -- at least none I've read -- and even if you are not a baseball fan, you will be held prisoner by this book to be freed only after you read the last page. Montville has written a great book about a great sports figure."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Montville's book. It's a flawlessly written biography of a flawed but uniquely talented baseball icon. If The Splendid Splinter wanted the title of \\"the greatest hitter who ever lived\\" he certainly accomplished that mission. A great read and highly recommended regardless of your team affiliation."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I tip my hat to Leigh Montville in his historical biography of Ted Williams which should remain as a classic in the chronicles of Baseball History.From Ted's humble childhood in San Diego to his exploits at Fenway Park to his heroism as a Marine fighter pilot are scenarios of legend.In Baseball, he took the art of hitting and made it a science. His exploits of 1941, when he became the last Major Leaguer to bat over 400 was indeed incredible. He really is the only player to do this in the live ball era. Hitters such as Ty Cobb were only Punch and Judy hitters of the Dead ball Era.. The only batsman to hit a ball both for power and average during the Dead Ball Era was Joe Jackson. In summation Ted Williams represents the epiphany of the modern day slugger.Second his service to his Country in World War II and the Korean War shows a man of determination and resolve. He never really got into combat in World War II but did serve as a Marine pilot.Later when he was called to service in Korea he saw his share of combat. As I see Ted Williams, he was more of a John Wayne than John Wayne. He served and didn't complain. His brother Major Leaguer Bob Feller was of the same ilk!Upon his return he continued to do what he did best. He hit the baseball. With all his service to his country he still was able to hit over 500 home runs. His batting average was still remarkable. In fact it remains the 3rd highest in the history of baseball.He took on the responsibilities of being a major league manager with the Washington Senators. He found that his prow ness as a batter didn't translate into a manager of great aptitude.In life after baseball he became a Hall of Fame fisherman. His exploits in his married life were a failure. His love of Country and the game of baseball stayed with him throughout his life. In the end he was a true American Hero!!"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I have read a couple of books on Ted Williams, but this was the best. It's exhaustively researched -- Montville spoke to anyone and everyone who may have come across Williams, almost to a fault -- and a lot of fun to read. I guess I would label it sympathetic, but it's really quite fair. I think that after reading this book, you will understand why so many people loved Williams off the field, but why he rubbed fans and writers the wrong way. Montville made me feel like I was along for the ride throughout Williams's amazing career, and that's not always easy to do. A great read to be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"It's all there- subtantial detail about all the good and bad of this tremendously talented, very famous, interesting and complex man. The book is well written and very entertaining. I couldn't put it down and finished it in 3-4 days. It covers all stages of Williams' life. I liked the fact that it covered a lot of his post-baseball life.I especially liked the interviews with and anecdotes from many of the players from Williams era, as well as his friends, ex-wives and associates. I grew up in the 50s, so I could relate to many of these players and their comments. The only negative is that it could have had less detail on the intracies of fishing- since I'm not a fisherman.The book is probably the best baseball biography I've ever read."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I always loved Ted Williams more than any other athlete. He truly was an American hero. However, some of his comments about Jesus Christ in this book are disturbing to me, and while I will always admire him, I admire him less because of what he said."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Ted Williams is one of the greatest baseball players of all time. His .406 batting average stands as of the game's greatest accomplishments and is still the benchmark average that modern players aim towards. Leigh Montvale's Ted Williams: The Biography Of An American Hero is the most extensive book about the Splendid Splinter. Despite the fanfare, the book is a disappointment. Mr. Montvale spends far too much time on Mr. Williams' life after baseball than his time within the game. To any reader of any sports biography, the most important aspect of the book should be the subject's athletic career. No one wants to read just an expanded stat sheet, but Mr. Montvale concentrates too much of the book on Mr. Williams' life outside of baseball. The 1941 season has some detail, but the 1946 is almost written as an afterthought. That season ended in Mr. Williams' only trip to the World Series in his long career. His two Triple Crown seasons of 1942 &amp; 1947 are mentioned in passing. Mr. Montvale does do an excellent job of explained the bitter rivalry between Mr. Williams and the Boston sportswriters. But again, he spends too much time into the background of the writers (one doesn't really care about the life history of Mr. Williams' fiercest critic, Dave Egan, but we get that). Mr. Montvale does go into great detail about Mr. Williams' three marriages and his fishing life on the Florida Keys and Canada. This is interesting, to a point, but these aspects of his life should have been given the secondary nature that his career received. Mr. Montvale also conveys Mr. Williams as an impetuous, foul-mouthed crank and relays countless stories from acquaintances and loved ones who hammer this point home. Included is a word for word interview with Mr. Williams' third wife Dolores that was conducted in 1969 but never released that makes this point abundantly clear. Mr. Montvale ends the book with a sort of biography within a biography as he details the life and exploits of Mr. Williams' only son, John Henry. Again, this is interesting and shows how sad of an end that Mr. Williams' life had, but he goes overboard in his tales of John Henry's transgressions. This book is not without merit as it does provide some detailed insights into one of the 20th Century's greatest athletes, but it falls short of its potential greatness."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"This book describes greatness, a quest for perfection, deep and long-term friendships between men; heroism and personal sacrifice for country; some of the inside details of baseball, a deep love for the game, betrayal and exploitation; and ultimately one of the most bizarre aftermath's to the life of a legend. There is no doubt that Ted Williams was one of the best hitters who ever lived. In fact, it can be argued, something that I often do, that he was the best hitter to ever play the game. On that note, while he was blessed with incredible skills, like so many successful athletes, he practiced as if he was a religious fanatic and that was his daily devotions. He was also a very intelligent man, some of the facets of hitting that Williams discussed had never been considered before. He studied pitchers with a precision that probably has never been duplicated.Under the social classifications now used, Ted was a Hispanic, his father was Mexican and his mother Caucasian. Growing up in San Diego, he was worshipping baseball and making it his field of study at a very early age. Unfortunately, his skill at hitting a baseball did not translate into maturity. He became a star at an early age, and he never managed to mellow a ferocious temper, which many of his friends said was the key to his success. Like so many people who accomplished so much, he was a perfectionist. He would hit a homerun and then criticize himself for swinging at a pitch that was not in the strike zone. Montville criticizes Williams for this, but it is not totally justified. A mistake that turns out right is still a mistake, and if you are satisfied with that, then over the long haul, the mistakes will sum to a point that will overwhelm you.It is amazing to think that he pulled two tours of duty as a Marine Corps pilot, flying combat missions in the Korean War and having a plane shot out from under him. There is no greater testament to his hitting ability than what happened after he returned from Korea at the age of 35. Having almost no time to readjust to the baseball world, he managed to hit over .400 for the remainder of the season and have a slugging percentage over .900. A close second is when he hit .388 at the age of 38, which put him within a few hits of .400. Over the course of the season, that many hits would have been generated by legs even a few years younger.His later years were spent in and out of baseball, fishing, hunting and enjoying himself. It is here where we also see the consequences of celebrity. His relationships with women were strained, often a consequence of the fact that he could have so many. Women seemed to roll in and out of bed with him at a regular pace and there is a somewhat substantiated rumor that he caught an STD while in Korea. His relationships with his children were poor, which led to his being exploited, manipulated and mistreated in his last years. Those who knew him best and had looked after him were shut out of his life when he needed them most. After his death, his body was frozen, something that was almost certainly the consequence of a forgery that was somehow accepted as legal.Ted Williams did many things at the highest level. He lived fast, enjoyed the good life of women, fame, adulation and monetary rewards. At the end, it seemed that his only regret was that he did not build familial relationships. Which is probably correct, because he maintained close relationships with friends for decades, old buddies to shoot piles of BS with.Montville captures Ted Williams as a great man with great flaws. Some criticized him because they could and because it sold papers. Nevertheless, Williams often went out of his way to antagonize others, spitting at and cursing fans and sportswriters when he felt like it. As is so often the case, the very qualities that make someone great also make their flaws great. However, he was also willing to help people in need. There are many stories of his charity work and how he would stop and give a total stranger a tip on hitting. This is a book that all baseball fans should read."},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"Ted Williams was way before my time, but I've always had an interest in him due to him being one of my fathers heroes and the fact he has a signed baseball of his. But little did I know how engrossed I would become in this book and the life of this very complicated man. Ted Williams had a rough childhood that molded him into the person and baseball player he was. Due to his strange and lonely childhood, he always had a very hard time giving and receiving love. This was evident by his three marriages. So the one and only thing he was truley commited to was baseball, and even that relationship could become rocky and ugly sometimes. Even his relationship with the fans was very complicated and tortured at times. Especially thinking that as his last game in a Red Sox uniform only around 12,000 showed up to the park that day. Ted Williams had hitting down to a science and could not get enough of swinging the bat and practicing. He would even practice swinging the bat while out playing leftfield. (Which caused some concern and some boos from the Fenway Faithful.) Leigh Montville does a tremendous job telling his story as a young man, making his way up through the majors and his Service years during WWII and Korea and for his love of fishing. Which Ted Williams got the most pleasure of in life. Leigh Montville also does a wonderful job showing his cranky and sometimes meanspirited side as well as the side that spent countless hours with sick children and raising money for the Jimmy Fund. You can tell and Leigh Montville tells us what love and respect he has for Williams, yet does not let that cloud his judgement in telling it like it really is. I was brought to tears in the last few chapters reading of Williams' declining health and how is sounds as if his son John-Henry took advantage of his father and how he made the decision to have him cryogenically frozen. You do not have to be a Red Sox fan to enjoy this book, you do not even need to be a baseball fan. You just have to be a fan of good writing and storytelling and that is exactly what you will get with this book. Bravo!!"},{"Title":"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero","review":"I always loved Ted Williams more than any other athlete. He truly was an American hero. However, some of his comments about Jesus Christ in this book are disturbing to me, and while I will always admire him, I admire him less because of what he said."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is not a clean romance - the profanity and premartial sex really detracted from what could be a great book.

This book is a real tear jerker. I'm looking forward to the next 3 books about the Grayson brothers."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Well, the story was okay, but nothing extraordinary. I finished the book & it passed an afternoon away. There was nothing overtly wrong with Ms Lindstrom's writing style, the editing was ordinary as usual & I hate spelling mistakes. All things considered, the book was worth what I paid for it."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"When I purchase books from Amazon, I search for Christian fiction. This book does not meet that criteria. Amazon needs to do a better job determining what is and what is not Christian fiction."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"It came up as a Christian book so I bought it. As the language began to get rougher, I realized it must not be Christian fiction. If it is Christian fiction shame on the author. When I tell my testimony of who I was before Christ, I don't go making it seem romantic, fun, and desireable. Thought love scenes were out of place if it is Christian fiction."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Shades of HonorGoing back to where you came from is sometimes the hardest thing to do. Radford Grayson does just that in this story of returning to your roots and facing your past. He brings with him his four year old motherless, fearful daughter Rebecca. Radford comes home to Fredonia, New York in 1870 after years of staying away- 1st during the war and then trying to fight his post war memories. He comes back home to his three brothers Kyle, Boyd and Duke to help run the family sawmill. Kyle harbours strong feelings against Radford walking back in to the family business and instead convinces Radford to help run the town livery owned by Evelyn Tucker( Kyles fiancee) and her ailing father. From there it's an emotional story about Radford fighting for inner peace, embracing love, forgiveness and accepting his past while moving forth with his life. Throughout the story Radford attempts to remain loyal to his family and protect and shelter his emotionally scarred daughter. The story showcases the emotional battle that all the main characters must overcome while bringing a divided family back together.Review- I enjoyed the well written story. I appreciate that the author focused on many characters in the book and their many states of emotion and turmoil. It was an easy read for an adult based audience with very mild intimate personal scenes. The book ended well and although the ending was predictable, enjoyable none the less.come see this book and more @ [...]"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"From the third page this book had such a hold on me that I couldn't put it down.

I look forward to reading more of the Grayson Brothers."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"The situation this book is built around--a man falling in love with his brother's fiancee--is so tantalizing and intriguing, and Wendy Lindstrom did not disappoint! I love the way the story plays out. The hero is one of four wonderfully sexy brothers, and I'm looking forward to reading their stories next."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I wasn't expecting much. I was looking for a light read with some romance and this popped up. I thought \\"ok, I'll bite\\" and I'm so glad that I did. I'm in love with this book and I can not wait to read the others. There was no love at first sight but a strong LOVE that grew over time. I could actually feel how much the 2 main characters really loved each other. But that's not all there is to it. You get a sense of family, honor and loyalty in this book. I found myself laughing with the characters, crying with them, getting nervous with them, longing with them...I was right there in the book with them, page for page word for word. Also, a lot of writers get caught up in the descriptive side of the book and it can get annoying when you just want to get into the story. Not in this book. Everything was describe nice and right to the point. She didn't linger on the many shades of the grass or the clouds in the sky. It was an appropriate amount of description that complimented the story line perfectly.wrapping it up...read this book and like me, you'll be ready for the rest.

Both the writing style and the editing were very well done and far above average, especially for a free book. The characters were well-developed as well as sympathetic and the dialogue was realistic.

While I don't necessarily desire to read books about God, I usually shop in the Christian fiction category in order to avoid curse words and sexual content. Amazon sure missed the boat when they labeled this book as Christian fiction. The writer appeared to have some writing talent, but unfortunately she felt the need to throw in unnecessary curse words and sexual content. And by unnecessary, I mean that the curse words and sexual content lent nothing to the plot or character development. As you get deeper into the story the curse words and sexual content become more frequent so I finally quit reading the book--it wasn't that spelling binding of a plot anyway."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"The Civil War details made this story so captivating.

It is well written and the plot well thought out. Parts of the book brought out long forgotten feelings of longing and bittersweet memories and that aching one gets in their chest. I like this author and will be reading more of this Grayson Brothers series."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"A great story line of two families' respect for each other, the promises made and the recovery from a traumatic past. Wendy has apparently delved deeply into the local history to create a delightful piece of pseudo history that is spellbinding.This could easily be used as suggested additional reading in a collegiate course on the reconstruction era.I especially liked the twists and turns in the development of the family's problems, and their ultimate solutions.Well done!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"It's one of those books you can't put down until either the page ends in a period or you're beginning a new chapter.

The story keeps the reader wanting the brothers to wake up especially Kyle to realize he is not the one suited for his fiance but Radford. However I have to agree even though it is considered a christian novel. The vivid details of passion makes it not one in the true sense. My suggestion to you is for you to be the judge of the contents yourself. However the author is truly a gifted writer."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This story is great! I laughed and cried.

I was a little apprehensive when I first purchased the book. Once I began reading the book I couldn't put it down. I would defiantly purchase another book by the writer."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Books that win the RWA's Golden Heart are usually excellent, and this one is no exception. Set in post-Civil War upperstate New York, Shades of Honor has likable, believable characters; a perfectly (or nearly perfectly) plotted story; and, best of all, a great, heart-thumping romance.Evelyn is the heroine, a woman who feels like a misfit because she spends most of her time running around in \\"britches\\" and doing manual labor in her father's livery. She's engaged to her long-time friend, Kyle, but is already having doubts about the upcoming marriage when Kyle's elder brother comes back home to reclaim his halcyon boyhood (or something).Radford, continuing the tradition of romance heroes with weird names, is haunted by the ever popular battlefield shock syndrome from the Civil War. He comes home to try and find peace for himself and his daughter, but Kyle is belligerent and he's forced to help out at the neighbor's (Evelyn and her father) livery. Radford and Evelyn are immediately attracted to one another, but of course Evelyn is engaged to Rad's brother. Isn't she?I challenge any romance lover not to like this book. The characters were very fun and likable, especially Evie, and the sexual tension between Radford and Evelyn was palatable. This is an excellently written novel that deserves to be looked at.So, why did I give Shades of Honor only three stars? First and foremost, historical novels that take place in America aren't really my cup of tea--they just don't capture my interest. The fact that this novel was able to do so only adds to my admiration of it, but I still don't like American novels. Secondly, parts of this book were INCREDIBLY sappy. I suppose some would call them \\"heart rending,\\" but they were sappy. Lastly, there was one character (if you could call her that) in this book that I didn't like, and that was Rebecca, who was completely unbelievable and soon strayed into the annoying category.Other than that, this book was great. I unreservedly recommend it, especially to people interested in American history, the Civil War in particular. Even if you aren't interested in that, however, Shades of Honor is a great read."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I got this book free and now I am going to buy the other three in the series. I cant remember the last time I have read a book like this in just over 5 hours throughout the day. I felt so many feelings while immersing myself in a different time and place. I sobbed like a baby through one part and then was laughing and smiling through others. Someone mentioned it being \\"too graphic\\".......umm ....it's a romance novel. I most certainly didn't think it was too graphic. I read 100's of books a year and have only recently started writing reviews. I have vowed to give an honest review good or bad for each one now. I think it would be a shame to miss out on a book like this because it wasn't someone's \\"cup of tea\\". Read this one and you'll be glad you did......but have some tissues handy :)"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"The book's cover caught my eye, as I was looking for the first time on the free downloads section of Amazon. I'm horse crazy so I wanted to check out what this book, Shades of Honor, was about. The cover I saw showed a rearing grey horse. (There are different covers for this book.) Civil War history, and an intriguing plot of falling for a brother's fianc&eacute;. Ok, go on...and then the heroine works a real, dirty, labor intensive job, during a time when proper women didn't dare work...and of all places, she works in a livery stable. And she trains horses on the side...I'm in. What a great first novel from Wendy Lindstrom. Strong characters, family bonds, soldiers' ties of honor, forged in horrific battles, PTSD, mourning, grief, family heritage and passion that can't be put aside. I love this family, the brothers, their work ethic and the way they approach life. The love story builds in spite of the hero and heroine trying desperately to do the right thing. I have gone on to find book 3 in the series, and have read that, while waiting for book 2 at my local library. Still searching for book 4, and will read the excerpt on Wendy's website about book 5.

The family interaction actually reminded me of situations I've known which shows how the emotions of pride, ego, love and forgiveness are universal and timeless."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I loved this book. There were so many memorable and lovable characters. The story of Radfords journey to recover from the soul ravaging war and his struggle to maintain his honor keeps the reader enthralled. I bought the following Grayson brothers books immediately after finishing this book and I can't wait to start reading them."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I have read many books this year and this is one great book. It holds your attention throughout the book."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Remember how LaVyrle Spencer's books swept you away to another place and time, while you fell madly, passionately in love with her fabulous characters? SHADES OF HONOR took me to that height of reading pleasure. Ms. Lindstrom has created fresh, vibrant characters, impossible situations, and genuine, heartfelt emotions and masterfully weaved them into a passionate romance that will have you smiling as you shed a few tears.Reviewed by Tracy Farnsworth for The Romance Readers ConnectionThe awesome underlying emotional power of Ms. Lindstrom's story grabs hold as she deftly explores the love between father and child, friends, and the deep, sometimes ambiguous, bonds between brothers. The regrets, the jealousies, the anger and the ultimate love that holds a family together through times of trouble and triumph are all here and guaranteed to move you to tears and even laughter. The first book in a trilogy, SHADES OF HONOR is a portent of great things to come from a very powerful new voice in the genre.Reviewed by Kathe Robin for Romantic Times magazine - 4 starsAn enchanting tale of loyalty, passion and true love. Ms. Lindstrom is a talented writer and I found myself wrapped in the characters and story to the point I cried.Reviewed by Teresa Sanders for Historical Romance WritersLindstrom's powerful characterization aptly portrays the inner conflicts that all of us have experienced at one time or another. The characters are real and suffer human emotions and longings...that's what makes this novel so powerful, the idea that these are things that real people experience every day. SHADES OF HONOR is the book that you'll re-read.Reviewed by Julie Singleton for Escape to RomanceMs. Lindstrom has achieved success in making her story fresh and delightful. Her ability to capture the warmth and essence of her characters is a rare gift. SHADES OF HONOR is a heartwarming and passionate tale...and this reader anxiously waits for the second [book] in the series.Reviewed by Denise Clark for Road to RomanceA poignant romance. If you enjoy a sweet, tender, romantic story that also has great conflict and depth of character, you'll enjoy SHADES OF HONOR.Reviewed by Carla Hosom for Romance and Friends!Shades of Honor is a Golden Heart award-winning novel, and in this case it was an award well deserved. I've almost forgotten what it's like to be so enthralled in a book and so concerned for the characters that I lose all track of time. As the hours flew by I knew it was going to be a late night (or maybe an early morning?) but the lost sleep was worth it. Shades of Honor is a perfect name for this book, as Evelyn and Radford come to terms with what it means to be honorable in different ways, both in relationships and on a battlefield. I love a good moral dilemma, and this is a juicy one. Characters often agonize over their choices in romance novels, but frequently the correct choice is ridiculously obvious to the reader. Kudos to the author for careful plotting and deft characterization. A fabulous effort, particularly for a first time author. I would love to see [Shades of Honor] get the audience it deserves, particularly among American Historical fans who are tired of the ubiquitous western. And if you start it late at night like I did, you can always sleep another time.Reviewed by Blythe Barnhill for All About RomanceLindstrom's superbly written, beautifully poignant debut romance has a wonderful emotional richness and depth of characterization that will appeal to readers who love authors like Lorraine Heath and Maggie Osborne.Booklist: John Charles - Copyright American Library Association.An amazing debut novel!Reviewed by LISA for Book Review CafeShades of Honor is a rare gem of a book that hits every note exactly right. Radford is a wonderful hero: an average, honorable man forced into horrible circumstances. Evie is a plucky heroine whose spunkiness never spills over into stupidity or becomes obnoxious. Both characters are believable, intelligent, reasonable and highly sympathetic. There are no villains in the book, only well-meaning, warm-hearted people whose goals are in opposition. The conflict among Rad, Evie, and Kyle is heart-breaking because we know how much they all truly care for each other, and yet it appears there's no way to solve their problems that won't bring one or all of them to the brink of tragedy. Despite that, the resolution is remarkable for being true to everything the author has already established about the characters. I'll be eagerly awaiting [the sequel].Reviewed by Karen McCullough for Scribes World Reviews - 5 Stars"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is a 5 star review. I cried, I laughed, I felt so much love for all of them. Wendy has tempted me with her ability to capture events that are life like. I look forward to more of what Wendy is offering."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is not your typical romance book. It's a family saga, and not only will you fall in love with the two main characters, but with a frail man and a scared little girl as well. I cried in three different areas of the book, and when it ended I felt a deep loss, wanting it to go on forever. Great writing. Great research. Great love story. And a great writer. If you're looking for a story with several plotlines, a hint of civil war memorabilia, and a desire to root for the heroes, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I rated this book with 5 stars because it met my criteria as a book I enjoyed from start to finish. There were no areas to skip over or speed read, very well written. The author has given the reader characters with deep sense of honor and family. A post civil war story that brings in the horrors of that war, but entered into the story to enrich and add depth. This is not a book that has sensual romance as its main focus, but is there to add to story. I read a lot of historical romance, mystery romance and some of it is not worth the read even if free, but not so here."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is an amazing novel by Wendy Lindstorm. Her words of the late 1800s reflect her creative ability. It gave me chills up and down my spine when I was reading!Radford Grayson has been gone from his hometown of Fredonia New York, for five years. He went to fight in the war, but felt he had abandonded his family in running the mill. Radford also has a small addition with him in his return. His daughter Rebecca, from a short-lived affair with a woman he met on his travels.Visions of coming home with open arms from his family, especially his brother Kyle, was instantly deflated. Kyle, with his hot-headed, ambitious nature, has been running the mill for years now, and is even getting married to a wooman, Evelyn, they had all been friends with growing up.Evelyn is a very petite, shy woman, who has been taking care of the livery for her father. It has been hard work for a woman and because of this, business has been slow. Evelyn's father, William, wanted Radford to help run the livery. Even though Evelyn protested, William insisted.While Evelyn and Radford worked together everyday, you could sense the flying sparks between them. Instead of imagining what kind of lover Kyle, her soon-to-be-husband, would be, she dreamed of Radford. What was causing these feelings?Radford doesn't want anyone, especially Evelyn, getting too close to his daughter. When Rebecca was smaller, Radford hired a nanny to care for her while he worked. The first woman hurt Rebecca when she moved away and got married. The second woman was a little more cruel. She abused her physically and mentally leaving her cowering from everyone except her father. He didn't want anyone doing that to her again.Radford keeps his distance from Evelyn, but is always watching and wanting her from afar. Can Radford let someone in his heart again after all the pain he's endured over the years? Will Evelyn leave Kyle who's always been a good provider and secure for her, even though the relationship is loveless? Find out in 'Shades of Honor!'"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I ordered this book because it was free; however, once I got into the story, the main focus is on Radford's passion, written in very graphic detail. The book uses a lot of expletives and has crude remarks which are unnecessary. The story line could have been more productive by letting the reader fill in the details rather than spelling out the passions felt toward Evelyn. Although the book shows the human emotions of bitterness and envy, as well as compassion, between brothers, it is hard to get past the daily passions of Radford which are always in the forefront. I could not finish the book and deleted it from my Kindle. I love to read, but will choose books that are more uplifting without the language and intimate details."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I wish there were more than 5* to give a book, because this one should get more. Radford returns to his home town expecting to fall right back into family arms and lumber business. But once he went off to war, his brother Kyle took over the business and wants nothing to do with big brother taking over. Kyle asks that Radford help his fiancee Evelyn with her family livery business instead. Radford is concerned with his small daughter Rebecca's adjusting to everything and so agrees to help Evelyn, but not happily. Sparks fly, temper flare and love is in the air. A wonderful book!!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I am not a romance novel reader. I usually will say those are the worst books to read. That being said I chose this book to read for god knows what reason. It was really well done. I could not put it down the characters came alive for me on my kindle. I am very interested in reading anything else by the writer since this story really did it for me. Normally romance novels have ridiculous amount of sex which I find completely unnecessary. This story stands on its own without the need of all that. Highly recomend!!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This book shouldn't be listed as Christian Fiction or at least, when I enter \\"Christian Fiction\\", this book was displayed. So I chose to read it, but if it had stated upfront about the explicit sexual content, I would have passed it by. The storyline was wonderful, but the sexual content was just too descriptive for my enjoyment. There are alot of those books out there, but fewer that are written conveying the meaning without the use of so much sex. This keeps me from reading the other books in saga."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I don't ever write reviews on any of the books I have read, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity this time. For a free read, this story is excellent. I really didn't think I'd like it and told myself I would read the first chapter, but then I was hooked. So hooked that in 3 days I finish this one and the other 3 in the series. I needed to relax and unwind and I did, reading some amazing stories about 4 brothers and their adventures. Honestly I would highly recommend them, give it a shot, I promise you that you will truly enjoy it. I did notice some typos and errors but nothing that took away from the books.I would rank the 4 the following:1. Shades of honor2. The longing3.Lips that touch Mine4. Kissing in the dark"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I really liked this book, it was an awesome read and could hardly put it down. All the characters were beautifully described and the story unfolded very well."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is one of the few books that I can say made me feel through the whole thing. You can feel the emotions from all the main characters. I have to admit I was openly crying in 2 or 3 different parts of this book. I've never had a book make me cry before, tear up maybe, but never actually cry. I'm going to buy the others in the series. I hope they are as good as this one."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and the three that followed. Good stories about family, love, honor and respect. Just when I thought the book would end, it continued with a few more chapters. I couldn't wait to read the next. Each one captured your attention and heart."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"There was nothing in this book that disappointed me. It was a fantastic read that kept me interested all the way through to the end and definitely sprung a few tears. I would absolutely recommend this book to all romance readers."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I liked this book, but it's fairly predictable. The references to the Civil War and the pain of soldiers' families made it more real. It is a good reminder that those who go to war come back different, and this family has to deal with Radford's painful experiences."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is a terrific book! I'm shocked to discover it was a debut novel. The author was able to write a historical romance that had enough romance but didn't go overboard. Including family honor, PTSD and a scared little girl who didn't know how to be a little girl. It actually made me cry in a couple spots. Very realistic; this could have easily been a true story. Great writing. Great Civil War research. I can't say enough good things about it."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Shades of Honor is a very well written book about the difficutlies of love and loss and being true to your heart. It's been a long time since I've read a book where I connected with the characters on such a level that the loss of one made me cry. The characters in this book are appropriately complex and seemed very true to life. The relationship between Radford and Evelyn is not far-fetched or contrived, and is a sweet story about truly finding your other half. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I enjoyed the first book so much that I purchased the remaining books in the series. All of the books are well written, and the characters are so interesting that I did not want the series to end."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Just an inpartial review not eloquent but yes this really is good. Sometime I am suspicious of good reviews its free because its first in a series and they feel this first one will get you hooked."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This was my first time reading anything by Wendy Lindstrom. Generally this isn't my favorite era to read about, but the books and story of the Grayson family were compelling enough to bring me back to Amazon again and again. Shades of Honor was a good book and my interest was so piqued that I purchased the next book in the series. There is enough passion and intrigue to keep the reader interested but not bore or be overly explicit. While the books aren't long, nor are they weighty in subject, there is plenty of family dynamic to make you want to keep reading the series. Her subsequent books have gotten better and better, and by the second and third books you really feel that you know the family personally. I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"was well written and i enjoyed it very much Wendy Lindstrom is an excellent writer and will read more of her books"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Good story and a fun read!

The author really made you root for two main characters and hope that they would get past the issues keeping them apart."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I loved Shades of Honor and look forward to reading about the rest of the brothers. Lindstrom's strong storytelling pulls you into the book in short order. The problems the characters seem authentic. Learning about the entire family gives you a taste for the next book in the series. I simply need time to read them."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"i enjoyed this book so much i also got the other three of the 4 grayson brothersi enjoyed it as much as laura lael miller"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This story was reasonably well written and the two main characters, Radford and Evelyn, well developed. Kyle, being the third person in the love triangle was also well represented.The author managed to inject moments of happiness, sadness and humour in her story. There were also poignant references to the Civil War, it's effect on soldiers and their families.However, disappointingly, Radford's other two brothers, Boyd and Duke, receive only scant mention and I'm not sure if the author did enough to interest me in buying any of the remaining 3 books in the series."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I will tell you frankly that I'm not a fan of either historical romances or Christian fiction so this wasn't exactly my genre. I generally prefer straight historical, however, this was better than what I usually see in those genres when it comes to historical. I did think there was an excessive emphasis on the sex, not because I object to sex in a novel, which I don't, but because a lot of it was gratuitous and added absolutely nothing to the story. However, the writing was competent and the author had done research on the civil war, so I think it does rate three stars."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"It was a great read I could hardly wait to get in it every evening! My first Wendy Lindstrom book & I would definitely recommend her books now."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Well written and enjoyable, I will definitely be looking to read more from this author. For those who like historical romance this should be on their list of books to read."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This book pulls you in from the first page. You ache for the frightened little girl and her father trying to do the best for her while fighting his own demons. I liked every character in this book. They weren't perfect people by any means, but they were believeable and you felt the brothers love for each other and well as their resentment. Ms Lindstrom did a wonderful job--you feel as if you know these people and care what happens to them. I'm eager to read the next story."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I am always wary of free books (which this one was for Kindle), but I loved this book. It was very well written. I loved that the authur was able to go into details about the time period without making you feel bored. I read alot of historical novels, and feel that most authurs try to hard to give an authentic feel to their books and lose the readers interest. Not once did this book lose my interest. I laughed, I cried, and I felt joy right along with the characters. I can not wait to read the stories of the remaing Grayson Brothers."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This was a refreshingly different story amongst the hundreds of period romances which seem to come from the same cookie cutter mould. The characters were really complex and the storyline dealt with the emotions in a very realistic yet sympathetic manner!

She has formed an attachment to her father and doesn't want to be left without him again.Evelyn is engaged to marry his brother. While they are friends they don't really have a connection. This wasn't an issue for Evelyn until Radford came home. The pair is very attracted to each other and do their best to keep away from another and not to betray anyone.The story is wonderful.

It was not what I expected, although a good read, not what I was looking for."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Like any romance novel, SHADES OF HONOR is about a man and a woman who fall in love. But in this beautiful novel, the man, Radford Grayson has betrayed his brother, his family, his uniform and his honor. He has abandoned for years the family-owned sawmill that he, as the oldest Grayson brother, was supposed to run once he'd completed his military service. He believes that the medals he received for valor in the Civil War were unearned. The woman he falls in love with is his brother's fiancee. You read SHADES OF HONOR wondering how this tormented hero can possibly redeem himself. That he does is a triumph of the soul."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I feel that it was one of the greatest romance books that I have read.

But in his absence, his younger brother, Kyle, has expanded the thriving business, and has no intentions of letting Rayford get involved. Instead, Kyle sends his brother to help his betrothed, Evelyn, with her livery business.Rayford admires Evelyn's dedication to her business, and her tireless efforts to keep it going. He can see how exhausted she is, and steps in to help as much as he can. He fights his feelings for her, but it does no good. Against his deep sense of honor, he falls in love with her, and she with him. What will Kyle think when he finds out with his wedding so near? Will this completely ruin the relationship he was trying to build with his brother?Ms. Lindstrom's debut novel was great! This particular historical period in not a particular favorite of mine, but the author's incredible skill completely lured me in. She writes with lyrical ease about honor, integrity, and most of all, about enduring and undeniable nature of love. I really enjoyed this novel and its execution. I look forward to reading about the rest of the Grayson brothers--especially Kyle's story. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I had such a hard time putting this book down! The author made me feel what the characters were feeling, their torment over having feelings for \\"the wrong person\\" felt real, and their shame for betraying someone they both loved was heartbreaking. The book even had me in tears in some parts. Evelyn and Radford try desperately to fight the feelings within themselves for the sake of Kyle, and even though I wanted to dislike Kyle for being so closed minded, I couldn't. I quit reading much for romance books quite a while ago when I discovered Psych Thrillers, but every once in a while I pick one up. This book did not disappoint at all! I DEFINITELY recommend this book, and plan to buy the rest of the Grayson brothers books!! All of the characters are so likable, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the rest of the Grayson men! Buy this book!!"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"In 1870, Radford Grayson knows his fearful four-year-old daughter Rebecca depends on him, but guiltily he always has let her down, but vows not to this time. Knowing he needs the help of his estranges family, he returns to his hometown of Fredonia, New York desperate to provide a nurturing environment for his motherless child. He promised the youngster never to leave her again as even a few seconds apart mean apprehension and resignation of being abandoned for the frightened lass.The first person he sees upon reaching the family saw mill is childhood friend Evelyn Tucker dressed in breeches. Evelyn is engaged to Radford's brother, Kyle, the dependable sibling. However, first Rebecca and then Radford reach her heart as she falls in love with the woe-some twosome. Father and daughter reciprocate her feelings, but her close friend Kyle is his sibling and her fianc&eacute; leaving any relationship between them potentially destroying a delicate balance of a fragile little girl.This powerful Reconstruction Era romance will remind readers of Elvis' Love Me Tender . The story line is loaded with passion and emotion, at times quite overwhelming for the audience, as guilty consciences, silent accusations, and pointed recriminations cause frictional relationships. The cast makes award winning Wendy Lindstrom's tale into a triumph for Americana historical romance readers who relish a character study that hopefully leads to sequels set in Fredonia.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Shades of honor was a story of Love and family Honor , I would not rave about the book but it was readable light and easy reading but one you could walk away from without completing."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"Just discovered a brand new favorite author to add to my list! Based on reading this first book in the series, I just bought the boxed set of the Grayson Series! This was a very special novel because of the exceptional writing, the unique and well-developed story line, memorable characters with great depth, so much passion not related to sex, and sexual interactions that were just explicit enough. I am extremely choosy about romance novels, as so many seem formula-driven. For a well-rounded novel, there must be good background, a story well beyond just the romance, well-developed characters, passion, realistic interaction and dialog. All these were present in abundance! But there was so much more! A very intricate story line, with varied personalities involved, and descriptive scenes that engaged all the reader's senses. I had hopes for where the story would go, but had no idea how it would be resolved. Humans are about so much more than just sex; it was all here."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"I really liked this book. It was well written and the chracters were likeable and very well fleshed out. The story was endearing with the right amount of antagonism.

The language was offensive, morals questionable, and it was more racy than it should have been for a Christian book."},{"Title":"SHADES OF HONOR","review":"This is NOT a christian book as listed under Amazon's \\"Christian Fiction\\" section.

The idea is that \\"bouts\\" of exercise, accumulated throughout the day, will help engender improved health. Thate notion, on the surface, makes sense, but there is debate among the pundits in this field about the validity of this notion. Each chapter discusses in great detail the effects of physical activity on health.Chapter 4, the core of the book, focuses on how exercise affects specific diseases, including heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, and mental health. The book also offers overviews an historical perspective, a look at patterns and trends of physical activity in chapter 4 (which may be the most lucid part of this part), and some great tables that are full of data. The sixth chapter lapses into the fuzzy, esoteric realm of health promotion, a somewhat dubious field full of pompous notions such as the \\"transtheoretical model,\\" the \\"relapse prevention model,\\" and the \\"theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior\\"---all of which are just mumbo jumbo for getting people off their butts and out exercising. One oversight is the lack of any information about how physical activity can benefit people with disabilities.This book will not help PE teachers or gym rats in any way, but it is supposed to influence policy makers.The layout is easy to read and each chapter is fully supported by lots of references. Most of the writing, save the chapter on promoting exercise, is clearly written, a testament, no doubt, to the work of the editors."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"The movie was good but it doesn't follow the book and the book is much better."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"while there is the occasional comment or description that seems outdated to today's reader, the overall glimpse into 'private' life in China is remarkable. It is obvious the author lived there and knew the society she wrote about, at least as well as a non-Chinese person--who would always be an outsider to some extent--could possibly know that society. I was mesmerized--really, really enjoyed it. It rings true in every way that matters--and is surprisingly progressive in terms of a woman deciding to forge her own life within the context provided by the traditional culutre. Very interesting how she learns to live that life and learns from that life."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"If anyone wonders how revolutions happen, this book is a good place to start. Through the Wu family, feudal lords in rural China, we see inside a house of power and privilege based solely on inheritance where generations of Wus have presided over lands and servants. A home where most of the women lie idle all day while wet nurses feed and care for their children (while their own go hungry, living hours away from their mothers); servants draw baths, comb hair, and serve tea; and cooks prepare and serve every meal. The men occasionally look over the fields or the markets, but aside from a few overlord sorts of duties, they primarily focus on making sure their wives are obedient and their every pleasure is met. But alas, Buck begins to show the tide of change that comes to China, and we see this change through the Wu family as Madame Wu reaches forty, and her own children grow up and marry. Madame Wu balances delicately on the tightrope that connects past with present. She holds to tradition while inching toward a different view for the future. She begins this journey on her fortieth birthday when she decides she has spent enough time in her husband's bedroom, serving his needs. She decides to bring a concubine into the house for him so that she can take up residence in her own rooms, space all her own where she can think and read and, eventually, befriend her third son's \\"foreign\\" (aka Western) tutor. I suppose we could call the novel a multi-generation soap opera, but Buck manages to keep it real enough that we're captured rather than annoyed by the characters. Madame Wu manages her family with grace and wisdom and patience. In many ways, my life has nothing in common with hers-and yet, it does. I want tradition, but I welcome new ideas; I want a strong marriage but also my independence; I want respect and authority within my home, but I want my children to follow their own passions. I want Madame Wu's qualities, but not her life. At times, though, she does seems a bit superhuman, a bit too perfect. Though she occasionally admits to mistakes, she seems to have no flaws.Through the Wu family, we see the eventual break-up of the traditional feudal system and the traditional family of several generations under one roof. The youngest son chooses to become a farmer, wanting life in the outdoors rather than in books and inside the family walls. The third son chooses to serve the peasant people by building schools to help educate them. The second son wants further learning and education that he can only receive in a city, so he heads to Shanghai. Only the eldest son clings to the life in which he was raised, a life with his subservient wife, a life where he tells his brother, \\"I think first of our family, not of strangers and common folk,\\" a life where he feels it is not necessary to have hospitals for the poor because there are too many people already and \\"why should so many live?\\" Buck probably didn't realize that in this character she created a 2012 Republican politician. And who says a story about 1940's pre-revolutionary China has little to do with 21st century America? We seem to be fighting similar battles."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"The book arrived in a reasonable amount of time and in great condition. I haven't read it yet - it was purchased to be read for a book club. Since it's by Pearl Buck I'm sure it's good."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Madame Wu's decision is a difficult one to make, yet she makes it without hesitation. On her fortieth birthday, a new woman is to enter the house of Wu as the concubine of her own husband. Unwilling because of hi love for her, he nevertheless has to accept his wife's wish. Not even the distress her own children feel prevent her from carrying out her plan. Although criticised by everyone, Madame Wu won't change her mind: hers is a deliberate decision. Yet, her own sons and daughters-in-law do not understand why she would want to preserve this old tradition. Everybody feels Madame Wu's beauty and intelligence perfectly justify her husband's affection. The decision of taking a concubine coming from her is highly stupefying and distressing, as no wife would tamely accept her husband taking a second wife, let alone forcing him into doing it. Throughout the book, the reader experiences a mixed feeling of impotence, admiration and anger. Impotence towards habits and traditions that seem impossible to change. Admiration for a woman who is capable of bearing such a situation. Anger for her unwillingness to change it. The reader is led to wonder why should a woman want to perpetuate well-rooted traditions, when these are totally against her sex. And this is exactly what the younger generation cannot understand either. The discovery the reader makes towards the end of the book is overwhelming: Madame Wu has never loved her husband. The concubine she is forcing in his bed is thus nothing but a means of conquering a freedom she has never been allowed to have as a devote wife. The discovery of the love she feels for the dead clergyman Andr&eacute; reassures her on her resolution and partly explains Madame Wu's reject of occidental habits. A cold, conscious, determined woman. A woman representing the triumph of the mind over passion. The control of the feelings matched to the more truthful and purest love for a man."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"I have read just about all Pearl S. Buck has written and this book was my favorite if it is possible to pick one amoung this authors fabulous books.This is a must read for any woman -it is fanatastic and a life changing read.It will make you cry, smile and you will love it!"},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"I love Pearl Buck's books. She is so adept at taking the reader right into a foreign world and making it understandable. One begins to see how we are all really the same underneath our outward appearances and social customs. In this book, wealtlhy Madame Wu changes the course of her entire family's lives because of her strong desires to ultimately satisfy self. At first, her actions appear to be somewhat self-sacrificing in a certain way. Some readers may find her attitudes and actions quite modern, but there are far-reaching consequences to those actions and one wonders how selfless those actions really are in the end. I found the surprise turn in Madame Wu's relationship/feelings for the exiled priest to be a bit far-fetched for a wealthy Chinese woman of her time, but life can take odd twists and turns. To me this book is a moral tale of actions and consequences. I do not belive she or her family were better off in the end in spite of her taking over the care of the priest's orphans. Very interesting reading...food for thought."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"The final sentence of the book, &quot;she knew she was immortal&quot;, describes a women's journey from domination to submission. Madame Wu, a wealthy landowner's wife in pre-war China is in control of her family's destiny. She decides at the age of 40 to retire from being her husband's lover and instead 'buys' him a young concubine so she can spend the rest of her life seeking her own pursuits of the spirit. Instead she finds that all under her own 'control' is falling apart until she meet's her son's tutor, Brother Andre who begins to teach her about life and the immortal decisions she is making. At first she is skeptical but soon she begins to notice that his words and ideas breathe new life into what she begins to understand is her soul.Instead of 'controlling' her family's happiness she begins to understand that happiness comes from setting the soul free so it can truly be itself. In doing that she understands her own immortality and achieves a peace she never thought attainable.Pearl Buck weaves a story of a beautiful, dutiful woman who in the world's view has everything but learns to give it up so she may find the happiness that all souls seek, freedom to be who God intended."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"This is an awesome and thought provoking novel by Pearl Buck. It makes one evaluate if they really know the true meaning of love, and life. I am a real Pearl Buck fan---just don't want to read any other authors right now, but this one stands out as my favorite! Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"I stumbled across this book in an old store and couldnt get home fast enough to read it. I found it fascinating to gain insight from my armchair, culture and traditions from China. I loved the characters and the style it was written. There was more than just a change in a life here (Madam Wu) there was the lifelong friendship of her best friend, the challenges of their children, the political times they faced, forbidden love and the complexities of arrogance.. My only regret is that this book is no longer in print."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"At 40, Madame Wu discovers what love is and what it is not as she invites a young village foundling into her home as 2nd wife. She is composed and beautiful and intimidating, but discovers that love is finding your true self. Beautifully written and a story that keeps me intrigued until the last page."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Wow. I find Pearl Buck to be an author that really holds my attention, and write about complex characters that I don't really always like, but in the end, because of the author's writing and vision, I come to see them as really complex human beings.This book, in particular, I think is really spiritual. I really wish that I had a book group to discuss this book with. At the beginning, I didn't really care for or understand the main character, Madame Wu. She decides after her 40th birthday party, that her husband can have a concubine and that she can turn inward. In the beginning, this is really quite a difficult concept for me, but in a way, it's also very liberating. It's a form of birth control for her, and also a way to keep her husband satisfied. In the end, Pearl Buck, as an author, really shows this woman to be very multidimensional, and I feel, quite spiritual and not so superficial as I think she starts out to be.In the background, there are daughter in laws who are more liberated than Madam Wu, and the chafe at the idea of a concubine. They are too modern for that and would not stand for having a concubine in the house. Some of this is quite historical fand relates gently to the communist revolution. Also it is showing generational differences and lack of understanding between generations. In the end, Madame Wu, I feel , is far more liberated than her daughter in laws, no matter how modern they are.There is also a DVD of this story, and I think the DVD cover is on the book cover that I read. If it shows a white man in an embrace with a Chinese woman, as if they were about to kiss, I want to warn you that this Hollywood image is not really the book at all. And in fact, that picture does not occur in the book either. Really, that image is an abomination of the book.I do know, by reading Pearl Buck, why she is a Nobel prize winner in writing. For me, it's this. She helps you to see characters (people) that you might really hate or disagree with in real life as real, very multifacted people. And though I might not always come to agree or fully care about her characteres, through her writing, I will learn to understand and respect them more than I would have if I had not read the book. And more than that, Buck weaves in real history and fact and makes is very interesting.Please read her books. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"When I first read &quot;Pavilion of Women&quot; I was unsure whether I like it or not...in fact I was a little disappoionted. But over the months I found my thoughts constantly flitting back to it-- to some bit of dialog, some passage in this book. A year later, drawn by something I could not describe, I re-read this book. It is not a book for girls, or even young women. It is a book for women. Women who have been married a long time. They alone, I think, would understand, sympathize and identify with the actions of the main character, Madame Wu, who, on her 40th b'day, arranges for her husband to take a &quot;little wife&quot;,and the consquences of this action on the family. I know the premise sounds simple but this book explores the very deep waters of the human heart. To be honest, even after a second reading I am not sure I actually like Madame Wu, and , I must admit, it is not Mrs. Buck's greatest works but , as said before, there is something haunting about this book..."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Pavilion of Women tells the story of a privileged upper class woman, Madame Wu. Having reached middle age, she decides to retire from her responsibilities to her husband and family. She believes that by separating herself from these responsibilities, she will finally achieve happiness and freedom. Her life changes when she meet brother Andre, who is hired to tutor one of the sons of Madame Wu. An unusual relationship develops between these two characters. The reader expects this to turn into a typcial forbidden love affair. That is not the case. I don't want to give the story away. What I gained from the book is that true freedom is not dependent on our circumstances in life but it is a state of mind. Happiness can be found not by fulfulling selfish needs but by serving others and by taking the focus away from ourselves."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Pavilion of Women is one of the novels that Ms. Buck wrote about the struggle of old vs new. Within the Wu household are bought concubines along with revolutionary wives who chose their husband and did not have their parents involved.

Yet I would even venture to say that the advice that this priest gives Madame Wu might even....change you!"},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"This novel begins in the world of the classic Chinese novel--it could be The Dream of the Red Chamber or a Judge Dee tale. All is beautiful, precise, elegant, traditional ... But soon Madame Wu realizes that the traditional ways are not working anymore. She tries to use tradition to satisfy Western, feminist cravings to find deeper meaning for her life. Understanding and then loving a Western man, Madame Wu suddenly sees her life and family in an entirely new way. The novel is poetic, philosophical, and yet personal. As Madame Wu and the world politics of the 40s change forever the Wu family, the mind of the reader is changed as well."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"The ancient ways of China and the structure of their family living together under the authority of Madame Wu is absolutely fascinating to me. I can see how the Chinese ancient organization of the family that existed for thousands of years helps the family members understand where they belong within the unit. It also shows that learning is lifelong. We need our elders, scholars without the burden of blood family, and each age group in our human family to contribute to the richness of life.Through Madame Wu's thirst for knowledge we see that even those who have lived long still have to much to learn to be open and able to love."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Pavilion of Women provokes thought about the nature of women's roles, not only in China, where the novel is set, but also in the world in general. The juxtaposition of ideas from the West and East is exposed through the characters of Madame Wu, a woman newly turned 40, who has decided to end the physical aspect of her relationship with her husband, Brother Andre, an unorthodox, but very intensely committed priest, and Little Sister Hsia, a foil for Brother Andre, offering a more traditional Christianity. Timeless questions about the nature of relationships between women and men, parent and child, and privileged and poor are explored. I found passages so moving and thought-provoking that I saved them in a journal for further contemplation. This is a good book for women--and men! I would also recommend it for my high school-age daughters in order that their consciousness of their roles as women be raised. The issues raised in this book are not limited only to China of the early twentieth century; they are timeless."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"The story is the typical Chinese setting: wife brings in a concubine for husband.

A masterpiece for lovers of THE GOOD EARTH."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"This was well written and informative.

I took this book with me on a 20+ hr flight, so having nothing to do, the book started off somewhat slow. After you get through about 50 pages, it gets better. I think she was able to properly meld all the characters in the book, to not make you feel like you missed out or that there was too much going on. Synopsis for this book do not do this book justice."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Madame Wu - the matriarch of a large and wealthy family - decides on her fortieth birthday and after 24 years of marriage, she is no longer going to involve herself in the physical side of her marriage. She instead decides she will obtain a concubine for her husband and simply...retire, so to speak, and just do what is necessary to keep the household running. Yet, is life ever that easy?Madame Wu is a character that is easy to admire: self-contained and self-reliant, she is organized and intelligent and is skilled at managing both the household and the accounts. She is also socially skilled at handling the individuals in her household. There seems to be nothing lacking in this woman. She moves the individuals in her life around like pieces on a chessboard - but she lacks the emotional sense most individuals have.This story is one in which Madame Wu must somehow find herself after 40 years of living on this earth, if it isn't too late. And, as a reader, Madame Wu's journey is one of fascination. As she learns things about herself, faces things she had never considered before, the reader is almost compelled to look at themselves and ask: \\"Am I all that I can be?\\"Admittedly, Pearl S Buck is one of my favorite authors. I've not yet read anything of hers that I haven't liked, and this is no exception. She seems to so perfectly capture not only the Chinese culture and lifestyle, but the human spirit and struggles we all have. I enjoyed this book very much, as I was taken along on Madame Wu's journey."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"I cannot improve on the accurate and insightful reviews above; I can only add that this story touched me to the core and I did not want it to end.

It is about the soul's search for the highest kind of love, transcending gender, time, place and culture, all set within a fascinating time and place: China on the brink of WW II.

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR MY OWN COPY SINCE THE ONE I READ WAS BORROWED. THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING A COPY FOR ME TO BUY."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"A novel chronicling a Chinese woman's life at the time of Chinese nationalism. This novel begins when Madame Wu decides to get her husband a concubine on her 40th birthday and thus free herself from duty. Madame Wu (M. Wu), the novel's protagonist, is a woman that has been bound by duty for many years, and has striven for perfection in all of her life's choices. In choosing a concubine for her husband, she intends to free herself from her duty to her husband, and yet continue the rest of her familial responsibilities.As the novel progresses, the reader discovers that in order to allow her husband to flourish, Madame Wu, a wiser and more intelligent person than her husband, has given up pursuit of her own pleasures in order to build up the esteem of her husband and create a thriving home for the entire family. After all, as Old Gentleman, M. Wu's father-in-law, once said, \\"Intelligence, more than poverty and riches, divides human beings and makes them friends or enemies.\\" M. Wu's intelligence in a threat to her husband, and so she must abandon it. In choosing a concubine for her husband, thus horrifying both her friends and family, M. Wu's trapped spirit sees only freedom within its grasp.However, once the concubine, dubbed \\"Ch'iuming\\" by M. Wu, enters their life, things get complicated. Even Mr. Wu cannot understand why his wife, formally so loving, has now become so \\"monstrous cold.\\" From unrequited loves, to forbidden loves, to unequal marriages--Pavilion of Women is not quite a love story, and more of a literary exposition on the pursuit of perfection and the costs of selfish-love over unselfish-love.In an effort to marry off one of her sons, M. Wu asks a foreign tutor, named Brother Andre, to tutor her son in English and make him more \\"eligible\\" for the woman she has chosen for him. M. Wu is manipulative in nearly all that she does, flattering to obtain her own means, but there is instilled in the reader a sense of sympathy for the woman who had no choice in her marriage, and is making the most out of the duties handed to her. With Bother Andre, however, M. Wu finds a kindred spirit that she never expected to find in the priest-without-a-church. Brother Andre, a man who refuses to acknowledge one true religion, and believes that all gods are \\"God,\\" is still a man of great worth. He believes that \\"religion is better without money\\" and refuses M. Wu's payment for tutoring her son. Brother Andre traverses the city and takes in abandoned girls, teaching them with his vast wisdom in languages, astronomy, etc., and, at the age of 16, finds them husbands.When M. Wu's son leaves the house, his marriage to the woman of M. Wu's choice all but crumbling, M. Wu soon enlists Brother Andre to tutor her son's wife, in hopes that it will improve their relationship. But the son's wife is no scholar. Soon, M. Wu becomes Brother Andre's best student, and from that point in the novel, M. Wu becomes a much more sympathetic character, changing so that even her servants do not recognize her.Pavilion of Women was a book that I fully intended to dislike, having read The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck prior to this, and not having liked it. However, by a third of the way through, I had to know how M. Wu's story would end. It is not action packed, but slow moving and thought provoking, so if you're looking for a quick read or an action-packed thriller, look elsewhere. If you want to meditate on some interesting thoughts and characters, pick up Pavilion of Women and enjoy a luxurious read through Chinese culture and history, where the characters are richly described and become well known to you."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Pearl S. Buck raises some very interesting issues about the role of women, the role of a matriarch, mother and son relationships, mother and daughter-in-law relationships, employer and employee relationships, friendship and love."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"A luminous tale of priveledged life in a changing China, before WW11. To read it is to shift from our fast-paced modern world into a time measured by strict adherence to tradition and order. The writing eases the reader into a more serene and meditative state, giving the reader time to absorb and analize the plot situations and outcomes; a thoroughly enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Buck manages to create really strong female characters within the framework of traditional Chinese society. After reading this book, I sometimes find myself thinking, \\"How would Madame Wu act in this situation?\\" This is a book I'd want to give to any of my female friends as they reach the age of 40 - it conveys so beautifully how, as we age and know ourselves better, still there are discoveries to be made and surprises to be experienced."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"Pearl S. Buck's novel tells the story of the Wu family in pre-communist China. Nobel and respected, they have lived for generations in the same tradition. Madame Wu is the mistress of this household, her whole life spent fulfilling the duties of her sex - ministering to her husband, bearing sons, dealing with servants, maintaining a smooth order in the house. But she is intelligent and deeply emotional, and has felt caged by an existence where everyone else come first.So on her fortieth birthday, Madame Wu decides to \\"retire\\" from her duties, to find time for herself. She arranges matters in the house like pieces on a chess board - procuring a concubine for her husband, and marrying off her children, hoping they will no longer demand her attention. But her retreat brings only emptiness, until a foreign priest enters the house to tutor her son.What follows is not a typical \\"forbidden love\\" story. Instead, \\"Pavillion of Women\\" uses the plot to explore themes of identity, self-love and what our connections with other people really mean. Madame Wu finds that freedom doesn't mean running away from duty. It involves learning to love herself first, setting her spirit free. It is then that she is able to return to her duties with a new sense of content.The conflict between responsibility to the group and personal freedom is played out in the family, as a microcosm of China as a whole at the time. But the issues here transcend time and culture - most of us will be able to relate to them. The book is beautifully written, and I recommend it if you want a story that makes you think."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"I love and treasure this book immeasurably. Every time I find a copy at a used book sale, I buy it and send it to my one of my women friends. Women everywhere should read this spectacular, beautifully written story of the independent, sassy Madame Wu. I thought Ms. Buck could never top \\"The Good Earth\\" but this one did it for me. I won't give a book report, just my humble opinion that this book should be on the reading list of every woman on earth....even my 20-something daughters loved the story."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"After reading and thoroughly enjoying her novel, \\"Pavilion of Women\\" (written in 1948), it was not difficult for me to understand why Pearl S. Buck earned the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature in 1938. As a natural storyteller, Buck allows one to enter the heart and mind of her main character, the beautiful and accomplished Madame Wu, so fully and painlessly by using simple explanations that seem so effortlessly illumined that they transcend the cultural differences of a mid 20th century China and allow this magnificent multi-dimensional creation to speak as a fully flesh and blood universal woman.As the title suggests, the plot revolves around the day to day happenstances of the oppressed \`pavilion of women' that provides a wealthy Chinese gentleman's \`happiness' in the form of siring future generations and keeping him pleasured as befits his rank as lord and master. Madame Wu, the one and only wife, on the day of her fortieth birthday decides quite calculatingly to acquire a concubine for this husband whom she has never loved, allowing her to rid herself within the complicated etiquette of the Chinese upper class of the burden of servicing her husband conjugally. As the mother of four sons, in her eyes and in the eyes of society, she fulfilled her duty as a wife. Fully knowing that she will continue to oversee the management of all who live under her domain, she nevertheless anticipates her retirement with relish, planning to read and self-educate herself within the confines of her father-in-law's well-stocked library. As a mother and mother-in-law, she must tactfully and eloquently steer her sons and daughters-in-law towards a rich and satisfying future in a newer less understood world while still buttressing the Chinese family infrastructure to continue what she herself withholds as traditionally correct.As China plummets towards modern thinking and communism, Madame Wu discovers that she must make concessions. Thinking to arrange the marriage of her broader-minded third son, she hires an unconventional Italian priest, Brother Andre, to teach languages and the known sciences to better endow her Fengmo with the intellectual assets he now needs to captivate a more progressive bride.Instead, the self-disciplined Madame Wu finds that she is mesmerized by the foreigner's gentle persuasiveness. With him she explores the idea of the soul and its ever pressing quest for freedom and realizes that throughout her life thus far she played the role of a wise albeit voyeuristic manipulator rather than that of thinking and feeling woman. Her gentle yet intense spiritual love for Andre reinforces Madame Wu's innate strength and enables her to make free, wise and joyous decisions that bring a warm happiness to the inhabitants under her domain.Bottom line: While the storyline moves along nicely, what makes \\"Pavilion of Women\\" an absolute pleasure to read is the clarity of Madame Wu's portrait that Buck allows us to form first from the inner workings of Madame Wu's mind and then from the soaring aspirations of her soul as it communes with that of Brother Andre. Buck's language flows from one \`pavilion' event to the next; her style is relaxed and easy to read, the development of Madame Wu's identity both believable and beautiful. Highly recommended for its ability to entertain and depict an alien culture.Diana F. Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"This is a strange love story. The setting is the time of Chinese nationalization, just before the Communist revolution. The main character is Madame Wu, an accomplished lady and wife of a wealthy landower.

Her intelligence soars above everyone elses. She has has a dear friend Madam Wang, but no peer or equal. That is, until she meets Brother Andre, who seems to be a Christian monk, but is something else entirely.Madam Wu hires the unusual Brother Andre to teach English to her son, but ends up being Andre's best student.

When she hires a foreign priest, Brother Andre, to come teach her son, he introduces a new world to her through his thought-provoking preaching and words of wisdom.

It is simply wonderful."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"&quot;Pavilion of Women&quot; was Pearl S. Buck's first novel about an upper-class Chinese family. It's the story of Madame Wu, beautiful and intelligent, who decides on her 40th birthday that her physical duty to her husband is over and, against his will, finds him a concubine. She is as deep as he is shallow, a good wife and mother, who prides herself on having raised four sons and married off the three oldest, but she doesn't realize she has never loved her husband, until she meets her real soulmate in the person of Brother Andre, a renegade Catholic priest whom she engages to teach her son foreign languages. Madame Wu also becomes Brother Andre's pupil and learns more from him than he ever set out to teach; what Brother Andre gives Madame Wu is the priceless gift of self-knowledge. Madame Wu has been the heart and soul of her large household, totally in control in her quiet way, but she realizes that running her large household is one thing; running her family's lives is something else again, and the best thing she can do for them is help them be who they were meant to be. In Madame Wu, Pearl Buck created a remarkable character who after 40 years finally learns what it is to love."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"If you plan to read this book and do not wish to have it spoiled for you, do not read the review by &quot;Manuela Bonfanti from Geneva&quot;."},{"Title":"Pavilion of women","review":"This is my 2nd favourite Pearl Buck novel-the first being &quot;The Good Earth&quot;.It describes in detail the everyday lives of the women of a wealthy household in the 1930's,before and during WW2 and before the rise of communism.They are pampered,waited upon and their only real duties are to satisfy the needs of their husbands and to produce sons.Despite their lives of ease, they are totally cloistered women who rarely leave the confines of the huge,multi-generational home and are ,for the most part,uneducated and completely ignorant od anything except events which happen to their immediate families. The true head of this family is a rare person of this class-an educated woman who hires a Christian priest to tutor her sons and who begins to absorb his teachings herself.I loved the rich details of their lives-the food,clothing,furnishings and all the things which made up their world.

Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down till I was finished with this book. It is a very moving and thoughtful book ~~ opening my eyes to something else that I would have never thought of reading.This book is about Madame Wu, who decided to retire from married life at the age of 40. She suggested a concubine for her husband as she believes very strongly that his needs need to be met ~~ just not by her. Her excuse is that she didn't want to bear any more children, but that is just a public excuse, one she offered to everyone who asked. The truth is, she didn't love her husband and wanted to retire from that part of her marriage. Needless to say, it unsettled the entire family ~~ even the concubine was unsettled. It reverberated throughout the entire book till the very end, when everyone seems to have moved onto their own problems.This is a book on a busy wealthy Chinese family. It is about traditions and ideas, non-traditions, love and finding purpose in life. It is about family relationships between father, son, mother, son, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, friendships, and even between mistress and servant.Madame Wu never thought she'd find peace and happiness till one of her sons' instructors came along. He was a Jesuit priest and they struck up a friendship based on conversations (which she remembered after his death). He literally changed her life and thought process. From being a woman who always did what she was told, she was liberated to being a free-thinking woman who strove to find peace in her soul.It is a book that I would recommend to all readers ~~ and it is definitely a book for a book club to discuss!

As for this tape, I finally got this figured out. This is part of a four-tape program that represents the complete two-book Winnie-the-Pooh story collection, except the stories are out of order (probably so that they would fit equally on the tapes). Book 1, &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh,&quot; is represented by &quot;Pooh Goes Visiting&quot; (stories in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10) and &quot;Piglet Meets a Heffalump&quot; (stories: 5, 6, 7, 8).

Reading a story out of the original works takes a good 15-20 minutes, which is more than one can really expect from a preschooler or toddler. Also, the original Pooh is a bit like Sesame Street, in that there are phrases and indeed entire sections of the stories that adults will find amusing but which will just go over a child's head.And yet, I didn't want to break down and go the route of the Disney-fied Pooh books, with their cartoonish illustrations and watered-down plots and characters.That's why I was so pleased to find the Easy-to-Read series.

These little books are divided into four chapters, although it should be no problem to read one from start to finish in one sitting.The print is large and well spaced, and there are ample illustrations (the original drawings by E.H. Shepard) on every page spread to keep little eyes engaged in the story. Most important, the editor has removed most of the passages that aren't so kid friendly and has simplified the stories without giving them a Disney style candy coating. One could read the original story and then the easy-to-read version and get the same basic plot; when going from the Milne works to the Disney versions, the same is certainly not true.I didn't give these books five stars because the editor retained some language and dialogue that may be a bit confusing for children in the intended age range. Nevertheless, these books are a wonderful introduction to a classic cast of characters for the preschool set."},{"Title":"Tigger Comes to the Forest and Other Stories","review":"This was an instant success with my 4 1/2 year old son. He listens to audiobooks often and tends to request the cd's from this series mor than any others."},{"Title":"Tigger Comes to the Forest and Other Stories","review":"This is another beautiful story set from the series, but I have to admit that the voice of tigger is a bit annoying, other than that we still like it and it is definitely worth buying it, ...even if you prefer to skip the stories including tigger."},{"Title":"Tigger Comes to the Forest and Other Stories","review":"I love these tapes. My preschooler loves these tapes and has since age 2 or so. My sister gave them to me because she and her kids love these tapes. First of all, Winnie the Pooh is simply the best toddler/preschool character out there, as he's funny and not scary or naughty, (or loud), and they use lots of words and do things which are new and fun and interesting for your toddler/ preschooler. Second, this dramatization is unbelievably good--entertaining to adults as well as kids, the perfect mix of humor and gentleness. Another reviewer has said Tigger is annoying--I completely disagree. Tigger is FINE. I wonder if this reviewer has encountered Disney Tigger--now there's annoying! We have taken these tapes everywhere and now of course have lost or broken most of them so I HAVE TO buy some more. There are alot of books and tapes out there you can take out of the library--JUST BUY THESE"},{"Title":"Tigger Comes to the Forest and Other Stories","review":"After my introduction to this ensemble cast with &quot;Pooh Goes Visiting,&quot; I looked forward to the rest of the series. But this one is a bit of a let-down. Be warned that the stories are, or seem to be, out of sequence. Contrary to the title, only two, I think, are about or even contain Tigger. And the voice of Tigger is REALLY annoying. Really. But the rest of the cast continues to bring a gentle wonderfulness to the Pooh stories -- so much so that it's well worth the annoyance of Tigger. Get this one, but don't miss the other, better ones."},{"Title":"Tigger Comes to the Forest and Other Stories","review":"[This is a review of the Hodder/Headline audiocassette version] I learned to read by listening (again and again and again and again) to a pair of well-loved and well-worn LPs of the Pooh stories read by Maurice Evans. I always considered them the finest Pooh audiobooks ever recorded. Up until now! Now there's this wonderful series of fully-dramatized adventures of Pooh featuring a brilliant cast of wonderful British actors: Stephen Fry (&quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;) as Pooh, Geoffrey Palmer (&quot;The Madness of King George&quot;) as Eeyore, Judy Dench (&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;) as Kanga...and best of all, the *incomparable* Jane Horrocks (&quot;Little Voice&quot; and Bubbles from &quot;AbFab&quot;) as a squeaky, alarmed, and altogether adorable Piglet. You don't have to be a kid to appreciate these fine recordings (and there are plenty of adult Pooh fans out there who will *love* these versions). Accept no substitutes: this is simply the finest Pooh audio series yet created, beating by a *far* distance the Alan Bennett and (ugh!) Charles Kuralt versions. There's more than just this one tape in the series, too. The series includes &quot;Tigger Comes to the Forest&quot; (ISBN: 1840322195); &quot;Piglet Meets a Heffalump&quot; (ISBN: 1840320524) and &quot;Pooh Invents a New Game&quot; (ISBN: 1840322268). Type the 10-digit ISBN number into the Amazon search field to go directly to the webpages for these cassettes."},{"Title":"Feminist Readings/Feminists Reading","review":"This is a wonderful introduction to different kinds of feminist theory. For each kind of theory, the authors give a historical context, explain the theory, show how the theory could be applied to a couple of canonical texts, and then discuss the pros and cons of the theory. Some chapters are better than others, and as it was published in the late 1980s, it is missing developments from the nineties forward. Still, seeing how Luce Irigaray's theory might be applied to an actual text is incredibly helpful for someone trying to understand these theories."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The works of Washington Irving)","review":"Irving's book on the Alhambra and the surrounding territory of Granada remains one of the best guidebooks to the region--and one of the most entertaining travelogues ever written. Anyone who has visited (or plans to visit) southern Spain will be thrilled by the account of Irving's trip, but I'll go further: you need not ever go there to enjoy this classic work of history and humor.Irving stayed at the Alhambra for three months in 1829 and jotted down notes concerning its history and legends. Early in his visit, Irving was accosted by Mateo Ximenes, a credulous and indigent \\"son of the Alhambra\\" who soon proves a worthy and endearing companion, a guide to secret chambers, and a conveyor of whimsical traditions. A couple of years later, while in London, Irving wrote \\"The Alhambra,\\" describing his idiosyncratic hosts, recounting the millennium-old history of the Moorish occupation, and transcribing fresh versions of the palace's medieval legends and myths, many of which resemble stories from the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" The first edition appeared in 1832, a second American edition was published four years later, but Irving extensively revised and enlarged the book in 1851, incorporating material unavailable or unknown to him in the 1830s. This last edition is the one most commonly available today.The result is easily Irving's most accessible book, filled with wit and anecdote. Alongside the history of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, Irving intersperses tales (both historical and mythical) of enchanted caves, imprisoned princesses, and buried treasure. His admiration for Islamic heritage is obvious throughout: \\"The Arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking, into Gothic Spain.\\" And he regularly denounces the prejudices (both medieval and contemporary) \\"so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal, which sometimes inflamed the Christian enterprises\\" and which have prevented his fellow Europeans from studying a rich and justifiably proud tradition.As Irving accurately summarizes, Moslem Spain was \\"a region of light amid Christian, yet benighted Europe; externally a warrior power fighting for existence; internally a realm devoted to literature, science, and the arts; where philosophy was cultivated with a passion . . . and where the luxuries of sense were transcended by those of thought and imagination.\\" Plus, the Islamic \\"occupiers\\" and Christian warriors certainly knew how to tell a good story. This book will delight both history and literature buffs."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The works of Washington Irving)","review":"I don't always like to read classics, but when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book, I decided to try it, and I am very glad that I did. Irving's words, though written so many years before now, still paint eloquent pictures of the Spain of his time. I could almost see what he was seeing. The stories and legends are also wonderful and fascinating. An antique copy of this book is one of my most treasured gifts."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The works of Washington Irving)","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book. If you are not planning on going, read it and you'll probably change your mind."},{"Title":"The Alhambra (The works of Washington Irving)","review":"I ordered this as a gift for my Ma.When I visited her a few weeks later I saw something that looked likea high schooler had copied at kinkos.The type is blurry and smudged.Some paragraphs are unreadable.Will Amazon take it back?No, it been more than 30 days....40 days to be exact.I will not purchase gift books from Amazon again...better off going to Borders....get aclean copy and ship it yourself."},{"Title":"Morrissey","review":"ive read several books in the smiths/moz vien. this one wont blow your mind but its worth its price. informative, clear and thoughtful."},{"Title":"When a parent loses a job: A workbook about my parent's job loss","review":"\\"With the growing number of job losses in the work force today, new issues are emerging for American families.

This extraordinary book is the perfect instructional tool for concerned parents, schools, outplacement services, and mental health centers.\\""},{"Title":"Mandragola;","review":"Most people know Niccolo Machiavelli, author of &quot;The Prince (Il Principe)&quot;, as the infamous apostle of power politics. But in his own day, Machiavelli was celebrated for his witty, sometimes satirical, plays. Perhaps the most entertaining of these--&quot;Mandragola&quot; (1518)--is available in this very readable edition.The protagonist is Callimaco, a libidinous young man who sets about to seduce Lucretia, the enchanting wife of a wealthy merchant. Callimaco fortuitously learns that the merchant has tried desperately to father a child, but to no avail. The clever Callimaco thereupon disguises himself as a physician and in this guise examines Lucretia, finding her even more alluring than he has dreamt. He deftly diagnoses her condition and prescribes a curious concoction that he must produce from the root of the mandrake plant--thus &quot;mandragola&quot;--to cure Lucretia of her affliction. If Lucretia drinks this potion, he declares, she will most certain! ! ly conceive a child.The gullible merchant is overjoyed, until he hears that the potion has one very severe side-effect: The first man to join with Lucretia carnally after she has partaken of the drink will die from the potion's effects! The merchant, Nicias, understands immediately: On no account must he be the first to sleep with his wife after she has taken the potion. He knows what he must do: He must find another. He explains the predicament to his wife, and she (reluctantly?) agrees to go along with her hustband's plan.As the reader might have guessed, the &quot;physician&quot; Callimaco informs Nicias that he just happens to know a young man who might consent to this indecent proposal. This man is, of course, Callimaco himself, who reappears in yet another disguise.Machiavelli's mischief is deliciously entertaining. The characters are true, and the innuendos are still fresh 480 years after Mandragola was first published.SOURCES:Muir, D. Erskine. Machiavell! ! i and His Times. New York: E.P.

London: Transaction Publishers, 1998."},{"Title":"Mandragola;","review":"Machiavelli is best known for his treatises on political action, most notably Il Principe. Most readers don't realize he was also a playwright, however, and an accomplished one. Mandragola is one of his best plays.One of the themes that runs through all of Machiavelli's works is the art of the crafty assault, and it is present here in spades. His greatest respect is for the man behind the puppet, and in this case it is Ligurio. The plot has already been outlined in a previous review, so it will not be discussed here, but the primary purpose of the plot is to develop the intricate artifice that Ligurio uses to help his friend Callimaco.The translation here is great also. At some points the translation interferes with the meter, but this is rare; most of the play flows along very naturally. The language is clear and easy to read, and yet Flaumenhaft, the translator, captures the essence of such difficult words as virtu, animo, and remedio without losing any of their meaning. Alternate meanings are often given in the footnotes.This is an excellent play, and the translation more than holds up its end. For those who appreciate the use of strategem, want a more thorough understanding of Machiavelli, or simply want to read a great play, this is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Mandragola;","review":"Most people think of Machiavelli as only a political thinker; but he was also an accomplished military tactician and playwright. The Mandragola is a classic Renaissance comedy; somewhat reminiscent of the works of Shakespeare or Marlowe, and the play, a farcical work involving love potions, and mistaken identity, and is quite funny even today.Good reading for any drama student interested in the period."},{"Title":"Mandragola;","review":"The plot of this Renaissance play by Niccolo Machiavelli was quite adequately described by a previous reviewer, so I won't repeat the synopsis here. Suffice it to say that, for those who have read \\"The Prince,\\" this play provided an illustration of the ideas presented in that treatise as they might work out in practice.The central character of the play is Ligurio. Machiavelli characterizes him as a parasite, but here I think Machiavelli is being ironic. I think Ligurio is a stand-in for Machiavelli himself. He is the crafty plotter, the one who puts the entire scheme in action. Callimaco is the noble prince for whose benefit Ligurio plots. Nicia and Fra Timoteo represent, respectively, the gullibility and stupidity of the lawyer/political class and the corruption and venality of the clergy. (Remember, Machiavelli was writing at a time when the Reformation was just around the corner, precisely because of clergymen like Fra Timoteo.) Lucrezia might be characterized as the innocent who is not so innocent after all; she initially appears to be a young girl who is about to be used to satisfy a young man's lust, but she eventually consents to the scheme and finally agrees to take on Callimaco as her lover. The underlying ethos of the play is that the end justifies the means, that other people can be duped and used to satisfy someone's wants, and that in the end everyone benefits. Pure Machiavelli!"},{"Title":"Mandragola;","review":"In preparing myself for a class I shall be attending next semester on Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, I stumbled upon this play by Machiavelli entitled Mandragola (or Mandrake, as in the herb, in English).I had already read The Prince some years back, and have just started on Discourses on Livy. These two are, of course, the two one must read if one wants to have a decent sense of Machiavelli's contributions to political theory. However, since so much of his stuff can seem heavy at times, reading something more lighthearted by Machiavelli has been a lot of fun.Mandragola is a comedy that takes place in Florence in the early sixteenth century. The characters are all humorous. The main character, Callimaco, is something of a rakehell, but a nice enough fellow. The play begins with him back at home in Florence after just finishing his studies in Paris. We learn that Callimaco has returned to Florence because of the reputation of one supposedly comely-looking girl, who is married to an older rich gentleman. Callimaco hatches a plan with his servant on how to turn the older husband into a cuckold. Essentially, this play is about Callimaco trying to get laid with some other man's wife. The comedy behind the play is in all the misadventures in which Callimaco and his team of licentious buddies involve themselves whilst accomplishing that goal.More than a few good lines pop up in the dialogue, but my favorite scene is probably the last one, where, after the exciting deed has been done, everyone goes to church to make repentance--some more than others.From a political theory perspective, Machiavelli's diction become important. Favorite words of his (like virtue, fortune, others...) are peppered throughout the dialogue, but on first read I found myself loosing myself in the story too much to pay attention to what any of this might mean in comparison to Machiavelli's larger body of political work. Doubtlessly, I shall be rereading this short play later in the coming months to work out these larger issues, assuming that they are there.For those less interested in the political theory aspect, Mandragola still makes for a funny read. I hope I can see it some day performed on stage. It would be interesting to see how a director might flesh out the scenes and characters."},{"Title":"Education and Conflict: Complexity and Chaos","review":"The author makes great argument and connection. Give a true picture of what education is truly about throughout the world. Is education responsible for a true breakdown of social cohesion? Read the book and you will find out"},{"Title":"Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy","review":"An extremist, disruptive version of capitalism, called neoliberalisim, now dominates the worldwide economic order. Practiced by huge transnational corporations and financial institutions with vast support from central governments, neoliberalism essentially transforms entire societies, destroying traditional ways of life and forcing individuals, sometimes with violence, to conform to its dictates. Not surprisingly, capitalistic institutions unleash immense propagandistic efforts to tout capitalism's unmatched outputs while obscuring the demands and burdens that it places on societies and individuals. \\"Naming the System\\" penetrates these purposeful obfuscations and describes the actual workings and impact of capitalism.The field of neoclassical economics provides a theoretical basis for the workings of capitalism. Though now dominant in universities and economic institutions, the author repeatedly takes issue with its essential premises. Especially irritating is the unwillingness of neoclassical economists to acknowledge the \\"contradictions\\" of capitalism, that is, its failure to deliver as predicted. It is difficult to not come to the conclusion that the entire discipline of neoclassical economics is subservient to the business class.Neoclassical economic theory posits \\"individuals,\\" all seeking to maximize their self-interests by freely operating in various marketplace settings, as the core actors in capitalism. According to the theory, this \\"free-market\\" activity operates within the context of fundamental laws of supply and demand, and will result in socially optimal outcomes. However, to regard all market actors as essentially equal \\"individuals\\" is highly misrepresentative. Multi-billion dollar corporations often can monopolize markets, manipulate consumers through advertising, and otherwise leverage their tremendous advantages in resources. But neoclassical economists are loath to admit that the dynamics of power, inequality, and coercion can tilt markets.A huge gap in the theory of the general benevolence of markets is that a society of self-interested maximizers will often fail to generate even basic, needed social outcomes. Conveniently, neoclassical economists leave it to governments to fill in where markets fail by doing such things as building roads and bridges, providing for national defense and public schools, and providing a legal structure and the enforcement necessary to conduct business. Neoclassicists are far less sanguine about the need to regulate or otherwise deal with the side effects of marketplace actions. According to the theory, self-interested businesses do not have to deal with the social effects of causing environmental degradation in production, laying-off workers, or paying poverty-level wages, because the marketplace will. However, it is simply not likely that the random acts of relatively uninformed and powerless individuals will be aggregated sufficiently to affect social outcomes through the marketplace. Neoclassicists insist that market actors always exercise \\"free choice.\\" Of course, they have to ignore the fact that such factors as the lack of actual equal opportunity to be well educated and to associate with employment enhancing individuals and the subtle coercion of a large pool of unemployed workers are not freely chosen conditions and do undermine free-market activity.The author insists that capitalism, or its latest incarnation as neoliberalism, be judged on its worldwide economic performance. Many Third World nations, in exchange for economic assistance, under directives by international, neoliberal economic bodies, such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the WTO, have accordingly opened their economies to global corporations and liberalizing economic forces. But results have hardly been encouraging. Since 1980 there has been no growth in per capita GDP in these countries and they have fallen further behind rich nations, not drawing nearer as predicted. Structural adjustment policies have forced millions of peasants from their lands into sprawling urban ghettos with only sporadic contingent and informal sector work available. It is hard to resist the conclusion that neoliberalism is a mechanism to disadvantage working people and to permit global corporations to exploit them.The author acknowledges that capitalism can produce a vast array of goods, but that productivity comes at a cost to societies and individuals. Though neoclassicists declared capitalism to be recession proof in the 1990s, capitalism has always lurched from crisis to crisis with a lot of discomfort being delivered to the working class with each recession. Loss of a job can be devastating, but capitalism also relentlessly redefines the nature of work. Capitalism is unconcerned about the inherent worthiness and importance of having and doing meaningful work. It persistently deskills jobs by breaking them into sub-tasks and subjecting them to automation and mechanization. Fewer and fewer workers are permitted to conceptualize, plan, and execute their work in a complete process.Neoliberal spokesmen often hold that capitalism and democracy are essentially one and the same. But the author points out that it is a fundamental contradiction of capitalism that the freedom that both employers and workers supposedly enjoy when meeting in the labor market disguises a regime of total control within workplaces. It is that unchallengeable control that permits owners to squeeze excessive profits from workplaces. The author digresses with an explanation of Marx's labor theory of value, but the issue is really one of relative power.Capitalism subtly redefines freedom and democracy. Democracy is no longer located in the political realm involving decision making; it has become the freedom to participate in the marketplace, to act in one's best interest. Social or collective concerns need not trouble an individual self-maximizer - the market will do that automatically. But it has been the collective actions of labor unions and worker-centered political parties that have attempted to tame the worst excesses of capitalism. But the effectiveness of labor unions has often been reduced through both repression and cooptation.Some radicals contend that the contradictions of capitalism are becoming so evident that it is a foregone conclusion that the working class will become a potent force in their own liberation. But the author is not so enamored of those prospects. The reaction of workers to the depredations of capitalism is often psychological self-destruction, not some form of activism. In addition, capitalism has proven to be highly resilient to challenges. It can usually call upon the full power of the state to defend its interests. And the ideology of consumerism is pervasive and subtly distorting, even equating shopping with revolutionary actions.Understanding the nature and contradictions of capitalism is certainly a place to begin to contest it. This book does its part well."},{"Title":"Naming the System: Inequality and Work in the Global Economy","review":"I am not an economist, but some of my best friends are. And much of my work as a labor law professor, has involved dealing with ideas couched in economic terms. Even so, there is a lot about economics as it is really practiced, that comes as a surprise. Several years, when the news was full of predictions from leading economists about the effects of a new policy on the economy, I asked a group of economists whether these sorts of predictions were based on studies of effects in the world. The economists told me that these predictions none of these predictions were ever tested. All that was ever done was to create simplified theories about how the economy worked and then use those theories to make predictions. No one ever checked to make certain those theories were valid.Imagine what healthcare would be like if doctors and scientists operated this way. Actually, we don't have to imagine. This is how life was in the Middle Ages when doctors tried to balance the body's four humors, and everyone knew the sun revolved around the earth. The models got more and more complex as reality did not jibe with theory.So all of us have our fates determined by economists whose methods are no more up to date than the 16th century. Consider Alan Greenspan, the hero of the Fed. He and his colleagues for years were convinced that the only way to fight inflation - and inflation had to be fought at all costs - was to raise interest rates any time unemployment fell below 5.8%. The effect was that higher interest rates increased unemployment. In the early 1990's, unemployment began to fall below this danger level, but no inflation appeared. Pressure was put on the Fed not to raise interest rates, enough pressure that they held off. Unemployment plunged ever lower with no inflation. Did the economists admit that their theory had to be discarded based on the evidence/ Of course not. They responded that they needed to refine the theory to account for this aberration from the theory, but the theory was still solid.Michael Yates does a much better job at leading the reader through classic economic theory and exploring the many ways in which those theories stand unproven - and yet they still rule the world. Yates provides a fair and balanced look at the claims of classic economics for economies and for global trade and demonstrates that there is no evidence to support those claims.There is no question that Michael Yates is passionate and has strong opinions. He does nothing to hide his views and is fair and open with the reader as he presents his arguments against classical economics and his ideas as to what should replace those disproven theories.
