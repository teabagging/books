I have read the section on Logotherapy many times since. Very inspiring."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"What makes \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\" such an enduring masterpiece, and, if such can be said, my preferred literary rendering of the holocaust experience, is that Frankl is able to concretely draw out meaningful truth and positive prescriptions for action from the deepest declivity of despair. Other works, including the deservedly revered \\"Night\\", give way at points to nihilism, cynicism, and bitterness, understandable in such devastation, but noticeably absent in Frankl's response. The humanity with which Frankl transcends the total assault he endures is more than laudable - and is the enabling and empowering turn in his destiny.\\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\" (86)\\"Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. Dostoevski said once, \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\" These words frequently came to mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost\\" (87)\\"But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\" (88)These are the ultimate lessons - the wisdom, which in fact, can only emerge from the crucible of such suffering. Who is more deserving of our respect and attention than those who endured a challenge which so few survived to report? The wisdom articulated in this book is thus rare as it is hard-won, and we, the more fortunate, should heed the contents of this slender, accessible, and powerful record."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"After years of hearing others praise this book, I finally read it for myself, and found it is worth reading! Dr. Victor Frankl, an author-psychiatrist, experienced first-hand the horrible atrocities that were forced upon the Jews in Nazi Concentration Camps, and lived to tell about it. He shares the truths he learned as a prisoner, including man's search for meaning in life, and his ability to survive extreme physical and emotional hardships, despite the odds. In the process he developed a new approach to psychotherapy, known as \\"logotherapy.\\" At the root of the theory is the value of helping others find their unique purpose or mission in life.What was the key to the survival in the Nazi death camps? It wasn't survival of the fittest in the traditional sense of those who were the most physically robust of the human species. Rather it tended to be those individuals, described below, who found inner survival strength as follows:(1.) Those who had a meaning in life, a sense of purpose, or intent to accomplish a goal. It was Dr. Frankl's desire to survive the death camps so that he could write and publish his experiences and truths learned through his suffering.(2.) Those who had a spiritual belief in God and a faith that there was a divine plan for them. They believed God would help them through their difficulties. Dr. Frankl said: \\"In spite of all the enforced physical and mental primitiveness of the life in a concentration camp, it was possible for spiritual life to deepen.\\"(3.) Those who had an intellectual life to fall back on (in their thoughts) during the monotonous, strenuous, and most painful times of endurance. He states: \\"Sensitive people who were used to a rich intellectual life may have suffered much pain... but the damage to their inner selves was less. They were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom.\\" This was something their oppressors were not able to take away from them.(4.) Those who held on to the cherished bonds of loved ones. Dr. Frankl often found strength by carrying on imagined conversations with his beloved wife who had been taken to another death camp. His ability to communicate his love for her in his thoughts, and receive back her love, gave him the incentive to hold on to life during the toughtest of times. Unfortunately his wife was not able to survive, but he didn't know this at the time. (Perhaps it was her Spirit he was communicating with afterall.)I was impressed with the description Dr. Frankl gave of a few of the prisoners, who despite being in a starving and sickly state, managed to go around offering aid and moral encouragement to others. Such individuals often gave of their meager piece of daily bread to keep another fellow prisoner alive. Such selfless service in the face of death, was truly admirable.In the second half of Dr. Frankl's book he distinguishes the difference between his theory of logotherapy and that of traditional approaches to physcho-analysis. At the core of his theory is the challenge to help individuals discover for themselves their reason for being, even a worthwhile goal. He quotes Nietzche who said: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\\" Dr. Frankl says: \\"The meaning of life always changes, but it never ceases to be.\\" This book can be a great resource for readers to evaluate their own purpose in life, and perhaps in the process choose a path that is worthwhile not only to them but that will benefit others as well."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"My copy of Viktor E. Frankl's book is dog-eared through constant re-reading. Never has such a short book had such a long-reaching effect on my life. The story of his survival against formidable odds in Nazi concentration camps may be compared with other great survival stories and stories of people with extraordnary handicaps who make their lives a resounding success. I never understood how they did it. And now I know and I feel inspired because I know. They gave their lives meaning, and worked on that every waking moment. Some aspects of logotherapy do, as one reviewer notes, sound a bit like reverse psychology. But if it works, who cares about the label? I'm cynical about self-help books and self-styled gurus but Dr Frankl and his book don't even belong in that genre. The Los Angles Times is right: &quot;If you read but one book this year, Dr Frankl's book should be that one&quot;."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I wish I had read this book earlier in my life.And, I can see that this will be just the first time that I have read it--I am going to be reading this book at least once a year, I want to re-visit it frequently. It will be a classic for me.For me, the first power of this short book is his narrative of survival in the concentration camps. What he witnessed and reports has its own power, but when he compounds it with an interpretation, that is, a search for meaning, Frankl's book has resounding merit. The second power is his development and explication of logotherapy. Freud advanced the theory that it was sublimated urges that drove the individual; Adler advocated that it was the individual's will to power that moved one; but Frankl's logotherapy is a theory searching for meaning--life needs to be interpreted. The individual lives and suffers now and in the past, but for the future, striving to be a better person, one must find a meaning, a 'why,' in order to change.Frankl's psychotherapy school of thought, I'm sure, has its detractors. I don't care about that. What I care about is the singular wisdom, tested in the fire, of his narrative. My spirit and my soul are still reverberating."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"OverviewThis book is divided into two sections. The first is a 100+ page autobiographical story of VF's experience in Nazi concentration camps, mixed with his observations on the nature of suffering and how a person can endure suffering if he/she can find meaning in it. The second is a discussion of \\"logotherapy\\" - essentially VF's rebuttel to psychoanalysis. In a nutshell he asserts that most people don't need psychoanalysis, but rather they need to understand that existential angst is \\"normal\\" and they need to find meaning in their lives and to know that their struggles have value.The Good:It's short and to the point and forgoes overly gruesome discussions of concentation camp horrors. VF looks at the events objectively, for the purpose in redeeming them per se - i.e. to learn lessons rather than to cast judgement. The message is profound and valuable: that our suffering has value and that we can bear up under our suffering if we find meaning in our lives.The Bad:As short as the book is I actually found it a bit boring and repetitive. And I found his approach myopic - he just keeps restating his idea that finding meaning in suffering and in life is the answer to psychological problems.The Ugly:While witholding judgement of the Nazi's, VF actually seems to subtly judge those prisoners who \\"gave up\\", sort of implying that they had failed because they could not find a reason to live.Overall I found it worth reading, but perhaps I found it old hat because I've read a lot previously on the subject of suffering and meaning and it didn't break any new ground for me personally. I can see how others would find it quite eye opening and inspirational. : )"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have been inspired by this book for 20 years. There is a reason it is still selling so well.

In the first part, Frankl relates his experiences as a concentration camp inmate, and the internal psychological devices he used and taught to other inmates to cope with it. Even a non-psychologist would be interested in it, especially those who perceive themselves to be suffering unjustly (such as any jail inmate). These ideas later coalesced into a separate school of psychotherapy, logotherapy. The second section of the book is apted referred to by the author as \\"logotherapy in a nutshell.\\"I would characterize this book as one which you would want to read sometime before you die.

Both my parents fought for their country overseas during the World War II and I heard, first hand, of stories that touch, horrify and will remain with me for a lifetime.Dr. Frankl developed an approach to psychotherapy known as, logotherapy. At the core of his theory is the belief that man's motivational force is reaching for meaning. While this book is not one that could be described as enjoyable reading, there is something about the author's experiences that will remain with us long after the book has concluded.

After a while, disgust, horror and pity went numb; you could not feel them anymore. Apathy was the second stage: a \\"protective shell\\" to preserve one's life. Under-nourishment, absence of sexual urge came third. Thus, he began to reconstruct the manuscript he lost in the disinfection chamber. People with intellectually rich life were able to retreat \\"within,\\" away from their terrible surroundings. Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Salvation of man through love and in love (p. 57) He answered YES to the question of the ultimate purpose of existence (p. 60). Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even under tremendous stress. Outside influences are not the only cause of a person's behavior. Only the men who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside, eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence (p. 90). Any prisoner who lost faith in the future was doomed: to let go of the spiritual hold on life, caused one to die. Frankl's views truly turn Maslow's hierarchy upside down (this suggestion of mine used to send my former fiancee into fits of rage, who loved Maslow's view because it \\"justified\\" her lack of control in her life and her innate inability to grow spiritually and mentally)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For a long time, I'd heard about this book and seen it quoted by other authors.

I promise.Gene Jennings, Author of Timely Words"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of those book that has to be read. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is actually in two parts. The first part is Frankel's experiences in various concentration camps during WWII. The anecdotes are deeply disturbing while it gives an insight how someone can survive the horrors of the times. It is these experiences that the second part of the book relies upon.The second part of the book is what Frankel describes as logotherapy. Frankel's hypothesis and his psychotherepic practice after the war is based on the premis that man's life needs to have meaning. He uses the story of various prisoners trying to survive another day including not smoking the last bit of a cigarette because that was the reason to continue until the next day. He notes that everybody in the camp would know when a prisoner was going to die because they gave up the will to live.This is not an easy read and it is not an indepth study of logotherapy. What it is is a very concisly written book on both the horrors of prison camp and the development of a fascinating therapy developed from part of these experiences. It is interesting to note that he turned a horror into a benefit to mankind. For that development, this is alone worth reading. Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have read few books that contain as much wisdom in as few pages as Frankl's &quot;Man's Search for Meaning&quot;. As a professional psychologist, Frankl's unique point-of-view within the Nazi concentration camps allowed him to observe phenomena that others would have missed. The theories that he refined while imprisoned, termed &quot;logotherapy&quot; (meaning-therapy) are a wonderful way a looking at ourselves and our problems. Logotherapy focuses on the importance of finding meaning in our lives and our activities - the very factor that Frankl noted was the most valuable in surviving the camps.I cannot give a higher recommendation from this book. It is profound, moving, informative - and under two-hundred pages. Without a doubt it is worth the handful of hours required to read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most compelling book I have ever read.

EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Once, in our lives, we've all read or heard about the facts of the Holocaust-the pain and suffering from famine, disease, unsanitation, and the mistreatment of Jews. Viktor E. Frankl, the author of Man's Search for Meaning, depicted his experience of the concentration camps and allowed what he called, an \\"outsider\\" to look in at the pain and suffering that he experienced. The first part of his book discussed his experiences at the concentration camps. It amazed me that even though he suffered a great deal, he managed to overcome his suffering in a comical way at times. During his time at the concentration camps he used nature as an example, and of course, the love that he had for his wife, to allow him to not only overcome his suffering, but made him much appreciative and he paid much more attention to these things than he ever did before. He allowed me to accept sorrow, pain, and suffering, things that we, as people, try to stay away from. As each and everyone of us do at a point and time in our lives, we experience the lost of a loved one or a tragedic event that occured in our life. How do we move on? How do we get over such a thing? In this book, Frankl tries to understand two things: how can one see or determine their meaning of life after an experience like he had? After years of mistreatment, will life be better?The second part of the book was split into two parts: \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and \\"The Case of Tragic Optimism\\", which answered his question about the meaning of life. He states that lopotherapy focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man's search for such a meaning. The meaning of one's life differs from man to man. Frankl used logotherapy not only on himself, but on the other prisoners as well. He, along with lopotherapy, help prisoners to realize that despite their present hardships, they will know what their purpose is and the meaning of their lives, and lopotherapy allowed them to have a different perspective on life.This book was not only amazing, but the illustrations of his experiences were so surreal, to the point that I could almost visualize being there. It has uplifted me and taught me that the meaning of my life will be defined, no matter what obstacle, trial, or tribulation may come my way during my life time. Very hope-filling and uplifting! Definitely, a book, promising not to let you down!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has motivated me to completely change my lifestyle. Henceforth I intend to be involved in worthwhile projects."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl, as you've read in other reviews, is a holocaust survivor. In Man's Search for Meaning Frankl takes his experiences in concentration camps and translates them into a theory for therapy. His personally developed therapy, logotherapy, strives to help mankind overcome nuerosis by applying meaning to one's life experience, including (if not especially) a person's suffering. It is stated over and over again in Frankl's book that if a man can be shown a why, he can endure almost any how. This isn't really a new idea. However, Frankl goes one step further by helping people to see meaning and dignity in their suffering. Indeed, the preface of the book starts out with the line ' Dr. Frankl, author-psychiatrist, sometimes asks his patients who suffer from a multitude of torments great and small, \\"Why do you not commit suicide?\\".' What an opening line! What a question! Why does a suffering person not commit suicide? Are they living for a minor child, to finish a project, because their religion forbids suicide? Whatever the reason is, Frankl suggests that while that reason does not necessarily eliminate the suffering, a person's recognition of the dignity of their suffering can give them the will to go on.While this book is not light reading, and does occasionally get a tad repetitive, it has such a wonderful message and packs so much into such a short space, that I highly recommend that everyone get a copy and read it. I was lent a copy by a friend and now I plan to get a copy for several people who I know. It's just wonderful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Disclaimer: I am not a psychologist, simply a student who had a couple of psychology courses. Therefore my knowledge of the complex field of psychology is admittedly not expert, and my opinions are based on my experiences (as, I may add, all persons are), not how the world may be for an expert in the field. That being said, this is my review.The world of psychology today seems to be dominated by Freudian theories and thinking. This is pervasive. For a student it is drilled into your head that your actions and beliefs are based on what your parents have done to you, and you are at the will of your primitive urges, versus your upbringing. For me, however, this theory never worked well for me. It takes the concept of free will out of the equation, which has bothered me immensely.Reading Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" therefore was quite refreshing. It opened up a new theory of psychology that is not commonly referenced in (at least introductory) psychology courses. The logic of Frankl's arguments, coupled with personal experiences for authority, provided me a better psychological explanation that Freudian psychology ever could. The beauty of Frankl's school of thinking, \\"logotherapy\\", provides a viable alternative to the cold, almost mechanical Freudian school of thinking.In addition to introducing a beautiful school of thinking, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" has the added benefit of being an enjoyable read. Where as most other psychology books read like a text book, making the average reader bored stiff, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" reads quickly, logically, and despite the horrifying accounts of holocaust atrocities, is a very enjoyable read.It is a shame that the academic psychological community doesn't have much regard for the theories of Frankl. In short, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a breath of fresh air, recommended for anyone who is sick of being force-fed Freudian theories."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the most influential book I have read.

However, in Viktor E. Frankl's autobiographical book, A Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl reveals how he and his family were treated within the horrific confines of concentration camps. Regurgitating the trauma, Frankl reveals that the only way he made it through was by searching himself for a meaning in life. He illustrates how this drive to discover his purpose in life kept him alive through the hellish five years. In the second half of his book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, Frankl describes the therapy of 'searching for a meaning' that he used on himself during survival of the concentration camps. Each person has his or her own meaning in life, Frankl states, a meaning different than anyone elses. He gives counts of his performance of logotherapy. Specifically, he may ask a depressed patient, \\"Why don't you commit suicide?\\" Through techniques like this, he shows not only real-life patients, but also the reader, that there really is a meaning in life.Personally, this book was one of the best self-theraputical books I have ever read. Frankl's perserverence through life's most gruesome and wearisome hardships is amazing. Through it all, he has used this book to press readers like myself to search deep within the soul. Easy to read, I literally finished this book in an hour.

Frankl is a psychologist when he's imprisoned and writes the book from the perspective of a scientist. He details the impact of torture on a prisoner's mind: his as well as his comrades. While the book does not avoid the grim reality and fate of Hitler's victims, its strength rides on the tail of its psychological insights and conclusions. Frankl surmises that one's life has meaning, whether one is experiencing happiness or suffering. Most would agree that many people don't have the inner strength or spiritual maturity to grow through such atrocity, let alone survive it.That's why a book like Frankl's is so life affirming, that there were people, in the midst of unthinkable suffering, could still offer their meager chunk of bread to another in need. In this day and age, it's wonderful to see that the human race can rise to such heights while, at the same time, sinking to such depths. There is hope, after all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Just finished reading Viktor E. Frankl's book Man's Search for Meaning. Along with over 12 million other readers I have found it a classic book and is a sobering look at life from an altogether profoundly realistic perspective. I have to say this was a long overdue book for me to read and it has left a profound effect on my view on life, my life and those of my fellow human beings."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an astonishing book that I strongly recommend. Victor Frankl was a Jewish Austrian Psychiatrist imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps including Auschwitz during the Second World War.The book begins with the remarkable biographical story of life in the concentration camp in conditions that are scarcely imaginable and where the prospects for survival were bleak. The second half of the book takes these experiences and their understanding as the basis for development of what Frankl called Logotherapy. At its heart is a belief that striving to find a meaning to ones life is the primary motivational force within people. This may be contrasted with striving for pleasure, or striving for power which are respectively at the heart of Freudian and Adlerian psychology.The description of life in the concentration camp is chilling in what it describes but this appears multiplied by the manner of the description. The narrative is largely free of gruesome details and uses simple matter of fact language to convey and amplify the all enveloping abject awfulness of the situation faced by those imprisoned. They are described as having been transported into an incredible and inexplicable world where every normality is replaced by ever present abnormality. Yet in this utterly abnormal world we see there is space for the acts of saints as well as demons.It is a book which provides insights into the nature of life and meaning and thus should be read by all. If its relevance to those involved in change needs to be stated, for me it is captured in clear imagery that life in the concentration camp which removed so much from the inmates, was denied removing one crucial thing, described thus:-\\"In the concentration camp every circumstances conspires to make the prisoner lose his hold. All the familiar goals in life are snatched away. What alone remains is \\"the last of human freedoms\\" - the ability to choose one's attitude in a given set of circumstances\\".It is this choosing of attitude that sits at the heart of the inmate's ability to survive, for those that did survive are characterised by having a clear vision, a clear imperative that they must survive for they have work yet to be done.When so much effort directed at change focuses on what to do and how, Frankl powerfully quotes the words of Nietzsche\`He who has a why to live, can bear with almost any how'.I highly recommend this book as one that will change your perspective on what people and organisations can achieve and the incredible importance of establishing meaning; of answering the question \`why?'"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first part of the book is the story of the author's life as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. The best words I can come up with to describe his story are \\"incredibly inspiring\\". It's amazing to me to read the authors application of a nearly unbiased scientific psychoanalysis of his fellow prisons, and sometimes the guards. That does not mean that this is a boring scientific read. It a gripping human drama.The second part of the book is a brief description of school of psychology that the author initially drafted before the war and refined in the cruel crucible of his imprisonment. This presentation can be a bit dry and technical but is worth the effort to study. Reading this, I felt as though a Jewish prisoner in Nazi Germany came to discover Buddhism through the transformation of his suffering - in his own words - \\"In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering the moment it finds meaning...\\". I also find it in the Zen-like observation - \\"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it.\\"I leave this review with what seems to be the authors favorite quote: \\"He who has a Why can bear almost any How.\\" -- Nietzsche"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had mixed reactions to this book that I've been meaning to read for years. If I understand the therapy correctly, Frankly advocates for the importance of meaning in each individual's life and that most pyschological illness comes from a lack of meaning (or meaningful meaning). Logotherapy, Frankl's approach and known as the third Vienna school of Psychotherapy--after Freud and Adler) focuses on approaching meaning in the client's life. One of the main ways meaning is expressed is through our suffering. Suffering, from Frankl's perspective is a \\"good\\" thing, or, at the least, necessary. I do kind of agree with this, not that it provides \\"meaning\\" necessarily, but that life is not really lived without some suffering (which seems counter to the Buddhist stuff, which I kind of agree with too--I guess they can be combined with the idea of acceptance of suffering . . .).The first part of the book is focused on Frankl's horrific experiences in the concentration camps and how those that survived did so by accepting their suffering and seeing how the suffering itself provided their existence with meaning (this part of the book is not really convincing to me. I see how Frankl has interpreted the world this way, but I don't see that this is a universal theory). The second half is somewhat more interesting, exploring what it does mean for people to suffer. One therapeutic approach is facing that which you fear which is a fairly common approach to fears."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The book is one of the most important and significant works of the past millennium.

There are two parts to the book, part 1 consists of his experiences, part 2 consists of his description of Logotherapy which he strongly advocated as a cure for many of the mental issues which people suffer from. The book presses the notion that a surge in various mental illness is due to the lack of any objective for our survival. We live empty lives, which are primarily in materialistic pursuits. The author cites Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\", to promote the idea. While all of this may sound very superficial, philosophical, in all honesty, if you really have a mission to live for, and it matters a lot to you, the question of existence rarely arises. We make our mission as the meaning. This was in a way the tactics, Dr.Franklin used for survival in the camps. He made his mission helping the other patients, spreading the lessons he had learnt and so on. He was very strongly driven by his objectives, and its no surprise that he survived the camps and went on to live till 1997.I must confess, I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the second part, as it was primarily based on his experiences and observations. The 2nd part is a little tricky to follow if you are reading the book as a reader. You many find it more intuitive if you are professional trained for mental health and counseling.Nevertheless, if you want to read a book which tries to give you correct hints at the path you should be taking in life, this is the perfect book. Its tries to offer a meaningful objective to your life, without pushing you towards any religion/faith."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To detach yourself from such extreme adversities, misery and death all around you, a seemingly hopeless future (actually, death) and to attempt to use that as a research environment to further understand human psychology - that is a contribution of monumental proportions. I was totally moved by his experience in the camp (some of it may even moisten your eyes a bit) and the observations he makes. It's a short book; definitely go for it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"After describing his concentration camp experiences in the first half of the book, Frankl argues that one of man's greatest needs is for purpose and meaning. This purpose is not and cannot be the same for everyone. For some, it is a cause; for others, the meaning is experiencing something or someone (e.g. the love of a person); for others, just accepting suffering with dignity. Frankl suggests that in the absence of such meaning. people lose their will to live in bad times, and engage in self-destructive behavior out of boredom during prosperous times.Frankl uses his concentration camp life as an example. While others lost their will to live, Frankl apparently did not. Why? Partially because of his desire to complete unfinished work, partially because of his love for his wife. (None of which guaranteed that he did live of course; he is quite eager to emphasize that even with all the will to live in the world, the odds were not on his side.)Frankl emphasizes that there is no abstract meaning of life generally (at least none that he knows of); rather, each person's life has a different meaning, and perhaps a different meaning at different times."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was an awesome book! I think everyone should read it. He learned invaluable lessons that every person can learn from and implement in their lives. The truths he espouses are embarrassingly obvious once we understand them; now, we just need to remember and live them and life will have so much more meaning for us!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A book everyone should buy for reading many times over a lifetime. A truly inspiring, refreshing and motivational book, which could not fail to encourage the reader to reflect on their fundamental meaning for life.It is a very easy book to read, while clearly influenced by a strong academic background."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is divided into two parts. The first part is a moving description of Frankl's time in Nazi concentration, work and death camps. Related in simple language, this stark depiction of the evil of which man is capable and the strength of the human mind and spirit should be required reading in every school in America.The second part of the book describes the psychological theories that Frankl developed as a result of his experience. The language is more academic, as is the subject matter, but, it remains interesting and instructive to the end. This book demands to be read in a single sitting and to be considered throughout one's life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've always been interested in the Holocaust, and this is the most riveting accounts I've read by a survivor of that monstrous ordeal. the fact that Frankl came through the experience with a greater appreciation of love, beauty and meaning, rather than bitterness, is very inspiring."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This single book is a must read for every person. Its greatest value is in showing us that we must never judge our lives based on a single slice of time but must look at it in total. Can you imagine if Viktor Frankl had died in that concentration camp and never lived to write and assist the millions he did? I am sure, if you look at the slice of time while in that concentration camp, living and having value in life was not a good time to decide on living."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In Viktor E. Frankl's book, Man's Search for Meaning he goes very in depth with his personal experiences in concentration camps during World War II. Frankl splits the book into two separate parts; beginning with his firsthand stories of the Holocaust and his imprisonments in Auschwitz and other concentration camps. He then talks about his many struggles that he endured along the way with inside himself and with others. Within this section he really focuses on how all of the people, including himself, react to what is going on around them within the camps. He writes about the psychological effects of everything that is going on. Whether it be never really knowing if your loved ones are alive, how long you will be able to survive or how long you will be imprisoned. The main question that Frankl raised in the first section was whether or not life was still worth living and how you could still find a meaning in life.The second part of the book which is split into two sections; one called \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and the other \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\" really answered the question from the first section. It talked about his own feelings of how to conduct therapy. This therapy being logotherapy, which states that man is driven by his own search for meaning and purpose. Frankl used this Logotherapy to help other prisoners and even himself. He talked to people and helped them to realize what their purpose was and how to change their outlook on life.This book is probably one of the most influential stories that I have ever read. I believe that this book is so powerful because for once you, in a way, get to see firsthand of what went on in concentration camps. The way Frankl writes of his experiences almost makes it seem like you are there witnessing it yourself. This book is very powerful and teaches a lot about life and makes you realize what your real meaning in life is. This book is very interesting and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Most books written about the Holocaust are factual books that give us insight on the concentration camps. Viktor E. Frankl gives us an autobiographical account of his personal experiences in Auschwitz and other concentration camps. This book is very powerful in a sense that it is ones own personal thoughts and feelings. He goes into great detail on the hardships and struggles the prisioners had to face in this period of their life. They constantly dealt with the stuggle of whether or not they would one day be free again. Dr. Frankl spent much time trying to figure out the meaning of life and his reason for living. He believed that this is what got him through those 5 years of his life. He also helped other people with their struggles to keep on living. He thought that when the prisoners lost the will to go on that they had stopped searching for the meaning of their life. Through his experience in the concentration camps, he developed a form of psychotherapy called Logotherapy. Logotherapy focuses more on the meaning of life and the future. He believes that man's desire in life is to find a meaning and purpose to life.In the second half of Dr. Frankl's book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, he expands on the meaning of life and how it is not general but different for every individual. This means that our meaning of life can change at any minute. In this part of the book, he argues that man must search for meaning and not just be given an answer to the question, \\"What is the meaning or purpose of my life\\"? He also gives instances where people have come to him about problems in their lives and how they find meaning in their life.Personally, I enjoyed this book because it seemed so real. It is easy to follow and it truely makes you think about the hardships people went through during the Holocaust. Dr. Frankl uses Logotherapy to help people find meaning in their lives. As you read this book it really makes you stop and think about the meaning and purpose of your life. Viktor E. Frankl used a quote that is very powerful, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\". This goes to show that where there is a will, they is a way and therefore we should never give up hope! This is a very inspirational book and I highly recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Everyone goes through obstacles in their life. Whether they are good or bad, it is how we individually deal with them that makes us who we are and what we will become. Not everyone in their lifetime is able to realize what their meaning in life is, but with Viktor Frankl's approach to psychotherapy known as logotherapy, maybe we all can.\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is an inspiring and breathtaking book definitely worth reading. In this book, he explains about his experience in concentration camps which led to his discovery of logotherapy. Frankl talks about Auschwitz, along with many other camps where he overcame many hardships. He had to learn what a human being does when he suddenly has nothing to lose. Frankl talks about different situations he experienced, where he explains through his logotherapy how someone should get through such situations and how himself or others dealt with it. This book not only talks about his experiences in concentration camps but goes into great detail about his logotherapy approach and how it is used. He talks about some of his patients experiences and how he worked with them to help change the way they may have been thinking and gave them a better understanding and meaning to what they were feeling.Throughout his hard times, Viktor tried to stay strong, not only using his logotherapy for himself but also as a supprot system for others in the concentration camps. He talked of taking one day at a time, hour by hour, minute by minute as if forgetting about the future and living in the present as best as you could. He found himself at times day dreaming about where he used to live, his family, freinds, and food. He also found himslef, as well as with many others humoring one other to take thier minds off the dreadful weather or the hard work they had to endure.After reading this book I was fascinated with how someone could take such a horrible experience from their life like living in a concentration camp and turn it into something good and meaningful in their life. It amazed me how he was able to use his logotherapy to help forget and reassure himself everyday he was there. Its hard to imagine what that would be like, but remarkable how he got through it.Dr. Frankl clearly explained his views in such a meaningful way throughout the entire book. I think that this book was extremely well-written and very easy to understand. I feel that everyone should read this book in order to get a better understanding of why we need meaning in our lives. This book was very interesting to me and made me realize how important it is to have meaning in my life. I feel we all need to realize what our meaning in life is, it will not only help us get through each day but defines why we are here in the first place. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The book \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is a very captivating and inspiring book. In this book, Dr. Frankl shares his experiences of the holocaust through the eyes of a prisoner in Jewish concentration camps. This is unique, because most books written about the Holocaust are based on facts and events rather than personal experience. I believe this is what makes this book more captivating, because you can relate and empathize with Dr. Frankl. The book begins with personal accounts of his 5 years in Auschwitz and other Jewish concentration camps. In this portion of the book, Dr. Frankl talks a lot about his struggle during those years to find reasons to live. He discusses that none of those men ever knew if they would ever make it out alive. During these trying times, he thought a great deal about what was important in his life, and he allowed us to experience what he went through during those years. This posed one main question: How can one begin their life again after such a tragic and horrifying experience?The answer to this question is what Dr. Frankl tried to argue throughout the book. He believed that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The second half of his book consisted of two parts: \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\". These parts explain that through his awful experiences throughout the Holocaust, he found that his solution to fighting tragedy is the will to find meaning, and through this he created logotherapy, in order to help other people find meaning in their life. He also explains how to conduct logtherapy, and tells us that a man is driven by his search for a meaning in life, which is much different than Freud's outlook on life.I believe Dr. Frankl's argument is very good and convincing. I think logotherapy and man's search for meaning and purpose in life are very fair, complete, and logical points. Dr. Frankl told his story about his experiences during the Holocaust, and based on his experiences he explained his argument that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. His explanation makes perfect sense. We face tragedy, obstacles, and struggles in all our lives, but in order to survive and be happy, we must find meaning and purpose. Dr. Frankl finds a very logical and realistic way to help people survive and prosper in life. This book is interesting, captivating, and inspiring, and it is worth taking the time to read. I'll leave you with a quote from the book that sums up Dr. Frankl's argument-\\"To live is to suffer, but to survive is to find meaning in the suffering.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"At times this book can be a little dry, but when you look at the book as a whole its a amazing book.The book in part one covers Frankl's experiences in a concentration camp. This part forms the base of the ideas of logothearpy. It's a great story and very interesting to see how person takes to such a horrible event.Second part of the book is on his theory of logothearpy. Very interesting idealogy. Covers some cases in it. The basic idea being that each person creates his own reality and meaning, whatever meaning a person finds in his/her life is the right one.third part is a update taken from a lecture he gave. Goes over some of the same material in part II and expands on it.Great book, worth the day or two it takes to read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The problem with Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is that it is so frequently recommended, by so many people, that you might think that it's one of those things that are \\"good for you.\\"Good for you -- like boring foodstuffs and cod liver oil and boring books you were forced to read in high school and never understood.But, man, no, that is not this book.The narrative portion of the book is a simply worded account of a man who lived through that most notorious of man-made hells, Auschwitz. It's purely by chance that he survived; his family was murdered.You may be thinking, \\"Why would I want to read that?\\"Well, just pick it up and find out.This book was forced on me. I didn't want to read it. Someone else wanted me to read it and gave me a copy. He told me that he regularly buys copies in used book stores and gives them away to others.

I have read the second half of the book twice. Victor Frankl's logotherapy makes perfect sense to me. I have been reading many books lately that talk about finding meaning and purpose in life. This is the book that puts the icing on the cake as far as believing that having a purpose is the link to survival as well as day to day happiness. As Dr. Frankl states \\"Happiness is not something to be pursued\\" it is a byproduct of living a life of meaning and purpose. I would also recommend logo-therapy as the place to start if you are struggling with any type of mental illness or depression. This book is a excellent read and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is an interesting and inspirational book that asks the question, what motivates the human race to survive? After surviving the hardships faced during his 3 years in four different concentration camps, Viktor Frankl created a theory known as Logotherapy. From \\"Logos\\" the Greek word for Meaning. During his time in the camps Frankl attempted to rewrite his life's achievement his manuscript. It was taken from him when he first arrived in Auschwitz. Whenever he found a small scrap piece of paper he would write down what he could. Frankl believes that the rewriting of his manusript is what allowed him to survive. In the second section of the book entitled \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", Frankl describes his theory of man's primary motivation being his meaning of life. Throught this section of the book he describes where you may find this meaning and how to go about searching for it. I personally have always shown a deep interest in concentration camps and the Holocaust. Therefore it was very easy for me to deeply enjoy this book. I found it interesting and unique that he wrote this book not about the tragic events of WWII but his personal experience. This book inspired me to search for the meaning of my own life and look more deeply into the strength and power of the human mind. In my favorite quote from the book, Frankl describes how not only is he a professor of two sciences, but also is a survivor of four concentration camps who has seen the bravery and strength of the human mind and body."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl developed his theory during thehorrifying experiences he had while being imprisoned in thenazi death camps.

The book delves into one man's reaction to suffering and humiliation while be brutally abused by the Nazis. It is hard to believe that anyone can recover from that ordeal and still be sane!!!Victor Frankl is truly a genious and his positivity during the horrors of Nazi death camp suffering is nothing less than a miracle. His frame of mind is what kept him alive despite the abuse and suffering. He was able to compartmentalize and logically follow steps to avoid death during this period. He theorized how to use this strategy in events of every day life.

The fact that he survived at all is nothing less than miraculous. In the second half, Dr. Frankl writes of logotherapy. Different from other better known forms of therapy, logotherapy focuses on meaning in one's life. It is this which he believes is what deep down we all strive for more, far more, than anything else.

In \\"A Whole New Mind\\" the author, Daniel Pink, has come up with six senses that are important to develop one's mind in a Conceptual Age and \\"meaning\\" is one of the them. The idea that we have to read a book to realize that we have to develop meaning in our lives seems pathetic. But nevertheless, I was intrigued by Pink's description of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and read it immediately after reading \\"A Whole New Mind\\". Surprisingly I had never heard of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" nor its author Victor Frankl even though its afterword states that it has sold 12 million copies in 24 languages and in a 1991 \\"Book of the Month\\" survey was voted among the 10 most influential books by readers.The book is the story of Frankl's experience as a prisoner in various concentration camps during World War II. Before being arrested, he was working on a manuscript about his psychological theories (he had been a practicing psychiatrist in Vienna). Though his wife sewed the manuscript in his coat, it was soon confiscated in the camp; he proceeded to practice his theory of searching for meaning despite his bleak situation and he also tried to recreate the manuscript on scraps of paper. Despite the grim and horrible scenes described by Frankl, you will be amazed by his outlook on life and how he just kept going. There is no doubt that his survival was aided by his firm belief in the importance of finding meaning in life (in ANY situation). He was also lucky and resourceful. When he was liberated from camp, he wrote the entire book in 9 days.At the end of the book is an essay on his theory of logotherapy which is a very practical outlook on addressing many psychological problems. He states that \\"man's main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.\\" He says that life has no inherent meaning but rather a unique meaning exists for each person which he has a responsibility to discover. The meaning can be discovered in 3 ways:1) By creating a work or doing a deed2) By experiencing something or encountering someone3) By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (though suffering is NOT a prerequisite for discovering meaning)His theory is much more than a theory since it was so effectively put into practice by him and the people he counseled. His theory is given much more weight by his life story (he lost both his parents and his pregnant wife in the camps). This is a short book that bears reading multiple times."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was a gift for my young cousin who was graduating from high school.

Perhaps the perfect blend of circumstances-a trained psychologist subjected to the horrifying human laboratory of Nazi concentration camps, has produced a work of notable impact. Part biography, part diary, part lab notes, Frankl analyzes his circumstances, his captors, fellow captives, and the human condition with clinical precision and gifted insight. I found myself enthralled with the descriptive skill and hard-won conclusions the author shares such as: love is the highest aspiration of human kind, life requires meaning, that nobility cannot be taken from the truly noble among us.

Heard about it many years ago and always wanted to read it. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone read this. It's a very interesting psychological look at the people who survived the Nazi death camps in particular, but in general, is a good resource for anyone going through a hard time. It looks at the coping mechanisms of those who survived, and the mindset of those who gave up, and reminds us all that even when everything including our very identity is taken away, we still have something that NO ONE can take unless we let them - how we will deal with our challenges. Will we give up and give in, defeated; or will we choose to look past the bad stuff at the sunset, the puppy's eyes, the pretty flowers and see that there is still good stuff in the world.This book, along withAwakening Joy: 10 Steps That Will Put You on the Road to Real HappinessandHow We Choose to Be Happy: The 9 Choices of Extremely Happy People--Their Secrets, Their Storiesare excellent textbooks on how to bring more joy back into your life.Do yourself a favor and buy all three."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am in no position to comment on this book, except to suggest others read it.

He was also the 32 books which were published in 32 languages-After three horrific years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps , Dr Frankl gained his freedom only to learn that his entire family had been murdered. But during , the terrible suffering and degradation of those grim years , he developed his theory of logotherapy.The first half of the book delves into his experiences in the concentration camps.The author analyses the character of the Capo-prisoners chosen to be trustees and guards of the other inmates- usually because of their brutality and meanness.Frankl observes that 'the best of us did not return'from the concentration camps.He examines three phases of the inmates mental reaction to concentration camp life-the period following his admission ; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation\\".Ultimately in recounting the horrors and dehuminization of concentration camp existance , of being continually stalked by death , , Frankl explains how he survived , and kept his humanity at the same time. The author explains how every moment in the camps offered the opportunity to make decisions about whether or not to submit to the powers which \\"threatened to rob you of your inner self , your inner freedom.\\"The point made was that ultimately the type of person the prisoner would become , was the result of an inner decision , and not of camp influences alone.Frankl refers to the martyrs whose behaviour in the camp , whose suffering and death , demonstrated the fact that their last inner freedom could not be lost.\\"It can be said that they where worthy of their suffering ; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievment. It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away- that makes life meaningful and purposeful.\\"Frabkl speaks of the dream which kept him alive in the camp , of lecturing and practising psychiatry- that is essentially G-D's commission to Frankl. The prisoner who lost faith in his future was doomed.The prisoners said to each other that no earthly happyness could alleviate the suffering they had experienced in the camps , but Frankl writes that \\"The crowning experience of all , for the homecoming man is the wonderful feeling that , afetr all he has suffered , there is nothing he need fear anymore-except for G-D\\".The second part of the book explains Frankl's theory of psychology known as logotherapy.\\"According to logotherapy , the striving to find a meaning in one's life is the primary motivational force in man\\".Frankl deals with the universality of values. He notes that in the Nazi concentration camps those who knew that their was a task waiting for them to be fulfilled where more likely to survive\\".On the meaning of life one cannot live for some general goal alone. That goal must be meaningfully present in every moment to make the moment alive in terms of it's destination and future.The meaning of life is that G-d asks every person to answer for his or her life i.e \\"What will you make of your life , my child\\".Only personal choices are authentic choices . Life in it's ultimate meaning confronts us with other people whose lives we influence by the way we are towards them.\\"A human being is not one thing among others , things determine each other , but man is ultimately self-determining\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Simply put, Frankly draws on his experiences in a death camp during WWII to introduce exstentialism into the field of psychiatry. Running contrary to the major 'isms' of the day, fulfillment/meaning is not to be found in the state(Communisms), the people (Fascism), or in free trade (Liberalism). Fullfilment is to be found in whatever an individual chooses, and once that 'topic of meaning' has been chosen, must be daily reaffirmed while protecting the negative liberties of all."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl Wrote this book based on his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. Through his experience, Frankl used a psychotherapeutic method as a way to survive. This method later became existential therapy. The benefits of Man's Search for Meaning are twofold: creating an additional therapy for man to survive extraordinary situations and the exposing the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. Man's Search for Meaning should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for meaning\\" by Viktor E. Frankl is very interesting and inspiring.Most books focusing on the Holocaust mainly state facts, but in \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" Frankl talks about his personal experiences he encountered while being in concentration camps. I can't say I can relate to what his been through because I've never been in such a messed up situations, but this book made me think about a lot of situations differently. Frankl made it clear to me that there is nothing wrong with \\"suffering\\" suffering is a part of life. In the first part of the book Frankl talks about all of the struggling he went through in concentration camps, but what's makes it interesting is how he hardly ever gave up and how he used humor and imagination to survive. He made hisself believe that he was going to get through it all.Frankl stressed the importance of inner decisions in the first part of the book as well. The main question Frankl had was is there still meaning of life after experiencing what he and others went through in concentration camps? How do one start life after experience such brutal treatment?In the second part of the book, which is divided into two sections: the first section called \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" and the second section called \\"The Case for Tragic Optimism\\" Frankl answer the questions that he had in the first part of the book. He creates logotherapy which helps him find the meaning of life. He used logotherapy to help other prisioners find meaning of life as well. Frankl stated that a man is driven by his search for a meaning in life, which he states in his part about how to conduct logotherapy.After reading Frankl's book I strongly believe that his agruement is good. Frank used his personal expericences to help explain his argument that man's deepest desire is to find meaning and purpose in life. Logotherapy is a logical and realistic way to help humans get through any trials and tribulations.Through all he went through in concentration camps, his inner freedom couldn't be lost. Frankl's lets it be known that there is nothing wrong with suffering,all that matters is that you make inner decisions.One of his biggiest fears was not to be worthy of his suffering.Although things are bad on the outside doesn't mean that the internal part of self should be sour. Man makes his own decisions in life. He lets it be known that human dignity can be retained in concentration camps. I love the book and I recommend everyone take time out to read it. There's a lot not being mention in the reviews, so check it out!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search For Meaning is a touching account of Viktor E. Frankl's experiences in several concentration camps during World War II. He relates his experiences to his discovery of the meaning of life. His book is a terrifying story of his survival in the concentration camps. He realized that the human spirit is capable of overcoming even the most dire circumstances.Frankl steps out of his own memories and analyzes the psychological consequences of the ongoing torture he is enduring. He describles the differences between those prisoners who had the will to survive to those who gave up. He concluded that major difference was having something to live for. Hope for the future was often what kept a prisoner alive. Despite how hopeless life might seem, it is important to find some good in it. This was his reason to endure each horrible day. The future seemed to make a difference, it was a light at the end of the tunnel.The prisoner defined their existance as not being defeated by their current circumstances, and keeping their thoughts on their future by envisioning their survival. Frankl and many other prisoners realized they could still have control over their inner selves. They realized that man could have everything taken from him except his soul. If you have a positive outlook it helps the world look like a better place. Frankl kenw that he did not have control over what happened to him in the camp, but he did have control of how he reacted to each situation.He invented a new type of therapy that was conceived while he was in the concentration camps called logotherapy. In order to really do something with your life, you cannot sit around and do nothing. You have to go out and try to achieve your goals. Frankl's theory states that man defines his own life by the choices he makes. The way each individual goes about their daily tasks and over comes the barriers that are placed in their way gives their life meaning. This manner of thought can be applied universally because it is not specific to one race or religion. Most prisoners in the camps became aware that there is a higher power. Each choice they made could have an enormous impact on their lives. Frankl took a horrible situation and turned it into a opportunity for growth and self understanding.There is another way to look at logotherapy. You could also interpret it as the individual, alone, makes their own choices in their life. There isn't a higher power that has any impact on them. Frankl's message encourages a person to achieve, and have hope for the future."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Please consider Viktor Frankl and his wonderful books with me for a few moments in time.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As an entering Freshman into a University, it was nice to have read this book right off the get go. College is about finding yourself and helping the others around you. Throughout this book that is exactly what Victor Frankl did. He survived the Nazi death camp by caring about the men around him and helping them realize that they too have a future. Man lives for his future, not dwelling on his past. I would recomend this book to any senior in high school or higher. It is something that will really get to you, even the 'older' people.

This book is anexquisite introduction to Logotherapy, Frankl'sexistential psychotherapy. It will deeplytouch you, and will help you in your own struggleto find meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was reading a counseling book on the \\"Search for Meaning\\" and in the introduction Dr. Gary Collins stated, 'For a number of years Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning was required reading for all incoming freshmen at a Christian Liberal Arts college where I taught.' The statistics showed that students who read this book upon entering college did better in their academic life because it helped prepare them to understand what their true desire in life was.So, before I finished that book I purchased this book and read it. I was amazed at all of the lessons that are taught, all of the theories that made sense and the purpose that it gives towards the work of a counselor that was so practical.The first half of the book talks about Fankl's time spent in a Nazi prison camp. He talked about how there was only a 1 in 28 chance that the prisoner would survive the camp. Most either died from disease or malnutrition or they were sent to the ovens where they died. Many more died by their own hand. Their lack of hope for a future drove them to suicide.Frankl took his observations of human nature and the experience in the war camps to think through the best way to provide counseling for people who are stressed, anxious, depressed, etc. The counseling he came up with is called 'Logotherapy.' He states that \\"Logo\\" is a Greek word which denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is the method used to help people learn to deal with their neuroses.So, 'Logotherapy' focuses on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. In other words, what is the meaning of life for the individual that is being counseled. As a counselor you must remember that the meaning of life for each of your patients will differ. There is not one easy answer that works for everyone. Each person is different. One of Frankl's favorite quotes is from Nietzche and it is, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.\\" The point of that statement is that people can endure any suffering, any disease, any hard life lesson if they know that they have a reason to live for.This is why a patient with cancer may beat all the odds, in other words, he is told he has only two months to live, but because he desires to see his child graduate from college he might actually live for 9 more months until that accomplishment is fulfilled and then the person takes a turn for the worse and dies. There was meaning for life, so life was lived.The second half of Fankl's book expresses his thoughts on why Man's Search For Meaning is so powerful and so necessary for each person. The subject is not fully discussed, this is a summary of his overall therapy method and learning. But it gives you a great introduction to what he believes is a good therapy format.After reading through this short book I can see why Dr. Collins and others felt that this was a good book for college freshman to read. The statistics gathered by George Barna were that upon entering college when asked what they hoped to accomplish, students answered 84% of the time that they wanted to find the meaning for their lives. The other 16% stated they wanted to gain a degree to earn more money and satisfy their desires.So, let's help our students and others learn more about the meaning for their lives. From a Pastor's point of view I was amazed at how well Viktor Frankl's thoughts weave right into Holy Scripture and are so pertinent.I think all serious students will gain much insight from this short work.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression. I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion.

The author survived Auschwitz during the Second World War. He emerged from the death camp having lost everything that mattered to him. His beloved wife was dead, his family was dead, almost all of his friends or acquaintances were dead or dying. He himself was nothing more than a bag of bones, barely clinging to life. In addition he had lost the manuscript of the book he had been writing, the work of his life. He saw no future for himself, and his past contained only suffering and death.In the days after the end of the war when his camp had been liberated by the Allied armies, Frankl said, he\\"...walked through the country past flowering meadows, for miles and miles, toward the market town near the camp. Larks rose to the sky and I could hear their joyous song. There was no one to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the wide earth and sky and the lark's jubilation and the freedom of space. I stopped, looked around, and up to the sky - and then I went down on my knees. At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of the world - I had but one sentence in mind - always the same: \`I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.' How long I knelt there and repeated the sentence memory can no longer recall. But I know that on that day, in that hour, my new life started. Step by step I progressed, until I again became a human being.\\"He had felt, for the first time, a spark of hope. That was all he needed to begin living again. He had found a subtle meaning in the beauty of the world and he could use his new consciousness and connection to that beauty as a reason to go on living.Frankl's little book was one of the most important books I've read in my life. When I was eighteen I understood only a bit of what he was trying to say, but it was enough to provide a frame that allowed me to continue my life and to continue learning.We all make meaning from the fragments of our lives, said Frankl, from the beauty of the world around us, from the fragile connections we have with each other.

It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives.The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices?The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had to read the first half of this book for a college class (\\"Great Human Questions\\"), but I continued the book to its end because I was amazed by Frankl's life, thoughts, and insights. Although a psychiatrist, much of his method of helping patients came from existential philosophy rather than abstract psychological theories.The first half of the book details how he came to write the book through witnessing events in various Nazi concentration camps, and how he felt he survived when others didn't because he had found a reason for living while others had given up. The second half of the book discusses and tries to explain his theory of logotherapy, which I am still not sure I understand.Man's Search for Meaning is probably a book I will read over and over again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A Man's Search for Meaning is definitely worth reading. The first half of the book is an easy 5 stars but the second half not so much. The entire book is good and I would suggest it to anyone. I would especially recommend it to anyone interested in psychology."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl is a famous Austrian psychiatrist well known for the invention of a new way of treating psychiatric ailments called logotherapy. Logotherapy strives to make the patient understand the purpose and meaning of his/her life. The meaning may differ from one person to another. It differs from the previous popular psychiatric theories based on the pleasure of sex by Freud and the urge for power by Adler. \\"Man's search for meaning\\" is a book which explains how Fankl survived concentration camps which lead to the eventual development of logotherapy.I read this book a few weeks back. This book is effectively divided into three parts. First part explains the tough conditions faced by Frankl in the Nazi concentration camps in Auschwitz and Dachau. Second part provides the realizations of Frankl through his experiences in extreme conditions of concentration camps. It provides in a nutshell the treatment of basic psychic ailments through logotherapy. Frankl and his students have treated millions of people using logotherapy and some of the instants are narrated in this part. Third part of the book includes a lecture given by Frankl which got appended to the book later as an overview of logotherapy.This book though a bit too hectic read to start with, poses some of the vital questions. How to find meaning of one's life even in highly improbable extreme situations? How to keep faith on oneself that the suffering would soon end, even if the conditions do not seem so? Why did not all the members of the concentration camp commit suicide? What impulse drove them to survive unrecoverable tortures imposed on them by the Nazis? How could the inmates of concentration camp cope up with the fear of being put in a gas chamber any moment? All these questions are elegantly answered in this wonderful book through search for meaning.Frankl gives instances how he helped the inmates of the camp even when he was suffering himself. Frankl also provides glimpses of the later treatments he provided to some of his patients which directed them to realize the real meaning of their life. Frankl makes it very clear that there is no such thing called universal meaning for every one's life. The meaning of life differs from one individual to another. The meaning can be anything like one's love for parents, affinity towards some God, completion of professional duty, etc. While in the camp, Frankl was driven by his love for wife and the psychotherapy book which was incomplete. Logotherapy can just direct one towards identifying that meaning of his/her life. It is for the individual to take the lead and live to fulfill that meaning.Though I have heard about the theories of Freud and Adler, I have not read their works. But after reading this book, I felt Frankl's logotherapy to be much more effective in facing life's challenges. The very fact that Frankl lived for more than 90 years even after going through the tortures of Nazi concentration camp, supports his theory quite well. The book is lucidly written though not much coherent. However, this book is highly recommended as it provides a detailed account of one of the foremost technique in psychotherapy and makes it accessible to any common man. I am sure every reader will get some different insight on life after completing this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's classic book, \\"Man's Search For Meaning\\", resonates with significance and purpose. After reading the book, you should be able to find true purpose and real meaning in your life. You should be able to be directed in the right course and direction.The book is divided into two parts. The first part recounts Frankl's experience during World War II at the concentration camps. He recounts on how he was able to survive. It boils down to purpose and meaning. Those who had a purpose and meaning to live had better odds of surviving the concentration camps. The second part discusses logotherapy.How do you find significance and meaning in your own life? Well, it is important to go through the process and understand and experience life. By serving others and helping others find their significance, you will find your significance and meaning in life.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book,\\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably one of the most impacting books I have ever read. The first part of his story, about his times in the concentration camps, manages to wrench the heart while still steering away from actively striving to highlight the suffering Frankl witnessed daily. Rather, his matter-of-fact tone and reserved yet descriptive telling of his stories in the concentration camps only serve to heighten the sense the reader gets of the trials he endured. But the most poignant part of the novel wasn't, for me, his stories but rather his overall message: that our greatest trait, and our greatest means of freedom, is the freedom to control our attitude towards any situation, no matter how horrendous (and here is where his experience in the concentration camps really serve to emphasize his point as well as his suffering and the suffering of others).The second part of the book, logotherapy, appealed to me almost more than the first portion did. Logotherapy focuses primarily on the goal of finding meaning in one's life. Upon reading the definition I thought, skeptic that I am, that sure--this is a great goal, but perchance all hot air. It wasn't until I read the rest of Frankl's portion on logotherapy, read as he related it to problems across all fields, from dissatisfaction at work to a loss of faith in one's own capabilities, and it wasn't until I went back and related these techniques that I realized how revolutionary Frankl's theories are.Of course logotherapy doesn't work for everyone and of course everyone will not agree with it, but believer in logotherapy or psychology or not, it would be a grievous error not to peruse Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. It is a book that will change the way you look at the world, whether you take the psychology into consideration or not."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is a fantastic read. Half of the book is about his struggles in concentration camps, but I particularly enjoyed the second half about logotherapy. The idea that you can survive anything by keeping a will to live is a simple, yet extraordinary idea. Frankl mentioned how the first people to die were the ones that had lost a purpose in their life. They did not imagine a goal, and were left to die in the concentration camps.My favorite quote from the book is \\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.\\" In other words, do something wrong that you know how to do right. You only have one life, don't waste it. Obviously people don't always know what the best decision at every given moment, but this is about controlling that which you have control over. Take advantage of the life you are giving, don't throw it away because there is always someone else who would do anything to have your life.Originally, I thought that this book applied only to the bigger issues in life; that it is about you life as a whole. While that does seem to hold true, the idea of meaning can be applied to all aspect of one's life. Whether it is something menial or something life threatening, having that goal or purpose leads to you putting forth a constant effort. That effort can change someone's life, just like this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is one of those stories that remains in your mind for years after having read it. The stories duel nature, the first half of the book recounting his experiences in Nazi concentration camps and the second half explaining the essence of logotheraphy, instills a hope in the reader that allows one to find meaning in the struggles of life. Viktor Frankl's explanation of finding meaning in ones life is from trite. The practice of logotheraphy presents itself as real and difficult yet obtainable. In using his own story he does not glorify his triumph in overcoming the brutality of the camps, yet he recapitulates his experience for the purpose of presenting an example to demonstrate how even after the roughest of situations hope can be found. His story instilled the feeling of strength and power within myself and I can almost guarantee these same feelings will be found in every reader."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found this book to be incredibly good. It's one of only a couple books I've found myself reading without any knowledge of the time that's gone by. It's a small book but has great spiritual, emotional, and moral qualities. It helped me understand some of my own emotions I felt, when realizing how to many, human life was insignificant while being in prison. The way he described his release was also similar to my own experiences. Although the comparison is no where equal. I believe there are many similarities. I recommend this book for everyone. It will keep you entertained from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I think Frankl is a excellent writer and therapist. He makes several valid points about how man should go about finding meaning in his life. I especially like how he presented the Meaning of Suffering to the depressed doctor with the analogy of what if the wife died first? Essentially saying that the husband is saving the wife from having to suffer his death by the husband suffering the death of his wife. It is a justified way of looking at suffering. Logotherapy is all about finding meaning in life and the book explains just that but only after a very long, depressing section on his stay at Auschwitz. Although this section is somewhat dry, it is necessary to understnad where he gets his point of view for the remainder of the book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This may be the only negative review of this book, but there needs to be a first for everything. This book started off great, recollections of the tradgedies and sufferings that the author (Viktor Frankl) experienced in numerous German concentration camps during the second World War. But the first section, describing the actual war, was intriguing and kept me reading. But with the introduction of Logotherapy, the book started to go downhill, and I lost interest in it, as logotherapy and an in-depth view of human reactions just isn't my thing. So, if you're into psychological text, this is your book, but if you're the action/suspense kind of book reader, you can read the first section. This was just a disappointment after the first section."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am not one who reads as much as many of you. My time is spent mostly \\"doing\\", as opposed to reading about doing. That said, I selected this book to read as one that I thought would be useful and enlightening. While it did provide some insights to the inner workings of the mind, it fell short of my expectations.To me, the content did not represent that which was implied by the title. Furthermore, the first half of the book relating to the authors experiences in a concentration camp, was severely disconnected with the second part of the book, which was basically, a self help phychoanalysis book. Both parts were interesting to a degree, but I did not think that they complimented each other. Like I said, disjointed at best.I know one reviewer stated that this is the best book he has in his entire (and massive) book collection. I'm sorry but, that's sad.Just one man's opinion....."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Book arrived promptly. Does not look like it was ever read. Good price for the book.

Told it was used they were very happy."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Because that's what it sounds like to me. Some people decide life sucks. Frankly, if coming from a concentration camp inmate, I don't think anyone has any right to suggest that is not a valid position.Any camp memoir has plenty of examples of the arbitrariness of who got to live and who got to die. Frankl survived by pure chance several times. I don't think we can accept his insinuation that those circumstances were somehow due to his wonderful philosophies.I am genuinely pleased for him that he found something that worked for him in the face of the annihilation of his family, and the book is indeed full of inspiring ways of looking at the world. However I find it simplistic in the extreme and bordering on the offensive that he seems to believe that what worked for him can and should work for everyone else, particularly when he uses the behaviours of those who gave up and/or died for other reasons (occasionally he seems to blur the distinction) as an example of how not to live.I also find his little nuggets of wisdom and anecdotes of how with a simple sentence he turned patients' lives around to be extremely obnoxious. Ditto his unfortunate insinuation that the only thing that can give a woman's life meaning is to have children."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"... A man with such intellect should realize that while life can be *given* a meaning, it can no longer be denied that the idea of an inherent one is ludicrous. I'm certain that if I'd been through Dachau or Auschwitz, my faith in \\"god\\" would be pretty much shot to hell. The only meaning life can have is secular, in the end."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Let me start by saying that this book does not belong to \\"My Favorite Books\\" bookshelf. I started reading this book for couple of reasons. One ... the central idea behind this book was referred by one of my favorite Authors (Stephen R Covey) in one of my favorite books viz \\"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\". Secondly, the title of this book was extremely seductive \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\". (Who does not want to know meaning of life?)This book is primarily divided into two parts. The first part is more of an autobiography of the Author(Victor E. Frankl). Second part is dedicated to \\"Logotherapy\\".As regards to the 1st part, I found the narration a bit dry. I think the Author did his best to put forward his life as dramatically as possible, however it does not stand out. As much as I sympathize with the Author for what he went through, I felt that he was being a bit boastful at times. I was specially disappointed to see that he was putting down some of his comrades to show how superior he was. The Author also also failed to explain how Logotherapy therapy helped him during his tough times.The second part is on Logotherapy, which is nothing but a \\"bowl of spaghetti\\". The ideas are not very well organized. Whatever is put forward is not sufficiently substantiated with reasoning or facts. Author has tried to use some high-sounding words to make it sound something superior, but I guess the Author failed miserably. The Logotherapy that is referred in second part has no reference in the first part. So it is difficult to make any correlation between the two parts of the book.If there is anything to learn from this book, it is ... \\"If you have a *why* in life, you will go through any *how* to achieve it.\\". So effectively, to find meaning in life, find out what is your final goal and let it direct you.Overall I found this book disappointing :-(-Sachin"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Out of falsehood nothing good can come. Viktor Frankl devotes a large section of his story to Auschwitz, and claims to have been there for quite some time, noting that \\"we had to wear the same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appearance of being shirts.\\" In reality, Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz, en route from Theresienstadt to an outcamp of Dachau. As Timothy Pytell, a professor of history at Cooper Union who has researched Frankl observed, a reader of Man's Search for Meaning would \\"be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz\\" and \\"if truth be told, Frankl's rendition is contradictory and profoundly deceptive.\\" Frankl finally admitted the truth in 1991 when he told the magazine \\"Possibilities\\" that \\"I was in Auschwitz only three or four days [...] I was sent to a barrack and we were all transported to a camp in Bavaria.\\"Frankl left Theresienstadt on October 19, 1944 and arrived at the Dachau sub-camp Kaufering III on October 25, 1944. How then did he come to write his stories of Auschwitz? One cannot avoid concluding that he simply made the stories up. One could also have determined this from Frankl's story of seeing large flames coming out of the Auschwitz crematorium chimneys - a technical impossibility for such installations.One can even identify Frankl's transport from Theresienstadt. But the Auschwitz Chronicle of Danuta Czech gives the following account of his train:\\"October 20: 1,500 Jewish men, women, and children are sent in an RSHA transport from the ghetto in Theresienstadt. After the selection, 169 women are admitted to the transit camp and 173 men as prisoners to the camp. The men receive Nos. B-13307-B-13479. The remaining 1,158 people are killed in the gas chamber of Crematorium III.\\"Frankl did not receive a number at Auschwitz. According to Danuta Czech's reasoning, which is followed by all the standard histories of Auschwitz, this implies that he was gassed. In reality, he merely stopped at Auschwitz on his way to Kaufering III. Therefore Frankl's real story disproves the story of extermination camp Auschwitz!As for Frankl's philosophy, it amounts to a ponderous meditation on one of Nietzsche's epigrams. Its fame is principally due to the intrigue of the Auschwitz story, which turns out to be fundamentally false."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was not quite what I expected. I do not mean todoubt Mr. Frankl's character or value or theories, or the atrocity ofconcentration camps, or anything else. In this book I expected to find a presentation and discussion of a theory. However, the first part was a description of camp life and consisted of \\"plain\\" facts. Of course, I do not doubt that they have certain things to say, but I did not see any theory coming through from these facts (at least up to the point that I had the patience to read). In my case, the first part did not attract my interest, but rather worked as a deterrent, because of very different expectations I had from this book.In describing a theory that wants to be called \\"scientific,\\" it is necessary to mention certain facts to prove ones point; in my opinion the first part did not serve such a prupose. Appealing to the emotions of the reader does not help him judge objectively a theory and certainly *doesn't* validate a theory! I do not suffer from any kind of loss and I've had little to do with physchology (my background is in physics and computer science... :-). I expected a logical and \\"matter-of-fact\\" description of a theory and (at least as far as I got in this book), I didn't see that. The beginning of the second part did not seem very \\"promising\\" either, so I gave this book up completely.To sum up, I'm *not* rejecting Mr. Frankl's theories (I still don't know what they are, after all!) but if you think in a manner similar to mine, maybe you should seek to learn about them from another book (possibly by the same author)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" left out the reason for our existence.

He doesn't recommend everbody suffers but his voice is one of reason, kindness, forgiveness, and gentleness. He describes the horrors of World War II and the camps.

Ask Austrian Psychiatrist Dr. Victor Frankl. Having spent a few years in the death camps the images he explains in the first half of his book is just unthinkable. The torture these people endured during these times are simply hard to believe.Frankl's graphic details of the killings, beatings and other inhumane activites makes the read wonder if there is any hope for them. This is the same type of question people ask when they loose clarity in their purpose. When there is a sudden change in their life, one may ask \\"What am I going to do now?\\"Frankl's introduction to logotherapy is fairly basic. No matter who or where we are, we can always choose our own attitude. Further, he says that everybody who finds their purpose will persevere to leave their legacy. Whether it is in business, family or a particular mission, once your purpose is discovered you will get to your destination.Frankl's phylosiphy helped him and others during the war to make it out of the camps before the Americans invaded Germany and the camps were raided.

We all know of the physical trauma and fear felt by all of the prisoners. We can't truly know all of the hurt done. This book doesn't go into the horrible details, but into the mind of a prisoner. There had to have been absolute trauma knowing one was a moment away from death. In this book, however, Viktor E. Frankl tells how the prisoners mentally survived. It was through a collective will to get through each passing day. One story tells how one person lost the will to live it was obvious that they weren't going to live. The going into of an individuals mind through the holocaust and the different perspective of horrors make this a great book.2. It offers principles and help to find meaning in life. Frankl's logo therapy is one way he identifies to help people examine his/her life. One doesn't need to have his logo therapy but identify principles in the book to help find meaning. The principle taught that one must make the best of whatever situation is present in life. He was in the holocaust and managed to survive. There is always a choice and only you can decide how you will react. It would have been easy to give up and lose character but Frankl never did.

It is the man who gives suffering, joy, or whatever his life contains a meaning, the way he accepts his fate and all that it entails.Regardless of external circumstances, there is a spark of freedom which enables man to fight or despair. To choose to be a demon or a saint.Agree or disagree, this book has power because it is written by someone who has been to hell and back. Who has seen it all with his own eyes.

This gives one a silver lining in any situation. Frankl shows us that the true test of one's existence comes only in the times of deepest suffering. The use of the word suffering is used so loosely in pschycological texts, in the context of our own lives, most of our suffering only construes to be the everyday problems of our existence. Recognizing this connection gives the reader a better understanding of the ideas of transendence, existence and love.

Read this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In \\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" Victor Frankl provides an introduction to existentialism and logotherapy. Based on his experiences in the concentration camps during World War 2, he says that life's meaning comes from within and that life does not cease to have meaning just because of suffering.He asked fellow prisoners why they did not commit suicide and he got responses such as they had a talent to be used, or a loved one waiting, or they had memories worth preserving. But how many people try to avoid death and don't commit suicide because they fear death?Frankl says that if there is a purpose in life at all, there must therefore be a purpose in suffering and dying. I don't think agree with that line of reasoning. If life is purposeful, then isn't death likely to be unpurposeful? Maybe there are \\"purposes\\" in suffering and dying but are they necessarily in our interest? The purpose of murder might be revenge, but that meaning doesn't benefit the victim. \\"Without suffering and death, life cannot be complete,\\" he writes on page 76. WHAT?! Could some cases of searching for meaning in suffering and dying be rationalization? Frankl says to search through suffering and find how good can come of it, making the suffering more bearable. \\"Suffering ceases to be suffering the moment it finds meaning,\\" he says. But I think it would be better still for good to come on its own and not through suffering. Finally, I think Frankl's statement that death gives life meaning contradicts his other beliefs. He is against suicide and helped his fellow prisoners to find meaning in life so they would keep living, yet he says life isn't complete without death. So if in his day, technology and medicine allowed man the option to live forever, would Frankl turn this down and allow himself to die? Wouldn't this be the same as commiting suicide?Frankl's Logotheraply proposes that many neuroses are caused by a failure of the sufferer to find meaning and sense of responsibility in his existence. Logotherapy is based on the belief that search for meaning is the primary motivation of man and not a \\"secondary rationalization\\" of instictual drives, defense mechanisms, reaction formations, or sublimations. He backs this up by saying that people live and die for their beliefs and values.He says that life is so valuable that it is worth living no matter how great the suffering may be, and finding meaning can pull man through any amount of suffering. He's against mercy killings and euthanasia for that reason. So if someone has a wasting, uncurable, terminatable illness, they should live out their natural life, he says. Or if someone has Alzheimer's disease, knowing who no one is, including themself, eats their meals through a straw, and has their diaper changed by a nurse-- they should be kept alive as long as possible. He says that we shouldn't confuse how much a person contributes to society with how much they are worth to it. Personally, I found insufficient information in the reading to convince me that there is a difference. The inference of these ideas is that human life is sacred and all humans are equal. What about animals? They can feel pain too. On the other hand, there are some humans who are in some condition that's it's like they don't even know they are alive, such as retardation, being comatose, etc and there are humans who do not want to be alive. As Frankl himself writes in the same book, being useful is equated with being meaningful and vice versa. So shouldn't we all seek to be useful in society to make our lives meaninful?As he noticed in the concentration camps, hope and courage were what kept people in the camps alive. Those who lost hope and courage would commit suicide or succumb to disease. Frankl quotes Nietzche, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.\\" In \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\", Stephen Covey noted that our ability to do anything is determined by knowing what to do, how to do it, and why to do it. Frankl's book stresses the \\"why\\"-- the motivation, the reason and meaning, to live.He says that people shouldn't focus on what they expect from life, but rather what life expects from them. To Frankl, the meaning of life is different for each person. To ask for a general, abstract meaning of life is like asking a chess Grandmaster what the greatest move in the world is, he writes.The last part of the book is devoted to a very brief intro to logotherapudic methods. \\"Hyper-intention\\" is how fear can bring to pass what we are afraid of or how trying too hard for something can prevent it from happening. To alleviate this problem, the author proposes to simply relax the hyper-intention. For example, to cure sleeplessness, try to stay awake. To achieve sexual orgasm, don't worry about it and instead focus on your partner. He says many neurotics aggravate their problems by trying to fight them. By learning to laugh at themselves, he says, neurotics can be on their way to a cure.As for the pursuit of happiness, Frankl urges the reader to pursue a REASON to be happy, just as to make someone laugh you must give him a reason to (tell him a joke). He notes that these days many people have enough to live by but nothing to live for-- they have the means but no meaning. In the future, as automation puts more time in people's hands, many will be in the \\"existential vacuum\\", faced with the lack of meaning in their lives when they aren't occupied with work or labor.Overall, I think this is an insightful book but I disagree with certain parts."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was really two books in one. The first part centered on the author's experiences and feelings of suffering as a Holocaust survivor. The terrible pain and indignity came out crystal clear. The second part was less than clear however. Logotherapy was difficult to grasp. Indeed, the author totally lost this reader as to the utility of logotherapy in my life and I would venture to guess that he had the same effect on other readers."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Product was described as no markings in the book.

Found something and I have not read other reviews much because I think lot of people get the point and they put forth better than me. Here is why I am writing the review. I think he (VF) was on his path to enlightenment and fell short in the form of logo therapy or other ideas. I used to dream of being a Messiah and had encounters with life twice where I was equally pinned on cross but all in my thoughts I knew I cannot bear the pain far less the thought so I am a mere mortal. Same way I cannot fathom the depth of concentration camps or what crystalizes out of it. Typically in India we have a philosophy which I found comes handy that when you are given pain then you also get the courage to with stand it. When do you cross over to enlightenment is something eluding me though it is not a per-requisite as far as I know. Kabbalah scholars will also find the book intriguing and failing in spiritual goals which he (VF) should have somehow alluded. Read this book with higher goal of finding meaning of life and you will find enough that time will be well spent. We all salute those who live life bigger than us and we feel fortunate that we are reading it in a cozy chair vs. living it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Book was delivered in the expected time frame.

Rather than dwelling on the atrocities of the guards and the evils of Nazism, he has shown us what the strength of the human spirit can accomplish.He describes a new way of looking at human interaction called Logotherapy, which explains why some people survived the camps with their spirits intact, while other who were even in better condition gave up and died.I loved the way he explains a difficult concept, and found myself re-reading several passages. He is a great philosopher and writer who understands humanity at a level few of us ever appreciate."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Despite being an inmate in a Nazi death camp, Frankl realizes meaning in his life.

A man cannot find peace in happiness unless they have a meaning or purpose in life. I thought it was fascinating and thought provoking. There is no one answer to a meaning in life but he certainly gives you ways to find insight into your own. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because some people may find it a bit difficult to grab all the concepts. I was told by someone in the field that it is required reading. Aside from that I believe that anyone who reads it will benefit even if they don't &#34;get&#34; all of it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I thought the first half of this book was life changing. I highlited many passages and have referred to them several times after I had finished the book. There was just enough story mixed with philosophy to be on my level of understanding.

Worth reading more then once!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had heard of Victor Frankl years ago, but never had the opportunity to read his work, and I'm grateful to finally get the chance to &#34;hear&#34; the voice of a concentration camp survivor.

Each person's search for meaning in his/her life is a different journey and Frankl has a deep understanding of our human fears and desires. This book will make you think and maybe even change your life. I'm going to read it again as there's a lot to absorb. I got hung up on some of the technical/psychological jargon but it wasn't that hard to grasp the basic meanings."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"An inspiring and honest look at adversity in life and looking beyond tragedy to a greater purpose in life.

No matter what trials we must go through, no matter how we are treated, we choose how we will respond."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first half of this book relates experiences from Mr. Frankl's days as a Holocost prisoner. He shares some of the day to day psychological effects of being a prisoner - very powerful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"this was an incredible book that was thoughtfully written. the author gave personal accounts and feelings that make you examine your own life. so often we sit back and ask what' s in this for me, the author encourages the reader to look outside of that and think of those around you. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Overall, the personal memoir of Victor Frankl was very good. Even though Frankl was not telling all of the many horrors of concentration camp life, the few details he shares are enough to make one cringe. Human depravity has led to many horrific events, such as the concentration camps. The overall message of this book was that of finding meaning in life. As a Christian, this fits very well with a biblical worldview. Even though Frankl falls a bit short of what the Bible teaches on the issue, he nevertheless brings out many valid points about life in general. The second half of the book, which seeks to summarize logotherapy, was not as good as the first half of the book. Going from personal reflection on his time in the concentration camps, Frankl provides the overall framework for his therapy of, finding meaning in life. I would definitely recommend this book and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Every student of psychology should read this at least once. Victor Frankl's story portrays the importance of putting meaning into your life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book really did change my life and I try to apply the lessons learned on a daily basis. I wish this was required reading for the world."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"After the glowing recommendation I received on this book I was expecting more. Maybe I should have read this 20 years ago and I would have had a different slant, but I have grown weary of listening to victims believing that by surviving the ordeal and then telling the story that they are somehow making up for the less than human behavior they exhibited. The holocaust was inexcusable. I just didn't feel like I learned anything new from this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Out of the worst of contexts, Viktor Frankl speaks the wisdom of how to live within suffering and find meaning. Staying present to the reality of what is happening right now and finding a glimmer of something that calls us forward seem to be the keys. Dwelling only on what has been lost or is being lost leads to meaninglessness and to a despair. This lose of all hope was certain death in the camps. Reading this book again continues to inspire me to manage my suffering in a way which gives my life meaning and purpose. I highly recommend this book for anyone for whom suffering is an issue."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I think this book should be required reading for everyone. Some of my little desires are so petty.. this book has made me think more about life and what is really important.."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Attempting to understand how anyone could endure the holocaust without giving up hope is of itself almost unfathomable. Yet Frankl, through his own direct experience, shows us how to find meaning through assisting others, thereby creating the purpose to continue on despite the suffering.In the second part of the book, Frankl then goes on to demonstrate how Logotherapy can be used in so many of the situations we inevitably encounter in our lives; from terminally ill relatives through to a reason to get out of bed each day and make a difference to the people around us.This book will put your own life into perspective, and will make you see the world in a vastly different way. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an amazing book. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who has an interest in psychology"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Excellent! A very different perspective than most Holocaust victems. We could learn much about ourselves as well as people in general about going forwars after tramatic experiences. The ooones that searched for a reason to survive; did and those who gave up expired. In view of the mess the world is in today, we need to be reminded to hold close those things that matter if we are to not just survive, but to thriive."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Rarely I feel the necessity to comment anybody or anything, but this book deserves it. I also got the advice to read it from my therapeut and, yes, in the life-limit situation. I don't think it's because of it I'm still living, but it surely push bounds my knowledge a bit forward. I have red it for a second time during last days and understand a little more...it should be red for many times. Like in E. Fromm's &quot;To have or to be&quot;, there is no simple solution -- but it helpes you to find your own. Because you only need to know WHY and the remaining is so easy...(so read Nietzche also, he is full of vitality) From other people I could only take a little -- like I took from Tony Shue's review some months ago, when I was looking for this book. I know, I don't have to repay him or my psychologist or friends, known or unknown people which helped me, knowing or unknowing -- but I feel I should do the same for someone else, known or unknown, who might be in need of simple human touch. So I wrote it -- maybe this book is the touch you need."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In the first portion of this book, Dr. Frankl examines his experiences in concentration camps during the Holocaust from a psychological perspective. Even though I have never read this book before I have heard many of these stories already. The second, and I think more profound portion of the book, is about logotherapy. He describes what he terms \\"existential vacuum\\" as a lack of meaning in ones life. He attributes many psychological problems such as addiction and depression to this existential vacuum. He therefore treats psychological problems through logotherapy where he helps the patient find meaning. Frankl asserts that happiness cannot be found as long as we seek happiness but only when we find our meaning. I, however, was disappointed to find that Dr. Frankel does not tell us what the meaning of life is, but states that the meaning is different for different people and even different for the same person at different times. This relativistic view of the meaning of life seems somewhat arbitrary to me and therefore meaningless. He does, however, tell how a person can find their meaning through relationships and even through suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Found this book to be insightful and meaningful. Author provided a different perspective on life in a concentration camp. Felt like Frankl was having a dialogue with me, which kept the book from becoming too \\"textbook\\". Made me think about survivors in a new way, and was able to relate his insights to current times."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning really helped me find what was true for my own life, and what I believed in. This novel put in very simple terms all the complex thoughts of life's meaning. This book has taught me that one has to find their own life source, or why one lives. Viktor Frankl shows you how to find what you're living for. He really reinforced the ideas I already had about my own life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was a great book. Who better to tell the story of the holocaust than a survivor of it. I used to think that I knew a lot about the holocaust and concentration camps. After reading this book, my knowledge of the holocaust had increased at least three-fold. One of the reasons that I liked this book so much, is that he was able to tell the reader not only what happened to the prisoners, but also the psychological effect it had on them. The title may give the appearance of a dull book, but I personally enjoyed it thouroughly. I also got 5 extra credit points in A.P. European History for reading it. Pretty cool huh?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl has touched so many readers with \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" because of the simple, yet beautiful prose style that he used in his writing.Straightforward, honest reporting of his concentration camp experiences, followed by an analysis of the psychological impact he and his fellow prisoners endured. No heavy jargon. No dogmatic credos. I felt it to be the most humanistic approach to \\"finding meaning\\" that I have ever read. Today there is a trend towards 'biological psychiatry'....everything can be explained organically. Frankl holds out the hope that humans still have the ultimate freedom to \\"choose how we react to the most barbaric conditions with dignity and self-respect\\".. That is what sets us apart from our fellow Earth creatures. A quick read that will affect any thinking reader."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"&quot;Man's Search For Meaning&quot; by Victor Frankl is a book which shouldn't even be allowed to be read by a lot of people. As I read some of the negative reviews here, I was reminded of the words of another well published fellow: &quot;Don't cast your pearls before swine. They will trample your pearls beneath their feet, and then turn and and rend you&quot;.This little book was written and translated into English over fifty years ago by a man who went through the crucible of the Holocaust. Not only did he survive as an organism, but as a naked human spirit. He looked death and horror right square in the eye, not in a brave moment, but over the grind of years and DEFIED IT, WITH JUSTICE,AND MERCY, AND WALKING HUMBLY WITH AN ADEQUATE WHY!Having done so, he began to try to share his gift with a world of people in pain, and people in vacuum. He has passed on now, but his gift of understanding will THUNDER down through the centuries, and continue to be built upon. If we humans ever transcend the petty little dogs nipping at our heels, and the monsters that confront us with our worst nightmares, we shall do it with the gift of understanding he left us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book should be required reading for anyone who has ever had the audacity to feel sorry for themselves (which is most of us).

He's unquestionably one of my heroes and this book is a must read (or re-read as the case may be). If you don't have it yet, it's time to get it. It's impossible to be a serious student of life and not soak up as much Frankl as you can.The man survived the horrors of Nazi concentration camps and, from that pain, brought the world his \\"Logotherapy\\"--a philosophy based on the fundamental precept that we have ultimate responsibility for choosing our responses to any given challenge AND equally powerful responsibility to determine how we will give ourselves to the world and create a truly meaningful life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a terrific book about the meaning of Life.

Warning: it is sometimes depressing, but enlightening."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Easy to read, full of good thought provoking content, this book has three parts to it: in part one Viktor Frankl discusses how everyday life in a concentration camp affected the mind of the average prisoner.Having been a concentration camp prisoner himself he speaks of his own experience and observations. He postulates that the search for meaning and the belief in meaning to one's life (and suffering) is what keeps us going or makes us give up. He explains how we can find meaning in our life. There's no meaning for everybody but our individual actions give meaning to our life.In part two he sketches out his own approach to psychotherapy which he called logotherapy. And in part three he explains the term tragic optimism.Part 3 seemed a cling-on to me. As if the publisher felt that the book wasn't long enough without some more material. Several statements from parts one and two are repeated and very little is added to the value of the book in my opinion.That notwithstanding I couldn't but be humble and thoughtful after reading parts one and two. How anybody can survive the horrors of a concentration camp and then live a life of compassion for others is in itself so noteworthy to me that I cannot but pay attention to what such a person has to say. Frankl's emphasis on action (creating a work or doing a deed and experiencing something or encountering someone) and attitude (especially towards suffering) to find fullfillment and give meaning to your life and his disdain of finding the same in introspection/meditation leaves me to contemplate my own beliefs in this regard. Maybe the next book I read will help me decide which way I tend to lean."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's journey and his amazing survival techniques in the Auschwitz death camps prove to be one of the most meaningful books ever written. If there was 1 book that everyone should read in their life this would be my choice. Forget all those meaningless self-help books on getting rich, getting in touch with your inner self and all that new age baloney that might enhance your life but if your life has no meaning, no foundation for growth than nothing will ever bring you true happiness.

I enjoyed reading the first part of the book and learning about what it was like to be in such a hellish place (a concentration camp), and yet still being able to be positive about life. What more can I say than its an excellent book?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Of all the \\"maven\\"/talking heads\\" that appear on TV and radio,I have always considered the most spaced out to be the various categories of shrinks.The one exception who easily comes to mind is Victor Frankl(1905-1997) who founded 'logotherapy' which he distinguishes from psycoanalysis with,\\"Now in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear(p.104).\\"And Frankl brings a strong moral basis to his 'therapy' largely based on lessons learned during the three years he was imprisoned in Aushwitz;in his forward,Frankl,who had a visa to leave his native Austria,decided to stay with his parents,influenced by a piece of marble his father managed to salvage from a representation of 'The Ten Commandments' from Vienna's largest synagogue which the Nazi's destroyed.The salvaged piece of marble was from The Commandment 'To Honor Your Mother and Father'(p.13).But,with one sentence Frankl shatters all the nonsense coming from \\"mavens\\" and modern culture:\\"...From this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world,but only these two-the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race of the indecent man\\"(p.94)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"People go through different obstacles in life, some good and some bad. Individuals who experience the worst of life sometimes come to an ending point and have no hope,nowhere to run and simply give up. Those who experience the good come to an ending point and try to understand their meaning in life, but come to find they don't know where to begin on their search. It's like they lost themselves on their journey and are only left with a blank to fill in. Everyone at some point in their lifetime need to realize what their meaning in life is and how to mold themselves into the person they truely are and not into who they have falsely become.Viktor Frankl has done just this. In his book he talks of his life as a young adult surviving a concentration camp horror. He also talks of his life after Auschwitz, and the other camps, and how he overcame the many hard and terrifying obstacles the concentration camps laid before him. He talks of his strengths, his weaknesses and his miraculous survival during those long, dreadful years of brutality and dehumanization.After reading this book I was so amazed to find how Frankl could take a bad experience and turn it into a success. He founded his own Logotherapy which he lectures at many worldwide universities and conventions. Overcome by so many things, Viktor found his own meaning in life through the concentration camps. He talked of taking one day at a time, not as if it was his last, but as if it was a new beginning. He always spoke the truth about his situation to himself and to his fellow prisoner's. He never tried to deny the situation he was put in, but to deal with it in his own therapeutic way. Even when the other's gave up hope and turned down the path towards suicide, Viktor kept his head high, stayed smart and always hoped for a brighter day, even though he knew the gas chambers were only seconds away.Never once in Man's Search for Meaning did Frankl contradict himself on the points he was trying to get across to the reader. He always stayed true to his own psychology and his own beliefs even at the hardest of times. All of the evidence he gave throughout the book clearly explained his journey for his meaning in life.Left with no one but himself, Viktor found ways to deal with his tremendous mound of emotions and grief even when he felt like the end was near and he was slowly losing hope until the final days. In the midst of mental and physical torment frankl always decided at the end of each day that he was going to live to see freedom and the outside world surrounding him in the camp.Viktor clearly explained his views in such a profound and meaningful way throughout his entire book. In the end it all came down to one point the clearly sticks with me after reading his story:Searching for a meaning in life can sometimes be hard and done in so many ways, whether your in a good situation or a bad one. You can either strive for that meaning or you can fall with those around you and never come to find what your life has in store."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Profound truths learned from real life experiences... I would highly recommend this book for helping us understand ourselves better. I believe that in our world today of \\"depressions, addictions and agressions\\" (conditions Frankl identifies) that \\"finding the meaning to our existence\\" is an inspired way to cure the vacuum that engulfs its victims. I am just surprised his theories are not more readily used in psychology today. They are timeless."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning was first recommended to me as an undergraduate majoring in psychology but I have read it several times over the years and with each reading I come away with added perspective, personally and professionally. I tend to only rate books as five-star when I come away feeling the experience has changed my life in a significant and positive way. Dr. Frankl's book is an inspiration, thought provoking, and life changing reminder that we always have choice and kindness and compassion always matter.As a communicator, Dr. Frankl was extremely eloquent and I found that as I was being led through his life experiences, thoughts, and perception, I was able to process his message for myself. Within the pages of this thought-provoking book, about a psychologist who was a prisoner in concentration camps during WWII, Frankl proposes spiritual liberation is possible within any experience, \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms...to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"This is one of those books that you keep on your shelf and reread from time to time. A very inspirational read, this short book is especially for those in search of life's meaning. The concepts flow logically and in a straightforward language. I recommend this book for everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The outcome of many a debate is determined in advance by the opening presumption. For example, do we assume a proposition is correct and require evidence against or assume it is false and require evidence in favor?Viktor Frankl's genius consists of applying this principle to the question of the meaning of life. In MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING, he proposed that we should not demand meaning from life, but rather recognize that life demands meaning from us.More than that, since the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and even from hour to hour, what matters is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's particular life at a given moment. And from this it follows that each person has his own specific vocation in life and must carry out a concrete mission. In that special assignment he cannot be replaced.Even under the tyranny of the Nazi death camps, where Frankl was a prisoner for nearly four years (described in Part One of the book), or the Soviet Gulag, where almost everything could be taken from a man or a woman, Frankl insisted that one thing remained, the last of human freedoms: the ability to chose one's attitude under any circumstances.For me, reading MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING as a young man was a life-changing experience. It settled in my mind the question of determinism vs. free will. It established for me a working hypothesis that my life could be pulled by goals as well as pushed by drives. As Frankl points out, between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space lies our power to choose our response and in that choice lies our growth and freedom. In short, it doesn't matter what we expect from life but rather what life expects from us.In my opinion, MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING should be on the core reading list of every American who aims to preserve human freedom and dignity.NOTE: For anyone facing an existential crisis, I recommend Frankl's speech to fellow concentration camp inmates in the winter of 1944-1945, which can be found on pages 102-105 of the book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the absolute best book that I have ever read.

I recommend it to my friends constantly."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl comprises of two parts. The first is his own harrowing account of the time he spent in four concentration camps under Nazi occupation during WWII. The second is his introduction to logotherapy, which is his own psychological method for helping others cope with pain, guilt and death. It is the first part of the book, from his own perspective entitled 'Experiences in a Concentration Camp', that is the true heart of his story.His retelling of the concentration camp experience is so gripping because it is, for lack of a better word, so simple. So much inhumanity of the most heinous kind was endured, and yet some of these men and women clung to something deep within themselves and managed to survive. And not everyone had a choice. Some lives were taken without a chance of survival.The introduction to logotherapy is much more academic, but it's summary is basic: From within and outside of yourself, find that which gives your life meaning and focus upon that to carry you through your pain and suffering. This wisdom has been echoed by many, and putting it into practice may take considerable time and effort, but it is the truest form of living I have ever encountered."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"How can one triumph over tremendous and bitter evils? How can someone even survive the ongoing evil faced head-on in a Nazi concentration camp--in facing the violence, the inhumanity and the injustice, where to all appearances, sin seems to have taken the upper hand? How does one even find hope when caught up in the clutch of such crushing evil that can so easily cause others to throw up their hands in helpless defeat? Victor Frankl not only tells us, but shows us how it's done from first-had experience--from finding meaning in one's existence and those around you--from finding dignity in your life regardless of circumstances--from exercising that which stands seemingly above all human characteristics: human freedom, which gives us the ability to continue to steer our choices and direct our lives.Yes, he writes, wrote: \\"We who have lived in concentration camps can remember those who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing, the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's own way.\\" Deprived of his own freedom, paradoxically, he kept his freedom. He continued his decision making. Revealing a profound insight into the reality of our existence, Frankl said, \\"Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\\" He nonetheless exercised this unassailable supreme human ability while imprisoned under the most horrendous conditions. Accordingly, he maintained to always have the benefit of \\"the last of the human freedoms: to choose one's attitude in any given circumstance, to choose one's own way.\\" He acknowledges the immeasurable greatness of the human spirit, unyielding under the grip of overwhelming evil--insistent on the import and value of right resolve, in spite of all odds--on being fully who we are, regardless of fully inhumane treatment--and remaining fully alive.The book is a study in psychology, all to itself!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you are intrigued by human nature this is a book for you.

It's definitely a different way to look at things than traditional psychoanalysis and gets you thinking from a different perspective. Great read, short and to the point."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A friend recommended this book after a discussion of \\"character motivation\\" in science fiction. I am so glad he did. Frankl was a psychiatrist working on a theory of what motivated mankind when he was thrown in a Nazi concentration camp. He survived in large part because he had something to live for--the publication of his work. The first part of the book details survival within the concentration camp. This part alone is worth the book's price. Unlike Hollywood depictions of camps, he shows what the inmates actually had to do in order to survive (they would do just about anything not to be on a \\"list\\") and he even shows the occasional humanity of some of the guards, even, amazingly, the final commandant of his camp.The second part of the book is a brief summary of Frankl's theories called logotherapy. I can't say I'm an expert on this; he published over 20 volumes on the subject. But what I read here is fascinating. In summary, he believes that man's search for meaning is his primary motivation, unlike Freudian psychology which teaches that man's search for pleasure is his primary motivation.I plan to reread this book regularly. Truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an important book if you are interested in human psychology, particularly in logotherapy. The book consists of three parts, the first is Dr. Frankls personal account of his survival at Auschwitz and other concentration camps. In the second part the author gives a concise summary of logotherapy (Def: It focuses on the meaning of the human existence and assists its patients to find meaning in their life.) and in the third and last chapter Frankl discusses \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and its usefulness.I found Dr. Frankls account of his time in Auschwitz very interesting, yet not as emotionally moving as accounts by other authors. I believe that's because the author focused his writings on the psychological aspect of the whole experience, thus giving it a more clinical and detached feeling. This actually proved to be helpful to the reader in understanding the theories of logotherapy.There were some really good insights in this book and I would like to quote the ones that I found to be most important:\\"Don't aim at success- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication or a cause greater than oneself or as a by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.\\"\\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\\"I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the meaning of life and how to live a meaningful life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl went through the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps. While many gave into despair and gave up their will to live, Frankl fought on to create some meaning from these horrible experiences. He believed that anything in life can be dealt with as long as we are able to find meaning in it.This book saved my life when I had lost everything I ever worked for. All my life I fought to be a champion. I got close to my dreams with national shows and sponsorship requests at 18, but I got severely injured.Doctors said I would need painkillers and Prozac for the rest of my life. They said I would never train again. I proved them wrong.After 2 grueling years, I got back to my peak and surpassed it at 20. Yet, in the finals of a grappling tournament, I got a severe injury that was supposed to have crippled me forever. I felt constant severe pain throughout my body.All the best doctors and therapists said I had no hope. I was doomed to lose the body that I worked all my life for. All my dreams, businesses, relationships, and meaning came from martial arts, fitness, and health. I sacrificed everything for my dreams, and now, everyone said my dream was dead. At times, I thought I should just die with my dreams.This book made me realize I always, always, had a choice. No matter what happens in our external circumstances, we can always decide our character.No one can take that away from us but ourselves.Now, 2 years and 30 doctors later, I found the most amazing doctors and masters who could heal me. They both showed me a new life and a new way that I never even dreamed possible. I learned about qi qong, tai chi, and bio-mechanics to cultivate the yin in my yang soul.I am healing, becoming stronger, bigger, and better than ever.The wound is the seed of our adult life; it is out of that wound that our adult life grows. In the shaman traditions, it was believed that a healer only got his powers from being wounded in battle. It was through that wound that the spirit of healing could enter. It was by healing oneself that one could heal others. You can look at your suffering and pain as disabilities, or as an ability to be a miracle, an inspiration, and a champion."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I bought this book because I was searching for yet another book on workplace bullying and another book came up in my search based on Frankl's book. I read the customer reviews on that book and one reviewer said something to the effect of, \\"If you want to read a book based on Viktor Frankl's opinion of how to get along at a bad work environment (like a Nazi death camp), why don't you just read Frankl's book?\\" So, that's where I started. I read it. Twice. Then I got out my computer and typed in passages that had meaning to me so I could re-read them during difficult times. I compressed the entire book down to about 10 pages, single spaced. I must admit that I consider myself a negative, often depressed sort of person, mostly because my work situation is so demoralizing. I was amazed by Frankl's coping mechanisms on how to get along in a difficult situation; every day meant multiple incidents of having to choose the correct path to avoid death or worse, making the choice to give up on your own life (suicide). He went through 5 years of that and lived to tell about it. It is a must read for everyone, particularly when you are having the hardest time of your life. I could tell that if I had read it as a college student, it wouldn't have the same meaning as now, when I am 50 and have had many ups and downs. I see everything at such a deeper level and appreciated this book so much more than I would have if I were younger. Briefly, the lessons in the book written 50 years ago still apply today. Here they are: Let luck be your guide. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Network with the equivalent of a one-step-up lateral (not your own) middle manager and they will help you when they can. Schmooze. Be kind to others. Don't complain, it doesn't help. You can't fix, deal with or appeal to a sadist, so don't try. Avoid sadists at all costs. Keep your mouth shut unless asked for your opinion and then be short and to the point. Praise, even when praise isn't deserved. Keep criticisms to yourself. Be inconspicuous. Work hard for the sake of doing a good job. Fantasize for escape. Everything can be taken away from you except for your past, so relish in it. When something good happens to you, write it down (keep a gratitude journal). Don't do anything that compromises your own values so you won't have regrets. Be careful who you abuse today because tomorrow they may be your master. You are not your job, your title or your position. You are a unique person loved by others. The only thing in life that really matters is the people you love and the people who love and need you. Love shared is eternal. Treat everyone with respect. The meaning of life is not what life can do for you, but what life expects of you; how you make the world a better place with your presence. The purpose of life is not happiness. The purpose of life is discovering what you can contribute to it. Save a slice of bread (or whatever is the only material thing that matters to you when there is nothing left) for later when you are really depressed and it's the only thing left that can get you through that difficult moment. (For me it's chocolate and a dark beer at the same time.) Apathy is the signaling of the beginning of the end of one's life. Everyone that you respect and look up to has human failings. Even tough guys cry. Suffering without purpose is meaningless. The larger the suffering, the bigger the lesson. There's lots more in the book for you to discover and it's an easy read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"From the perspective of a member in a culture consumed in the \\"existential vacuum\\", Frankl's experiences and logotheraphy discussion offers a call to action for those prepared to live a meaningful life.

The first part is a stark autobiography of Frankl's personal journey through the Holocaust. It is powerful, compelling and harrowing.. this story is now familiar, but Frankl tells it with immense compassion and dignity. A Google search reveals that this book has not been invited into a certain Holocaust museum (?), but one would assume it is because Frankl's philosophy, which he outlines in the second part of the book, which is borne from his personal search for meaning in the darkest days of WW2, achieved a transcendence of Self that went beyond the labelling of Jew and Nazi. I found his exposition of logotherapy fascinating, with golden threads of thought that I could unwind with more current day psychological schematas, such as those propounded in NLP and Psychosynthesis. As a primer on the theory of Existentialism and an introduction to existential therapy, which he helped to form, I would also thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book changed my life. I have purchased this book more times than I can remember to give to other people. The author has a way of stating things with a minimum of words. This is good for the reader because a library full of other books cannot begin to have the impact, in my opinion, of this book.Frankl does not seem to feel he is special or extraordinary is any way because he has survived his circumstances. He is kind to his readers. When I read this book I feel as though I am in his kind hands. I feel as though I am being taken care of.One thing I always remember from this book, and think about almost daily is something he writes about how we perceive other people. He writes that often we form an opinion about someone, and then later hear something about that person from someone else that is totally different. He says perhaps we think that someone is very bad, and then hear someone say that that person is very good. He goes on to remark that what made that person good had perhaps not happened to that person yet, when our opinion was formed. Before I make opinions about others now, I think that whatever I'm about to say that is critical, may have already changed. I think we would appreciate if others would do this for us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's journey and his amazing survival techniques in the Auschwitz death camps prove to be one of the most meaningful books ever written.

In the midst of our greatest struggles we learn our greatest lessons and a life without struggle is not a life with meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"People have considered this book primarily a book about survival in inhuman conditions. But Victor Frankl got into those inhuman conditions because he did a decent, human thing; he honored his aged father and mother, instead of accepting the US immigration visa. He had a opportunity to participate in an escape attempt, but was moved with compassion by one of the sick prisoners in his care.Viktor Frankl considered his logotherapy to be basically humanistic, attempting to focus the patient's attention on the meanings he will fulfill in the future, the things he will create, the deeds he will do, the people he loves, the sufferings he will courageously endure. But a lot of logotherapists didn't have the God of Viktor Frankl inside them, the God who delivered Viktor from his narrow prison.Given that we have had other impositions of inhuman conditions since the book was written, such as the Killing Fields of Cambodia and the massacres in Rwanda, it would be useful for future editions to address these situations. Neither the foreword nor the afterword addressed these."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a must read for everyone!

How does a person maintain hope when all seems lost, and what causes them to perish is explained by Victor Frankl."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found that Man's Search for Meaning was a refreshing read in its ability to portray the unceasing question of the reason for our existence in an explicit manor. His approach to the human mind can be seen in the diction of his prose. Frankl does not intimidate his reader with convoluted explanations of the perplexing labyrinth that is our mind, but rather he speaks directly and clearly about the nature of experiencing everyday. Nor does he make his audience suffer by going into great gore and detail, but rather he makes his audience suffer in blatantly stating the facts of humanity. Like many of us, Victor Frankl does not have an answer to the \\"big questions\\" , but resolves that mans power over other beings is our ability to continue to question what we don't know-even if we never find the answer. The mirroring effect that the dual story-one of a Holocaust survivor, the other of a Psychotherapist-gives is theory the advantage of applicability. It is fascinating to see what experiences mold the mind of a man who studies the mind. To anyone interested in the nature of nature I greatly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The original purpose-filled motivational book and a timeless masterpiece.Viktor Frankl was a Jewish neurologist, psychiatrist, and philosopher, whose work was interrupted by the advent of World War II.There are two sections to the English edition of this book. The first is an account of Viktor Frankl's experiences in four different concentration camps, (but often just referred to as Auschwitz).As a psychiatrist, he objectively analyzes the motivation and behaviors of everyone in the camps; prisoners and captors alike. Surprisingly, not all prisoners are \\"good\\", and not all captors are \\"bad\\".The second half of this book explains Logotherapy, defined as healing through finding meaning. It was dubbed the third Viennese school of psychotherapy. Rather than Freud's pleasure principle or Adler's power principle, Logotherapy is based on the principle that finding a meaning in one's life is the most important and powerful force for all human beings.\\"There is nothing in the world that can so much enable a person to overcome outer difficulties and inner troubles as the awareness of having a mission in life.\\"Is it possible to find meaning in the camps? Viktor claims meaning can be found in three ways; through love; through work or deeds; and through suffering. This book proves his theories.\\"Ever more people today have the means to live, but no meaning to live for.\\"This is the best book I have ever read, and re-read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book presents the whole spectrum of what a human being is capable of. From kindness to cruelty, from empathy to indifference to others, it is all there in Viktor Frankl's recollections of his concentration camp experiences. He is concerned with presenting the three stages that concentration camp prisoners go through, and what can be learned from those stages.The book consists of two parts. The first half deals with his experiences in the concentration camp. The second part deals with the form of psychotherapy that he created called Logotherapy.Every form of psychotherapy has a particular emphasis. For example, Rational Emotive Therapy emphasizes rational thinking as the key to improving mental health. In Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy, the emphasis is on the individual finding meaning in his or her life. To quote Dr. Frankl, \\"According to Logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.\\" There is no one ultimate abstract meaning of life, but very personal meanings of life. Dr. Frankl argues that even in the most difficult experiences that life can present to a person, that person can choose to find a meaning in that suffering. His life was a shining example of that truth.Here are a few reasons why I admire Dr. Frankl. He had the opportunity to emigrate to the United States, and thus be spared the concentration camp experiences, but chose to remain with his parents. He rejected the idea of \\"collective guilt.\\" He could have emigrated after the war to almost any country, but chose to stay in Austria and devote himself to the patients there. He could have been bitter, but he chose to be giving. Having lost all of his family, he married again. In short, he chose love and responsibility all along the way.The prisoners at the concentration camp were stripped of everything that gave them dignity. Each was assigned a number. Dr. Frankl's number was 119,104. I suspect that if a number could feel, then the number 119,104 would feel honored to have been assigned to such a one as Dr. Viktor E. Frankl."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl's narrative brings me face to face with Nazi concentration camp: the abhorring degradation of fellow human beings, mass murdering, barbaric treatment of prisoners. Yet, human souls were able to seek comfort in natural beauty in such unbearable existence. Ultimately the book is about triumph, particularly spiritual triumph despite all the suffering one went through. If a person can emerge from such experience: being stripped naked, taken away all possessing, being beaten and starved, doing harsh labor in the bitter winter, facing arbitrary death in every moment, later learned that his parents and wife were all killed in gas chamber, but coming out compassionate, forgiving and becoming a successful doctor and author (publishing 30 books afterwards), how can we not marvel at human resilience?The eventual survival of Frankl may be due to luck (not boarding the last train), his own social smart (avoiding offending prison guards, befriending the foremen), and kindness from fellow prisoners (extra bread saved, joint escape attempt). But it also crucially depended on his spiritual strength and holding on to the final hope. He called this search of \\"meaning of suffering\\". By assigning meaning to his suffering, he then would not fall prey to bitter disappointment when liberation did come at an expected date, while a fellow prisoner lost hope and died. In other words, Frankl found a way to maintain eternal hope. It is this hope enables him to stand strong despite any suffering or disappointment.In the last chapter, Frankl offered an invaluable explanation on logotherapy. Its methodology is enlightening, much similar to what Anthony Robbins has preached all along in his seminar. Humans need \\"meaningful goals\\" to feel happy.Each of us goes through life with unique experience. No one can repeat that experience for us. Even our suffering is unique. Thus the meaning of our life is put upon us instead of us searching for it. It is how we answer life, in our unique way.The bare truth of concentration camp, the honesty and the compassion deeply touches me. There is no self pity or hatred. Instead you experience a deep sense of beauty in this writing. All you feel is a much larger understanding for human existence and the ultimate triumph of human spirit.How can we feel despair when men endured and survived concentration camp? Even if the world problem is daunting, Frankl said, \\"the world may be in a bad state, but everything will become worse unless each of us does his best\\". As horrible as Nazi concentration camp is, Frankl lived to tell the story, to share his experience. All those who died did not die in vain. Ultimately goodness and justice, and human spirits triumph in this world."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has information I hadn't seen anywhere else and the author interpreted his experience well. Frankl was sincere in his account and lucid explanation of the search for meaning. I intend to listen to this book (I got the CD format) many more times.Because there was so much information that was new to me, I really have to listen again. For example, Frankl said sensitive individuals tended to last longer in the concentration camp that less sensitive inmates. This is exactly the opposite of what I expected. The reason given is that sensitivity helped people to retreat to an inner spiritual life and thereby provided strength.Frankl's views on the importance of love stands out. He felt that it was the strongest force in our world and through it we would in a sense never really die. He discovered this in a time when he would talk to his wife while suffering in the camp. He had no way of knowing his wife had been killed already, and he felt her presence as if she were alive. To do this point justice, I'd have to quote Frankl verbatim and at length.One of the lasting impressions of the story and the interpretation has to do with the futility of trying to control one's fate as opposed to being true to one's innermost feelings. At several turns, Frankl would have perished if he had taken choices that seemed correct for purposes of survival and yet didn't feel right to him.I recommend this book to every one, because we all suffer since there is no escape from suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression. I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion.

I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression.

The gist of the book is, no matter your circumstances, you are responsible for your experience. That is singularly one of the most powerful truths. When we realize we are responsible for our lives and experiences, we will discover the gift of power. You want to have a happy productive life, create it. We are not the victims of our circumstances as Viktor Frankl writes, and if anyone realized that, it was Viktor Frankl. Do yourself a favor and read this book, then pass the book along to someone that will appreciate it's value."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Well, everyone knows this is a classic. It surely is a great (and very short) book. The first part of the book (\\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\") is not that easy to read. Great is its content and profound is its ideas, it is nevertheless slightly fragmentary - but given the fact that Dr Frankl wrote it in only nine successive days, and within months after his liberation from the camp, it is understandable; indeed this just adds to its authenticity. The second part of the book \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", written presumably in 1962, is more organized, at least comparatively speaking. Some of the terms and even ideas might sound out-dated, but this surely does not diminish it greatness.His ideas are protean and not restricted to merely an unconditional \\"belief\\" in life's meaningfulness. In fact, as Dr Frankl reminded us, there is no such thing as a single and unified \\"meaning of life\\". This varies from person to person and vitally also changes from time to time even intra-personally. Everyone, because of his possession of self-determination (i.e. free will), has the responsibility to choose the right action and even more crucially the right ATTITUDE when dealt with a situation or a set of circumstances. It is because of this ultimate freedom, the freedom to choose, that man can retain his \\"meaning\\" and dignity under the most devastating catastrophe. In short, I quote Dr Frankl, \\"it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us\\" (note that he wrote this in 1945, sixteen years before JFK's inaugural speech). Implicit in the book, although hard to explain (and does it or can it be explained anyway?), is the importance of love (not self-love though) - a medical practitioner myself, I was honestly moved by his reliquishing the chance to escape because he could not bear abandoning his patients in the camp.The importance and the possibilty of freedom is illustrated by a very touching story of the SS commander of Dr Frankl's own camp who privately and secretly bought medicine \\"from his own pocket\\" for the inmates. It was even more endearing that right after the liberation of the camp, he was protected by his former Jewish immates.I cannot help but to finish this short review by quoting Nietzsche (whom in turn Dr Frankl quotes) - \\"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To find this book at the exact time I was struggling to find a reason for my life, to me, was no coincidence.This book, to use the cliche, changed my life.

We are shaped by the past, but we must live for the future.And I must comment on a previous review, you missed the point Frankl was making entirely, when telling the man who's wife had died about the reason for his experiencing pain.

The book is in excellent condition and I would not hesitate in using your services again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Jewish German psychiatrist, Viktor Frankl, fathered the \\"Third School of Viennese Psychiatry,\\" known \\"logotherapy.\\" This book introduces his philosophy as he tells the gripping account of his three years in the Nazi death camps World War II.Frankl wrote seventeen volumes in German on the principles of logotherapy which he weaves into this short book, so it is difficult to summarize his philosophy in a review! Nevertheless, most basic to logotherapy is Frankl's strong conviction that man is responsible. I agree. Unfortunately, the great defect of Frankl's system is the lack of objective ground given for this responsibility! Humans are responsible, yes. But to what or who? Frankl fails to answer this. Logotherapy is then essentially a humanized moralism-better than the nihilism which was bred by Neitzsche,but still short of what men really need.The following paragraph represents the strength and contribution of logotherapy to the field of psychiatrics: \\"We who lived inconcentration camps can remember the men who walked through huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"This is also the essence of the proactivity which Stephen Covey commends in Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, the book in which I first learned of Frankl. In and of itself, this concept is good. But concepts cannot be divorced from a world-view. And a world-view which isn't built on objective reality is faulty.According to Frankl, the basic motivation in man is \\"the striving to find a meaning in one's life\\" - notice he says a meaning, and not meaning. He didnt' believe it was possible to define meaning generally for all people: \\"The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\"Frankl's attempt to relieve the \\"existential frustration\\" of human beings fails to deliver right here; for though a subjectively perceived meaning may help a person endure suffering (as it did him), this meaning may have no objective ground in reality, and thus be REALLY meaningless after all, leaving the person deluded and deceived. Frankl says, \\"self-actualization cannot be attained if it is made an end in itself, but only as a side-effect of self-transcendence.\\" But is not self-transcendence impossible if there is no objective reality which is transcendent?! Logotherapy leaves us to ourselvs after all.According to Frankl's philosphy, one can discover meaning in life in one of three ways: \\"by doing a deed, by experiencing a value [such as love], or by suffering.\\" Unfortunately, logotherapy fails to connect deeds, experiences, or suffering to anything objective; God is virtually absent.Having said all of this, commendable in the book is Frankl's conviction that liberty be balanced with responsibility: \\"freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. That is why I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\\" True.I also commend Frankl's rejection of pure naturalism:\\"there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \`nothingbutness,' the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of man makes him into a robot, not a human being. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\" Thus, Darwin and Freud both suffer from Frankl's analysis.Of interest is Frankl's description of logotherapy as a technique, where he discusses \\"anticipatory anxiety\\" and its cure, \\"parodoxical intention.&quot; This sounded a lot like reverse psychology to me!I'm not a psychiatrist or the son of a psychiatrist,but I am a pastor, a theologian, and an amateur philosopher; and in my judgment, Frankl leaves us with some helpful principles, but they are like a beautiful superstructure with no foundation, and thus, shaky. Man's search for meaning will ultimately fail if it does't terminate in the purpose for which human beings are created,namely, \\"to glorify God and enjoy Him forever.\\" Though Frankl has some good thoughts, I still prefer Saint Augustine who prayed to God: \\"Thou hast made us for thyself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in Thee.\\" That is where meaning in life is ultimately found."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I love the book.

The Doctor decribes this as how are thought patterns can make us or break us in intense situations. How some prisoners lost all hope and eventually died or got sick. And how some just continued to hope and made it. It tries to describe the meaning of life that man is always asking himself.

Because Victor was a Jew, he and his family were persecuted and his wife and child were murdered in the Holocaust. Now he survived, he decided to remain in Vienna where he spoke German much to the nerve of his fellow Holocaust survivors. Unlike all the other books about the Holocaust, Victor shows both inhumanity and humanity. He explains the prisonlike atmosphere and the politics of the system in order to survive. Yes, they did horrible things and horrible things happened for somebody to survive much like Victor who worked as a doctor. Frankel tries to determine what the pain, suffering and horror of the HOlocaust was all about. He brings color to the German Nazis and well criticizes his fellow prisoners who would sell their own out to survive. We will never know unless we have been there ourselves. For Frankl, he tries to do something positive out of the most horrible situation of the last century. He died around the time of two other notable world figures, Mother Theresa and Princess Diana. In their own way, they did something positive for humanity that most of us will never get to do. Mother Theresa's death was not unexpected but she should have gotten a lot more press than Princess Diana whose death was a shocker and Victor Frankl who died after living a long life surviving the ultimate horror of death and the joy of living afterwards. This book is one of the most important books you will read about the HOlocaust, about life, and about living."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a classic.

The idea behind this book is that, when man has lost everything, there is still something they can pursue in their mind, there is still something which he they can look forward to.Coming from his own experience in the concentration camps, there was something he was looking for, even when he had lost everything in life and there was nothing else to look forward other than to be gassed. He also motivated his comrades to look for something - to search for a meaning in life and to isolate their minds from the external happenings.As a general read, it is worth reading, it gets us thinking in new lines.But is it applicable to give new hope to people ? Can it motivate a terminally ill cancer patient to look for something ?What would have Lance Armstrong have to say about logotherapy ? I think Lance would have acknowledged it - having recovered from cancer to become a champion again. Again it is all about finding new meaning/new hopes to continue and sustain life, even in the brink of hopelessness."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl's narrative begins with an especially long, detailed account of his horrific experiences in the infamous Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. Frankl assesses the various stages one endures upon being imprisoned in a camp. He contests that the stages can be categorized into three phases: \\"the period following his admission; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation.\\" He goes on to examine the symptoms that characterize each phase. The first phase, he asserts, is identified by \\"shock.\\" He describes the horrific journey, \\"everyone's heart missed a beat at the moment. Auschwitz-the very name stood for all that was horrible...\\"The second phase detailed in the narrative is one of \\"relative apathy in which he achieved a kind of emotional death.\\" Frankl describes his experiences as a physician treating members of the camp diagnosed with typhus. He recounts the death of a patient and how he watched with no emotion as the other prisoners robbed the still-warm corpse of whatever could potentially be of use to them. Additionally, he describes the body being carried away with no emotion, \\"the man with the corpse approached the steps. Wearily he dragged himself up. Then the body: first the feet, then the trunk, and finally-with an uncanny rattling noise-the head of the corpse bumped up the two steps.\\" He later elaborates by further assessing the distinguishing features of the second phase, \\"if my lack of emotion had not surprised be from the standpoint of professional interest, I would not remember this incident now, because there was so little feeling involved in it.\\"Finally, he concludes that the final phase is distinguished by a prisoner's release from the concentration camp, \\"'freedom,' we repeated to ourselves, and yet we could not grasp it.\\" He contests that while liberation from the camp was to be a joyous occasion, the prisoner's had difficulty feeling pleasure, he explains that psychologically, what was happening to the prisoner's was known as \\"depersonalization,\\" in other words, they found it hard to believe that the events unfolding around them were real. He also reminds the reader that even the period following liberation saw survivors lusting for vengeance, or seeing no meaning to their lives when their entire families had been murdered.Though \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" is certainly the longest portion of the book, \\"Logotherapy In a Nutshell\\" formally introduces Frankl's \\"school of thought.\\" The term \\"logotherapy\\" is derived from \\"logos\\" the Greek word for meaning. Frankl believes that the most effective therapy for many individuals is to discover the essential purpose of their lives. Frankl believes that the origins of so many self-destructive patterns and behaviors lie in an individual's \\"existential frustration,\\" in other words, their inability to seek out the meaning in their lives.Frankl asserts that Freudian-style psychoanalysis is faulty in that it spends a disproportionate amount of energy searching for the origins of \\"neuroses.\\" On the contrary, Logotherapists help their patients find the meaning in their lives, subsequently fostering an onward-looking method to therapy. Though Psychoanalysis often reduces meaning and values to sheer \\"defense mechanisms,\\" Frankl responds, \\"I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my defense mechanisms.\\" In addition, Frankl argues that logotherapy is a much more realistic response to the human state in that it seeks to establish an appropriate conflict between a person's current circumstance in life and his or her goals.In conclusion, Frankly objectively assesses how he used Logotherapy to overcome the mental traumas of life in a concentration camp and encourages individuals to apply his findings to their own lives. While there are many distinctions between traditional Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy, it is certain that one could potentially reap many rewards from considering Frankl's findings."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you were assigned to read this book in school years ago, maybe you can't remember what all the fuss is about.

Situations where finding the power to cope and find meaning seem to be pointless. The author describes how he found the emotional strength to survive the concentration camps and come out to be a man who is not broken by circumstances. I couldn't relate to all of his advice but I will remember one thing that the author advised. When in an unbelievably dire and hopeless situation and all other meaning is lost, you can find meaning in suffering and dying with dignity. When all bets are off, you shouldn't lose your humanity."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This was a very moving story and outlook on life.

For those of us who sometimes question, &#34;what is the meaning of life?&#34;, Frankl gives us thoughts to ponder. Life is more meaningful when one has a passion about something or someone. The different view of the Nazi concentration camps was enlightening for me; the people banded together and protected one another even when the only thing left to them was the prospect of yet another day of suffering. Perhaps finding a passion or reason to live is the solution to depression treatment; perhaps more effective than drug therapies."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had to read this book for a Leadership Class for my work.

Viktor Frankl's accounts are intense and disturbing, but only by description in service of his supporting how finding purpose in the darkest circumstances can for for the human spirit, and ultimately survival. It is not a book about the suffering and the horror. In fact, his writing about his years in the camps offers a perspective that few could ever come to on their own. His conviction that a fulfilled life comes from finding meaning in what one does, day to day, is convincing and I have seen it played out in my life, with my friends, and in my work time and time again. It is not a treatise on finding an overarching meaning for one's life as a whole &#8211; that would be overwhelming &#8211; and he insists not possible until our death.

Having been interested in the human condition and psychology and philosophy for my entire life, this book is extremely interesting on all levels. It is a true story of Viktor Frankl's own internment in the Nazi German concentration camps brought to the world as a first-hand account of the experiences and conclusions of a learned and brilliant psychologist, who went from respected professional to holocaust prisoner to holocaust survivor. He has turned his brilliant mind to analysis of the experience from a perspective that no other mere researcher could ever achieve.It is moving, horrifying, and educational.

Just the 1st section on Frankl's experience in the death camps is full of inspiration. It is somewhat disturbing to be faced with the inhumanity we all have potential to act out. But the lessons Frankl learned and that we can learn from today are worth the book at twice the price. The 2nd half of the book is less exciting but eminently profound. Reading about Frankl's method of therapy is very instructive for anyone's life.

I first read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" (\\"'''' '''' ''''''\\") during my military service and I recall it making a great impression on me. Reading it now, more than twenty years later, it is still a remarkably moving and impressive book (especially given how short it is).In concise and somewhat dry prose, without resorting to over dramatisation, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a Holocaust survivor. He asks a basic question: how can the concentration camp experience help explain why people hang on to life. Frankl uses the experiences from the concentration camps, perhaps the worst possible place for a human being to believe and hang on to life, in order to formulate a psychotherapeutic method in finding a reason to live (Logotherapy). He describes the three stages a typical concentration camp prisoner goes through - shock, apathy and disillusionment - and concludes that regardless of the hardships every person finds a reason to live. For one person it might be God or religion; for another it might be a beloved one waiting for him on the outside; for yet another it might be some personal goal that still needs to be accomplished. Whatever the reason, humans find a way to hang on to life in the worst possible circumstances.Frankl's basic conclusion is that basic tenement of Jewish faith: freedom of choice (although Frankl did not frame his theory in any religious terms). Ultimately, regardless of the conditions of life, freedom of choice remains the one determining factor of how a person will live. And Frankl says that the right choice to make in order to have a meaningful life is to help others find their meaning of life, to be a decent person, a mentsch. His examples of decent \\"good\\" Nazis and indecent \\"bad\\" prisoners illustrate how this personal choice can make all the difference.It is no wonder \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is considered one of the most influential books on the 20th century."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Two copies were received promptly and in good condition.

The book is about making personal choices of how you want to define a situation and taking responsibility for the life that you give meaning to in each and every moment.I realise now that when I am faced with a challenge I decide how I want to perceive it and to turn the challenge into an opportunity to grow and change as a person. When I see the TV news about how bad things are economically and the so called crisis in the world and then compare today's events with the authors experiences in the death camps and how he found meaning in spite of it all - I know I can change my outlook and find opportunity in spite of what the media says."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"What's there to say ....... ought to be required reading in every school (if it isn't already)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Excellent book about survival and life approach.

It's a great, inspirational read, including personal stories of spiritual survival. -Was happy to see it's still in print."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Victor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a powerful reflection on his experiences in Nazi death camps where he observes Man in his best and worst capacities. In fact, it was first published in 1946 as \\"A Psychologist Experiences the Concentration Camp\\", a much more descriptive title. While it may seem Frank's manifesto was born of his imprisonment during middle age, by his late teens he had already begun formulating a thesis that the quest for meaning is the key to mental health. Ironically, his horrific experience in the camps offered him the opportunity to test his hypothesis.The book was disappointing in its presentation. The text was relatively short at 165 pages, but it was not an easy read. The first part, which focused on Frankl's experience in concentration camps, was approximately 100 pages with no chapters or headers or organization in the narrative itself. The second part was Frankl's introduction to his \\"logotherapy\\" derivative of psychotherapy, and it is very academic in nature. A postscript and afterward follow. There was some notable redundancy throughout, and one might imagine the four sections were pulled from four separate sources.But the unique observations expressed here belie the presentation. In a sad, evil place where \\"reality dimmed and all efforts and emotions were centered on one task: preserving one's own life\\" and the best inhabitants could hope for was \\"negative happiness-freedom from suffering\\", Frankl models the behavior of himself, his peers, and his captors.Amid the pain, squalor, and certainty of death (Frankl stated his chances of survival at 1 in 28) in the prisons, Frankl adopted and articulated a stoic pride and respect for his predicament. For \\"without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete\\". He states that man must come to understand that \\"no one can relieve him of suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way he bears his burden\\". He wrote \\"Suffering became a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We realized its hidden opportunities for achievement\\". For \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way\\".For Frankl and his companions in the throes of despair, the search for the meaning of life became singular. Frankl's answer, poignant if not hopeful: \\"We needed to stop asking ourselves the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and right conduct\\".Happiness cannot be achieved, it can only ensue. \\"One must have a reason to \`be happy'\\", and then they can achieve optimism despite the \\"Tragic Triad\\" of suffering, guilt, and death. Frankl frequently refers to Nietzsche's philosophy of \\"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How\\".In \\"Meaning\\", readers will find some unique aphorisms and behavioral theories validated by the most rigorous testing imaginable. \\"In the concentration camps...in this living laboratory and testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"how have i lived for 33 years without reading this book?the ideas are inspiring by their merit, and even more so in response to the indescribable horror of the holocaustand it's short, viktor frankl wrote it in just 9 days. you can read it in a few hours and start finding more meaning in your lifeone paragraph on page 108 summarizes frankl's overall approach very nicely ->\\"i doubt whether a doctor can answer [the meaning of life] question in general terms. for the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. what matters, therefore, is not the meaning of a person's life at a given moment. to put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: 'tell me, master, what is the best move in the world?' there simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game and the particular personality of one's opponent. the same holds for human existence. one should not search for an abstract meaning of life. everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. thus, everyone's task is as unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.\\"if you are intrigued by the ideas in this paragraph, i highly recommend reading the book. frankl offers us compelling and concrete suggestions along with extraordinary examples of people creatively, lovingly and responsibly finding meaning in their \\"very real and concrete\\" lives"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an very intense book about life and the human spirit.

He encourages his patients and readers to live a full life by looking to the future rather than reliving the past.Quotation: \\"Self-transcendence of human existence: Being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfil or another human being to encounter.

Such a victory of human will!I bought this as a Kindle and then purchased a &#34;paper&#34; copy so that my (adult) children could read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was read many years ago at a time when this reviewer felt nearly crushed under the weight of family and personal troubles. It is not light and diverting reading; indeed, in part it is terrifying. Yet the memory of it has persisted across all these years.A prominent psychiatrist in pre-World War II Vienna, Doctor Frankl found himself suddenly stripped of all money, possessions, position, respect, and ultimately, his family--including his pregnant and beloved wife. After confinement in some of the smaller concentration camps, he ultimately arrived at Auschwitz--the lowest circle of the man-made Hell that was the system of concentration and extermination camps (in German, 'Konzentrationslager' and 'Vernichtungslager'). There, his medical skills were not employed until nearly the end of the war. Instead, he was employed at hard labor just like the rest of the men in his prison block who were marched every day to their work site before dawn and marched back late at night.The most striking thing about Frankl's account of his imprisonment (to me at least) was not the backbreaking work, the all-pervading fear, nor even the constant, maddening hunger; but the unrelenting degradation of the prisoners in order to get them to accept the Nazi's judgment of them as sub-human. For example, when carrying heavy tanks filled with human sewage for disposal, almost inevitably some would splash prisoners full in the face. Any move to wipe one's face, or even show instinctive grimaces of disgust would be punished by the Capos (trusted prisoners, chosen mostly for their brutality) with a prompt beating from a club or whip. Because of this, the normal reactions of prisoners to being befouled were soon suppressed. Every attempt possible was made to degrade the prisoners by the (frequently delighted) SS guards and the Capos. Subjected to this treatment, some prisoners gave up hope and committed suicide by running into the inner electric fence that encircled the camp. Others would lie motionless in their bunks in their own waste--ignoring pleas to get up from fellow prisoners, and blows from guards alike--smoking up all of the cigarettes they might have been saving for barter.Faced with this, Frankl combated this potential demoralization in himself and others by leading the prisoners back to their own humanity. \\"Every freedom may be taken away from a man but one; the freedom to choose what attitude he will take towards his conditions.\\" Despite every attempt to rob them of human dignity, prisoners still had a choice. Would they take an attitude of 'I die tomorrow; you die today' and behave as starving beasts--stealing other prisoner's food, for example; or would they show that they were neither animals nor things, but human beings? Some Amazon reviews of an earlier edition of this book seemed to imply that Frankl had judged those who despaired and died to be weak, or that he was somehow 'better' than they for having survived. Those reviewers can only have done this by forgetting what they had read. Frankl instead writes with sorrow that \\"the best of us did not survive\\", warmly remembering comrades who ended their days offering comfort and sometimes their last bit of bread to fellow prisoners.We live in an age when the feeling that one's life is meaningless is rampant even compared to the recent past. Many compensate by drowning themselves in their career; working fourteen hour days, always gabbing into their cell phone, and carrying their laptop everywhere so they can do some work even in what would be an idle moment. Others escape into escapist and/or authoritarian religion, gladly handing over the miserable burden of their freedom and the need to find meaning to someone else. (Frankl--an observant Jew throughout his life--was not anti-religious I should point out. He writes that a therapist's attempts to debunk genuine religious or spiritual views are an unethical attempt to force the therapist's views on a client.) Still others use alcohol and/or drugs (including perfectly legal drugs)as a response to a sense of life's meaninglessness or futility.Frankl writes that our struggle--even our despair--over finding meaning in our lives is not an psychiatric illness, or even a precursor to one. Potential readers of this book will not find \\"The Meaning of Life\\". What they will find is the story of a man who was compelled to develop the tools to find his own meaning, his 'why'--at a time when his life depended on it in a way seldom seen in life and history. Hopefully, these tools will benefit others as they have benefited me. As someone wrote of Ralph Waldo Emerson, \\"He did not try to lead others to himself, but to themselves.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Hitler had occupied Austria when Viktor Frankl, a young Viennese psychiatrist and writer, learned that the United States had approved his request to immigrate. His parents were overjoyed --- their son would escape the Nazis, go off to America and continue his brilliant work.Frankl was feeling guilty about leaving his parents when he noticed a piece of marble on a table at home. What was it? His father said it was a piece of the largest synagogue in Vienna, burned by the Nazis. On it was a fragment of the Ten Commandments --- the part about honoring thy father and mother.Rock covers paper. Frankly decided to stay in Vienna and look after his parents. As if that were possible! Before the war was over, the Nazis imprisoned Frankl, his pregnant wife, his brother and his parents. All but Frankl perished.In 1945, in just nine days, Frankl wrote \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" It has sold tens of millions of copies, been published in dozens of languages --- for many, it's been a life-changer. Somehow, I missed every opportunity to read it. Just as well. My younger selves might have missed the profundity of this short, simple book.Frankl's message is simple: Life can be terrible. But there is one power you alone possess --- the power to decide what you think about your situation. If you think there is a point to your suffering and if you can imagine your life on the other side of it, you are searching for meaning. More, you are finding meaning, for the very act of searching ennobles you. Achievements can pile up, riches may come your way --- none of that matters. The search is everything.For Frankl, the search for meaning is both a philosophy and an attitude. Going into a concentration camp, he knew what the odds were --- 90% of the people on his transport train would die, most within a few hours of arriving at Auschwitz. And this led him to his first breakthrough: \\"I struck out my whole former life.\\"Auschwitz became his teacher. He had no fear of death; the gas chambers spared him the thought of suicide. He learned to look eager for work; if you want to live, you have to be useful. And then he learned The Secret. Let him tell it:We stumbled on in the darkness, over big stones and through large puddles, along the one road running through the camp. The accompanying guards kept shouting at us and driving us with the butts of their rifles. Anyone with very sore feet supported himself on his neighbor's arm. Hardly a word was spoken; the icy wind did not encourage talk. Hiding his hand behind his upturned collar, the man marching next to me whispered suddenly: \\"If our wives could see us now! I do hope they are better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us.\\"That brought thoughts of my own wife to mind. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another on and upward, nothing was said, but we both knew: each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky, where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile, her frank and encouraging look. Real or not, her look then was more luminous than the sun which was beginning to rise.A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth -- that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is through love and in love.I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world may still know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when a man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way--an honorable way--in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment. For the first time in my life, I was able to understand the words, \\"The angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory.\\"Those are easy words to write in the comfort of the coffeehouse, surrounded by attractive people who have the dual luck of health and wealth. But to feel this way after being shipped to four concentration camps and losing your loved ones --- that's something else.Yes, Frankl was lucky, and he knows it; as he says, \\"The best among us did not return.\\" But the lucky did. Indeed, only the lucky did. And isn't a great part of luck the irrational belief of a better future?Like all concentration camp memoirs, Frankl's is one horror after another. But unlike almost all others, his memoir is dotted with remarkable scenes. Like the time a block warden, at a very low point in the war, asks Frankl to speak to the inmates. Frankl reminds them that all they have lost can be achieved again. And then he says something at once shocking and inspiring: \\"Human life, under any circumstances, never ceases to have meaning.\\" Even hopelessness offers a kind of dignity. If we act well in dire straits, we honor God --- we show that, even as we are killed, we maintain our dignity. That was some sermon....Days after the war ended, Viktor Frank walked out of the camp and into the countryside. He listened to the birds sing; he felt the expanse of earth and sky. He did not yet know that the wife he thought of constantly was dead. He had just one sentence running through his head: \\"I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and he answered me in the freedom of space.\\" And with that, Frankl walked into his future.Why read \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" now? Because we live in an age of weak excuses and phony explanations and very few people stepping forward to take responsibility for anything. In this appalling time, Viktor Frankl reminds us that what we do and how we think about it actually matter. He tells us that, even on a crowded planet, every life is important. He makes us stand tall and see clearly and think straight and want to do right.It doesn't get much simpler than that, does it?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've always found it rather a clich&eacute; to say that a book has the power to change one's life. However, of any book that I've ever read, Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning has come very close to doing so. For the first time, I have found a desire to read and re-read an individual book, and have already asked others to read it as well. While it would be a tad exaggerated to say that it actually changed my life, I can say that it has had some powerful effects on my perspective on life. For the most part, it has reinforced my existing beliefs, but it has also made many things clearer for me, including the importance of one's search for meaning in life. I found many parallels in Frankl's Logotherapy to William Glasser's Choice Theory, but Frankl's views were really more profound in many ways, due partly to his account of life in a concentration camp, and partly to his ties to existentialism.Frankl's portrayal of life in the concentration camp moved me in many ways, and on more than one occasion while reading the book. From the beauty he was able to find in unexpected moments within the hellish world of a concentration camp, to his ability to remove himself from the experience in the most humble manner, Frankl portrayed a life of suffering and anguish beyond words as having rays of hope, and even, for some, a sense of meaning. This is simply remarkable, providing for the reader a new sense of perspective on all aspects of life. Additionally, Frankl's explanations of the psychological stages of an inmate are truly enlightening. Honestly, I find it difficult to find the words to describe the first portion of the book. While it is both informative and illuminating with regard to life in a concentration camp, it is also poignant and truly inspiring, written from a different perspective than most accounts of the same subject matter."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl tackles a lot of ground in a short space, looking deeply into the profound question of meaning in our lives from the perspective of a Nazi concentration camp survivor.The first half of this book is a recounting of the authors' experiences as an inmate in various Nazi death camps. My skin crawled reading about the brutality and inhumanity he tells us of. I've heard and read a lot about the concentration camps before, but this first hand experience was very powerful. Frankl had already developed his psychological theory before the internment, so he tells us how his experiences essentially confirmed his view that humans have a need to find personal meaning. He recounts numerous stories from the camps of how hope for the future kept him and his comrades alive. Frankl describes how the prisoners were able to create dreams and plans for the future in order to stay sane and keep their will to live in an environment where it was very easy to give up. What I got out of his recounting of the horrors of the death camps was that even though the Nazi's took away almost all of the basic human necessities we are used to in life, and brutalized their prisoners, they weren't able to control the minds of those imprisoned. We each have the ability to control our own thoughts no matter what the situation - this is our power.The second half of the book delves into Frankl's formal psychological theory he terms &quot;Logotherapy&quot;. He says traditional psychotherapy looks into our past to find cures for current psychological problems. His Logotherapy on the other hand he says helps people through finding hope for the future by getting in touch with the meaning in their lives. I felt his argument was in some ways simplistic in that he suggests those who are depressed and/or suicidal have lost a personal meaning to life - and that they need to find it. That much is probably already evident to the suicidal patient - they already know they have nothing to live for. Telling them to &quot;go find meaning to your life&quot; is surely good advice, but kind of obvious. How do you do it? Frankl does have some suggestions however.I felt that overall this was a compelling read that challenges the reader to consider what role personal meaning has in their life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of my favourite books. It is really two books in one. The first is an account of the author's imprisonment in Auschwitz, and the insights he gained into the individual's search for meaning in suffering while there, and the second book is a more detailed introduction to &quot;Logotherapy&quot;. Frankl does not deny the usefulness of Jung's or Freud's work, but he does not stop there -- he continues where they left off. His brand of pychology he calls &quot;logotherapy&quot; -- or &quot;meaning therapy&quot;. In this sort of analysis, he tries to get the individual to look at their present life rather than examing complexes, phobias or dreams. Many people who are unsatisfied in their lives can trace this to a nagging sense of meaning starvation. This can be overcome, in Frankl's view. He doesn't give any very good ideas as to how one is to go about doing this in much detail, but then again, this is just an introductory text. The problem of meaning is a topic that also embraces a religious perspective on life, and it may be of interest to those who wish to pursue this further. It is a very inspirational book and contains many helpful insights for those who are struggling with any sort of suffering, pain, or grief, which they are powereless to combat. In such cases, Frankl suggests, one's only positive action may to be to endure the suffering in the right way, and to find meaning and worth in pain. This seems important to me, because life is not all happiness . . . the bad times as well as the good must be redeemed as worthwhile for an individual to feel a true sense of life's worth. Hopefully, in the future, Frankl's ideas will gain more prominence as they seem to offer more promise than most other forms of psychological theories do. A very powerful read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl deserves the highest respect, much as Nelson Mandela does today although the severity of the experience would have been somewhat harsher but less daunting in time. Frankl's book covers two main aspects in his title: Search for Meaning, the first details his experiences in Auschwitz, one of the worst concentration camps used by the Nazis and controlled by the SS. The second part of the book outlines his own way of psychotherapy entitled Logotherapy, refering to the Greek word Logos, in this case related to meaning. It approaches the process of psychotherapy in a completely different way from that of Freud.It's the first part of the book which completely captures the reader, its simply unputdownable, Frankl's suffering in the camps is remarkable in the sense of the humanity he talks of rather than the more than obvious horrors he must have been exposed to. The camp changed him as a human being or rather, one feels, that Frankl grows into his own humanity expanding what was already there in potential form as he reminds the reader that his early Logotherapy manuscript was with him in the camp, although lost. It is edifying that he returns from the camp in a spirit of underlying trust in humanity's ability to, so to speak, save itself.In the second part he describes Logotherapy and the techniques used to put it into practice. The therapy deals with the search for meaning in a person's life and the lack of it in present society. This has of course been even more exacerbated in current times compared with the more moderate version of the 50's and 60's of Frankl's era. It is in fact remarkable that this kind of therapy has not taken over from other forms given its obvious improvement over older more mechanical and less human forms of therapy.Its a remarkable work deserving of the highest respect."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going? These are questions that confront humankind each day. Without the answers to these questions, a person may find their life void of purpose or joy. This book does not answer any of those questions, but reminds you of the importance of getting the answer to the second and third questions.Before reading the book I felt I had a pretty good grasp on my own answers for the three questions of life. However, Dr. Frankl made me specify my answers. I needed a mission, a creed by which I should live my life, a statment by which I could measure each decision in life.Dr. Frankl explains, through his own experience during the Holocaust, that each person has a reason to live. When that reason ceases to exist, that person must either find another reason or be dead emotionally. This story reminds me of the story of Anne Frank. She was doing quite well until she felt that her entire family was dead. She could no longer see a reason to continue fighting the opposition, so she gave up and died shortly after her sister. Had she known or thought her father was still alive, I believe she may have been able to escape sickness and survive her imprisonment.Dr. Frankl encourages you, without preaching, to find THAT reason for you life. What purpose does your life hold? Don't ask what you want out of life, but ask, &quot;What does life want from me?&quot; The key is to find what life wants from you.The holocaust stories will help you see the necessity of answering these questions. Whether you find your life with or without purpose, read this book. It could change your life for the better."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"+++++This book, by Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry (at the University of Vienna Medical School) Dr. Viktor Frankl (1905 to 1997) has five divisions:(1) Preface by Gordon Allport. (Comprises 4 pages.) Allport was formerly a professor of psychology at Harvard. It was mainly through his efforts that Frankl's work was introduced to North America. Here he highlights key aspects of Frankl's book. I agree with him when he says:\\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity [of spending three years at Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps] is a psychiatrist worth listening to. He, if anyone, should be able to view our human condition wisely and with compassion.\\"(2) A recent preface by Frankl where he discusses his book (first published in German in 1946) and other significant matters. (3 pages.) He states the true intention of his book:\\"I...wanted simply to convey to the reader by way of concrete example that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.\\"(3) Frankl's actual book. (130 pages.) It consists of two parts, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" and \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" respectively. (Logotherapy was the psychotherapy developed by Frankl.) More of this division will be explainedbelow.(4) A postscript by Frankl written in 1983 entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\" (15 pages.) This section is very interesting. By tragic optimism Frankl \\"means that one...remains optimistic in spite of [tragedy].\\" He goes on to state that \\"[t]his chapter...raises the question, \`How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of [overwhelming tragedy]?'\\" Even though I disagree with certain parts, it still is packed with wisdom and facts. My favorite piece of information from this section:\\"Austrian...pollsters recently reported that those held in highest esteem by most...people interviewed are neither...great artists nor...great scientists, neither...great statesmen nor...great sports figures, but those who master a hard lot [or hard circumstances] with their head held high.\\"(5) An extensive bibliography of Logotherapy. (40 pages.)Part one (consisting of 85 pages) of Frankl's actual two part book begins with the following:\\"This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events but of [my] personal experiences...It is the inside story [or autobiographical story] of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors.\\"And what a story it is!! This story is not concerned with great horrors (well-documented in other books) but \\"with the multitude of small torments\\" that were endured. Not only does Frankl relate his experiences, but he also details his observations and conclusions based on those observations. He also imparts to the reader his wisdom (not all of which I agree with). Four of my favorite wise sayings that he imparts are:(1) \\"An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.\\"(2) \\"Suffering is [a]...part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"(3) \\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\"(4) \\"No one has the right to do harm, not even if wrong has been done to them.\\"He also passes on to his readers philosophical truths. Two of my favorites come from the philosopher Nietzsche:(1) \\"He who has a WHY to live for can bear almost any HOW.\\"(2) \\"That which does not kill [or destroy] me, makes me stronger.\\"Part two (35 pages) introduces the reader to \\"logotherapy,\\" the theory of psychotherapy developed by Frankl from his experiences in the concentration camp (that were outlined in part one).\\"Logotherapy...focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on [a person's] search for such meaning.\\" Thus, Frankl \\"speak[s] of a will to meaning in contrast to...the will to pleasure on which Freudian psychoanalysis is centered, as well as in contrast to the will to power on which Adlerian psychology...is focused.\\"This part is not difficult to understand and is simply written. Here, Frankl again imparts his wisdom to the reader (not all of which I agree with). Two of my favorite wise sayings are:(1) \\"[A person] should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather [that person] must recognize that it is he [or she] who is asked.\\"(2) \\"The meaning of life always changes, but...it never ceases to be.\\"This part consists of about twenty small, easy-to-read sections. Examples of the titles of these sections include:(1) The Will to Meaning(2) The Meaning of Life(3) The Essence of Existence(4) The Meaning of Suffering(5) The Meaning of LoveIn conclusion, read this life-transforming book and discover for yourself why it has been translated into more than twenty languages, why it has seen nearly one hundred printings in English, and why it is, according to the Library of Congress, \\"One of the ten most influential books in America!!!\\"+++++"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Wow. I work at a bookstore and have always been interested in the psychological and spiritual elements of life, so it was admittedly humbling when a young girl asked me to help her find this million-selling book which I had never heard of. Upon locating it, I looked at it in my hands and asked her what it was about----besides the obvious, that is. She didn't know that much about it herself, except that it had come highly recommended. I made a mental note to pick it up a copy, and did so. I dunno. There was just something about it.... Maybe it was the fact that this book just reeks of brilliance. And even more importantly, LOGIC!!! For something so short, it's amazing that Victor was able to cram so much insight and genius into such a small, riveting piece. From page one, you are enraptured, totally drawn into his grueling first-person account of what it was like to spend years in a concentration camp. Of special interest is it to note that Victor takes great pains not to &quot;overglorify&quot; the events, but instead chooses only to document accounts that were relevant to his learning.The second part of the book illustrates logotherapy, logos actually meaning the word &quot;meaning&quot;. He discusses the existential vaccuum (TV, sex, etc), among other issues. Although enthralled by psychology, I was of course worried this segment would be drier and/or difficult to understand. Fortunately, Frankl is much better at explaining himself than the likes of other fascinating minds (e.g. Jung, etc.), and this part of the book was just as entertaining, since he not only speaks in a language we can all easily understand but also discusses behaviors and scenarios we each face (and struggle with) all the time.One example really stood out to me. He tells of an older, educated man of society who comes to him for help. Apparently this man's wife had died two years prior and he was still having difficulty overcoming the grief and loneliness--the utter depression---he was experiencing. He didn't know what to do. Victor simply asked him what his wife would have done had HE died first. The man quickly assured Victor that she would have been equally distraught and would have suffered greatly. Victor then commended the man on what a tremendous gift he was able to give to his wife in saving her all of that tremendous pain. The expense was, of course, his own pain and suffering, but he was still able to save his beloved wife from going through such a traumatic ordeal, and instead had gone through it FOR her (since one of them was bound to do it at some point!) This man, in five minutes, was healed. And beaming. My grandmother is going through this EXACT scenario, and you can be sure I am sending her a xeroxed, enlarged copy of that part of the book, to say the very least.His work is as equally philosophical as it is psychological--he speaks---NOT &quot;preaches&quot;---of changing one's outlook, which was perhaps the only thing the Germans couldn't rob the Jews of. And afterwards--although he's very careful not to tell anyone that they &quot;should&quot; in fact change their perspective, you can't help but look at things differently---with more acceptance and analysis than you might have otherwise done so. It's very enlightening, riveting, and insightful, and I look forward to exploring more of his mind and works.There is now not a doubt in my mind that the aforementioned customer at the beginning of this review came up to ME looking for that book for a REASON--and that I was supposed to read this book. And the next time she came in, I thanked her profusely as we discussed the book in total awe of what we had read. I can't recommend this book enough---to anyone and everyone. It should be required reading! In fact, I already bought a copy for my friend Rebecca, who just received her masters in psychology, although it would make a great gift for just about anybody.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Of the many thousands of books I have read this is the most important. Frankl survived Auschwitz and derived meaning from the experience. Can we do any less in the face of our own small problems?The book, to a large degree, is based on a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how.\\" It's true, and Frankl's life proves it.Frankl doesn't provide a road map for finding the meaning in every experience. He does something better. He asks us to ask ourselves what our experiences mean. We already know, if only we will stop to think. My favorite example is that of a man who greaves the loss of his wife. Frankl asks him why he greaves. The man answers that he greaves because he loved his wife. Frankl asks him, \\"Isn't that a good thing?\\" A light goes on in the man's mind, he nods, and gets up and leaves. Frankl's book can make a light go on in all of our minds. All we have to do is spend a couple of hours reading this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book in a college course which I am forever grateful for; I would not have read it if I didn't take this course. When it comes to reading a book that affects your life and its meaning, this books sets the standard. It provides a painful and true look into a dark and horrbile time in human history. Instead of standing at the fence and looking into the state of man in a concentration camp, we are offered a view from within the camp and the man. When you consider the survival and the perspective of the author, an actual survivor, life becomes inspiring and full of meaning.As humans we must pay attention to the lessons of history and the wisdom learned by those who lived it. In this case, we are presented with a message wrapped in horror. Yet, the outcome can be inspiration and change.The text is written in direct and simple langauge.

Once I have made that mental connection, I am compelled to discover why that book has influenced so many different people. Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is one of those influential books, and now I know why -- it is one of the best, thought-provoking, and potentially life-changing books I have ever read.Frankl was a Holocaust survivor who used his concentration camp experiences as a laboratory to study the nature and character of man. Frankl went on to become a world-renowned psychiatrist whose thoughts developed a new psychotherapy called logotherapy.Frankl believed man's main concern in life is in fulfilling a meaning that is unique only to him, that each life has its own specific meaning, and that everyone is responsible for his own life and existence.The book was broken down into two complementary chapters, and a postscript (revised edition). In the first chapter, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp,\\" Frankl shared his thoughts and observations as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps. The descriptions of his life and the lives and actions of his fellow prisoners was authentic, yet not as overly graphic as other Holocaust accounts I have read. In the second chapter, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell,\\" Frankl gave a scholarly explanation of logotherapy. While some of the more academic terms and concepts were difficult to understand at first and required me to re-read some sections, he gave sufficient examples that helped me to get his main points.The postscript was titled, \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism,\\" and was based on a lecture Frankl gave in 1983. Frankl defined \\"tragic optimism\\" as \\"...an optimism in the face of tragedy and in view of the human potential which at its best always allows for: (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life's transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.\\" The postscript helped me to better understand some of the more difficult connections between the first two chapters.Throughout this book, I found many spiritual and thought-provoking quotes and passages that made reading it a very personal and reflective experience for me:\\"He who has a 'why' to live can bear with almost any 'how.'\\" Friedrich Nietzsche\\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"\\"Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\"\\"...the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.\\"\\"Man is 'not' fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.\\"\\"Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\\"\\"In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured.\\"I consider my life to be a constant work-in-progress, so this book is on my short list of books that I plan to read again and again to help me keep my life focused and meaningful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I've read numerous books on philosophy and psychology, but of all the books I've read, I would say that this book should be compulsory reading for everyone. Not only does he explore the basic psychological motivation and purpose of our existence, he does it in an unusual way, by describing his own experiences at Auschwitz under Nazi occupation.By giving insight into human behaviour in its most vulnerable and exposed state, he provides us with an insight into our own psyches.It's also a reminder of the extraordinary evil that men can do with very little incentive.

Yet somehow, through providential care, I knew, even as a youngster, that life must have meaning to both the fortunate as well as to the unfortunate, to the rich as the poor, to the privileged as the lowly. This meaning I have long understood. Viktor Frankl has helped me to see, even more clearly, the groaning of life itself, which yearns for meaning and purpose, even in the midst of unimaginable sufferings. Frankl said, \\"For the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into songs by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth-that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry, human thoughts, and belief have to impart: The salvation of man is the through love and in love.\\"My personal discovery has, furthermore, led me see the significance of what Blaise Pascal said with respect to the futility of a life, whose existence is without love, and that the highest expression of this love is ultimately found in God. He said, \\"I see the terrifying immensity of the universe which surrounds me, and find myself, limited to one corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am set down here rather than elsewhere, nor why the brief period for my life is assigned to me at this moment rather than another in all eternity that has gone before and will come after me. On all sides I behold nothing but infinity, in which I am a mere atom, a mere passing shadow that returns no more.\\" Yes, without God, life is a mere existential vacuum in the great cosmos.I am struck with one curiosity about the book. I am not sure why Frankl often quoted Friedrich Nietze. According to historians (Paul Johnson; History of the Jews), Nietzche's philosophy was one of the impetus which brought about the rise of Germanic-centricity, or the attitude that German was a superior race, which tragically led to the horrifying oppression against the Jews."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In terms of usefulness, this is the best book I have ever read.

My advice - quit whining about things, don't buy the stuff off the T.V, just read this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANINGby Dr Viktor FranklI was introduced to an earlier edition of this book after I had watched Joel Barker's video, 'The Power of Vision' during the early nineties.The book captured the author's chilling & yet inspirational story of his personal struggle & eventual triumph against unspeakable horror at the Auschwitz concentration camps. His entire family (His father, mother, brother & his wife) perished in the camps, except for his sister.[Frankly, I did not realise the magnitude of the author's horrendous sufferings - & the Holocaust as a whole - until I personally visited the Auschwitz concentration camps, in the town of Oswiecim, situated about 60 kms from Krakow in southern Poland, with my late wife during the mid-nineties. Auschwitz was actually the German name for the town. I was told by my guide that about 6 million people died in the Auschwitz camps, more than 90% of whom were Jews.]Because he was a psychiatrist, he was able to observe behaviours at the camps. He noticed that the healthiest, youngest, smartest, & best looking were not automatically the ones who survived.At this juncture, I would like to quote exactly what he wrote:\\"Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food & various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, & not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering & death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost......Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way......Most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity & a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge & simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners......What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves & furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us...\\"According to him, in the final analysis, the most significant indicator of survival was that all of those who made it through had something significant yet to do with their lives. In other words, if one has something significant or purposeful or meaningful yet to do with one's life, the chances of survival against hardships, obstacles, setbacks & even death threats, will be much higher. That is to say, man's primary motivational force is his seach for ultimate meaning. Joel Barker calls it the power of vision. According to Barker, a positive vision of the future is what gives meaning to life & a meaningful vision empowers us to solve problems & accomplish goals.Another productive learning experience for me, from reading the book, is this: one often cannot change the circumstances of one's encounter with any situation, person or event, but one certainly has the power to choose how to interprete it & how to respond to it.Put it in another way, one's attitude or outlook on life certainly has ramifications on how one can survive - & thrive - in the longer term.I think I can now appreciate better about what Anthony Robbins once said: \\"It's in your moment of decision that your destiny is shaped.\\" He added further:There are three decisions that control our destiny:- our decisions about what to focus on;- our decisions about what things mean to us;- our decisions about what to do to create the results we desire;Viktor Frankl had also made another profound observation in his book:\\"Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it & make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, & it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.\\"This resonates very well with what F Buckminster Fuller, recognised as Planet Earth's friendly genius (he created the Geodesic dome), called 'precession' or 'precessional effects' is his book, 'Critical Path'.On the whole, I have enjoyed very much reading Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search for Meaning'. Thanks to Joel Barker for the timely introduction!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl touches upon the most fundamental aspect to some of the psychiatric problems (and non-psychiatric) that face us today: life lacking meaning. his genius and foresight that is seen as he details his experiences and perspective while in the camps is a feat, or rather a level of magnitude, to which we should all aspire.

The reason? Well classics frequently attract readers who have every intention of reading timeless literature, yet alas, they occupy space for a generation and the glue backing is brittle and splits the book in half when it is finally cracked open. The Ipad storage story? Ask me in a generation's time.Now Victor Frankl's &#34;......Search For meaning&#34;: Man's that is. It is a classic and a bloody good one to actually read. Why? Because it is classically meaningful and it makes classical common sense. If things are bad enough, how do you live without hope? Well if you are resident at hotel Auchwitz in the first half of the forties, you don't: unless you recall classics like Dostoyevsky. (spelled differently in Frankl's script but the same bloke I assume) You will learn that suffering is within the human condition for all of us. Therefore we can get meaning by being worthy of our suffering. To be unworthy is the real suffering. You may even die to be a worthy sufferer like that because it is better than turning into an impulsive unprincipled animal. Good people die in Frank's book but they lived with meaning until they were dead. How about us? Just because we don't live in concentration camps does not mean we do not suffer excruciating struggles. Frankl gives an analogy of a bottle that fills up with gas, meaning our lives fill up with challenges that pain us wherever we are. The second part of the book is a technical and professional rationale of what Frankl told us about in the first half. Why don't you just read it and see if you find principles to find some meaning in?"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A man is for the good of others if he has dignity.The stars were chosen for there purpose to dream, hope, and see beyond our own eyes.

While the book starts with concentration camps, there is little focus on the &#34;repulsive&#34; aspects of that experience - but more of a removed view. Why do people do what they do? Why do some people tolerate the intolerable longer than others? How do you handle things in life you can't control? How do you handle things you can??

The first section of this book is his recounting of his experiences. The later sections delve into his concepts of logotherapy and psychoanalysis.

It is however interesting that Frankl's account is somewhat contradicted by the experience of another of the 'survivors' Primo Levi. For Levi survival depended a great deal on one's good luck, regardless of one's attitude or virtue. I think in general that those like Frankl and Levi who survived the ' worse horror ' have a kind of authenticity as witnesses which obliges us to give what they say, special attention and consideration.In this sense I think too that Frankl's central insight about our being moral creatures, who can help make meaning in our lives even in the most extreme circumstances is a very significant one."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This may be instrumental for those who wish to understand the greater purpose behind their suffering. The author describes enduring many horrific experiences of the Holocaust while discovering a greater meaning along the way.Viktor Frankl believes there is a deeper meaning behind the suffering many experience. He believes it's a individual's challenge to discover the purpose concealed within their pain. He's non-judgmental on human suffering, seeing one's pain as a potential source of strength rather than as a sign of weakness.This book offers insights to those who seek a greater meaning within their suffering. While much of his story takes place during the Holocaust, the lessons learned are universal to anyone who's endured great difficulty."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In a world filled with paradoxes and contradictions, Frankl's work reaches across almost forty years and not only touches the heart but brings conviction. There is purpose in life, in suffering, indeed there is meaning in individual existence!!! I would reccommend this book to anyone on their own personal journey towards living life to its full, regardless of individual circumstance."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For those who have ever pondered the meaning of life, this book provides an interesting insight. In the book, Frankl, tells his story of life in a Nazi concentration camp but rather than focusing mainly on the horrors of camp life, he uses specific examples of mundane life in order to support his main purpose of demonstrating that even in the worst circumstances there can be a meaning for life.A recurring idea is \\"He who has a 'why' to live for can bear with almost any 'how'.\\" (Friedrich Nietszche) This sentence has the utmost importance for Frankl because a man without purpose cannot and does not live in a concentration camp. Repeatedly Frankl describes those who had given up hope on ever getting anything better out of life and then articulates, \\"...it did not really matter what we expected from life but rather what life expected from us.\\" His idea is that meaning in life does not come from the \\"active creation of something of value\\" but rather in how we handle life, the decisions we make in the best and worst of circumstances in response to the tasks that life has given us.It only takes a few hours to read but still has a lasting effect on the reader well after finishing. One may not agree with his view but in my opinion it is an understanding worth considering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I choose this book to review as part of an academic assignment and found it to be an uplifting spiritual journey, rather than an ardous academic task! Dr. Frankl's story of survival midst the unimaginable human suffering in the Death camps of WW11 is a truly moving account of the indomitable nature of the human spirit. In many ways it is the same courageous, inspirationl spirit which I have the privilege to encounter through my work ( i.e. working with people who have cancer). People have an enormous capacity to cope with suffering as evidenced by Dr. Frankl's testimony -the power to do so is within all of us, deep within our core, our very being. This book is not alone inspirational, it is also powerfully liberating; a liberation which emanates from Dr. Frankl's truism -- our one true freedom is our infinite freedom to choose our attitude, regardless of the circumstances. Our search or spiritual quest for meaning is as unique and individual as we are, and the meaning we eventually attribute to our inevitable human suffering is also unique. This book focuses the mind on the truly important things in life, our relationships, our loved ones, etc. My perspective on life and living has not only broadened but has deepened also. The philosophy/theory espoused by Viktor Frankl in this masterpiece has \\"grounded\\" me in a very real sense.The world is a lesser place without Dr. Frankl but his beautifully enriching work will shine brightly like a beacon of hope in the hearts and minds of men for years to come."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl does a superb job in capturing life in the concentration camps during WWII. I was moved at the same time touched by his words, \\"A man's salvation lies in and through Love.\\" It is true that we are free to choose our attitudes in any given situation and Dr. Frankl choose not to suffer by relying on the Love for his wife to survive the gruesome days in the Nazi camps. This is a beautiful book, which reflects on human suffering and how we are free to choose our attitudes. In the most horrific situations, we as humans can choose not to suffer. It is in us, the most influential power we carry (our attitudes) that lies in humans which can guide us to see the beauty the lies within and around us (life), even during the toughest times!A MUST READ BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, I read it for a Philosophy class.

I would encourage others to read this book, because in life there is meaning, we get it by our name, who we love, and our relationships with other people. We can identify with a lot...Read this book..."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To start off this review I would like to say that I am very pleased so far with the book. Right now I have already finished the first part of the book and I am reading the second part. I am reading the part where he goes over Logotherapy. It is really quite interesting. The book got to me in so many different ways. I find it very surprising how this man got through the Holocaust especially when he was a victim. To live through the horror of a Nazi death camp isn't anything easy but this man did it and with great struggle. Reading this book makes me think a lot differently about life now. What really got me in the book was the part where he describes how he and his fellow friends in the death camps would save others from committing suicide. He would tell them that life waits for them. He told them that they should live because somewhere out there, after they are all liberated, a person will be waiting for he/she. This gave the person great confidence in themselves and started looking forward to the future instead of the present. It really made me think about life today. Although we are not going through even half the stuff that this man went through, it makes you think about life. It makes you wonder what WILL happen in the future and what kinds of things wait for you ahead. So I say to my fellow comrades out there, death isn't the only way out. There is much more in life. It's a tough book in the sense that it makes you think beyond a lot, but it is definitely worth it when you figure out the meanings behind everything he has to say. There is always a message. Take the message of death for example. It is all fate. It really all comes down to fate. It all comes down to having unconditional faith in life even though it doesn't seem like the right idea at the time.He explains everything about Logotherapy and to me it is the strongest and most powerful form of therapy yet! Logotherapy is something that one does to them self. It is a mind thing and it works. It really does. It is really effective. You could learn, from Logotherapy, how life is so beautiful and so wonderful. One just has to open their eyes. After reading this autobiography, you learn so many things about life and all the tricks in life. It's actually something quite beautiful. This is such an optimistic book. This book helps you find yourself and where you're at today. It helps you find a meaning in life. Oh, there are so many.Viktor Frankl wrote an excellent book for all kinds of different levels of readers. He touched bases with the reader and, even though you may not like it, makes you understand that everyone goes through the same thing one way or another. This was an excellent book and I strongly recommend it for those interested in psychological books."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an awesome book, written by a survivor of Auschwitz death camp in Nazi Germany, and a man who is surely one of the most gifted and insightful psychiatrists who has lived. Indeed, a psychiatrist who has personally faced such extremity, is a psychiatrist worth listening to.Frankl is a man of faith, and he explains that there exists a deep, spiritual core within each of us which cannot be crushed or taken away from us - no matter how grim or awful our external circumstances may be. He says that from the soul's reckoning, tragedy can be the greatest opportunity for triumph. While in the camp, even though Frankl had no idea how many hours, days or years he had left to live, he realised that during the moment now, he had a choice whether to be free, or whether to be imprisoned. That is, to be free in his spirit. During his experience in Auschwitz, Frankl literally found himself on the bottom line, and from there, he made the most amazing discovery of all. He discovered the truth of his own spiritual awakening.The most effective way I can convey the Frankl's message, and the profundity of his work, is to share some quotes from the book itself. Frankl says...&quot;The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity - even under the most difficult circumstances - to add a deeper meaning to his life.&quot;... &quot;One of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above such conditions, to grow beyond them.&quot;... &quot;Often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. ... To be sure, a human being is a finite thing, and his freedom is restricted. It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take stand toward the conditions.&quot;... &quot;Even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by doing so change himself. He may turn a personal tragedy into a triumph.&quot;Frankl closes the book with a profound, bedrock refutation against Sigmund Freud's theory, and also against materialists' theories that human beings are 'conditioned' by their external surroundings. He quotes Freud, who had asserted, &quot;Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people uniformly to hunger. With the increase of the imperative urge of hunger, all individual differences will blur, and in their stead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.&quot;Frankl replies, &quot;Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed in the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the 'individual differences' did not 'blur' but, on the contrary, people became more different: people unmasked themselves, both the swine and saints. ... We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automation; more than this, we may even try to predict the mechanisms of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche.&quot;Frankl's conclusions are profound: &quot;The self transcendence of human existence ... denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or Someone, other than oneself.&quot;Overall, this is an extraordinarily profound and unique book which, at times, proves quite heavy and difficult to digest, but once one gets in tune with the author's message, then its truth and light becomes fully clear, apparent and undeniable.Certainly not a light read, yet highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Besides presenting his Logotherapy in a nutshell, Viktor Frankl tells us about the horrors of concentration camps and how some people survived - and why.

I'd definitely recommend, and I have!I'm interested in seeing what else Frankl has written."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In the first half of this fascinating little book, Frankl describes his years in the concentration camps (including Auschwitz) with the purpose of analyzing the behavior of people in extreme situations. He admits that someone who wasn't there can't give a very detailed or personal account, but a person who WAS there can't give a detached account because they were emotionally involved. I think he did an excellent job of viewing the situation with detachment, considering the situation. This was a really interesting little memoir. The second half of the book introduces his theory of psychoanalysis: logotherapy. Logotherapy is focused on man's search for meaning; in contrast to Freudian theory focusing on man's search for pleasure and Adlerian theory focusing on man's search for power. I think Logotherapy is the most sensible form of psychotherapy I've ever heard of. How can I argue that our happiness depends on our perceiving our own purpose? I admit I felt a little skepticism when he kept bringing up examples of how he'd \\"cured\\" someone after only one session--he must have been a particularly clever person to manage that so often. But that aside, I think the technique of finding meaning in a patient's life is rather useful."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the most significant books I have ever read.

Reading this short book carefully is a life changer."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I recently completed a master's in counseling and guidance and have been reading to find a set of books that will best address some of the disorders in the DSM-IV. Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a \\"normal\\" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.Depression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths* Book = \\"Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity\\"- David H. Rosen\\"o I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend \\"The Essential Jung\\" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.* Book = \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" - Viktor Franklo I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered - and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.Depersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there* Book = \\"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\\" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugelo Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we \\"are\\" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question if we are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the \\"normal\\" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.Bipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program* Book = \\"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness\\" by Kay Redfield Jamisono Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.ADHD (attention deficit disorder)* Book = \\"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It\\" - Gabor Mateo This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)* Book = \\"Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\" - Ian Osborno Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.That is all for now, but I am still reading"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"nt: \\"This book was recommended to me, by a man that I respect. Every time I read Viktor E. Frankl's, Man's Search For Meaning, I find that I need time to reflect on what I have read, often even after just a paragraph. What evils have been brought on humans, by other humans with the lame excuses that they feel superior? Dr. Frankl writes: \\"From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two--the \\"race\\" of the decent man and the \\"race\\" of the indecent man\\". I am so glad that I read this book.A professor asked our class asked who each would be more inclined to follow Sigmund Freud, or, Abraham Maslow. Thinking out-loud, I suggested Viktor E. Frankl. The professor however stated, that he was out of scope of that particular assignment. Whereas I am a layman at best, and to be frank, I have great respect for Maslow's Hierarchy of needs, I am just not a fan of Freud. As for Viktor E. Frankl? G-d love the man. Well, really, with the forward looking Logotherapy, G-d love the man.Dr. Frankl writes: \\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.\\" [Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search For Meaning (p.122)]Best regards.Doug\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As a spiritual author, I was recently asked by one of my readers whether one could successfully maintain a sense of higher values in the midst of especially horrific circumstances--such as extremely tortuous prison conditions. Wouldn't one inevitably be reduced to a base, animalistic state? I started to answer her question, but stopped, because I have never personally experienced a circumstance like that. So anything I have to say on the subject would mostly be conjecture. And then it dawned on me. Wasn't there a book written by a man who had experienced life in a Nazi Concentration Camp--a book with an uplifting message about man's indomitable spirit? It only took seconds via Google to find Viktor Frankl's \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" And there was the \\"proof\\" I was seeking. After reading Frankl's book, I can now say with conviction that one can, indeed, maintain a sense of higher values in horrific conditions. One can retain his or her human dignity, an appreciation for art, beauty, and creativity, and even grow from the experience. Perhaps only one person in a thousand will do so. But Frankl demonstrated that it is possible. Thank you, Viktor, for sharing your trials and triumphs with us all.

It is captivating to read. The depth of his insight will leave you wanting to memorize certain passages.

Already a renowned psychotherapist, Frankl's experiences at Auschwitz and other concentration camps provided him profound and striking insights into human psychology. He sets them out in this brief and elegant book.Firstly, when put in a situation of extreme adversity or deprivation human personalities do not blur into one \\"uniform expression of the unstilled urge\\", as Sigmund Freud had supposed they would but, on the contrary, true personalities are accentuated. Secondly, despair and depression are not at all correlated with the experience of adversity, but if anything inversely so: in our modern, plentiful and comfortable times, neuroses are legion. By contrast, on the whole they weren't in Nazi death camps. Frankl was uniquely placed and qualified to comment on this; Freud was not: \\"Thank heaven,\\" Frankl remarks dryly, \\"Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside\\".This seems right: I dare say you don't see much neuroticism in modern day Somalia either (though I do quite like the idea of obsessive-compulsive Mogadishan parents pushing their kids into extra cello lessons.)Frankl uses his anecdotal observations to propose what was in its day a revolutionary psychology: it isn't our primal physical urges which determine our behaviour, with intellectual constructions being mere epiphenomenal by-products (Freud would have it that love, for example, was a spin-off of the deeper primal sexual urge), but the other way round: it is the intellectual content - the *meaning* of our lives that shapes and drives our behaviour and, crucially, our happiness.The more profound and compelling you find the meaning in your own life, the less neurotic you're likely to be.This leaves open the question of what \\"meaning\\" might be, and what might make a profound and compelling one. This question Frankl doesn't answer, rightly I think, other in rather an airy fashion. Anecdotally, meanings are more likely to count as profound and compelling the more gravely connected with the \\"tragic triad\\" of pain, guilt and death they are (no shortage, therefore, at Auschwitz). But beyond those axes, the implication will be that we, the users, determine our own meaning.This may perhaps be a little self-fulfilling, and neurosis may be a product of existential frustration (in other words the confounding of one's own quest for meaning through preoccupation with things you don't truly value): Frankl cites a senior American diplomat who sought treatment from depression arising from discontent with his working life. Frankl's advice was not undergo psychotherapy, but to change his job to something he cared more about!But all the same this seems to me a plausible explanation for modern melancholy: who, these days, isn't continually and forcibly preoccupied with things he or she doesn't truly value? That seems to perfectly capture the \\"asset rich, time poor\\" existence.This is a short book, but it's a gem: the message of plurality and self-determination are ones which should strike harmonious chords in the ears of those, like this reviewer, who are nudging into middle age and wondering if it is quite all what it cracked up to be.Olly Buxton"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"At multiple levels Viktor Frankl's book is simply brilliant.At the level of primitive survival Frankl shows that there is no way of knowing whether volunteering will end at the gas chamber or a rest camp, when the dice are being rolled by someone else.In terms of the day-to-day existence he found that it was important to stay in the middle of the flock, or work party to stay warm, and not be beaten.On the re-adjusted scales of Happiness, he understandably developed the concept of negative happiness- freedom from suffering.Finally, he realised that LOVE is the highest goal to which one can aspire.This is the one book that you finish reading and think- My life is pretty damn good!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I don't think I have ever read a book where someone has written what is so true to me about the essential truths of life. What makes this book so different is the background of total adversity in which it was written. Viktor E Frankl in the face of almost certain death on a daily if not minute by minute basis still found within himself the ability to help his fellows, particularly those who had given up and were considering suicide. In the book he said and I quote \\"When we are no longer able to change a situation... We are challenged to change ourselves.\\"It was this quote which attracted me to this great man and I recommend him to you. As a result of reading Man's Search For Meaning I am now including this book as a mandatory read in The Sun Chi Healing course and system."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book should be in everybody's library.

This book is a must read. One that I found worth reading again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was recommended to me by my father but years went by before I actually read it.

It is small, very readable, very very inexpensive...get it read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl reprises a remarkable circumstance, his experience in German Work/Death Camps during WWII and his inspiring quest to find meaning amid daunting nearly unimaginable oppression. Functions better as a critique of Frankl's psychotherapy predecessors (Freud) than as a tract promoting the unique virtues of logotherapy. Worthy book for those of \\"greatest generation.\\" For \\"boomers,\\" my coming of age, I would suggest Ernest Becker's \\"The Denial of Death\\" serves as a more cogent testament and comprehensive critique."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"There are an ton of reviews on this book already and I couldn't possibly come up with other insights that haven't been mentioned yet. I just felt I needed to add another 5 star review and recommend this life changing (saving?) book. When you feel like you're slumping or life has you down all you need to do is read this book. It's all about your attitude of life and you have complete control of this fact. Enjoy this book and read it over and over."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book was an assigned reading requirement for an Undergraduate Social Work course. I hate to admit that I had heard the word Holocaust but had no historical knowledge on the subject. Yes, I was a junior at the college level and had never been taught about the Holocaust. I found this book to be a great (yet painful) historical biography that I can say began my interest in learning more about the Holocaust. I have learned more over the years about his theoretical perspective of logotherapy and can attribute my initial interest in reading this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of the best book that I've ever read. It changed my life in many ways. Viktor Frankl did an extraordinarily job that influences many people's lives. He deserves all respect for his job."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For Frankl, if life has a meaning, it has to be found in suffering. And he knows what suffering is.A brilliant student who writes essays on Schopenhauer, Psychology and Philosophy when he is still in high school, reduced to a beggar child in WWI and excluded from Alfred Adler's circle, without any reason at the age of 19.At 23 he already enjoys international recognition for his free work with suicidal youth in Vienna.In 1938, already a respected psychiatrist, he is invited to live in the US, but prefers to stay close to his old parents, only to be deported, 4 years later to a Jewish ghetto in Prague, where his wife is forced to abort their child and where his father dies from exhaustion 6 months later. Sister Stella manages to escape to AUS. In 1944 the whole family is separated and send to different concentration camps. Only when freed by US troops in April 45, he comes to know that all were killed, including his brother and sister in law. He is kept alive to take care, as a doctor, of other sick prisoners. \\"Man's search for meaning\\" was written in 9 days in 1946, and sold 9 million books until his death in 1997, and is considered one of the ten most influential books among lifetime readers in America today.\\"Man's search for meaning\\" makes an analysis of the psyche of a concentration camp prisoner.What becomes of man when everything is taken from him? To Frankl what one becomes is the result of an individual choice, the choice of weather to behave with dignity and according to moral values or renounce to his freedom of choice, dignity and self respect and behave and become like a scum and an animal.Suffering is part of life as much as death. The meaning and purpose of life lies in making use of suffering to exercise our freedom of choice, to chose how to take and accept suffering and in this way grow as a human being. Unavoidable, unescapable suffering is in fact a blessing. We must be worth our suffering. Man is free to chose to transform suffering into growth, guilt into change and life's transitoriness into action.Just as life has a meaning, even under the most miserable of conditions, so does a human being have value independently of its usefulness to society.The meaning of life in general is less important than the specific meaning of one's life at a specific moment, because that meaning may change every moment. We have to decide every moment what we want to be.Logotherapy, the psychoanalytical method he devised, concentrates on the responsibility one has for his own life. Responsibility to one's conscience or to society. It identifies the what and the who, one's responsible for. And no one can be responsible for someone else's acts.Man is free to chose to transform suffering into growth, guilt into change and life's transitoriness into action.No 2 persons can be compared, No 2 lives are the same.Sometimes we have to take action, sometimes, we have to accept things the way they are. We all have to suffer, no one can suffer for us. We are alone in the Universe for this task. We have to face suffering bravely and don't cry more than is necessary. Those who see us in our suffering (family, friends or God) expect us to do it with pride and not miserably.The meaning of life lies outside man. Lies in the people s/he loves and the causes s/he serves.We cannot know someone completely but through love. Only love sees the potentialities and is able to help realize them.Sex is only an expression of that love.A person that has fulfilled the meaning of his life, actualised his potentialities and suffered with dignity, is a person that looks back on his life with pride and does not envy youth."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"While I have never really warmed up to the second part of Frankl's book, the \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" section has to be one of the finest examinations of meaning under terrible circumstances ever written. Frankl is insightful, unpretentious, incisive, elegant, brilliant. The first section is an existential masterpiece.I guess my difficulty with logotherapy is that meaning as experienced and conveyed by Frankl feels like it gets reduced down when put forth as a psychiatric theory.But part one is just brilliant beyond any attempt to review it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor E. Frankl teaches us that light can be found in each individual struggle to find meaning within - even through the worst pain, suffering and dehumanization; even in the darkest corners of history...The book is split into two parts: Experiences In A Concentration Camp and Logotherapy In a Nutshell.Part one is an account of his experiences in the concentration camps (Auschwitz and several others). Frankl gives us a picture of the sequence of three psychological reactions the prisoners experience to the process of imprisonment and freedom. Despite the horrifying circumstances, we begin to see an optimism budding in the sea of bleakness: a unique sense of meaning in some of the prisoners which helps them to cope with the day to day horrors of camp existence - a meaning which holds their spirits up even though their bodies are broken. This part of the book is unbelievably sad, yet the message it carries about the human condition is truly empowering.In part 2, we are given a brief overview of Frankl's theory of logotherapy, a form of psychotherapy which helps patients find meaning in their lives - no matter what their circumstances.The wisdom contained herein is so rich that after having only finished it last night, I know that I will be re-reading it for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am not much on bibliotherapy, but I have lost more copies of this book than any other giving it to psychotherapy clients to read. This is an incredibly readable, heartfelt treatise on meaning-oriented, existential therapy. The greatest component to it is that it is not written in an erudite nor an obtuse manner. Instead, it is written so that everyone can grasp it. Written from a first-person perspective, with the first part of the book focused on Frankl's personal and interpersonal struggles, trials, tribulations, and explorations while in a concentration camp, this book clearly and simply develops Frankl's logotherapy perspective on therapy. As I have done before with countless clients, I highly recommend this book for anyone in search of meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the best book I have read! It is: easy to read, a nice blend of thoughts and drama, inspiring, and comes with great ideas. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the most important themes of this great work is substituting society's common grouping of people (black, white, Jew, gentile, etc.) with a delineation that is truly practical. Frankl rightly says there are only two categories of people \\"the decent and the indecent.\\" That is perhaps the greatest idea postulated in generations. So now we must wrestle with the fact that there are decent and indecent black people, decent and indecent white people, and yes, even decent Germans in the midst of the holocaust.To arrive at that conclusion under those circumstance gives hope that we may transcend the unnecessary divisions of our time, freeing us to see past exteriors and balance the core of a person on the scales of decency. We all carry baggage and this book has lightened my load.While these ideas are powerful they are only a sub-theme in this work. Centrally, Frankl conveys his method of overcoming life's greatest challenges and it is very profound."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was hesitant to read this book because I thought it would only be about the horrors of the concentration camps which we have all heard about for decades. But this book is different in that it examines the prisoner's state of mind and how Viktor Frankl uses his experiences to support his logotherapy. Great book, I'm glad I finally took the time to read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is really two works in one. In the first, longer part, Frankl details his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. His purpose is to demonstrate to the reader that even in the most horrific of circumstances it is possible to hold your head high and maintain your sense of purpose and optimism. In the second part, Frankl describes just how his \\"logotherapy\\" works.This book, highly popular in the 1970s, is both informative and practical. If you hadn't previously figured out how to rise above the fleeting events of your life when they distress you, this book makes the process clear and explicit. It is in fact one Western version of some of the main tenets of Buddhism, which tells us that life is only an illusion of endless change, and you must constantly reach for the unchangeable truths beyond that illusion.Having missed reading the book when it was first popular, I am glad to have finally gotten to it, if a bit late in life. I strongly agree with Frankl's point that \\"self-actualization is possible...only as a side-effect of self-transcendence\\". There are additional tidbits I found useful, such as the notion of \\"paradoxical intention\\", in which you try to consciously perform some action you are trying to cure yourself of, such as stuttering. Frankl also rightly reminds us that in each situation, you will know for yourself what the one *right* thing to do is, and you must chose that in order to be at peace with yourself.I gave the book only four stars, since I felt it was a bit repetitive (I wonder what the original 20-volume German-language version was like), continually recycling a single core idea which could have been explained in fewer words - though shortening the text might admittedly have made it less effective. It is in any case a great work, a classic in the psychology and self-help genre, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"To this day, Viktor Frankl's name is a frequent reference or footnote in motivational and business books and many others. He says we never cease to be ourselves, we are never without an ability to choose. In this small, understated treatise of his time in Nazi concentration camps, as part of his own means of coping, Frankl analyzes why some seemingly strong people die and others, whom you'd expect to wither away, do not. In the inhuman caldron that burned away all pretense and excuses, leaving bare human nature, Frankle witnesses the skills to mastering life: hope, chiefly, then humor, love, beauty and more. In his book, those change from lofty concepts to the essence of existence--and in many cases the means to continue to live."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I own this book in paperback. I had to read it in college. I still remember the first time I read it. I sat in a chair and read it cover-to-cover. That's how good it is. It's amazing. This is one of those books you have to read in your lifetime. I'm writing this review because I saw it's a Kindle deal today for $1.99. That's awesome. Get it. Read it. It'll knock your socks off."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I loved Frankl's perspective on our time here as being a choice of attitude. His account of concentration camp life was heart-stopping and his ability to see light in such a dark time, his ability to pull himself out of such a desperate and sick situation lends hope that I can do the same in my times which can, in no way, compare to his. This book inspired me and shed light on what I might call depression. GREAT read!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book would get five stars even if only its first half was written.It describes the life at concentration camp as pictured by the author Victor Frankl, who was a trained psychiatrist and a concentration camp survivor.The author lost his wife and parents in Holocaust and himself experienced nadir of human suffering in concentration camps for three years.He gives a very detailed account of how the various human mind states manifested themselves under conditions of duress. And it really touches you at a very deep level.In the second half of the book, he lays out his theory that man's primary motivation is finding meaning in life.Logotherapy is his theory which gives an analysis of man's search for meaning in life. He proposes the basic principles as:- Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. We need the right attitude to deal with difficult situations.- We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.Contrary to what Sigmund Freud proposed, he says that there are objective differences in the behavior when human beings are subject to deplorable conditions.Instead of harping on his own suffering in Nazi camps he instead chooses to focus on his message.\\"Suffering is not necessary to find meaning, but one can find meaning in spite of suffering.To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic. Rather, a positive attitude can go a long way to ease even the most dreaded human conditions. And there can always be a meaning in life if one is ready to search for it.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl is indeed a study in resilience. He has demonstrated the power of finding purpose in pain, in suffering, in dying. Man's Search for Meaning is his opus; it includes Frankl's reflections on years of suffering and it provides principles for others who find themselves feeling hopeless and helpless.By his late-20s, Frankl was a respected Jewish psychiatrist practicing in Vienna, Austria. He specialized in neurology and psychiatry and even worked as a brain surgeon. His work was primarily with those struggling with depression and suicide. In 1942, at age 37, Frankl, his wife and his parents were deported to a German concentration camp where Frankl was asked to treat newcomers to camp in order to reduce the risk that they would commit suicide. After two years in that role, he was transferred to Auschwitz and then on to a third concentration camp where he worked in slave-labor until the concentration camp was liberated by Allied forces in 1945. By then, however, Frankl's wife and parents had all been murdered as residents of separate camps.The purposes of those concentration camps were two-fold: the methodical killing of millions of innocent people but also the demoralization and dehumanization of the Jewish people (Ainsztein, 1974). In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl reflects upon those around him who struggled with thoughts of suicide (p. 31) and even his own blunting of emotions (p. 35). Pain is not a respecter of persons, a valuable lesson implicit in the book as Frankl discloses his own struggles as being parallel to those without the great intellect, education and opportunity that he possessed.It appears as though Frankl the psychiatrist was not demoralized to the extent that he could not recognize strategies for coping in himself and those around him. The fact that he was later able to put these observations and reflections on paper is a treasure.In Resilient Adults: Overcoming a Cruel Past, Higgins discusses a number of characteristics and dynamics of the resilient that mirror Frankl's experiences. Higgins notes that those in her study who demonstrated resilience had above average IQ, exceptional talents, high levels of ego development, attuned empathy, and a strong sense of activism. One dynamic particularly relevant to Frankl is the component of profound religious faith. Of those who participated inHiggins' study who were identified as resilient, a number discussed the value that they received in expressing how they overcame their distress. Frankl demonstrated this decades before Higgins' study noted the therapeutic value of self-expression of resilience.Higgins' study participants reported that being exposed to the resilience of others provided a sense of hope for them in the midst of distress. Reading Man's Search for Meaning provides encouragement for those who find themselves in distress. For many people, the tragedies reported and documented from the German concentration camps are of the most heinous of all time. The resiliency demonstrated by Frankl offers hope for any circumstance.Frankl discusses the importance of \\"simple desires\\" during the times of greatest agony (p. 40). Those who are feeling hopeless and full of desire should likewise recognize the simple things that they appreciate despite the gravity of their situations. Frankl's perhaps most important contribution was his disclosure of the role of the \\"vigor of religious belief\\" (p. 46). This is of particular interest considering the opinions of religion propagated by the two other key Viennese psychiatrists, Freud and Adler.A struggle normalized by Frankl was that of thoughts of suicide (p. 31). For those who believe that they are the only ones so desperate as to consider the taking of their own life, Frankl writes about the struggles with suicide of the entire concentration camp community as well as his own individual struggle with hopelessness and doubts about whether he could go on. Inclusion of such a vulnerable disclosure is helpful to readers who feel that they are alone in the depth of their pain. To recognize the prevalence of this struggle in the face of such extreme pain is therapeutic, particularly when coupled with the knowledge that those who acknowledged the struggle survived.A thread present at numerous points within the pages of Man's Search for Meaning is that of the preeminence of family. At various points, Frankl discusses how \\"longing for home and family\\" (p. 33) kept painful emotions at bay, even when they were thinking about their spouses being in similar, or worse conditions (p. 48). By doing so, Frankl encourages future readers to also treasure those close to them when facing trials.Frankl discusses the role of humor (p. 54) as a means of self-preservation in the darkest of hours, noting that \\"a very trifling thing can cause the greatest of joys\\" (p. 55). Solitude, often considered the enemy of the oppressed, was treasured (p. 61). Day-dreaming became a real coping mechanism to get through each day; inner life became intensified (p. 50). These dynamics may come as a surprise to those in the midst of pain; however, Frankl emphasized the healing component that each provided for those in the midst of the torment found in the concentration camps of World War Two.While the first half of Man's Search for Meaning is autobiographical, the second half is a summation on Frankl's penultimate contribution to his field, logotherapy. Frankl wrote that his experiences in Nazi death camps taught him to affirm what Nietzsche had said, that \\"he who has a why to live for can bear with almost any\\" (Frederick Nietzsche). The theory upon which logotherapy is based grew out of Frankl's experiences within the Nazi death camps.Logotherapy is from the Greek word logos. Logos can be translated as study, word, spirit, God or meaning. Boeree noted that Frankl was often compared with two other famous Viennese psychiatrists Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. While Freud concentrated on pleasure as the root of human motivation and Adler upon power, Frankl concentrated on meaning. It was his goal to bring into greater balance perspectives on physiology and spirituality as a means to construct meaning.Frankl posited during his autobiographical section that man \\"can only live by looking to the future\\" (p. 115) and noted that the \\"ultimate and highest goal to which man can aspire\\" is love (p. 58). Frankl reflects upon his experiences and states that \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to chose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's one way\\" (p. 104). Frankl is critical of those who shame others out of reflecting upon their own suffering noting that suffering that is endured with dignity fosters meaning.Religion is a key construct in Man's Search for Meaning. Frankl is clear to testify to the importance of relying on God. In his introduction to logotherapy, Frankl presents his theory in a much broader religious context. While Freud clearly presented a psychological basis that was hostile to religion, Frankl posits one that recognizes how his own spiritual life \\"was deepened\\" (p. 56) while encouraging others to identify their own relationship with the transcendent.Completing Man's search leads readers to wonder how psychotherapeutic models would be viewed differently if access to the same depth of autobiographical reflection was available for each theorist. Having a glimpse into Frankl's time in a World War Two concentration camp allows his audience to see into his heart and to recognize the context of his work with patients and students.Filled with hope, Man's Search for Meaning is quite inspirational as Frankl chronicles how he found meaning in life under the worst of circumstances. It is as though Frankl has found a dozen ways to say that the answer to all psychological problems is to \\"find meaning in suffering.\\" His optimism has a contagious flavor to it. Man's Search is a compelling read that prompts deep introspection as to the relationship between the sufferer and the suffering and how to ascribe meaning to that suffering. Frankl demonstrates that, \\"even in the most terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress,\\" individuals \\"can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind\\" (p. 74)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The detachment with which the author plows through the deprivations of concentration-camp life (as he personally experienced) is erudite and emotional. The vivid imagery is caught in the mundane yet otherworldly details of camp survival techniques--whether using cigarettes as currency or clapping loudly to poor capo-poetry as a means of self-preservation--underpinning the despair that assailed the lives of the prisoners. In his account, love transcends the barbarism of genocide, shouted commands, lashings, and shows itself to be the greatest aspiration man can hold.At one point, the author, scantily clad, marches on frozen ground, before the pale light of dawn emerges, envisaging his wife, talking to her, relishing in her memory, occasionally interrupted by a falling prisoner, a whipping, a lashing, a shout, to return to the indelible warmth of her memory.There can be bliss in hell and strength of soul in a corpse-like man. The impetus of life is self-determination and meaningfulness in both the dark and light of humanity. This book centers on the notion that individual decisions define an one's future--not circumstances, external prejudices, or the environment. It is a book that celebrates the future, reveres age and experience, gives perspective to suffering and, most importantly, tells of freedom as value-less without \\"responsibleness\\"--in other words, life has naught to offer but the chance to offer it something; every hour, every day."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"It's absurd to \\"review\\" a reflection on the Holocaust by a Holocaust survivor. I guess I just felt compelled to write a few words about how much this book touched me.Previously, I have only read two other Holocaust memoirs: Elie Wiesel'sNight (Oprah's Book Club)and Simon Wisenthal'sThe Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness (Newly Expanded Paperback Edition)and I can't help but use them as references when thinking of ways to describe Frankl's approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" Both Wiesel and Wisenthal were strictly documentarian in their approaches. When recounting their time as victims of the Nazi regime's extermination program, both described their experiences as they happened, and attempted to convey their emotions at the time. Both wrote beautifully, but were very faithful to the attitude Wiesel once described about the \\"experience\\" of the Holocaust, which is that no poetry or analytical thought could do it justice, that silence was the only possible response.Frankl clearly doesn't take this approach in \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\" Before he and his family were captured by the SS, Frankl was an aspiring psychoanalyst who was on the verge of publishing a major book. His fascination with human nature clearly runs deep, and is self-evident in the way in which Frankl chose to respond to the Holocaust. While in the camps themselves, Frankl paid close attention to the people around him, and paid particular attention to himself. Despite the sheer brutalization he experienced, he didn't seem to lose his sense of curiosity, and wasn't afraid to use his experiences in order to develop insights into the souls of human beings, or to compare the suffering he and his fellow inmates experienced to experiences of suffering found in the outside world. He noticed their coping strategies, their behaviors, the things they would say, the ways in which their perspectives changed. Although he comes across as an individual who can never really shed his intellectual gaze, he never comes across as cold. His retellings of his memoires, his reflections on what happened to him, and the ideas he develops out of them are all intertwined with a deep concern for the moral future of humanity, and the care he felt for those who suffered along with him in Auschwitz and the other camps he was imprisoned him.I won't bother describing the events that Frankl retells. I shouldn't have to, because you damn well should read them! His conclusions, however, are both interesting and inspiring. While in the camps, Frankl noticed that although all the prisoners were reduced to nothing, and all were equally degraded and posessionless, their individuality did not disappear. The Nazis may have stripped them of every signifier that spoke of their dignity, but various prisoners still stood out in their moral actions. Some shared food when they hardly had any themselves. Some sacrificed themselves in order to help others. Meanwhile, others became cruel, or others simply gave up, smoked their last cigarette, and awaited their death. The first philosophically significant conclusion Frankl takes from this is that human beings are not the total products of their social environment. Even when \\"equalized\\" in the harshest, most severe way possible, various prisoners were still able to define themselves through the care they showed for their fellow man. Secondly, those who did act morally and did persevere believed in something. This \\"something\\" could be the hope that they would see their significant others one day, that they needed to still carry out God's work, or that they would continue to live after the Holocaust was over. Frankl also shares the way in which he applied this to himself, and he insists that it was the sole factor that allowed him to survive. His thoughts of his wife, and the work he needed to continue outside of the camps, according to him, were the things that allowed him to survive the Nazi's worst tortures and cruelties. His suffering was intense, but he was able to give it meaning, which made it bearable. In multiple instances, he repeats a famous Nietzsche quote as if it is his personal mantra: \\"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.\\" Ironically, those who believed in nothing but survival fell into animality, and according to what he saw, did not survive. Those who didn't believe in their own survival, but rather, the importance of something greater, in fact, were far more likely to persevere.The second half of \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is an argument that his experiences are fully applicable to all peoples' lives. I find this particularly interesting, because as I mentioned earlier, one of the most common statements one hears about Holocaust experiences is that they're incommunicable, that the only proper reaction is silence. I'm not saying that Frankl would think that the experiences of Holocaust survivors were \\"communicable\\" per se, but he clearly believes that they can tell us something about ourselves. He provides various stories from his time as a practicing psychotherapist where he applied \\"logotheraphy,\\" a strain of psychological thought we now would probably refer to as \\"humanist psychology.\\" Frankl criticizes the prevailing Freudianism of his day for its promotion of the idea that the human mind was machine-like, and that individuals had no control over their actions. He retells one particularly funny story about an Austrian patient who was dissatisfied with his diplomatic career. Previous psychoanalysts told him that he was dissatisfied because he worked with U.S. relations, and that his mind interpreted the U.S. as his father. It makes the modern reader laugh, but this is actually what Frankl was fighting against! Frankl, as an alternative, suggested that the man's career conflicted with his inner values (which the patient kept telling his previous psychoanalysts anyways!), and that he needed to find a career that was in line with his personal sense of meaning. The patient did exactly that- and what do you know- it made him happier!Modern American pop culture is overloaded with feel-good gurus: \\"The Purpose-Driven Life,\\" or the garbage referred to as \\"The Secret.\\" These hucksters either pick a specific religious belief as \\"the big solution,\\" or tell their followers absurd things, such as the idea that they can \\"do anything,\\" or wish their ills away. Frankl, being a profound philosopher-psychologist, promotes the idea that people should discover their own purpose. However, he understands the complexities of such a project. Frankl stresses that discovering purpose is a task unique to each individual. If an individual wants to turn to religion, that's fine. At the same time, Frankl points out that fidelity to one's family, a creative project, or the desire to improve one's character can all play the role of meaning. In fact, he warns against simply picking a \\"meaning\\" out of thin air. Unlike feel-good gurus, Frankl understands that suffering is a part of life, and no amount of therapy or reflection can change that. He frankly admits that \\"logotherapy\\" cannot solve all psychological problems, or that it's a magic cure. Rather, he believes that it represents something which is lacking in the modern world, something that needs to balance out the influences of crass capitalist materialism and cold scientific determinism, and suspects that many could stand to benefit from this sort of reflection.This book is wonderful. You should read it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl was one of the greatest psychologists and noblest human beings of the 20th century. He taught that the primary motivation in human life was the search for meaning. He explained that \\"the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day, and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.\\" There is potential meaning to be fulfilled in every situation in life, no matter how painful and difficult it may be. During World War II Viktor Frankl and his family were imprisoned in the Nazi death camps; his pregnant wife was murdered in the gas chambers and his parents died of starvation and illness. Frankl miraculously survived and after the war wrote about his experiences and conclusions about human nature in his book \\"Man's Search for Meaning.\\"Frankl asserted that man is free to make choices and determine his life and that is a much needed refresher in our age, when many perceive people to be simply subjects to biological, psychological, and social conditions. Frankl says: \\"Man does not simply exist, but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment... In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behaved like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions and not on conditions.\\" He clarifies that although man is not free from conditions, he is free to take a position toward those conditions. Our power and responsibility is to give meaning to our unique lives and fulfill that meaning, no matter what the conditions are.There are certain achievements that have the potential to greatly impact all of humanity; I believe that Viktor Frankl's ideas represent such an achievement and should not be limited to the realm of psychotherapy. They were tested during the darkest hour of human history and after passing such a test, they are no longer \\"ideas\\" but rather facts about human nature, facts that we all need to consider as we face the challenges of our times and in our personal lives.Roumen Bezergianov, author of \\"Character Education with Chess\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Everyone should read Man's Search for Meaning at some point in his or her life. I personally am not a huge fan of pulling a book from the shelf and reading for hours, but I could not put this book down.In his book Viktor Frankl uses his experiences in concentration camps to teach this valuable lesson: that when one finds meaning to life, then trials, challenges, and pain become more possible to overcome. Frankl, who is a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, uses his background in psychology to help him survive.I really liked the book because he taught the valuable lesson that no matter where you are and what happens to you, no one can control your thoughts, mind, and attitude. Frankl is thrown into Nazi prisons and endures more than I will probably face in my lifetime. But he showed me that even if your job, home, family, career, and name are taken away, no one can take away what is inside of you.The possibility of seeing his family again was Frankl's motivation to survive the different situations that he was thrown into. I really enjoyed the moral of the book and his desire to survive. I wish that he would have written more about his experiences and time in the camps. The book is a short read, and about the last third is devoted to explaining his psychotherapy called Logo Therapy.One of the reasons that I enjoyed reading the book so much is because it is a part of the world's history from an individual's perspective. I personally felt like I could relate different parts of my life to the things that were being said in the book. I was never put into a concentration camp, but I think that at some point in everyone's lives, they are stripped of something. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a lot out of a little.

The first part of the book is more of an auto-biographical account of how he arrived in Auschwitz, the harsh living conditions, and later what happened after his release. I found this section easy to read, with some real pearls of wisdom. The second part of the book was more difficult for me personally because it included a lot of psychology terms.It was interesting to learn about the things Frankl endured, and more importantly how he survived the bitter cold, limited food rations, brutal punishments, and the overall depression associated with being a death camp prisoner. Despite all the hardships, he even discussed a few rays of sunlight that broke through the otherwise drab existence - this included humor, natural beauty of a sunset, and many other things.Overall, this is a book I would like to read and study again, especially so I can better understand the psychology concepts used in the second part. I do think the first book is written simply enough for anyone to understand the basic concepts Frankl is conveying about our own personal search for meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I would never recommend an idea or explanation as the sole truth. I believe it is important to take the best from each idea and to take what best works for you.

Severe incidents of human cruelty are mentioned, yet this book sends an uplifting and inspiring message to all. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For all the reviews this work has recieved that cry for &quot;scientific method&quot; and fact, I ask you to remove your isolated, removed, academe blinders and look closer. You may find a work that contains both abstract theory meshed with concrete life experience. Nietzsche states the only writing he trusts is that which is &quot;written with blood&quot;. Read closer and you might find the sublime scientific method evident in passages like: &quot;We who lived in the concentration camps can still remember the men who went from hut to hut comforting others giving up their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number but they offer sufficent proof that everything can be taken away from a man except on thing--the last of his freedoms. To choose one's attidute in any given circumstance, to choose one's own way.&quot; The existental reality of the choice and the harsh grim reality of suffering.

There were many instances descibed in this book where I found similaritiesin my emotional make-up although my sufferings were no where near that dramatic and &quot;hopeless&quot;.In the words of Nietzsche : &quot;He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW,&quot; I found peace within chaos.Although I did not understand some of the more difficult arguments, the book set me on the path to findmy own meaning of life and the courage to live. I think that the meaning of life need not be one thing oraction but can be several but I can only think of one thing now. The meaning of my life now is totouch the people I know or care about in the most tender and deep way I know how. And to see them happy evenfor a brief moment by what I do for them is quite enough.

The majority of this work which chronicles the atrocities of and his horrid experiences in the death camps (a more representative term than &quot;concentration camps&quot;) stand as a testament to the &quot;defiant power of the human spirit.&quot; The latter two chapters on the tenets of logotherapy are contained merely for the academically inclined. Moreover, Frankl's experiences validate that &quot;To live is to suffer. To survive is to find meaning in the suffering.&quot; Furthermore, his experiences support his infrequently cited &quot;equations of meaning&quot;: &quot;Despair=Suffering-Meaning&quot; whereas &quot;Hope=Suffering+Meaning!&quot; This book is a gift to us - a gift to transcend our materialism and actualize our inherent human spirituality. By doing so, Frankl endows us with love and challenges us to discover and actualize our own unique meaning(s) in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have used this book in all 3 ways, spiritually, emotionally and in my therapy practice.Spiritually the existential philosophy is made practical and relateable to the real world. He has taken the essence of existentialism without the dark brooding arrogance of the modern day philosopher to seperate from the ideas.Emotionally, Frankl faced horrors we can never know and remained a caring man. He blazed a path for others to follow by finding a purpose to live for and accepting both responsiblity AND freedom of choice in all situations.In therapy, I found Frankls ideas useful when my client is overwhelmed with the question of &quot;why?&quot; Frankls lessons have led me to ask the return question &quot;how will you respond in the face of this, even if you never know why?&quot;His book is about philosophy applied to tradgey and the human spirit. I highly recommmend it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm actually a little surprised this book has such a high rating. I enjoyed it, and it was a very powerful book but I would have liked to know that this book focused so much on the theory and origin of logotherapy.This book was recommended to me by a family member who thought very highly of this book. Indeed, it was a very powerful book, yet (perhaps since it was written quite a time ago), it didn't connect or flow in the ways I was hoping it to. A book about the horrors of the holocaust- absolutely. A book about the foundations of the author's theory \\"logotherapy\\"?- yes. The meaning of life?- eh.The author seems to spend an extended amount of time reflecting on his experiences in Nazi death camps, which were terrible and captivating, but became redundant. And although I had little interest in logotherapy to start with, I was open to learning more about it. I found the descriptions to be quite dense and forced, his attempt to describe logotherapy was sometimes a bit awkward and came off at times like a poorly written textbook. Specifically, the examples given about logotherapy I found sometimes to not be the best, sometimes the examples being more about other theories or not logotherapy at all.Overall, not a bad book at all, I just found the title and descriptions to be misleading. This book has a lot to take in, and once you read it through it maybe worth going back to certain sections to fully be able to digest Frankl's material.op"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Every human being should read this book.

And what if there were nothing, no savior, no relief, no narcotic or dream--nothing--! to keep us from falling into life's absurdities, crazinesses, meaninglessneses...Would it still be worth living to its fullest? Frankl says of course it is, if we could just keep our hearts hopeful. (My interpretation is, &quot;Things'll be better, if I can make it to Thursday&quot;.) Do you see? In spite of the philosophical/scientific lingo on his chapters on logotherapy and the fact that perhaps we'll never be in such dire circumstances as he experienced at the concentration camps, Frankl is telling us, if anything, life is worth living because of all the good things and good people that are here around us and that we can find...even during genocide or war or personal trauma.

However, science is not the only way of approaching these things. Where would literature be if it was all scientific? OK, that's not the best view. How about this -- isn't there room for crossover between what we so readily divide into &quot;science&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot;?? Isn't there science and philosophy in literature, and can't there also be literature in science and philosophy? Viktor Frankl has written a book you may not have expected -- neither did I. Nevertheless, there is truth in his view of our ability to give ourselves meaning. There is a scientific way of approaching this -- quantum physics, biology, anthropology, cultural theories and neurological studies of the &quot;will&quot; in the mind -- but Frankl has approached truth in a different way.

One only needs to look at the terribly gaunt facesstaring from the pictures taken at some of the camps to shudder at the thought of the horrific experiences of these unfortunate people. For the lucky few who survived, only to discover their entire families were exterminated, existence most certainlyseemed meaningless.By all accounts, Victor Frankel should have easily succumbed to a destructive behavior immediately after his liberation from a camp in Bohemia. Surviving some of the mosthorrific encounters of those times, including overcoming a deadly case of typhoid fever, he was informed that his wife, his father, mother, and brother were all killed in various camps. Rather than commit suicide, he struggled to find meaning in his survival. It was this search for meaning that shaped the idea for a new brand in psychotherapy calledLogotherapy. Through this therapy, which literary means \\"healing through reason,\\" he helped numerous patients focus on the challenges of their personal search for meaning in life. It would do justice to mention that he found a way to cope with his losses, marry, have a daughter, two grandchildren, and a great granddaughter.

Even though the two parts of the book could be considered independent, after reading the first one you will understand how the theory introduced in the second part is developed.You would agree or not with the theory itself, you could even say there is some advertisement, but this book will make you think on the subject anyway, on both such cruel facts and mental health."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"My husband really enjoyed this book, I wasn't that thrilled with it.

He explains his experiences in a concentration camp. In his book he explains the experiences which led to his discovery of logotherapy and his main premise details why life holds a potential meaning under any condition. The main premises and conclusions are:* Do not aim at success the more you aim at it and make if a target the more you are going to miss it* Three things prisoners felt upon entering concentration camps shock, apathy, and delusion* When they say a prisoner smoking his own cigarettes they knew he had given up on faith* Frankl wasn't one of those whom shock of admission greatly depressed. He smiled at a prisoner who told him he was in danger* Dreams were more of a regression at retreat to a more primitive form of mental life. His wishes and desires became obvious in his dreams* Sensitive people were able to retreat from their terrible surroundings to a life of inner riches and spiritual freedom and survived better than those of robust native* He understood how a man who has nothing left still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved* He says love goes beyond physical person it finds its deepest meaning in spiritual being his innerself, whether or not their alive is of no importance. Fate was one's master and that one must not try to influence it in any way* They did not bare their sufferings with a genuine achievement. There is one thing I dread not to be worthy of my sufferings* It is this spiritual freedom which can not be taken away that makes life meaningful and purposefully correct* A man who could not see the end of his provisional existence was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. Therefore his inner life changed regarding our provisional existence as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing prisoners to lose their hold on life* Emotion ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it* He who has a why to live can bear any how* If someone knows why they want to live you will be able to deal with whatever if takes to live* Life ultimately means taking responsibility to find right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which if constantly sets for each individual* For tears bare witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer* He talks about commonplace truth no one has right to do wrong not even if wrong has been done to them* Person whose memory alone had given him courage in camp did not exist anymore when the day of his dreams finally came he found it so different from all he had longed for* How do we examine what we think what are we trying to unmask in concentration camp the people became who they were deep down there is a way in which we as people are unmasking certain opinion* Bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph to turn one's predicament into a human achievement* Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now* Just because life has no meaning we do not sit back and do nothing the fact that we are in the world serves no purpose* Human being is not in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy and through actualizing the potential meaning inherent dormant in a given situation* Emotion are meaningful reasonable or unreasonable as they conform to reason or fail to conform. Heart never takes place of head but should obey itI believe all of his arguments are good however he does make a few mistakes. Frankl talks about determinism and how man needs this, but determinism is self refuting that's how it falls on this principal. He also say how the heart should never take place of head but if it didn't he would not have made it through those camps He uses the emotions as a way for man to deal with the hard life of the concentration camps. Frankl commits no fallacy but points one out about two wrongs not making it right as a way to compensate for what has happen to the prisoners. I think he is very fair in the since that he does not talk bad about the abuse nor does he present his argument as a person who has been brutally beaten in a concentration camp.When I first read this book I was a little upset because I felt like the voices of the people who died and suffered in these camps were not heard. Later as I went through to evaluate the argument I realized how important it was to understand it like Frankl had mention He uses strong ideas when dealing with difficult situations and I believe this as well. In conclusion I feel Frankl did a good job in his arguments for logotherapy and survival in the words of C. S. Lewis either the premise is already concealed in the imperative or conclusion is the indicative."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Surely topics and questions that have not been sufficiently answered since time began (whenever that was).My paperback copy was swiped off the shelf of my maternal grandmother's; no telling how much she payed for it at the time,(25 cents maybe for a 1960's copy?).I loved this book, even though it deals with horrific realities in a concentration camp.Victor Frankl's experiences in the camp at Aushwitz are herein related. Also, threaded within that account are his reflections on the human psyche's response to such horrifying treatment which gave credence and further insight into his own developing system of psychotherapy, later termed logotherapy. His life's work was hidden within his coat, but the Nazi's confiscated and destroyed his manuscript upon arrival at the camp. He would spend whatever precious moments of personal freedom to scribble his thoughts on whatever he could find to keep those thoughts alive.What made the most lasting impression on me was his describing that first day at Aushwitz when the Nazi's, from a sick and twisted interpretation/understanding of Matthew 25:33, divided all of the arrivals into two groups, one to be gassed and the other to survive and go through a hellish ordeal at the unmerciful mercy of their captors. My thoughts on the Nazi's action in that instance is that they must not have read in their Bibles where God says \\"Vengeance is mine says the Lord, I will repay\\" which is found in both the Old and New Testaments, and to Abraham and his descendants \\"I will curse those who curse thee\\" Genesis 12:3.Frankl's Logotherapy has benefitted such groups of people suffering from depression and other severe forms of mental disturbances."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Seriously? I enjoyed the book but it is so outrageously over-hyped I have to wonder what a spoiled pack of brats the people who consider this book to be life changing are.Quick summation of the book.

If you don't have something outside of your immediate circumstances to look forward to you will be broken.Enjoyable read, ridiculously over-hyped."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I was anticipating this read so much that when I finally started reading it, it was a slow and drawn out first section of the book. There are basically two parts to the book: one is Viktor's experience in the Nazi camps and the other is his examination of the effects on him and others he observed. The first part of the book is what \\"killed\\" it for me. Too much detail and just too long for what he's trying to get to. The second part of the book is much better, but not what I thought it would be. Overall, this book is highly raved about by speakers, leaders, etc but I think it's just because the overall them of the book, not because the book is so great."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As many stories introduce themselves, there are many times a main character who plays a strong influence in the books' effect on the person reading it. The reader will often be able to connect to the main character through similarities that they share. It could also be the willpower or determined personality that lure the reader closer to the main character. In the case of Man's Search for Meaning, this was exactly what happened to me. I was hooked by the first page. The author really allowed me to think about for who and what I am living for. If I were to put myself in his optimistic shoes, I would realize that there is no way I could have gone through what he did with the positive attitude that he had. Not only were his personality traits shining through the cover of the book into my mind, but alson adding to the books' real meaning.My favorite personality trait would be Viktor's inspirational glow on life. His powerful quotes fill the magical pages with truth and acceptance to his new life in the camps. He teaches us that we need to sit back and just think about the true meaning in our lives. He is sure that he will get out of the camps alive and be able to share his story with the world. He overall just believed in what he said and was confident that everything would turn out okay.Throughout Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor's personality traits shined out to me like a lightning bug in a dark night sky. In the camps he had a way of helping other prisoners get their hopes up and many others to find their meaning in life. It was his personality that pulled him through all his hardships."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"&quot;victor frankl manages to communicate, with the fewest words possible and no matter our life situation, why life is worth living&quot;."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If you've never been real comfortable with Freud or Jung then this book could be just right for you.

The narrative is paramount! Frankl's experiences serve to validate that &quot;To live is to suffer. To survive is to find meaning in the suffering.&quot; Furthermore, his experiences support his infrequently cited &quot;equations of meaning.&quot; Namely, &quot;Despair=Suffering-Meaning&quot; whereas &quot;Hope=Suffering+Meaning!&quot; Through this book Frankl has bequeathed a gift to us - a gift endowing us with the absolute knowledge of our inherent spirituality, bestowing upon us the existence of the Love of God and challenging us to discover and actualize the unique meaning(s) in our lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search For Meaning is a great way to get into the mind of a World War II concentration camp survivor.

There is much meaning to draw from it and apply to your own life. Very insightful generally speaking, the audio doesn't detract.

Only recently it has been published in English. It still rings true, written by a Nazi concentration camp inmate, Dr. Viktor Frankl. He originally wanted to be an anonymous author; however, his friends persuaded him to publish under his own name to give the book credibility. Readers could therefore also understand this is a psychiatrist's objective view of suffering, which is part of life, and why life and hope prevail in the darkest moments.Part One, Experiences in a Concentration Camp is key to all he learned on the meaning of life. The horrible losses and inhumanity are seared into your mind, but when Dr. Frankl looks at the horror with educated eyes, he recognizes courage, objectivity and responsibility as vital for survival. This is a story of a man who was sent to the concentration camp with a belief that if he had to suffer and die, it would be significant: he would not suffer nor die for nothing.Dr. Frankl reviews the fight for survival and his decisions that somehow help him survive. He notes that prisoners go through three phases, 1)shock: the period following his admission 2)apathy: the period where they they become well entrenched in camp routine, and 3)the sense of loss, where they lose everything but hope. He digs down deep in his own soul to helps others to go on and have meaning in their life - not to give up and find the basic motivation to go on. He teaches despairing men \\"that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but what life expected from us.\\" Dr. Frankl repeats, \\"if we have the \\"why\\" we will always find the \\"how\\" to go on.\\"This book shows each individual he is important and every decision he makes is impactful. Therefore, make the right decisions and be triumphant. Right decisions cause the least pain and give the most love for fellow man. It is what gives us hope and value as part of humanity.Part Two, Logo-Therapy in a Nutshell, was not as interesting to me. It describes Frankl's philosophy of logo-therapy and reminded me of of mid-eastern religions as well as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It is a way (Frankl calls it \\"neo-dynamics\\") to have a goal in mind and achieve it no matter what obstacles and stress you are facing. The things that make life important and with meaning are different for each of us. All of us can have a meaning of life, but the \\"big picture meaning\\" is hard to understand. It takes us a lifetime of good and bad events and decisions to shape us.Part Three, is a postscript on \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and states that despite the \\"tragic triad\\" (as it is called in Logo-Therapy) 1)pain, 2)guilt, and 3)death - how is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that? Logo-therapy teaches there are three main avenues on which one arrives at meaning in life. The first is creating a work or by doing a deed. The second is by experiencing something or encountering someone, and the third is turning a personal tragedy into a triumph. He mentions using bad situations as a growth experience.Overall a deep book but a good book on looking at life.

Dr. Frankl endured the horrors of three Nazi concentration camps and then thankfully lived to document his experience and, more to the point, the effects of the camps' conditions on himself, his colleagues, and his oppressors.The book's first part contains Dr. Frankl's observances of human nature in the concentration camps, while the second part discusses his technique of logotherapy. Logotherapy, in contrast to Freudian techniques, doesn't immerse itself in childhood conflicts and sexual frustration. Logotherapy instead asserts that humans ultimately desire to know and live the meaning of their lives above all else.He cites his staying alive in the camps for his wife, who at one point resided in an adjacent barracks yards away, as an example of how meaning in his own life inspired his survival. He also discusses being kept alive by his drive to further develop his ideas and theories about the human quest for meaning, which he actually began forming before entering the camps. These two examples cover the main ways he says humans find meaning -- in relationships and in their life's work.He also discusses suffering with dignity and the function of an inner spiritual life as a respite from harsh and humiliating conditions.

However, if you are looking for a book that chronicles the experiences, this is not necessarily the one you want to get.The book does an excellent job at presenting a few ideas regarding the psychology of suffering, taking as a case example the concentration camps. However, it is somewhat fragmented and does not present a coherent, complete story of Frankl's experiences.As I said before, that was not the intent of the author in writing this book. His intent, rather, was to look at the experiences of individuals with suffering. One of the take home messages for me was that suffering can bring out the very best in some and the very worst in others.He refers to meaning as one of the prime motivators and quotes Nietzche twice: (1) That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger; and (2) He who has a why to live can bear almost any how. He also expresses profound wisdom in explaining that some prisoners would go around comforting the others and even giving away their last piece of bread, proving that they can take away anything but a person's ability to choose how s/he will respond to any given situation.The only reason why this gets four stars is that I think Frankl would have an AMAZING book if he would have incorporated a more complete telling of his experiences in the concentration camp. For the most part, he only talks about the most basic details in order to talk mostly about the psychology of the camps.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the psychology of individuals, especially when they are suffering.

In \\"Man's Search For Meaning,\\" he tells readers about his experiences in Auschwitz concentration camp, and how he discovered logotherapy by going through this horrible experience. In case you are wondering, the object and challenge and challenge of logotherapy is to put together ties of meaning and responsibility in people's lives, and actually make themselves feel important.Dr. Viktor E. Frankl was a long time prisoner in various concentration camps. There he was stripped of his feeling of existence. His mother, father, brother, and wife were sent to gas chambers and killed. Everyone in his family, except his sister, unfortunately died in these concentration camps. He went many days without eating or sleeping, in brutally freezing temperatures. Knowing that every single day he was on the brink of extermination, how did he still find life worth living? That is what this book really sums up in one word, logotherapy.All of Frankl's stories in this book ring true to anyone that suffered the tortures of these concentration camps. He views the human spirit with compassion and truth. It really makes his experiences worth listening to. Even though I, certainly, have never been in a concentration camp I felt that Frankl's words and feelings were shown greatly in his writing. It is definitely not a cakewalk to talk about your past when it has such a difficult history. This really shows that you do not have to be quiet about dark emotions. Do not feel burdened to be silent when you know you were the one who experienced such tragedies.I have never liked reading about the concentration camps in Europe, because those thoughts are not comforting to someone who does not want to face the reality of it. This was very detailed and specific on all the accounts in the camps. Although, it also was very clear on logotherapy, so needless to say it was very dry. The message that the book made obvious to me was that we cannot forget the past, but cannot dwell on it either. The grass is always greener on the other side, and we always must move on no matter where life takes us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book shook me to the core.I had a huge breakthrough.I read it six times and will probably read it six more.Buy it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is a tantalizing book. Victor E. Frankl wrote the novel after his experience in a concentration camp where he tested and created his psychotheraputic theories. It was a short reader, not even 600 pages and while the first half was somewhat disturbing, it being about his exerience in the camp, but the second half is a little slow, it becomes monotonous and a little dull because it is about his development of Logotherapy. This book is good for the intellectual type but I do not suggest that any tom, dick or sue just pick it up to curl up with at the window seat on a rainy saturday. Thats just about it, nothing that exciting but what are you gunna do its about the haulocaust...."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Before one goes through this book it's worth picking up a copy of the April 2000 issue of the Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 35, Number 2, and reading carefully the essay by Timothy Pytell, \\"The Missing Pieces of the Puzzle: A Reflection on the Odd Career of Viktor Frankl.\\" Pytell established that Frankl spent 3 or 4 days at Auschwitz and 2 years at Theresienstadt, but he falsified the story to give readers the impression that he had spent at least half a year at Auschwitz. Phrases like \\"the same shirts for half a year\\" account for Pytell's judgment that \\"any reader ... will be stunned to discover that Frankl spent only a few days in Auschwitz.\\" This is not an honest book.I only give it 2 stars because I did find some of the later philosophizing to be interesting. Frankl's thesis about how humans are able to survive through great torments when they feel they have found a meaning in life rings true. But the point would have been better gotten across if the first part of the book had been honestly written as a novel about a fictional character who might possibly resemble a real person somewhere in history. Instead, Frankl tried to pass this off as an autobiography of himself and for that he deserves to be slammed hard."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I am a widow, and this book was recommended to me by a psychologist to help lift my spirits. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how page after page of descriptions of life under the nazis is supposed to help anyone with anything. I was already aware that many people have had to go through even worse things than watching a beloved spouse die of cancer, awful as that is. Certainly Mr. Frankel's experience and response to it is a tribute to the human spirit -- proof that we are more resillient than we think. But uplifting? No, I don't think so. Depressing, with no new information, is my synopsis. More power to those who can comfort themselves with some \\"meaning\\" in suffering and get something out of this book.

That if you can convince youself you have something to live for: you will continue to live for it. So? If after getting hit on the head with a lead pipe 100x one is to receive ten million dollars, I suppose there are some who will endure that pain, too, in the hope they will survive. They won't.Perhaps the real question is if there is *any* reward for enduring the brutality of life that is worth the suffering. Most, if not virtually all, love relationships are based on a thinly or not-so thinly disguised basis of psychology mercantilism, if not outright economic dealmaking. Other higher pursuits: art, philosophy, philanthropy, so-called spiritual attainment are arguably better, but, really, are little more than panaceas not much different, in their ultimate purpose, than devoting one's life to developing the perfect tennis game, for instance. They absorb one's attention and distract one's focus from the pain &amp; dissolution to come, or even occuring, &amp; keep one, perhaps, from ending it all at the very moment. In this manner, we all buoy each other up, but for what? The question remains unanswered. Life is a concentration camp and we are all going to the gas chamber in the end. What do we do in the meantime. Is it worth it?Frankl, like any reasonably intelligent person, delineates the central problem well: Why live? But like every other professional philosopher or psychologist, he comes up with a reason (altho in this case the reason boils down to *find a reason*) because, well, what else is he going to do? The biological imperative compels us to go on with life at any price. The alternative: that there is no reason to do so--that is simply too terrifying to contemplate, would violate species survival, and be considered unpublishable. Just once I'd like to see a thinker have the courage to face the ultimate question and not flinch, escape to a flight of fancy, take a leap of *faith* or otherwise dissemble.Life is not worth living. Don't blink."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I realize that this book probably has historical significance for the field of psychotherapy. Parts One (Concentration Camp) and Two (Logotherapy) were originally published in Austria in 1946. The author, apparently a distinguished psychiatrist, spent three years in Nazi concentration camps when he was in his late 30s. His education was circa 1920s-30s, at the University of Vienna (Freudian influences certainly abounded at that time.)From a 2003 (and a layperson's) perspective, this book touches upon many ideas, and not in a particularly concise or unified way. These ideas, from my perspective, are often the embryonic stages and \\"seeds\\" of thought often more specifically and fully expressed in future and current psychology. Interestingly, he questions pure Freudian theory--maybe this was fairly novel in 1946. Self actualization, self-transcendence, finding an authentic self are ideas later espoused by Maslow, Dr. Phil MacGraw, and other psychologists. Perhaps the book would have been more effective for me if I had read it in 1946, but I wasn't born yet. I believe the best audience for it in 2003 are psychologists/psychiatrists--there are ideas/\\"seeds\\" for graduate students to expound upon and develop.I much prefer The Diary of Ann Frank, or The Pianist, in terms of artfulness and my developing empathy for the characters, than Frankl's somewhat detached professional espousal of Holocaust atrocities. A dated, sometimes rambling discourse. The 1984 postscript seems \\"cobbled onto\\" the original. There are 40 pages of bibliography that append the book-is this included for hisprofessional audience? Not uninteresting, but not worth revisiting."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I ordered this book for myself after one of the other women on the tour suggested it. I've only read a few chapters. It's not a book you can't put down. I haven't had any free time to go back and read more of it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Reading this book was largely a waste of my time. Frankel does not set forth a literary experiment in an attempt to prove a hypothesis. Rather, he gives the hypothesis and then assumes the hypothesis to prove his beliefs. Frankel commits the cardinal sin of writing a persuasive work: he assumes his theory is correct instead of proving it. He never even attempts to prove it. This man needs to learn the scientific method. As a persuasive work, this volume is woefully inadequate."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Looking, for the moment, beyond the glaring and obvious problems with the supposed philsophy Mr. Frankl provides in this book and getting to the, in this case, much more important issue, which is the overall negative effect and even immense pain that this writing not only already has caused but continues to cause persons, well, I both feel and think it important to state that this is the most reprehensible book I have ever read. His opinions when it comes to therapy are unhealthy to say the least and his entire theory is groundless and irrational.In this book, Mr. Frankl admits to telling a man that the meaning to that man's life since the death of his beloved wife was to feel pain! Mr. Frankl even went on to tell that poor man whom for whatever reason bought into his proprietary brand of crazy, termed \\"logotherapy,\\" that he should embrace the pain and even nurture the pain so as to be able to feel it more fully. What??? Therapy??? Psychosis?Viktor Frankl is, in my opinion, a mentally-ill person whose book has caught on for some reason yet unknown to me. There is no meaning to be found anywhere around this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had been meaning for several years to read this seminal work but had two reservations in doing so: first, with images of the Holocaust already seared in my mind from films and documentaries, I was hesitant to read what I assumed would be even more graphic descriptions of life in a concentration camp; second, even accepting that Frankl's first-person narrative of life in the camps is important both in historical and moral terms, I had planned to read Part I and dispense with the section describing Logotherapy, believing it would be too inaccessible to the lay person.I was absolutely wrong on both counts.As one trained in probing the psyche, it is understandable that Frankl's account of Auschwitz and Dachau would focus on prisoners' mindsets and reactions to the extreme multiple pressures that they faced. It was surprising, however, to see the degree to which he refrained from employing more vivid descriptions of the state of human anatomy, rank brutality, personal weakness, etc. This is especially interesting given the fact that Frankl set down his thoughts not in hindsight, but initially while still impounded. By emphasizing the actions and reactions of the camps' internees while describing the despicable acts of their captors in the most basic terms, Frankl actually produces an even more gripping and insightful narrative.Having completed Part I, I moved immediately to Part II on Logotherapy, anxious to see how Frankl would construct a new framework of professional analysis based on the numbing, near-shattering environment that he had survived. Eventually I found that I had been informally using some aspects of Logotherapy in reviewing the course of my own life from time to time and that his three-part framework for living - discerning meaning in productivity, meaning in relations with others and striving for a consistent sense of dignity when experiencing unavoidable suffering - resonated loudly in me. Frankl connects the dots between his camp experiences and observations and the development and implementation of Logotherapy quite well, with very limited jargon, and with a stark conclusion.I hesitated before embracing this work. Don't."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I read this book during the weekend. I had to write a report on it for psychology class in college, and the book was presented in such a way that I could not put it down. It's a good book for detailed account and experience for one person at the concentration camp, and it also helps teach that at some point no matter how bad an experience one undergoes, you have to learn from it and move on. I have to admit that I think this book changed me since the time I read it 10 years ago. I have become more adaptive to negative and extreneous situations. It's the only book in college that I really completely read and enjoyed.I commend Dr. Frankl for writting this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I wish I read this 20 years ago, it would have created a whole new perspective on my life. I won't repeat what many of the other fine reviewers have mentioned, but will add the following:According to Frankl, man's search for meaning is his primary motivation for life, not a secondary rationalization.Existential Vacuum, in today's Modern Society, we all have basic food, and shelter, we all can survive (thank goodness we don't have to endure what Frankl had to), we are all comfortable in our existence, and yet this comfort creates boredom, and therefore, our search for meaning is even more compounded. Thus is what Frankl refers to as existential vacuum, we exist today day to day, but do so in a vacuum of existence, until we know our meaning.Man should not ask what is the meaning of life, but rather BE asked. In response, man must answer in his responsible, to whom is he responsible to, to what, to whom?True meaning is discovered in the world, not within man himself. Seek out your experiences, the meaning is out there in the world, not within yourself.You cannot avoid untentional suffering, but you can change your attitude towards it, to give suffering a meaning to you.Live your life as though you were living it the second time. View life as a series of movie frames, the ending and meaning may not be apparent until the very end of the movie, and yet, each of the hundreds of individual frames has meaning within the context of the whole movie.View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? what would you have wanted to accomplish but didn't? what were the happy moments? what were the sad? what would you do again, and what you wouldn't?A must read for anyone searching for a deeper meaning in life.

However after reading it, I have nothing but good things to say. The first part of the book details the author's experiences in several concentration camps during WWII. These experiences are sometimes painful to read but don't go into such a level of depth as to be excrutiating. Also, the experiences are used to make points, not just for the sake of showing how bad these camps were.The second half is used to describe the author's brand of psychotherapy called logotherapy--used to help a patient find a meaning to life. The author is fond of quoting Nietzche &quot;A man who has a why to live can bear with any how,&quot; which is the heart of his theory.Overall, this book is suprisingly uplifting and contains several very positive messages which anyoone can put to use in their own lives. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book portrays the incredible journey of Dr. Viktor Frankl. He survived the horrors of Auschwitz and Dachau, but his brutal experience ironically served as the basis for his life's work. He created a branch of psychiatry called logotherapy, which signifies, \\"therapy of meaning.\\" The work is compelling, candid, motivating, and at times, humorous. Dr. Frankl has an uplifting writing style, and is an excellent observer of events that most people would banish forever from their memories. His unselfish desire to tell his story, despite the painful reminders, should be appreciated by all who cherish human dignity.Dr. Frankl had a rare perspective. A trained medical doctor with a specialty in psychiatry, he was placed in a unique situation. He was able to observe his own reactions to the daily rigors of a concentration camp, along with the behavior of his captors and fellow prisoners from the eyes of a psychiatrist. He chronicles the cruelty not only of the Nazis, but also from some of the other prisoners. Yet throughout his brutal experience, he was able to find meaning in his own suffering. Unlike most of us, he was able to translate his own suffering to help his fellow man.Upon his arrival at Auschwitz, a manuscript containing his life's work was taken from him. From that point on, he relinquished his former life. Very few people learned that he was a doctor, although there were times when he volunteered his services to care for typhus patients. It is ironic that the lost manuscript, his \\"mental child,\\" did not force him to lose all hope. If anything, the reader sees that Dr. Frankl's loss became his meaning for life. His documented experience is now the world's collective gain. This book is a tremendous work of one man's search for meaning, his survival against all odds, along with the triumphant victory of his human spirit.In a time when many of us question the meaning of life after the terrorist bombings, Dr. Frankl's lucid commentary provides a welcome elixir. His message provides hope, courage, and inspiration. Two quotes stand out: \\"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms, to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\" And the second. \\"Live as if you were living for the second time, and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.\\"Thank you for the opportunity to review this inspirational story."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a lovely book. The ideas are innovative & thought provoking and probably worthy of 5 stars. But I think Frankl would respect reviewers who don't give him 5 stars because he is not intent on getting everyone to believe in one set of ideas or one way of interpreting the world. He wants each person to consider creating their own philosophies and meanings. He was not primarily a student of one previously existing psychological discipline; instead, he set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories. This book is worth consideration, even if you find yourself disagreeing with him regularly. I encourage you to make your own evauations of the things he has to say.I disagree with his position that happiness and success \\"cannot be pursued\\"; especially given that his Logotherapy is \\"not pessimistic but rather activistic.\\" In the same way that his Logotherapy does not consider the \\"will to meaning\\" as a secondary drive to either the will to power or pleasure, I do not consider the will to happiness or will to success to be secondary or passive byproducts to other \\"primary\\" pursuits. He asserts happiness & success only ensue \\"as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it . . . success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.\\" I respectfully disagree. When I read this, alarms go off in my head, like when I hear that G n' R song that suggests \\"patience\\" is the solution to whatever the problem was. Or when I hear people say, \\"There's nothing anyone can do, so just give it to God.\\" Or \\"That's just the way it is and some things will never change.\\" Oh, don't you believe them. As Frankl may tell you in his recounting of the vacuum of morality & humanity in the concentration camps - when God doesn't address problems in a healthy, ethical or timely manner, sometimes the existential response is to ask God to give the problems back to you so you can try to fix them sooner.Another criticism of his happiness and success theories is that they seem to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Yes, he doesn't believe the self interested drives to power and pleasure are dominant or primary. But he goes further to suggest that happiness & success are primarily achieved through \\"surrender\\" to another person or external cause. Yes, Freudian psychoanalysis can lead to neuroses by focusing too much on oneself. But I think better therapeutic solutions are found by giving value and acknowledgement to BOTH self interests AND the interests of others. To exclude either can lead to dishonest, inconsiderate, or harmful results. Frankl sometimes frames options as needing to choose one OR the other (too often mutually exclusive), and I think he does not consider the option of doing BOTH at key times. Also, he sometimes concedes to an acceptance of suffering more often than I would encourage.I agree with Frankl that we are not only defined by the circumstances that occur to us. We are defined by how we interpret them and how we respond to them. Whether a person believes in Logotherapy or any other therapy, I think Frankl, in his examples of his therapeutic work with patients, does a good job of getting across the concept that positive changes can occur when people consider alternate ways of perceiving the actions and behaviors happening around them, and consider new ways of responding to them.Any therapy can be tough, because most therapeutic processes involve losses of pride. They often involve a person making concessions - concessions about their long held, immutable or fundamental core defining beliefs and perspectives. They often involve considering foreign, and previously personally taboo perspectives. And it takes powerful forces sometimes to get some people to consider making such hard concessions - forces such as: potentially losing a loved one, or losing both the House & the Senate and realizing different \\"mighty mandates\\" are in town. (Thank God for democracy and free speech because even when they don't always lead to better policies, they at least promote change.)The Nazis believed that not everyone can or should be allowed to succeed because of their race, religion, status, or philosophies. Frankl's response to the cruel world the Nazis created was to suggest that each individual should be judged by the conduct of their character - by how they responded each day to each hand they were dealt. \\"Former prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing influence of all was that a prisoner could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. He had been given no date for his release.\\" Yet each day, prisoners like Frankl chose to respond in the best ways they could under the circumstances. I don't think Frankl wrote primarily because he wanted to become your therapist. I think he wrote to inspire each individual to become so well read and diversely read on religion, ethics, and psychological theories that they become one of their own best therapists. And I thank him for his contributions to encourage each of us in that pursuit.I started this review by mentioning Frankl set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories. And I finish this review by thanking an old friend, a woman who chose to fight me tooth and nail to encourage me to start to do the same."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a great book written by the worlds greatest psychiatrist since Sigmund Freud...

Why suffer through anything? Why stick with something when it seems almost hopeless? The true lesson of this book is : Through your suffering, you have the chance to touch the future. Frankl reminds us always that no matter what trials we suffer through, our ability to find a meaning in our suffering, to make sure that someone, somewhere learns from it and makes an impact in their life, is truly one of the greatest lessons of all. For such a small price I can't even fathome how useful this lesson is. Everyone who reads this book is a better person at the end.

I was recommended this book and when I first time I picked up I made it to the title page and lost interest after seeing the subtitle: an introduction to logotherapy. A while late the book was again recommended to me, this time by another person, and I became determined to read past the subtitle.Although this is &quot;An introduction to Logotherapy&quot; the implications of this book are much more profound then simply a psychology text-book or a do-it-yourself self-help book. This book does not play the part of creating a sugared life, denying that real struggles, real trials, and real pain do exist. But in acknowledging suffering, this book does not attach meaninglessness to life, which is so easy to do when a person does profoundly suffer. Instead Frankl asserts a beauty to life that is inclusive of both suffering and meaning.In one of the many beautiful passages in the book, Frankl states that, &quot;What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaninglessness of life; but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningfulness in rational terms.&quot;This book manages to transcend psychology and the usual &quot;self-help&quot; books to express in sincere and honest terms that life is worth living.

He was already advocating a practice of logotherapy; people need to feel a purpose to their lives in order to overcome grief, guilt, and death. Through this lens he writes about his imprisonment and the importance of finding meaning to get through the experience.Frankl asserts that people can find meaning in three places; through some great work or achievement, in the love they hold for another person, and through suffering for a purpose.

Frankl, reached in the course of more than three years in a succession of four Nazi concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The book he wrote in the space of nine days in 1946, originally under another title, morphed over the years into the thin volume known around the world today as Man's Search for Meaning. It has sold more than 12 million copies and been translated into 24 languages, serving as a source of inspiration and solace for millions of people. Man's Search for Meaning is frequently cited as one of the most important books of the 20th Century.Frankl's almost matter-of-fact description of his years in concentration camps is profoundly moving, the more so because it's a fiercely personal document and makes no attempt to relate the familiar statistics now surrounding the topic or to place the Nazi phenomenon in historic perspective. Frankl writes simply about how he personally managed to remain hopeful in the face of staggering brutality, including the murder of his young wife at Bergen-Belsen and the death of numberless friends and colleagues. As Frankl relates, their deaths came not only at the hands of SS guards but also, at least equally, as the result of sadistic behavior by the \\"Capos,\\" prisoners themselves raised to positions of authority and privilege by the Nazis. The effect of reading this material is searing. Here, God is truly in the details.However, Frankl's story about life in the concentration camps is only one of several parts in Man's Search for Meaning. The edition I read included five pieces written over more than half a century by three different authors: a foreword by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, an Afterword by William J. Winslade, and three articles by Frankl. The first of these three, \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp,\\" has received the most attention from non-professionals. The second, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell,\\" is Frankl's brief summary of the principles and procedures of logotherapy, the \\"third school\\" of Viennese psychiatry that Frankl created -- an approach that's often termed \\"existential psychiatry.\\" (Somehow, Carl Jung seems to have gotten lost in the numbering system -- perhaps because he was Swiss, not Viennese.) Frankl also wrote a \\"Postscript 1984&#8243; bearing the title, \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\" And all this writing fits comfortably into a remarkably thin little volume.Intellectually, Frankl's abbreviated introduction to logotherapy for the layperson, was the most intriguing part of the book. The term itself is derived from the much-used Greek word, logos, which has been applied to all manner of pursuits in philosophy, rhetoric, and religion. Frankl took it to mean something like \\"meaning.\\" He rejected the determinism of Freudian and Adlerian psychiatry, insisting that neither approach was useful in treating more than a minority of psychological problems. In his own practice and that of the students under his supervision in a series of top Viennese hospitals, Frankl found that many psychological problems could be easily cured by one or a few conversations between the patient and the logotherapist. Logotherapy involved no years-long sojourns on the analyst's couch. (In fact, patients sat in chairs.) He cites many cases of ingrained phobic and compulsive behavior that he and his disciples cured by somehow convincing patients not to worry about their behavior. A lifelong stutterer, for example, was cured when he was persuaded to enter conversations unconcerned about stuttering -- and the cure was lasting. A fellow physician transcended his depression over the loss of his wife in a single, short conversation with Frankl. The essential truth of logotherapy is as Frankl discovered in the camps: so long as we maintain a powerful commitment to some life goal outside our present circumstances, we can get through practically any privation.Man's Search for Meaning should be in everyone's library. The lessons Viktor Frankl teaches can be applied to challenges in any culture and all walks of life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very thought provoking that gives you a look both into life in a concentration camp and why and how many of us cope. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book has been a college required reading in some schools.It tells of a man living in a concentration camp in implorable conditions. He observes how human nature drives some of the prisioners and the ways their lives are lived simply through the mind and the thoughts one gives it.You can also actually feel what he lived through and the process after the American's set the people free and the way life had changed for them. Also you can see the victory achieved by 'right thoughts'. Very powerful book.

I'm only sorry I didn't find this sooner."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Part autobiography, part psychotherapy, and part philosophy, this book is one of the most important and meaningful works of non-fiction that I have ever read. It is rare to find an author who gets right to the heart of what it means to be human. Viktor Frankl does this with a well-reasoned theory of human motivation and an intensely powerful life story.Frankl's main idea, namely that man's primary motivational force is his search for meaning in life, is so simple and yet so profound. Through his gripping account of his experience in the Nazi concentration camps, he describes how all the prisoners responded differently than others to the torture and abuses that they faced. Some behaved like animals, while others literally gave their last crumb of bread to a fellow prisoner even though they were all equally hungry. From this experience he developed the notion of what he calls the last human freedom - the ability to choose one's response to any given set of circumstances. And he concludes that in order to endure the horrors of the concentration camps, it was necessary to always have a sense of a future life purpose - a believe that there was some reason to keep on living.Viktor Frankl's book should be considered essential reading for anyone with an interest in psychotherapy or personal leadership. It is one of the few works of non-fiction that I have come across that has virtually universal appeal and applicability."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl is my new hero. Reading this book has truly changed the way I view the world and the people in it, including myself. I bought several copies to give as Christmas presents this year.The first part of the book is Frankl's account of his three years in concentration camps and how he was able to find meaning in his suffering and support for his existential theory for treating individuals' mental health issues. If you read only this part, your life will be changed. But for mental health practitioners and those interested in understanding what makes themselves and others tick, his explanation of Logotherapy is like the meaning of life and existence neatly summed up in a few pages. This book has changed me to the very core of my being and will certainly influence the way in which I treat my clients."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This simply written little book contains a very great truth that is immediately usable by anyone who cares to internalize it. The book tries to communicate through the use of quite remarkable real life examples from Nazi concentration camps, the lesson that life holds a potential meaning under any conditions whatsoever, even the most misarable ones. it teaches that we must always say YES to life in spite of all tragic aspects of human existence.A psychology classic worth reading by anyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"A must read!

Do not go through life without reading this book, for I promise you it will not be nearly as fulfilling without it... I don't care who you are, or what your views on the Holocaust are, read this book. Inspirational, Insightful, Touching and Breath-taking."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book describes Frankl's experience in a concentration camp during WWII. I read it for a course I took. I expected a self-help book, but what I got was a life changing work, one of the most inspiring books I've ever read.This powerful book is a firsthand account from a Holocaust survivor about how even prisoners at Auschwitz could still find hope amidst the horrors within the walls of that concentration camp. The experience of those prisoners showed that even the deepest suffering can be turned into something positive.The first half describes Frankl's experiences and observations of life in the camps from 1942-1945, like a Reader's Digest condensed version of Solzhenitsyn's \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.\\" But Frankl is also a psychiatrist, and his insights into the human behavior he saw are particularly interesting and detailed. He explains some of the coping mechanisms that people used and discusses why some defense mechanisms were more effective than others. Given the title, it's not surprising that the concept of \\"meaning\\" plays a key role.The second half of the book is about how Frankl took the concepts he learned in the concentration camps and applied it to his work as a psychotherapist. Frankl's approach to psychotherapy is called Logotherapy. Logotherapy \\"confronts\\" patients to help them find, recognize, and reorient themselves toward the true, vital meaning of their own lives. Frankl talks about people living in an \\"existential vacuum\\" and proposes a technique or approach through which people can find meaning in work, love, or by responding in a healthy way to difficult circumstances.The book is full of interesting ideas about human behavior and emotions. And of course, the historical context of Frankl's observations and insights makes them that much more powerful. One interesting idea is the concept of \\"paradoxical intention,\\" which implies that people frequently end up doing pretty much exactly the opposite of what they actually intended to do. That may help explain why people who go on a diet frequently end up gaining weight, why people who resolve to quit drinking frequently go back to the bottle, and similar, puzzling behaviors. Frankl describes a number of ways in which understanding the concept of paradoxical intention can help people overcome certain types of seemingly uncontrollable behavior problems.But the key insight of course is the concept of \\"meaning,\\" the idea that it is up to each person to recognize that even if they lose everything, their family, their freedom, their rights, even their very identity, nevertheless there is still one thing that no one can take from them, and that is their ability to choose how to respond to adversity. People who realize that have an incredibly valuable tool for making sense of life, even in the most dire circumstances. The realization that there is a higher purpose, even amidst such circumstances, can be a powerful tool to help one find a way through adversity. That's an awesome thing.This was a very inspirational book. I recommend it to anyone, especially those who may be experiencing something of an \\"existential vacuum\\" in their own lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is one of those books that once you start reading you don't want to put it down. It is inspirational from cover to cover. The descriptions of events will paint a clear picture for anyone. This book will really get you thinking about all aspects of your life. Frankl does a marvelous job providing specific examples for every important point of \\"logotherapy\\" he wants his readers to fully comprehend.Frankl talks about his experience in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. The description of the dichotomy of man is amazing yet simplistic. To understand that MAN created such an evil thing like a gas chamber, yet no matter how horrible the situation is, MAN always has the freedom to choose how he will react. This freedom can never be taken away, even in the darkest of places...Frankl lived to tell about it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Say yes to life, nevertheless!\\" is the original title in the German mother tongue of Frankl He was a philosopher, doctor, physiotherapist and founder of the Logotherapy (not to be mixed with Logopedics). This is a medical science which emphasises the openness and the chances of a situation and of life, with the aim of encouragement. The pastoral help consists according to Frankl in the dedication to a thing, to another people, in the memory of fortunate moments, in the hope, in humour and in prayer. And even when the whole thing is limitless and inevitable, there is still meaning: to endure sufferings in dignity and with courage.Frankl, a Jew, survived the Nazi concentration camps. His parents, his wife, his brother did not. Shortly after his deliverance he wrote this book with the programmatic title. He depicts herein the life in the camp with the point of view of a participating observer. This relativization helps him to keep distance to the frightful events. At the same time he receives hope in an almost dead-end situation. He advices the desperate people around him for a more biblical attitude of \\"Nevertheless!\\" and to acquire the consciousness that even the desperation of their fight cannot harm the meaning and dignity as long as the courage is preserved.In accordance with that Frankl tried to be an encouraging example. He told them that he himself never thought of losing hope and lived to that. \\"No man knows the future!\\" Not only hope is for Frankl a worthy power for survival, but also love - and this is also something he experiences together with his co-prisoners.For the novelist Basil Hume Frankl\`s narrative of his day-dreams in the middle of a cruel camp-reality where he speaks in thoughts with his also imprisoned wife is one of the most moving reports about human love, that he ever read. In this text Frankl also shows in which respect man is more than just a \\"psychologic organism\\" what he was for Sigmund Freud. He is rather a spiritual being, an eternal creature. In this dimension man is not vulnerable and cannot get sick.After his release Frankl developed his Logotherapy which is taught all over the world. Frankl held several professorships in the USA. He married again. At the age of 70 he acquired his pilot license with the reasoning that he need not acquiesce in everything from himself. He meant his fear of a comedown. For somebody who teaches always to stand up, a consecutive effort."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm an actor. You've never heard of me.

What pulls you through.Read the book.It's a perfect account of a bad situation."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This small volume is a priceless addition to any collection of humanitarian ideas. Its subtext makes several interrelated existential points about human suffering and human meaning; points that only those who have known extreme suffering could make with the kind of conviction and eloquence that Dr. Frankel has made here: That while pain and suffering may be relative, even \\"chosen,\\" the infliction of gratuitous cruelty -- insults, indignities and debasement are absolutes, and is an unforgivable but universal currency applied by all totalitarian systems.Social and political tyrannies, whether soft or hard, are just opposite sides of the same coin of cultural and existential emptiness. They begin first by destroying the most precious of freedoms, the freedom of thought: effectively creating a \\"concentration camp of the mind\\" through social stratification, willful (or benign) neglect, obscene discrepancies in wealth and wellbeing, and by twisted race-based ideologies and other forms of \\"groupthink\\" consensus-based political and social orthodoxies. Then come the politics of exclusion, followed by social death - ghettoes and segregation; and then the final stop: unjust physical imprisonment and eventually removal to concentration camps. It is a gradient that leads progressively to walls of hopelessness and despair and that at each step of the way is every bit as cruel in their cumulative emotional and psychological effects as the electrified fences that enclosed the prisoners of Auschwitz.The existential challenge for the suffer has been put best by Professor Cornel West of Princeton University, who as a self-described \\"Chekhovian Christian\\" sees the challenge as follows: \\"... Being a Chekhovian Christian is refusing to be imprisoned and walled-in by intentionally inflicted misery. It is to wake up each day with a new strategy for survival.\\"That is exactly what Dr. Frankel did in repeatedly facing-down certain death at the hands of the Nazi war-machine. This book and the Logo-therapy that it gave rise to are fitting living tributes to all of those who died in the European holocaust."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This should be required reading in all college programs before students begin their course specific courses.

As strange as it sounds, that was an opportunity to develop their love for life, and that love for life was what kept them alive, Victor Frankl is a being full of light that not only thought about his own life but the value of other's lives, specially in such an ultimate experience where survival was critical.

Fortunately, most of us will never likely come within reach of such dreadful circumstances; however, by means of this book we are able to ascertain meaning by vicariously viewing the experiences of Dr. Frankl and learning from his own thoughts and perceptions about the matter.This book rates high in its ability to help the reader search for meaning, define purpose, and gain an incredible sense of relativity. I give four stars only as a result of its propensity to read like a psychology text book. I admit, however, that may speak more to my weaknesses and lack of pursuit on such subjects than the quality of the writing.

Frankl found a way to confront the greatest evil of the last century, which for him was very personal, and survive. In the midst of it he discovered that we most long for meaning in our lives, and so he developed a therapy that helps people search for it.The beginning part of the book about life in the camps simply cannot be forgotten. And then, when he tries to make sense of it, ordinary readers realize that whatever they have suffered there is a way forward. Frankl used tragedy to help others.

The way of his writing is very clear and to the point. There are a lot of psychology terms, but not so many that it makes the book confusing.

Frankl's work is especially relevant in our time."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for MeaningSignificant work indeed after Freud and Adler. The book shows by example of personal experience of the author, and that of many other, how the influence of one's thought power can make you live or die and the rightful thinking that can make one stand against all odds. The meaning for life is not defined by someone but to be found by each one of us and that the meaning exists whatever the living state of affairs be, is the message of the book. There probably has never been a worst place to live other than in concentration camps, as described in the book and the ordeal of living through it. The book also deals with the dimension of spiritual thinking a little (probably the 8 volumes of the theory proposed by Viktor Frankl has more info). A must read for students of psychology."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Excluding scientific achievements and their documentation, no other short book presents the gifts of the twentieth century as perfectly as Frankl's work.Man's Search for Meaning, or ISM for the modern substitution of \\"An Individual's\\" for \\"Man's,\\" gives the extreme twisted side of human organization with its autobiography of a holocaust survivor, but balances it with the strongest statement possible not against the horror, but against determinism: humans always have the freedom to choose their response. Furthermore, the text is written with the direct, yet respectful words, for the twisted, but not fixed, timber of human life exemplified in the intelligent style of Freud, Jung, and Adler - a mid-century style not commonly written anymore, a style that assumes that a reader not only has worked to develop a humane education, but is also willing to work to improve it.The main thrust of Frankl is that humans strive to make meaning of their lives first and foremost. This updates Freud's statements that humans seek pleasure primarily or Adler's statements that people seek power. The job of a psychoanalyst (a quaint word today) is to use logotherapy (a set of approaches initiated by Frankl) to help patients solve their problems, internally and externally, by finding their meaning. Obviously Frankl fits within the resolving existentialism tide of the twentieth century. He complements the texts of Isaiah Berlin which also focus on the meaning of freedom within the constraints of humans as they are and the societies in which they live.If only considered responses to Frankl by stoics such as Seneca and Aurelius were possible. A dialogue across time - which a reader can form - places many of the travails of history as being those of humans within history resolving their search for meaning, a seeking also inherent within most readers. This segues into seeing history not just through the lens of great events and powers, but through the experiences of everyone, not just elites."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is an unforgettable piece of writing. It is written by Viktor Frankl, a concentration camp survivor, psychiatrist, and founder of logotherapy. In a clear, true, voice he quickly entrains the reader into the reality of the camps; the hierarchies, the realities, and the will to live that will allow humans to endure and participate in almost anything. Yet with the depravity he also writes of the few who shone- who cared for others; who did not abandon spiritual principles. This amazing first-person account is unforgettable because of his bravery, intellectual approach, and clear-headed ability to recount details. Dr. Frankl also shares the core principles behind his innovative approach to psychotherapy. We are all searching for meaning; reading this book will allow you to look at life in a new way and you will be changed forever.

Yet, the overall message of this book is wonderfully exhilarating. Whatever meaning you find in your life is your life. If that meaning gives you hope, you will have hope. If that meaning gives you despair, you will find despair. This is a fantastic piece of existential work! The whole idea in this book reminds me a bit of the concept of the self-system in Toru Sato's genius book &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot;. Now &quot;The Ever-Transcending Spirit&quot; is a much newer book but it is another truly excellent book that takes these things one step further by integrating these ideas with the psychology of relationships as well as transpersonal experiences.

The first of which is a real life experience about being in a concentration camp in World War II. The second analyzing what went on and how he used his knowledge to help himself and others. He breaks down how many people acted and reacted to the gruesomeness of what he saw in the camps. He says that there are three stages of the mind in the concentration camp. The first being when you first get there, second being when you get into the work schedule, the third being when you get released. The first revolves around realizing that life is over, as you know it to be. The second is just a repetition of doing and putting up with what the German soldiers and Capo do to them. The third revolves to being numb to happiness and not being able to be happy because everything and everyone you knew was gone. This reaction was caused by being in a deep depression or posttraumatic stress disorder. He describes helping people to find hope for something, a will to live. In the second part of the book he describes that the meaning of life for anyone person changes at any point in time. That we need to find our own meaning and that he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.I loved the first part of the book about his personal experiences but failed to understand most of the second half of the book. I would recommend this book to everyone who is looking for a meaning in life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl presents the horrendous conditions of Auschwitz with the matter-of-fact tone of a sympathetic but objective observer, much like a clinician who cares deeply about his patients but does not allow his emotions to interfere with his analysis. He shows the reader a wide range of human behavior under extreme duress, including examples of the best and worst in our nature. It is hard to imagine anyone reading this first part, his condensed description of surviving the death camps, without being moved, without becoming deeply thoughtful, even stunned, in the face of man's inhumanity to man, and conversely of what it can mean to be truly human.The book continues with Frankl describing his philosophy of psychiatric treatment, &quot;logotherapy&quot;, that is, therapy based on discovering meaning in one's life. Based in large part on his observations in the camps, Frankl developed a method of treating depression which rejected the Freudian approach of dwelling on the past, wallowing in childhood traumas, in favor of focusing on the future, discovering personal meaning in one's present context. The idea of proper context is important here. Frankl enjoins against the notion of a One True Meaning of Life. The analogy he uses is that of asking the chess grand master, &quot;What is the best move in the world?&quot; It's an absurd question as it stands, of course, as every move must be evaluated in light of a particular game, the current layout of pieces, the personalities and strategies of each player, etc. Similarly, the constellation of meanings that lend our lives substance and power can very well change over time. The content of the answer is not as important as asking the right question: &quot;For me, in this place, at this time, what gives or can give my existence the most meaning?&quot; [that's a paraphrase, not a quote] Acting always in accordance with the honest answer to this question is, in Frankl's view, the most sustainable route to happiness throughout our lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is life changing.

It is in fact two books with the first being his Concentration Camp survival story and the second about Logotherapy. The former is an incredible story of survival with perhaps a significant amount of sheer luck. What shocked me was the manipulation aspects of controlling prisoners by their own and the absolute lack of respect for life. I could not help thinking that many unpalatable incidents were left out of the book. I was not disappointed in the author's desire to show that survival was closely linked to having a meaning in life or positive attitude. Frankl did not wallow in pity, bitterness and was factual in his account during those dark years.The Logotherapy analysis did use jargon and technical terms. However, I was impressed with the argument of not digging into the past to solve all problems. More could have been done to highlight differences to Freud and Adler. Selected case studies did help.For any person wallowing in self-pity this book is a must read. It does add a great deal to the field of 'self-help' literature and a glimpse into the ability of a human being to survive atrocious conditions."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is an amazing book, it helps you see that whatever you are going through in life you can find meaning and to look how that situation can be a positive.

In this book, the author not only describes his experiences as a survivor of Auschwitz, but he sets out a premise and philosophy for life, and in this actually answers in concrete terms the question posed by the many as to the meaning of life. I have copied and pasted my notes on this book below for you, in hopes that it will give you a feel for the book. I HIGHLY recommend this book:Life holds a potential meaning under any conditions, even the most miserable ones.Even in a position of utter desolation, where no expression is possible in positive action, achievement is still possible in enduring suffering in an honorable way and fulfillment can still be achieved through loving contemplation of the image one carries in his heart of his beloved.A human being is not completely and unavoidably influenced by his surroundings. There is human liberty in every circumstance. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, an independence of mind, even in the bleakest of circumstances.Those who lived through the concentration camps often recall the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but even one individual would offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing- the last of the human freedoms- the ability to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.Dostoevski once wrote \\"There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.\\"In difficulty lies the chance for man either to make use of or forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that only a difficult situation can afford him. When faced with difficulty, man can either choose to forget his self respect and dignity and turn himself into an animal or he can remain dignified, brave, and unselfish. It is in this decision that he determines whether he is or is not worthy of his sufferings.But difficulties are not found only inside the concentration camp. Everyday offers us the opportunity to make a decision- the decision as to whether you will or will not submit to those powers which threaten to rob you of your very self, of your values.If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. For suffering is an inescapable part of life, even as death. The way in which a man accepts his fate and whatever suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, always gives him ample opportunity, regardless of circumstance, to add a deeper meaning to his life.Man can either make a victory of difficult experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or he can ignore the opportunity and become an animal among life's miseries.Do not think that such aspirations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. Though it is true that only a few people are capable of reaching such high moral standards, and that of the prisoners in camp, only a few were able to keep their full inner liberty and obtain those values which their suffering afforded- it is also equally true that even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength can raise him above his outward fate.Former prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing influence of all was that one could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. The prisoner had been given no date for his release. As such, a prison sentence was not only uncertain but also unlimited. Life in a concentration camp has often been referred to as a \\"provisional existence.\\" We can add to this by defining it as a \\"provisional existence of unknown limit.\\"New arrivals usually knew nothing about the conditions of camp. Those who had come back from other camps were obliged to keep silent and from some camps no one had returned at all. Upon entering camp, a change began to take place in the minds of the men. With the end of uncertainty came the uncertainty of the end. It was impossible to foresee whether or when, if at all, this form of existence would end.A man who could not see the end of his \\"provisional existence\\" was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. As such, he ceased living for the future and only looked backwards. In turn, the whole structure of his inner life changed and signs of decay set in.A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future often found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts. There was a tendency to look to the past to somehow make the present less real. But in becoming retrospective, there laid a certain danger: Everything in the present and going forward suddenly became pointless.The prisoners who declined did not view camp's difficulties as an opportunity to develop inner strength, but instead only despised life as something of no consequence. Life for such people became meaningless and soon they lost their will to live.Because of this effect, any attempt at fighting environmental influences had to aim at giving the prisoner inner strength by pointing out to him a future goal to which he could look forward.He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future. Man lives not in the present but only either in the future or the past.The prisoner who saw no more sense in his life, no aim, no purpose, was soon lost. The typical reply with which such a man rejected all encouraging argument was \\"I have nothing to expect from life any more.\\"What was needed was a fundamental change in our attitude towards life. We had to learn ourselves and furthermore, we had to teach other despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what mattered was what life expected from us.We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to see ourselves as those who were questioned and our answers had to consist in right action and right conduct.In this, the meaning of life ultimately lies in taking the responsibility to find the right answers to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. As these tasks differ from man to man, the meaning of life differs from man to man. Questions about the meaning of life can never be answered by sweeping statements. Life does not mean something vague, but something very real and concrete, just as life's tasks are also very real and concrete, and a man's willingness to fulfill them is what determines his destiny.Let us now consider what we can do if a person asks what the meaning of life is. I doubt that a doctor can answer this question in general terms for the meaning of life differs from man to man. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to the chess champion: \\"Tell me, master, what is the best move in the world?\\" There simply is no such thing as the best or even a good move apart from a particular situation in a game. The same holds for human existence. One should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific purpose in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Each situation in life represents a unique challenge to man and presents a problem for him to solve. As such, the question of the meaning of life may actually be reversed. Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is questioned. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.Logotherapy tries to make the patient fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, Logotherapy leaves it to the patient to answer for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible. It does not provide answers but merely assists by asking the right question."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Thanks to one of my psychology professors, I was introduced to a book by Victor Frankl that is about what he went through in the concentration camps in Germany during WWII and how he survived.

I bought it when I was trying to support a friend who was enduring one of life's random tragedies. I do not believe in a god who never sends us more than we can bear. In fact, I don't believe God sends us good or ill events, and Frankl's work supports my view. What he does show is that under the most heinous of circumstances, humans have the ability to make moral choices, and that is powerful information.Frankl-- who survived when his pregnant wife, parents and other relatives did not-- went on to show that not all prisoners were moral and all guards immoral. Within extremely narrow parameters, both had the freedom to embrace life and to aid others. He was also insightful about what signaled impending death. I guess I should not be surprised that after the war, Frankl opposed the theory of collective guilt; he was loathe to condemn whole societies, which is what makes him out of step with many Holocaust scholars and (in my reading) with other prominent moral teachers of his era.The last part of the book sets out his theories of logotherapy in which he held that the purpose of psychotherapy is to help patients make meaning of their lives rather than find happiness or resolve various complexes. It's interesting that logotherapy is almost unknown today, although some of his ideas seem to bubble up in existential therapies. As it turns out, Man's Search is condensed from longer writings he produced after liberation. The book in English is so lucid that I forgot that he lived all this experience \\"in German.\\" Unlike many psychological writings, this one does not suffer from the restriction of categories that don't quite translate.

To be fair, Frankl never sets out to answer the question, and in fact proposes that each individual must answer it on their own, for themselves.Frankl's position seems to be very similar to those of people like Albert Camus: that despite man's incessant search, there is no inherent meaning in life. Frankl differs in his response to this reality from people like Camus in that his solution to the meaninglessness of life is to create meaning on our own, based on our own interests and experiences. For Frankl this meant identifying with human suffering and helping others to find individual meaning. For me at least, it's hardly enough.Of course there are no easy answers, and that is precisely the point."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have always been inspired by Man's Search for Meaning, with its tough-minded and inspiring message.

In addition, very few people can transcend their personal agony, grief, and pain and turn it into wisdom for everyone to share. Victor Frankl did just that. He took his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II and used them as a sharpening stone to develop a revolutionary approach to understanding the psyche of humankind.Although the large majority of this book is about his concentration camp experiences, this book is about hope and meaning. Frankl shows humankind how to approach life in a positive way and to use life to its fullest to not only find meaning, but to create meaning.This book doesn't belong only in the psychiatry section, it proves its worth by belonging in the philosophy section as well. If you're looking for a shining beacon of hope in a dark world, this book may help you create a spark. If you already have meaning, this book is fuel for your flame and clarity for your vision. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For those struggling to find meaning in life, suffering seems like an unlikely source of inspiration. Frankl uses his own experiences in Nazi concentration camps to develop his theory of logotherapy. His theory describes how human beings have a basic need to find meaning in life that should not be underestimated in its importance. Frankl argues that many pschycologists dismiss this need as trivial, but he feels it must be met before a person can resolve many of the psychological issues for which they seek treatment. By describing his own experiences of the horrors of the Holocaust, he provides convincing evidence for his theory of logotherapy.Unlike Frued's psychoanalysis, logotherapy focuses on using difficult experiences as learning opportunities rather than traumas resulting in neurosis. The first half of his book sets the stage for his learning by recounting his years in the Nazi camps and his attitude of wanting to survive in order to pass on his life's work. The second half of the book explains logotherapy, and is also his testament to how his attitude helped him survive.Frankl's argument for logotherapy is convincing as he describes how many who lost the will to live did indeed die. While I'm sure some survivors can attribute their survival to simply being at the right place at the right time, their attitudes toward their fate certainly played a role in their survival. The importance of what he calls this \\"will to meaning\\" is carried over to his treatment of patients after the war. He describes how patients who may be considered \\"ill\\" by some doctors simply lacked a focus for their lives. Once they were able to find focus, their conditions were much improved.The result of Frankl's account is an uplifting, thought provoking book that reaffirms the importance of finding meaning in life in order to deal with it's ups and downs."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" by Viktor Frankl is an extremely well-written book that is hard to put down. Throughout the book Frankl talks about his accounts in the Nazi death camps which led him to the discovery of his theory of logotherapy. He feels that man can surpass suffering and find a meaning to life, regardless of the circumstances he is in. After reading this book, I have began to look at life differently because I know that the only way to find the true meaning of my life is through experience, by creating a work or deed, and by the attitude I take towards suffering.In this book, Frankl begins with an account of his experiences in four different Nazi death camps, including Auschwitz. In the next section of his book, Frankl discusses the theory of logotherapy and makes clear arguments on how to search for the real meaning of life.Frankl argues that the meaning of life in general is not what really matters, but rather the meaning of a person's life at a specific moment. According to his theory of logotherapy, the meaning can be discovered by creating a work or a deed, experiencing something or encountering someone, and by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.When Frankl is telling of his experience in Nazi death camps, we are told about his first manuscript being taken as he entered Auschwitz. He found meaning his life to keep going so that he could rewrite this manuscript when he was liberated. While still in the camp he would write down bits of the manuscript on scraps of paper and he laid suffering from typhus fever. Keeping his mind on his work ultimately helped him survive throughout the camps.Another important argument that Frankl talks about is the ability to find meaning in spite of the suffering that may be encountered. He feels that by changing your attitude toward your \\"unalterable fate\\", you can at least see the meaning in your suffering. As stated in logotherapy, man's main concern in life is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain, but rather to see a meaning in life.I believe that the arguments made by Frankl were very good arguments. His claims were logically consistent, the premises true, and his ideas were expressed clearly and precisely.I think that this is a great book for anyone to read in order to get a new outlook on life. Frankl's ideas are extraordinary and relates to everyone in some way. He believes that the meaning to life is different for everyone, but that there are several ways to attain it. \\"It does not matter really what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man's Search for Meaning,\\" by Viktor Frankl was by far the best book that I have read since I entered college. After reading it I felt that I had been presented with a new way to deal with suffering. Although I have been given ways in the past to deal with suffering in life, they were never given to me in such a compelling manner.The first part of the book discusses Frankl's experience in a Nazi concentration camp. In the second part of the book, Frankl discusses basic concepts of logotherapy and he makes a number of arguments concerning the meaning of suffering and life.When talking about the liberated prisoner, Frankl contends that suffering has no limits. Even a man who endured the unimaginable suffering in a concentration camp has not reached the limit of possible suffering. To support this, Frankl speaks about the negative response that a prisoner would often receive when he returned to his home town as if empathy were too much to ask for, and years spent in misery weren't long enough. This is a strong argument because the premises contend that even after a prisoner had suffered in a concentration camp, he still faced more suffering when he returned to his normal life.Frankl believes that man is never driven to behave morally. Instead, man decides to behave morally. He supports this by stating that man behaves morally for the sake of a cause that he is committed to, someone he loves, or for the sake of his god. He also offers reasons for why man does not behave morally (to fulfill a moral drive or to have a good conscience). If a man behaved morally to have a good conscience, \\"he would become a Pharisee and cease to be a truly moral person.\\" Because that doesn't mean that you are necessarily a Pharisee (only in terms of the Jewish religion I suppose) this isn't a very strong or fair argument.Frankl says that there is nothing that would help a person survive the worst conditions, more than the knowledge that there is meaning for one's life. He corroborates this by referring to the concentration camps. Those prisoners who knew there was a duty waiting for them to complete were the most likely to survive. There is another instance in the book where Frankl uses the death of one of his \\"comrades\\" to illustrate that those who had given up hope, were almost sure to die.He goes on to say that the meaning of life in general doesn't matter. What does matter is the meaning of one's life at a given moment. This is because the meaning of life varies amongst people and over time.He says that, \\"One should not search for an abstract meaning of life.\\" In life, everyone has their own mission or vocation and must accomplish their task. This is, in part, what Frankl feels a patient should be told if they ask, \\"What is the meaning of life?\\" Because the premises follow necessarily from the conclusion this is a good argument.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever searched for the reason for suffering. This book informs the reader of an alternative way to view suffering: as a part of life. It teaches the reader to understand that in the same way that suffering has a meaning, life has a meaning; and determining what the meaning is can aid you through the most dire and tough circumstances."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For me, an incredibly useful perspective on suffering. I would even go as far as to say paradigm shifting. You should especially read this if you are succeptible to depression."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"It isnt a lengthy book, but it's a great book. It's a book you will read again.

Yes, it's that good."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Hands down the best book I've read in over a year. I bought this book because I was void of hope. I felt my painful experiences far exceeded anybody else's. Who could relate with me? I'll tell you who. This man here: Viktor Frankl. He invented logotherapy which is far more effective than psychotherapy. It deals with the meaning in our Lives rather than the problems with our brains. I thought that I had lived a hard one until I read this book. A concentration camp during the holocaust was no joke, the epitomy of suffering. Yet, there is meaning behind everything in Life, even times of great distress. This book awoke me from my slumber!! If you think that your Life is hopeless and not worth living .... please READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I came back to this book after some 30 years and found much deeper value. Frankl's thesis is that the ultimate freedom we have is to choose our response to whatever befalls us and that it remains for us to find the meaning of it -- as evidenced in our response. This would sound like so much emotional candy for people without significant problems except that he has a strong moral position to say this: 5 years in Nazi concentration camps. As he speaks of prisoners finding dignity in simple acts like giving away their ration of food or facing their death bullet with poise, I see how instead of crumpling from the weight of my misfortunes, I can use them to become stronger and reach past myself to help others.One of my grandmothers, several generations back, crossed the plains as a Mormon pioneer when she was a child. Her journal tells of their persecutions in England, burying her mother on the trail with a few stones over the shallow grave to ward off wolves, and losing her husband to a snowslide in Utah. The faith, dignity, and bouyancy emanating from her narrative, and old-timers in the family told me from her character, would seem strange without the lesson of Frankl's book: these challenges gave her the opportunity to choose to whether to follow a higher or a lower path. I can see how her response was a determined choice not to let these events deprive her of happiness.After re-reading this book, it is easier in my life to maintain calm when talking with angry people. I can choose not to become caught up in their anger. Instead, my calm response can be my strong statement that \\"I choose not for us to be at war. I choose to remain at peace and to try to share that peace with you.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"IntroductionA very well writen book by a man that has had to endure a tremendous amount of physical and emotional punishment. Frankel's main argument is that a human being can overcome almost anytihng in life if they can find their meaning for living. By using some of his own perosnal experiences and others' as well, he is able to illustrate that his argument of meaning is true. By using his personal experiences and observatoins it is very clear to see that his argument that by finding a true meaning or desire a human being can hold on for what they believe in.Argument summaryFrankel's main premises in the first half of the book are that even under the most extreme circumstances, as in Frankel's time in a Nazi concentration camp, a person who has something to live for can and will survive. For Frankel it was his wife that he constantly thought about and strived to live for. He had observations of people emotionaly giving up, which led to sickness and death. The conclusions of his arguments are that if a person finds their meaning for life, in Frankel's case his wife, and they never give up hope for them then a person can overcome almost anything as long as you don't give up.Critical EvaluationFrankel's arguments are of good reasoning and deductively valid. If a person has nothing to live for, nothing to strive for, then that person is not going to live or strive for anything. It is this very simple yet very strong emotion that makes it possible for people to go on and continue. If a person finds true meaning for their life then that person will do everything in their power to keep that meaning and that meaning will keep them striving forward. His arguments do not seem to contain any fallacies. In fact if you look at the fallacy of look who's talking, Frankel is doing exactly the opposite. He is practicing what he preaches if you want to put it that way. Not only is he arguing that if you find a means of continuance then it is possible to go on, but he also has personal experience with this. His times in the concentration camps and not giving up on hope and having his wife as a means of continuance prove that he is not commiting such a fallacy for example. The only negative I have to say against Frankel's arguments are that once he makes one, as in his argument that logotherapy is the meaning of life and existence, he seems to ramble and lead to something a little of course. Besides this, I find his arguments to be stellar and in my mind prove to be a very heartfilled and emotionally lifting read.ConclusionFrankel's experiences not only prove that the human soul is very powerful as long as you give yourself a means to go on, to strive for what not only what you believe, but prove that almost anything is possible. Using his own personal experiences and observations amongst others, he not only proves these arguments but lets you into his life of meaning. Throughout the book Frankel is numerously quoting Nietzsche which is a strong support for his argument that human beings need to find meaning in order to survive. I am going to leave you with the quote that is most often quoted, \\"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how\\"."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The first section of this book (which makes up over half of the text) consist of Victor Frankl's account of his experiences in the concentration camp. This section seems unique among the Holocaust accounts that I've seen and read because Dr. Frankl approaches the topic from a psychological perspective. He discusses the ways in which the different prisoners react to their (note: men and women were seperated at the camps, so Frankl is mainly disscussing his experiences with the men in Auschwitz) imprissonment. He writes about the psychological effects of being completely dehumanized; of losing even your name, and becoming simply a number. Also he disscusses the effects of not being able to contact loved ones, or even know is they are still living. Another issue that Dr. Frankl talks about in this book is the idea that none of the prisoners of the concentration camp had an idea as to when there imprissonment would end (if ever). Thus, they were faced with the thought of living the rest of their lives as workers at the camps. Dr. Frankl discusses how people can find meaning to life in these conditions. He also describes how finding meaning in life, or a reason to live, was extraordinarilly important to surviving the camp.One of the most interesting, and disturbing, issues in the book was the idea of the Capo. These were were people put in charge of their fellow prisoners, in order to keep them in line. Dr. Frankl describes these people as, often, being more harsh than the actual guards. This seems to be a disturbing lesson in the abuse of power. This also goes along with Dr. Frankl's discussion of how the camps brought out the true personality of the people within it (after all the social trapping had been stripped away): The cretins, the saints, and all of those in between.The second half of the book is made up of two sections &quot;Logotherapy in a Nutshell,&quot; and &quot;The Case for Tragic Optimsism.&quot; These two sections basically describe Dr. Frankl's theory on as to how to conduct therapy (Logotherapy). The idea behind this therapy is that man is driven by his search for a meaning in life. This differs from the psychoanalysis perspective (driven, at this time, by the ideas of Sigmund Freud) in that the psychoanalytic school believed that humans were driven by their unconscious desires. For Frankl, the need for meaning seems to outway the unconscious. In fact, he goes into detail about the negative effects that the abscence of meaning, or what he calls the &quot;existential Vacuum,&quot; has on people. To illustrate many ideas, he often uses his experiences in the concentration camps, as well as various cases for treatment (which help to solidify his view of life, and therapy).I would recomend this book to almost anybody. I feel that it's interesting, and worthwhile. I would especially recomend this to people interested in psychology, as well as those who wish to learn something about the experiences within the concentration camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl's logotherapy is straightforward and easy to understand. It is also a useful antidote to the rather frightening drift in psychology during the past two decades toward strict biological determinism.This particular work is one I keep at hand and re-read on a regular basis. I read it for the first time a few months after I started medical treatment and therapy for life-long depression. I get more from it each time I go back to it.Logotherapy manages an incredible balance. It does not put man himself at the center of the universe, thus avoiding the kind of narcissistic self-reflection common to much of the therapeutic literature today. Yet, it does not sweep man aside as irrelevant. Instead, Frankl argues that we have an incredible power to shape our attitudes and responses to the challenges life presents us and that we inevitably grow thanks to these challenges.This is a quick read and could conceivably change your life. Man is more than the sum of his biology and his environment. We inevitably choose to be who we are. Frankl's argument is that, if we choose wisely, we can triumph even in tragedy. It's a truth many of us have lost sight of in our cynicism."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably.*** Why no voting buttons?

I was finding it hard to find something to hold on to after getting the news. This book has helped put the cancer in perspective and is giving me the courage and encouragement to keep on living...no matter what. And if I die, then there has to be meaning in my life before then. I am now beginning to understand that I should not ask what can I get out of life, but what does life expect from me.This is a WONDERFUL and INSPIRATIONAL book that I recommend for anyone suffering from any tragic cirucmstance...cancer, death in the family, divorce, etc. All of the phsychiatric nonsense might help (I doubt it), but this book will get you on the right road."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Several years ago a friend had an operation for a cancerous growth behind his eye yet today is well and tells of the importance of the right mental attitude when facing adversity. Another friend faces a similar experience but appears to be in the process of succumbing in ignorance of the importance of mental attitude. Seeking guidance as to what I might do to help, I turned to this book.After recounting the horrors of everyday life in a work camp - the initial selection process in which 90% were sent to the gas chambers while 10% were kept to extract the last ounce of work as slaves for construction firms; the Capos selected from the most brutal who had lost all scruples in order to save their life; how everything was subservient to keeping oneself and one's closest friends alive - Viktor Frankl tells of the psychological problems they met.The most important seems to be the hope of release as shown by the very high death rate in his camp in the week between Christmas 1944 and new year 1945 which had no explanation in food, treatment, weather, disease or working conditions; it was that the majority had lived in the nave hope that they would be home again by Christmas. In the absence of encouraging news, the prisoners lost courage; disappointment overcame them and their powers of resistance dropped. Frankl noticed that it was the men who comforted others, who gave away their last piece of bread who survived longest and who offered proof that everything can be taken but one thing - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances.In the camp every decision determined whether or not you would submit to loss of inner freedom. The sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. It is this spiritual freedom which cannot be taken away which makes life meaningful and purposeful. Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influences. Most inmates believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. In reality, however, one could make a victory of those experiences, turning them into an inner triumph.Frankl saw himself giving a lecture on the psychology of the concentration camp, living Spinoza's observation that \\"Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\\" Armed with the insight that any attempt to restore man's inner strength had first to succeed in showing him some future goal he tried to help would-be suicides to realize that life was still expecting something from them - a loving son awaiting his return, an unfinished work to complete. When the impossibility of replacing you is realized it is impossible to throw your life away. When you know the why of your existence you will be able to bear almost any how.Frankl had to learn and then teach that it really did not matter what we expect from life but rather what life expects from us. The answer lies in right action and in right conduct; life ultimately means taking responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill tasks that it constantly sets for each individual. These tasks, and therefore the meaning of life, differ from man to man and from moment to moment, making it impossible to define in general terms or in sweeping statements. No man and no destiny can be compared to any other man or destiny. It may require a man to shape his own fate, contemplate or accept his fate. There is only one right answer to the situation at hand.When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his single, unique task. His unique opportunity lies in the way he bears his burden. Once the meaning of suffering has been revealed, suffering has hidden opportunities for achievement. When he had the opportunity to address a group of prisoners his purpose was to help each man to find a full meaning to their life in that practically hopeless situation by pointing out the joys each had experienced in the past and that no one had suffered irreplaceable losses. Whoever was still alive had reason for hope; health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society, could all be restored. Life never ceases to have meaning and this infinite meaning includes suffering and dying, privation and death. God or someone alive or dead would hope to find them suffering proudly.After the war, Frankl introduced Logotherapy, which focuses on the meanings of life to be fulfilled by the patient in the future. The patient is confronted with the meaning of his life. The meaning of human existence as well as man's search for such a meaning is unique and specific and can be fulfilled by him alone. He is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values. The more that you forget yourself by giving to a cause or serving in love, the more you actualize yourself. We can discover meaning in three ways - creating a work or doing a deed; by experiencing something or encountering someone; and by the attitude we take to unavoidable suffering.When we are no longer able to change a situation such as inoperable cancer we have to change our attitude. He asks his patients to project themselves forward to their deathbed and look back on the meaningful things in their lives. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be; he has control over what he will become in the next moment.This book has certainly provided much food for thought!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"&quot;Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done, and of love loved but of sufferings bravely suffered.&quot; (p. 123)My connection to Viktor Frankl dates back to a Hannukah party in which I found myself conversing with a baker who used to deliver his bread. It took me a few more years to discover this absolute gem of a book, itself both bread for the soul and leaven for the mind.The first half of this book consists of Frankl's reflection on his time in a Nazi concentration camp. &quot;An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior,&quot; (p. 18) he notices, &quot;Yet it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is omnipresent.&quot; (p. 43) Distilling the essence of his experience at the hands of the Nazis and the resilience of his soul, he states, &quot;If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.&quot; (p. 67) Finally, he notes that &quot;Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms--to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.&quot; (p. 65)He segues into the second part of the book, a description of &quot;logotherapy,&quot; based on the challenge learned behind barbed wire, downwind from the ovens &quot;Whenever there was an opportunity for it, one had to give them a why--an aim--for their lives, in order to strengthen them to bear the terrible _how_ of their existence.&quot; (p. 76)Frankl states that &quot;Man's search for meaning is a primary force in his life and not a 'secondary rationalization' of instinctual drives.&quot; (p. 99) He finds this meaning specific &amp; unique to each individual. Logotherapy focuses on the future, the assignments and meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in _his_ future, breaking up the self-centeredness of the neurotic instead of fostering and reinforcing it.He believes that &quot;the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected,&quot; (p. 101) that &quot;_logos_, or 'meaning', is not only an emerging from existence itself but rather something confronting existence.&quot; (p. 100) This _logos_ frustrates by not being available to finite minds, but nevertheless continues to confront man. In wrestling with this confrontation, each individual enacts their &quot;will to meaning,&quot; defining a &quot;meaning of life [that] differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment.&quot; (p. 110) Logotherapy sees responsibility as the very essence of human existence: &quot;each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by _answering_ _for_ his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.&quot; (p. 111) Thus, the &quot;categorical imperative&quot; of logotherapy is &quot;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&quot; (p. 111)Beyond the philosophy of logotherapy, Frankl discusses technique briefly, addressing anticipatory anxiety, &quot;it characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid.&quot; (p. 123) The mechanism for this is &quot;hyper-intention,&quot; which, by focusing on the problem, magnifies the problem. He confronts this with &quot;paradoxical intention,&quot; suggesting that the insomniac try to stay awake and that the phobic patient &quot;intend, if only for a moment, precisely that which he fears.&quot; (p. 125)He concludes the book with &quot;Our generation is realistic for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who has invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who has entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.&quot; (p. 136)I find this short book incredibly full of life and meaning; it's one of the most powerful I've ever read. The act of creating a philosophy and psychology of life out of the horrors of Auschwitz confronts my own whinings about the discomforts I find in life. I find courage here, not just Dr. Frankl's courage, but an inspiration to my own courage, and a challenge to live more fully, to create more meaning, instead of simply accepting the meanings thrust upon me by TV sitcoms, billboards, and internet banality.The epitome of a five star book. Worthy of more if Amazon would allow it.(If you'd like to dialogue about this book, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I originally bought this book knowing nothing about Frankl, his experiences, or psychological theories. I simply read the description and a few of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon and decided that it sounded interesting. What a life-changing book. Merely reading it at any given time has a marked positive influence on my attitude towards life.What's most interesting about it, as Frankl says himself, is that what he's propounding are not abstract ideas developed by some academic at a university or in some research laboratory. He uses his direct experience in one of the most adverse circumstances possible--a Nazi concentration camp--to relate the ideas of logotherapy (his own school of psychotherapy) to the reader.In a nutshell, the three most important tenets of logotherapy are as follows: (1) Life has meaning under all circumstances--even the most miserable ones; (2) Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life; and (3) We have the freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering. These principles are put directly to the test, and Frankl demonstrates their validity in a way that no social scientist has conceived of (or been able to) ever before.From the afterword:\\"Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, 'The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.''That was it, exactly,' Frankl said. 'Those are the very words I had written.'\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is a true classic in that it speaks to every generation. Even though it was written in the immediate post-Holocaust period and was one of the first personal accounts of the Nazi death camps, Frankl's brief account has new meaning today. In today's world, many people are constantly pursuing pleasure in the form of wealth, success, or sexual fulfillment. Although there is nothing intrinsically wrong with these, Frankl's point is that life must have meaning. A person can inject meaning into even the most degraded life conditions by clinging to his values. But without meaning, life can drag on, seemingly without end. The \\"purpose-driven life\\" is the only life that leads to true fulfillment."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"There is something to be said of a person who can go through a horrific journey such as the atrocities of Auschwitz and recall it with such clarity in order to help others. I was completely emotionally overwhelmed by the first half of the book-which is a narrative of what he experienced and fascinated with the next half which is an explanation of logotherapy.This is not an overly long or hard book to read in spite of some of the subject matter. My version was a thin paperback that I finished in a few days. It took me longer to fully appreciate because I hung onto each page and felt a responsibility to make sure I understood his journey and how he came to his conclusions.I recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"An American doctor once asked Viktor Frankl to explain the difference between conventional psychoanalysis and logotherapy. Before answering, Frankl asked the doctor for his definition of psychoanalysis. The man said, &quot;During psychoanalysis, the patient must lie down on a couch and tell you things which sometimes are very disagreeable to tell.&quot; Frankl immediately replied by saying: &quot;Now, in logotherapy the patient may remain sitting erect but he must hear things which sometimes are very disagreeable to hear.&quot; By this he meant that in logotherapy the patient is actually confronted with and reoriented toward the MEANING of his life. The role of the therapist, then, is to help the patient discover a purposefulness in his life. Frankl's theory is that man's search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a &quot;secondary rationalization&quot; of instinctual drives. Whereas Freudian psychoanalysis focuses on the &quot;will to pleasure&quot; and Adlerian psychology focuses on the &quot;will to power&quot; it can be said that Frankl's logotherapy focuses on the &quot;will to meaning.&quot; Does man give in to to conditions or stand up to them? According to Frankl, the strength of a person's sense of meaning, responsibility, and purpose is the greatest determining factor in how that question will be answered. He believed that &quot;man is ultimately self-determining&quot; and as such, &quot;does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.&quot;The first (and largest) section of this book is the searing autobiographical account of the author's experience as a longtime prisoner in a concentration camp. These camps claimed the lives of his father, mother, brother, and wife. Frankl's survival and the subsequent miracle of this book are a testimony to man's capacity to rise above his outward fate. As Gordon W. Allport states in the preface, &quot;A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to.&quot;I agree, and highly reccommend this book. As the sub-title says, it is an &quot;introduction&quot; to logotherapy, and anyone who wants to go deeper into the principles and practical application of Frankl's existential psychiatry should go to his excellent &quot;The Doctor And The Soul&quot;.Frankl was fond of quoting Nietzsche's dictum...&quot;He who has a WHY to live can bear with almost any HOW.&quot;"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Good stuff. The first half of the book, which deals with his personal experience in the concentration camps, is extremely fascinating. The second half, which I'm not finished with yet, is also very valuable--it takes longer to read due to the complexity, but it's a very different approach to psychology than I've heard in the past. Basically it says (as far as I understand) \\"Who cares what your dad and mom did to you when you were young. You need to find out what is the meaning of your life. Until you do that, you won't be happy.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I'm surprised there aren't a lot more reviews on this book. It might just be the best book I've ever read (and it's really short and easy to read).Viktor Frankl is an amazing man- a psychiatrist who lived in the concentration camps during WWII, and not only made it through and came out alive, but went on to touch many people's lives.The first half of the book, Viktor takes you through his experiences as a prisoner of the concentration camps. It's a unique perspective because he's really getting into what happens mentally to the prisoners and guards. Why do some continue to have the will to live despite everything? Why do others give up and let themselves die? Why do some prisoners show incredible cruelness toward their fellow prisoners, while some of the guards show compassion and kindness? Everything seems to hint to the fact that we are not just a product of our experiences. Even in a concentration camp where it seems like every freedom is stripped of the prisoner, the prisoner is still free on some level to make choices about his own will to live and his own character. So what is it that causes different men in the same situation to make different choices?The second part of the book delves into the answers he came to for all of those questions, as Viktor explains his psychotherapy (or \\"logotherapy\\"). I'm not going to get into all of it now, because I'd rather just recommend you read it yourself. I am sure you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl uses his hellish experience in the concentration camps of World War II to illustrate how one must be pushed to the limit of their being to find out what they are truly capable of. He turns one of the darkest episodes in the history of the world into a strangely uplifting experience for the reader. Through the objective look at the behavior of man suffering the negative sublime, he is able to guide an individual to find the meaning to their own lives. Logotherapy is a key point in this book. Explained thoroughly in the book, logotherapy can be applied to everyone. This book helped me to understand my life in a way which I had not thought about before. I would highly recommend Man's Search for Meaning to anyone, especially those feeling like they need some kind of purpose in their lives."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a beautiful, wonderful book about the salvation of man. A while ago I had done much research into the holocaust, and I find it very unfortunate I did not find this book then. Viktor Frankl was a man to whom life was beloved. He found meaning in his darkest hour, and lived to teach the world a great lesson. It is a novel about death and suffering, and those souls who decided to shine in a sea of darkness. It should be a mandatory read in our high schools, for all our youth, so that they may learn respect and be left amazed by a great man. A man by the name of Viktor Frankl."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I had the good fortune of knowing my great-grandfather, may he rest in peace, for the first ten years of my life. Being a Holocaust survivor, my great-grandfather always had a story or piece of wisdom to share with my family when we visited. He gave my father Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl as a gift and it remains one of my father's favorite books to this day. Although I was too young to read the book at the time, I know now that it rings truth in a new perspective on the Holocaust. My ancestors survived the horrors that the Nazis inflicted upon them, and they lived to tell me the tale. In an engaging and fascinating way, Frankl sheds some light as to how exactly people made it out of the concentration camps alive, with a will to live and with hope for the future.In the first part of the book, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps. He traces the mental state of an average prisoner in the camps, beginning upon arrival, and through liberation. Frankl writes that after the initial shock of reaching the infamous camp, a prisoner would be overcome by a \\"delusion of reprieve\\", an irrational feeling of hope that his situation would somehow be changed for the better. However, after being separated from loved ones in the dreaded selections, and watching them walk towards the gas chambers to their deaths, the reality and horrification of it all dawned upon the prisoner. Frankl describes the next emotional stage as \\"relative apathy\\", which was a complete weakening of the prisoner's senses and feelings, leaving a body merely going through the motions of everyday camp routine rather than a person. According to Frankl, apathy was essential for the preservation of a prisoner's life, because it channeled every emotion he had towards the goal of making it through the day alive. The third and final stage that a prisoner experienced was the complete inability to grasp the meaning of freedom. Following this the prisoner would have to re-learn what emotions such as joy and pleasure meant. Throughout this development, there still remains the question: what were the thoughts that gave a prisoner the drive to live, completely necessary for the conservation of his life? Frankl provides answers to this question in the second section of the book.Throughout the book, Frankl often quotes Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.\\" In the second section, Frankl elaborates on how this phrase sums up, in a nutshell, the mentality with which he survived the war. Having a purpose in life, writes Frankl, is the key to withstanding almost any suffering. Frankl named his theory \\"logotherapy\\", since logos is Greek for meaning. A method employed in psychology, \\"logotherapy\\" causes a patient to pinpoint and become familiar with the meaning of his life, which according to Frankl is the patient's will to strive, succeed, and to live. Frankl goes on to suggest three ways in which one can strive for meaning. The first one, understandably, is to accomplish something. Additionally, meaning can be found by loving another. Finally, man can find meaning by suffering. When one is faced with suffering, and there is nothing he can do to change his predicament, the only remaining option is for him to change his perspective, to change the way in which he views the situation. An example that Frankl gives is of a story of a grieving widower who had lost his wife. The man came to Frankl to ask for advice. Frankl asked the man, \\"What would have happened...if you had died first and your wife would have had to survive without you?\\" Through this question, the suffering the man was enduring gained a new purpose, he was mourning, but his wife would not have to mourn him. This story illustrates the usage of \\"logotherapy\\", and how by using it, one can utilize his suffering and find meaning through it.The Holocaust and World War II is a time in world history that has been studied and pondered by many scholars. There are volumes upon volumes written about this dark time in history. Man's Search for Meaning is unique because Frankl focuses on the psychology of it all. He brings proofs to back up his claim that man's search for meaning is, in and of itself, a will to live. Through starvation, sickness, torture and brutality, surrounded by death and despair, man can endure it all, he can even gain something from it, so long as he has a reason to keep going. Each individual has a different source of meaning, yet no matter what the cause, the meaning alone is what gives that man the drive to wake up each morning and endure whatever life sends his way. Even when faced with death itself, man can survive if he has a reason to.This book was written specifically about the Holocaust and the concentration camps. Nonetheless, there is a life-changing lesson that one can learn from reading the book, no matter what his life circumstances may be. Life is full of challenges, but those challenges eventually cause a person to question who he is and what he stands for, thereby forcing him to determine the meaning in his life. No matter where a person comes from, and no matter where he is headed, he must have a purpose in his life in order to move forward, and to be able to look back at the end of his life and feel proud of all that he accomplished. In a brilliant and insightful way, Victor Frankl has ultimately handed his readers the key to success and happiness, and the answer to many questions; he has affirmed that above all, meaning is what makes life worth living."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In his Foreword to MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING, Rabbi Harold Kushner writes: \\"If a book has one passage, one idea with the power to change a personal life that alone justifies reading it.\\" I read this book in 1961, reread in 1991 and I have just finished reading it again to get a better understanding of it. At the age of 85, I am searching for the meaning for my actual survival of five Nazi camps. I bore witness how people were capable to brave the worst conceivable conditions. I do not recall many nihilists among us prisoners, predominantly pious Jews; our omnipresent suffering had meaning. For most of us, zest for life and trust in God didn't diminish. We were daydreamers of pleasant happenings in the past and wishful happenings in the future. Frankl believes that neither pleasure nor power, but the quest for meaning in life is essential. He quotes Nietzsche's maxim \\"He who has a WHY to live, can bear with almost any HOW.\\"I shared my life story, mainly my predicament during the Holocaust, with over 700 audiences. I deem it to be my mission; it gives a meaning to my suffering. While my story is primarily about suffering and losses, Victor Frankl's first part of the book is primarily about his strength and will to survive. I have often been asked:\\"What kept you going? Why did you strive to stay alive? How could you survive when so many others haven't?\\" I have no clear cut answer; it might have been a combination of factors and luck was perhaps one of them. I do know that despite the suffering I strove to survive. The desire and hope to be reunited with my family gave me the courage to suffer.Frankl, an accomplished psychiatrist before the war, seems to have psychiatric mediums. His therapeutic doctrine known as logotherapy (Logo\\" from the Greek denotes, \\"meaning,\\" and therapy is helping people with their neuroses) implies that it is imperative to find meaning for life. He believed that people cannot avoid suffering but they can choose how to cope with it and to find meaning in it. Hope should never be given up; Frankl quotes Otto von Bismarck (1815-1898) \\"Life is like being at the dentist. You always think that the worst is still to come, and yet it is over already.\\" Frankl survived Auschwitz, and three other concentration camps; this was a miracle and a blessing to us. In this book written six months after liberation Frankl writes: \\"The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute. We, too, clung to shred of hope (p.10).\\"During the Holocaust, I had been subjected to unimaginable acts of extreme wickedness, as reflected in my autobiography From a Name to A Number. I thought that I have seen it all, apparently not. Frankl's book brings to light horrific situations that I have not heard of or read about. His story contributes to the grand, but incomplete, mosaic of Holocaust history. There are still stories to be told, to be written. Once we Holocaust survivors are no longer among the living, our stories, the importance of their intrinsic lessons, should be read and reread. Man's Search for Meaning is a contribution of monumental proportions to the Holocaust legacy. I am grateful to Frankl for enlightening me and others, who have read the 12 million copies, in twenty-four languages, of this book.Frankl had an option, in 1942, to emigrate to the U.S. and thus save his and his wife's life. He had chosen to let his visa lapse, because he didn't want to leave his aging parents in Austria. Consequently, his parents and his wife perished in the Holocaust while incarcerated Viktor Frankl suffered. He found meaning in his suffering. Abiding by the fifth Commandment Honor your Father and Mother was meaningful to Frankl. It is indicative how Frankl's character and compassionate soul enveloped his philosophy."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning, FranklAn engaging story from the first page, in which Frankl interweaves psychological implications with personal experience. It is a book that is filled with wisdom and an irreplaceable perspective, namely that of one who has been through hell and lived to tell the tale. Several thoughts jumped out at me as I read.First, on p. 19 Frankl reveals an unsettling, yet profound, truth regarding the survivors and more importantly, those who did not survive. \\"On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles - whatever one may choose to call them - we know: the best of us did not return.\\"What a sobering thought! What a world that must have been, where humans were reduced to the very basest of existence. Frankl later raises the question of whether or not we have any choice of how we will respond in our circumstances. Are we simply a product of our circumstances, and any human would respond in the same, or similar, fashion? Or do we have freedom of choice in facing our circumstances, no matter what they are? Frankl answers that yes, we do have a choice.The second part is an introduction to logotherapy. He describes the technique of logotherapy as a meaning-based and future-oriented system. He wants people to find meaning in their situation, especially as it relates to the living of their life with their desired future in mind. He rejects the notion that our past controls us, and wishes people to realize their own responsibiltiy to make choices and to determine their own future.The final section of the book is an essay that Frankl wrote called \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism. This short essay is rife with pearls of wisdom.First, Frankl begins with what he calls the 'tragic triad' - those aspects of human existence that can be circumscribed by pain, guilt, or death.Second, he does give a three-fold answer to the question of what gives life meaning. These are: 1 - Creating a work or doing a deed; 2 - experiencing something or encountering someone; and 3 - Turning a tragedy into a triumph, ie: finding meaning in suffering.Frankl ends with a discussion on not just the meaning in every life no matter what the circumstances, but also the value of every life no matter what the circumstances. He contrasts our society's focus on youth and usefulness with a focus on the elderly and their dignity. Youth have possibilities, the elderly have a store of actualities. I love the way Frankl describes our past as a repository, or storehouse, of all that we have done and experienced. Rather than saying the past is irretrievably lost, he looks at the past as being irrevocably stored and treasured. This is an interesting way to look at life, and puts a new perspective on our past. Rather than try to bury it, or to relive it, we need to recognize that it is safely lived and is to be treasured and learned from.Overall, this book is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. I am fascinated by the concepts of logotherapy, and am challenged to think in terms of my own future and what I hope for, as well as to see the meaning in my past and present as well. Additionally, I believe this perspective will help me as I counsel others. While Frankl does not touch much on faith and theology, this book definitely does impact the way I look at human nature, at suffering, and at what it means to live a life that has meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Man can endure any how as long as he has a why ...\\" To me, this is the essential take-away of this clear, moving essay by concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl.

Even if you don't like it, I promise you'll never forget it. I'll admit that I've only read the first half of the book, dealing with Frankl's experiences in the Nazi concentration camps, but the book still changed the way I think about life's challenges.Essentially, Frankl tells readers that depite their physical situation, they still have the power to control their minds and emotions. So basically, even when Nazis are kicking you in the head, you can choose to be happy. It sounds crazy, but Frankl is living proof that man can triumph over misery if he simply chooses to do so. Although I'm not a stranger to the historical accounts of the Holocaust (did I spell that right?), this book really opened my eyes as to what it was really like. After reading about Frankl's experiences, suddenly your own problems won't seem half as bad. This is one of those books that should be required reading for the entire human race. Just the first half of the book hammers the point home really well. If you want to explore the theoretical and psychoanalytical aspects of Frankl's beliefs, then read the second half too. But the first half is what will change you the most. There's powerful stuff here. Use it wisely."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Are human beings solely the product of conditional and environmental factors - biological, psychological and sociological - a predetermined being in every respect? Conversely, does the human being ultimately have freedom of choice? Can she/he, then, transcend these so-called deterministic factors, choose how to respond to the world and live with imposed suffering? In the end, is it conceivably possible to find \\"meaning\\" in our suffering?In this book, Dr. Frankl addresses these important questions, illustrating his terrible experiences as an inmate of the Nazi concentration camps, leading to his discovery of \\"Logotherapy\\" - a revolutionary approach to psychotherapy, that places emphasis on the human being's \\"will-to-meaning\\".The unmentionable atrocities in the Nazi concentration camps of WWII have been well documented. However, Dr. Frankl does not focus on the atrocities themselves, but the numerous ways his fellow inmates \\"responded\\" to the suffering inflicted upon them by their captors. Frankl emphasises that the prisoners of these camps must not be viewed as mere expressions of certain physical and sociological conditions, he writes,\\"Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influence alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp.\\" (P.87)The inmates' survival and sanity depended upon a fundamental inner decision, a choice, in terms of how they responded, mentally and spiritually, to these indignities. From Frankl's observations of his fellow prisoners and his own experiences, brought him to conclude, that,\\"We have stated that that which was, ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner's inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision.\\" (P.90)Those individuals who discovered meaning in their suffering and a faith in the future, maintained an attitude of survival, and had a better chance at staying alive.\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is a powerful text, which explores issues of profound significance, with clarity and humaneness. This is also a highly credible book, because it is written by a man who experienced first hand man's inhumanity to man, and from these unspeakable indignities, discovered a psychology of hope, which can be applied across the entire spectrum of the human condition."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book by Viktor Frankl may appear dated because it was first published in the 1950's, but do not be disallusioned about its timelessness, strength and perspective for all those who want to put their lives in order, realizing that strength from within can be found in ALL situations, by realizing that lifes smallest gifts, realizations, connections, visualizations and observations can put a whole new perspective on one's life and future, while soul searching for the real meaning of life.

I'd never read a book about that, so I was interested to see how he would describe his experiences. In the next part, he talks about his psychiatric method Logotherapy which is a very interesting subject itself.Honestly, it wasn't so much the experiences he talked about that made me stop and think; not the inhumanity, or the excessive strain the camp victims were put under. It was his view and analysis of the circumstances he and his camp mates found themselves in which made me put the book down on more than one occasion and to think deeply about what he had to say. This happened constantly throughout the book, and it made me reflect on the suffering that I have gone through throughout my lifetime.As a final note, there is a part in the book where he talks about paradoxical intention. I have found it to be a great way to break the old habit of freezing up in the urinal when another person is standing next to me. I've also used it with great success in helping me fall asleep when I start to worry that I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.Man's Search for Meaning is certainly a book worth reading by everyone, and especially by people who have undergone an incredible amount of suffering in their lifetimes."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Wonderful book frankl demonstrates great insight into his struggles to stay alive during his horrific experiences in Auschwitz.

Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.\\" Victor express his own testimony of the Holocaust he was a survivor for three years in the camp he shares his observations as he observes those encamped around and about \\"In the concentration camps, for example, in this living laboratory and on this testing ground, we watched and witnessed some of our comrades behave like swine while others behave like saints. Man has both potentialities within himself, which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.\\" Victor retorts his findings how the human being can overcome adverse situations even though the environment was created to destroy the human spirit Victor expresses that it is not the conditions that make the decision it is the decision of the one that makes his choice of the outcome. Many of us have endured tragedy that's what makes this book identifiable although our tragedies are unique they create the same questions, \\"How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?\\" When most people especially soldiers in the military veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars question their views on life from the traumatic events they have witness and endured, not only within the theater but within the home and so we find ourselves lost within our trauma questioning life, \\"Can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects? After all, \\"Saying yes to life in spite of everything.\\" In a world that is quick to write someone off or medicate Victor expresses that we have to be careful as the collective body, \\"First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man's \\"nothingness,\\" the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of a man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is a pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.\\"Victor created \\"Logo therapy\\", a therapist a Logo therapist's role, \\"consist of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.\\" He believes that you have to go beyond yourself the future and not dwell in the past, \\"he stimulated many therapists to look beyond patients past or present problems to help to choose productive futures by making personal choices and taking responsibility for them.\\" I truly see this book as inspirational one that can help one to get back on track to push it forward, \\"to take a stand towards the conditions.\\" Victor says, \\"What is demanded of man is not, as some existential philosophers teach, to endure the meaningless of life, but rather to bear his incapacity to grasp its unconditional meaningless in rational terms, Logos is deeper than logic."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Awesome content, well put even for the non-specialists.

I find it hard to believe there is so much hate in this world that would drive one group of people to want to kill and oppress not only one other person, but an entire race of people. The hate is there and it is awful. Since I feel sorry for myself and become depressed more than I would like, I found more meaning to my life just from reading this book. I can't imagine what it would be like to survive such a horrific event such as this. For people to find meaning in their lives while experiencing these tragedies is amazing. I think many of us can apply logotherapy in our lives too. The logotherapy examples the author described that helped his patients were interesting because they worked and now I want to apply them in my own life. The fact that the author experienced these awful things and was able to learn from it and help other people is awesome. This book is a great read for everyone, especially ones who are depressed.

We search for meaning in our lives, but, as Dr. Frankel says, I can't hope to find the meaning of my life as a whole until I'm at the end of it, and maybe I can't even know it then. Instead, following his example and writings, I can find meaning in my life every day by being the best me I can be today. That's all there is, anyway, because we don't know if we will even have tomorrow. He says finding meaning in life is an art to engage in every day, not a scientific search to reach a conclusion once and for all. For me it was a new perspective to look at the meaning of my life from the perspective of just being my truest self today, rather than deriving my meaning from my activities and accomplishments."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have to admit that I heard about this book very recently. I was introduced to this book while I was reading Dr. Francis Collins's collection of essays \\"Belief\\".Dr.Frankl's essay from that collection struck me as one of the deepest and most meaningful one.At that moment I decided to read the book. The book is worth the money with just the introduction, throughout the book you really feel like talking to the person himself on a winter night by the fire place.As a person who was partially faced with similar decisions (having to leave the parents and spending part of my life time under oppression), I found this book very touching.I wish every high school student read this book, this way they may take fewer things for granted.The value of the book does't consist only in the excellent narrative style but also on the psychological depth.Definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl was already a psychiatrist at the time that he was a prisoner in Auschwitz, and some other camps, during WWII. It's the most interesting description of concentration life I've heard that I found bearable to listen to. He's very good at describing how being in a concentration camp affected the minds of the prisoners and also the guards and others who were in charge. The prisoners were all different psychologically. Some of them were destroyed mentally by the prison life. I common trait was becoming absorbed in the past to escape the unbearable present. Of course, I've seen this happen in everyday life with people who were not in concentration camps, which I think the main value of this book. His discription of psychology under these horrible conditions, one can recognize in the psychology of men one meets and knows in everyday life. He describes, too, how people acted when they were released, which was for many as difficult or even more so than adjusting to life in the camp. People often seemed indifferent to what the prisoner had just gone through, which affected different released prisoners in different ways. The strong men, like Dr. Frankl, used the concentration camp experience to grow spiritually and psychologically, but those kinds of men are few and far between.After the War, Dr. Frankl became a practicing psychiatrist, and developed something he calls logotherapy. It's based on his idea that he developed while in the camps that man is searching for meaning in life above everything else. The men who could find some meaning in their concentration camp experience survived the best.This book is especially wonderful if you are really interested in psychology and how people react under the most sever of circumstances, which, according to Dr. Frankil, is ever which way."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Just in case, if one wants to ascertain the level of endurance human beings possess, he needs to go no further than read through the experiences at concentration camps as recalled by a survivor - Viktor Frankl - in this book.And considering that a will to survive does not manifest only in situations where life is at stake, physically, but at various stages in life, where even smallest of problems can seem mammoth and wreck havoc in making life miserable at psychological level, the lessons contained in this book have vast practical applications, when it comes to understanding our survival instinct.The basic principle which differentiates a survivor from a loser is well highlighted by the following quote, which is often cited by the author in the book - 'The one who has a why to live can bear almost any how.'I would highly recommend this book and would suggest re-reading it a few times because it would better enable on to grasp and internalize the importance of the subject addressed in this book and appreciate the viewpoint of the author."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first read this book in college many years ago as I was working on my degree in psychology. An excerpt from it is in John McCain's autobiographical book,Faith of My Fathers: A Family Memoir. I was glad to be reminded of this book which I had not read in years. I found my old copy on the shelf but I am also glad to learn it is still available.The comparison between Frankl and McCain as prisoners is striking. Both of them emphasize the basic human need for meaning and purpose. Both share incredible horrors of prison camp as well as the human ability to look beyond present circumstances, to keep the horrid memories from continuing as sources of torture years after the actual experiences.We can apply this ability to many of the unfortunate experiences in our lives. It is not only an attitude of forgive and forget, it is the need to keep the horrors or smaller angers from continuing to torment us.It is more than a little frightening that there are people who deny that the Holocaust even happened.

The details of Logotherapy wear a bit thin after many reads, just because of familiarity.I don't really relate to the idea of suffering as a life accomplishment - not because I devalue the trials of those who have no other choice, but just because I'm disconnected enough from it that I have trouble relating. I do continue to find the idea that a purpose is imposed on you rather than vice versa intriguing, although again, I'm not sure that I agree.It's a great book and everyone should at least make a lap of the biography to understand what the Holocaust looked like from an insider, particularly people like myself who have been affected by the death of loved ones.If you've never read it, it will be the best $7 you've ever spent."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl has written an powerfull book about his years as a prisoner inside a nazi concentration camp. He worked as a psychologist and wrote on the subject of lifes meaning. The book is a powerfull testament to the will of humans to survive in dire circumstances. The book begins with the train full of prisoners rolling into the camp. At once they are stripped of all their belongings. Beginning with their clothes, and then glasses, jewlery and all other personal belongings. This is the first step in the process of dehumanizing them. So the struggle for these prisoners he writes is very much about struggling to keep the idea of yourself as a subject alive. To keep alive ones feeling of self worth was essential for survival. it was also important he writes to have the feeling that one had a spiritual center where one could retain some freedom even though one was imprisoned. Otherwise he or she will regress to feeling very small and in the end becoming a formless member of the herd, like an animal. Once this was achieved, when the personality and subjectivity had been broken and erased the person could be willed to do almost anything. The spirit only survives he writes, as long as the idea of hope does. That is why in the suffering one has to parodoxically have to try to find some meaning. If one dosent then the organism is in great danger of being annihilated. Only those who where able to somehow retain a sense of hope, that maybe somewhere someone was waiting for them, that someone who loved them was thinking about them, that god,even though it seemed impossible, saw their suffering."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Title says it all.

Dr. Frankl's words have a profoundly honest ring, for they rest on experiences to deep for deception.\\"So wrote Gordon Allport, Harvard Professor of Psychology and at mid-20th century, one of the great American psychologists. What does Frankl say? More vitally, what talk has he walked?\\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" is not a boastful or an easy book. But it is forcefully honest & gripping -- ongoing struggles, failures and flashes of success, brilliant success really. Not so much in preserving sanity. For who of us has the right to dare call insane anyone in a concentration camp who became overwhelmed or gave up? Frankl's struggles, and the struggles of those around him, were how to keep humanely living in the face of what seems unfaceable.As Frankl says, \\"...we had nothing to lose except our so ridiculously naked lives.\\" If there's a meaning, a reason, a \\"why?\\" sturdy enough to bear that load, it must confront outrageous & unavoidable suffering.I'm a psychotherapist; I work with many who suffer: children severely abused & neglected, adults still caught up in their abuse, soldiers back from Iraq along with their spouses & children. A label is easy & obvious: PTSD. Healing is not.Frankl, writing well before we called this a \\"stress disorder\\" (Concentration camps = STRESS? Can you feel how wrong it is to stop at the mechanics of stress?), shows us a deeper, more accurate, more transcendent reality & truth. Struggling to find a worthy life in the face of suffering is not a \\"disorder\\". In that struggle we can become profoundly sickened, and our risk of sickening is never far away. But equally possible & present is a humbling choice: we can honestly face our suffering and struggle to find (create, build, open ourselves up to, ....) our own meaning. \\"Our own\\", in that it is individual to us, but it is never \\"just ourselves\\".Through brutally-learned understandings & terribly-lived examples, Frankl shows us ways. I fear quoting a few lines. It feels like sound-biting & trivializing, not only misleading but obscene. Frankl isn't about one-liners, though he writes many memorable lines & stories.

He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how. A man can get used to anything but do not ask how. Set me like a seal upon thy heart, love is as strong as death. There is only one thing that i dread, not to be worthy for my sufferings.Dr. Frankl's idea of meaning is a bit unnatural and i believe it would be fair to say that he sees this as a kind of religion.

Author Viktor E. Frankl is a pioneer for his groundbreaking Logotherapy. Most of this book was written in Auschwitz concentration camp.Part 1 of the book summarizes author's experience in concentration camp and his observation of human nature. One of my favorite quotes from this part is \\"there are only two races of men, decent men and indecent and no society is free of either of them.Part 2 of the book explains Logotherapy & related concepts. One of his favorite metaphors is the existential vacuum. If meaning is what we desire, then meaninglessness is a hole, an emptiness, in our lives. Whenever you have a vacuum, of course, things rush in to fill it. Frankl suggests that one of the most conspicuous signs of existential vacuum in our society is boredom. He points out how often people, when they finally have the time to do what they want, don't seem to want to do anything! People go into a tailspin when they retire; students get drunk every weekend; we submerge ourselves in passive entertainment every evening. The \\"Sunday neurosis,\\" he calls it.So we attempt to fill our existential vacuums with \\"stuff\\" that, because it provides some satisfaction (i.e. happiness), we hope will provide ultimate satisfaction as well: We might try to fill our lives with pleasure, eating beyond all necessity, having promiscuous sex, living \\"the high life;\\" or we might seek power, especially the power represented by monetary success; or we might fill our lives with \\"busy-ness,\\" conformity, conventionality; or we might fill the vacuum with anger and hatred and spend our days attempting to destroy what we think is hurting us. We might also fill our lives with certain neurotic \\"vicious cycles,\\" such as obsession with germs and cleanliness, or fear-driven obsession with a phobic object. The defining quality of these vicious cycles is that, whatever we do, it is never enough.On the subject of happiness, Frankl quotes Edith Weisskopf-Joelson's paper on logotherapy, which shows great insight into the soul of the 21st century: \\"Our current mental hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, that unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavoidable unhappiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy.\\" He contends that \\"Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue\\". What an eye-opener...I read this part of the book every day, till the time I was reading the book.Finding Meaning:So how do we find meaning? Frankl suggests three broad approaches. The first is through experiential values, that is, by experiencing something - or someone - we value. This can include Maslow's peak experiences and esthetic experiences such as viewing great art or natural wonders. The most important example of experiential values is the love we feel towards another. Through our love, we can enable our beloved to develop meaning, and by doing so, we develop meaning ourselves! Love, he says, \\"is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire\\".Frankl points out that, in modern society, many confuse sex with love. Without love, he says, sex is nothing more than masturbation, and the other is nothing more than a tool to be used, a means to an end. Sex can only be fully enjoyed as the physical expression of love. Love is the recognition of the uniqueness of the other as an individual, with an intuitive understanding of their full potential as human beings. Frankl believes this is only possible within monogamous relationships. As long as partners are interchangeable, they remain objects.A second means of discovering meaning is through creative values, by \\"doing a deed,\\" as he puts it. This is the traditional existential idea of providing oneself with meaning by becoming involved in one's projects, or, better, in the project of one's own life. It includes the creativity involved in art, music, writing, invention, and so on. Frankl views creativity (as well as love) as a function of the spiritual unconscious, that is, the conscience. The irrationality of artistic production is the same as the intuition that allows us to recognize the good.The third means of finding meaning is one few people besides Frankl talk about: attitudinal values. Attitudinal values include such virtues as compassion, bravery, a good sense of humor, and so on. But Frankl's most famous example is achieving meaning by way of suffering.He gives an example concerning one of his clients: A doctor whose wife had died mourned her terribly. Frankl asked him, \\"if you had died first, what would it have been like for her?\\" The doctor answered that it would have been incredibly difficult for her. Frankl then pointed out that, by her dying first, she had been spared that suffering, but that now he had to pay the price by surviving and mourning her. In other words, grief is the price we pay for love. For the doctor, this thought gave his wife's death and his own pain meaning, which in turn allowed him to deal with it. His suffering becomes something more: With meaning, suffering can be endured with dignity.Frankl also notes that seriously ill people are not often given an opportunity to suffer bravely, and thereby retain some dignity. Cheer up! we say. Be optimistic! Often, they are made to feel ashamed of their pain and unhappiness.He says this: \\"everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.\\"Conclusion:Irrespective of your religious or spiritual inclination, this book is something you cannot ignore. Every reading session will introduce you to a new aspect of human psyche and will set you in soul-searching mode. A highly recommended book for those who want to go beyond the clutter of everyday life and find deeper meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"If I had to read only one book in my life, this would be the book.

It should be required reading for all high school students. It is a deeply moving account of one man's survival, physically and emotionally, of an incredibly horrendous experience. It has given me a guiding light during difficult times in my own life."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found this book to be deeply moving. The first section where he describes his time in a concentration camp and the ways that he and his fellow inmates attempted to cope with the terrible conditions , is extremely good. It is well written and though maybe not quite in the class of Primo Levi it is still one of the best biographical works on this subject that I have read. It is extremely inspiring.The second section of the book mainly describes his \\"logotherapy\\" theory. It is very interesting and I can see that many people would get a lot out of it but I was not entirely convinced by it. Finding your own personal meaning to life is probably extremely beneficial to you but I don't think that you can entirely prove or even disprove that there is an ultimate meaning to life.Despite this small reservation I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I found his perception of human behavior incredibly enlightening. I found his honesty incredibly humbling. He wrote for the reader and I learned about myself and human nature. Sin. Given the circumstances, when ones basic needs are not met, in the face of terror, pain, loss desperation, what would I do? What would I accept? How far would I go? I am afraid to find out. He did. He can be proud of who he is. He has gone there and come back. His integrity intact. His wisdom far beyond what I can ever hope to achieve."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"As with any story of survival I am inspired. However, in addition to recounting his experience in the concentration camps, Viktor Frankl expounds on his unique psychological technique -logotherapy. Of course this is a fascinating and terrifying read but he provides an insight into his experiences that really must be read firsthand to truly be appreciated."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is definitely a must read for everybody. The first part of this book focuses on Frankl's time in the concentration camps, and the second part focuses on his ideas of logotherapy, and you definitely need the first part to really understand the second part. According to Frankl, no matter what situation you are put into, you can choose how to react to it, you end up choosing who you are. Frankl's Logotherapy is based around the idea that everything man does stems from his search for meaning, which I think makes a lot of sense. This is is a book that you must read, whether or not you are interested in psychology. It is a quick read, but you will want to keep reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book as was referenced by Denis Waitley's Psychology of Winning Tape/Book.

She had suffered in her final month, and had left me and my siblings without a mother at a fairly young age. Being able to think about the meaning of one's life, the purpose of suffering, and the spiritual drive that transcends us was very comforting. I now realize that every challenge I face is a new test, and every time I pass the test I can become a stronger human with more gifts to give.As much as Frankl's message, I also appreciate his brevity. Many would have been compelled to write a 1000 page tome, but Frankl kept it brief and to the point. Because of that, I think each word carries even more significance.If you haven't read this book, it should be the next one on your list."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I write this article as I still read this book out of immense inspiration. We, humans have this curiosity to discover ourselves and if we don't really put an effort to find an answer, we at least put a lot of effort in hiding and forgetting this maddening quest. It takes various forms, from intoxication and debauchery to art and science. But, there is no peace until we find an answer to this question that we have in our mind. The lives of great geniuses of the past and all their sad stories stand witness to my above hypothesis. We feel victimized by the society or god for some reason or the other. But least do we realize that irrespective of all the tumult that happens around, we are bestowed with something that the rest of the animal kingdom doesn't have-spiritual freedom. To decide how we want to feel at any given instant- Freedom that we yarn for but constantly run away from.This is something everyone is aware of but this wonderful book logically explains it in a easily understandable way to transfer the thought into the conscious part of our mind from the subconscious or unconscious.

It was also meaningful to my experience as an elementary school teacher, a daughter and sister, and every other role I have in life.

Frankl shares his experience as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII, and how this experience helped him to develop an approach to psychotherapy (called logotherapy). Even those readers who are not interested in the details of his theory will enjoy Part I, which consists of the story of his experiences at Auschwitz and Dachau. His main point is that everyone can find the will to go on, even in the direst of circumstances, if only we can identify something that we are willing to live for. Frankl's tragic experiences, and his glorious victory are an example for every human to aspire to. Man's Search for Meaning should be required reading for life!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In my opinion, \\"Man's search for meaning\\" (1946) is a very interesting book, that will leave you with some practical knowledge easy to apply in your daily life. In a nutshell, and if you aren't feeling like reading a more or less long review, the main idea of this book is that \\"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\\".The above quoted phrase is from Nietzsche, but don't jump to conclusions: Viktor Frankl (1905-1997) certainly does not share his philosophical ideas. Frankl merely chose one of Nietzsche's phrases as a way to crystallize his own ideas: that is, that the most important force in a person's life is his will to meaning. In a way, this book shows how Frankl reached that conclusion.The first part of \\"Man's search for meaning\\" deals with the author's experiences in a Nazi concentration camp, and the lessons he draw from that torturous experience. Frankl said that those that survived had one thing in common, a purpose, and that \\"everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way no matter the circumstance\\".In the second part of this book, Frankl explains logotheraphy, the theory of psychotherapy he developed. According to the author, logotherapy focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on a person's search for such meaning, and the consequent purpose. Frankl says that \\"The meaning of life always changes, but... it never ceases to be\\", and that we really find ourselves when we find it, or at least our own personal version of it. Furthermore, he also says that \\"the meaning of our existence is not invented by ourselves, but rather detected,\\" and that logos, or \\"meaning\\", is not only merely something emerging from existence itself but rather something confronting said existence. The author also points out that logotherapy gives great importance to responsibility, due to the fact that \\"each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.\\"It is pertinent to highlight the fact that logotheraphy differs strongly from other two well-known schools of psychoteraphy, Freudian psychoanalysis (that centers on the will to pleasure), and Adlerian psychology (that focuses on the will to power). From my point of view, Frankl perspective makes for a much better explanation...All in all, I highly recommend this book. I like the central place that Frankl gives to responsibility, and the idea that man \\"does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment\\". In my opinion, \\"Man's search for meaning\\" is interesting, but specially and most importantly, it makes sense...Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Since its first publication in 1946, Viktor E. Frankl's landmark book has sold over two million copies. From his horrific experiences in Nazi death camps, Frankl has extracted a moving, uplifting message of that uniquely human longing: the need for meaning. Frankl delves into the depths of his own experience to extricate a highly provocative and extraordinary suggestion; that man's primary motivating force is his search for meaning. Frankl holds that man cannot exist or live with any hope or joy if he cannot find meaning to do so.Frankl's stays in Auschwitz and Dachu provided him with the opportunity to examine human behavior under the most strenuous of circumstances. He was able to separate himself from his emotions and allow himself to examine his compatriots in the light of his psychoanalytical training. The account of his time in the camps veers away from recounting the terrible events, towards focusing instead on the prisoners' reactions to them; the way they coped and how some survived where others couldn't.Frankl's book is composed of several parts. The first section is a narrative of his concentration camp experiences. The second and third sections of the book summarize and expand upon his new form of therapy; logotherapy. The basic tenant of his logotherapy is the concept that the primary motivating force in a man's life is his search for meaning. Hence, the title of the book. Frankl illustrates his new concept through many examples. From the men joking in the trenches they were digging to his meditation on his wife and his love for her. Frankl kept himself alive through his dedication to optimism and his hope for the future. He calls his optimism, \`tragic optimism' for it is only through the experience of tragedy, Frankl says, that we can come to know the extent of our imagination and thus, our optimism. Frankl says that this tragic optimism is borne only out of dire situation such as his experience.In the latter half of the book, Frankl goes on to explain his new philosophy and therapy model. He uses the example of the man who decided not to work one day in the camp to illustrate how some men found the will to live and others did not. He holds that this will to live is created as a direct result of a man's desire for meaning and the ensuing search for the same. He explains that a human's reaction to a gives set of circumstances is not defiantly controllable. A man's emotional reaction and response are fluid and private; unable to be controlled by any external force lesser than his own internal will.While not discussing his ideas in religious terms, per se, Frankl's Jewish identity seeps through the books lines and becomes quite evident at times. While it may be difficult to reconcile strict existentialism with true Judaism, Frankl's devotion to his faith and to his theory are, quite evidently, equal. While he usually discusses an inner being and an \`emotional centre', Frankl's language sometimes slips back into his common tongue and he refers to this \\"centre\\" as a soul.This book is a wonderful investment. Its succinct and direct analysis of the human condition is an easy read for even the most novice. It explains the concepts of logotherapy in language that is unencumbered by complexities of language or technical terminology. Frankl was a common man writing for others in his style. Initially intended to be published anonymously, Man's Search for Meaning is as deep and profound an analysis of the human condition as there has ever been. Written by a man on the forefront of a disaster of epic proportions, it provides the reader with a refreshing gust of clear reasoning and profound opportunity for self-analysis and self-improvement."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This book is simultaneusly a chronicle, a pshychology essay, an ethical treaty, and a quite effective medicine against suffering.The first part is about the author's experinces in some nazi concentration camps, from a psychiatrist point of view. This view is fairly unbiased and an example of that is that he never mentions the word &quot;jew&quot; in the whole book. One of his categorical conclusions is that there are only two kinds of human reces: the decent human beings and the non decent ones.This first part of the book (originally planned to be the whole book) serves as a basis for the second part where the basics of logotherapy are explained. Regardles wheter or not a reader agrees with the psychiatry ideas on the second part, what resulted evident to me is that those ideas can be enormously helpful for people that are suffering deeply. Some of those ideas would seem commonplace but that is just because this book has been extremly influential. I am sure anyone can read this book with the certainty that she is not wasiting her time."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I purchased \\"Mans Search for meaning\\" because Amazon suggested it after I read \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. I began to read it, and at first it seemed quite a bit like \\"Night\\" (which was a terrific book may I mention). As you read on after his story of being in the Concentration Camp, he begins to talk about how he was able to handle being in the position in which he was. This is when the book begins to hit you differently! It feels like he is talking directly to you. Trying to help guide you in a better direction than what your life may be leading. It makes you want to be and do better! I believe everyone gets something different and the same from \\"Man Search for Meaning\\". It helped me, I now feel like my life is going in the right direction, thanks to Viktor E Frankl. I highly recommend this book! Make time to read it, there's so much power in such a small book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Victor Frankl was an existentialist. The existentialists went out of fashion in psychiatry because they were equated with a \`be glad you're neurotic\\" approach, and denial of the reality of mental illness. This was bad for the psychiatry business, although several existentialists made a living as psychiatrists.The book is in two halves; the first describes his concentration camp experiences, the second his method of psychotherapy (or rather his philosophy of life) which he called logotherapy. The first half is not irrelevant to the second half. Some psychologists, such as Abraham Maslow, with his hierarchy of needs, suggest that issues like search for meaning are just icing on the cake of life. They become irrelevant when the chips are down. A starving man does not worry about the state of world politics. Frankl's experiences taught him that the will to go on living comes from some kind of inner force that is not just an animal survival instinct.Is logotherapy really a treatment method, or should we consider this book as self-help? I think it is more useful as a book for patients than as a manual for therapists, although I hope it doesn't persuade them to throw away their Prozac. It is full of illuminating insights and I found myself underlining many passages. Some of the actual techniques described, such as negative practice for obsessive rituals are more akin to behavior therapy than insight-oriented psychotherapy. He describes several one-shot cures brought about by philosophical utterances which may have worked for him but are in the category of \\"don't try this at home\\" for less charismatic practitioners. His ideas about anhedonia and boredom are good."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Dr. Frankl's book of Man's Search for Meaning, was written by him in only nine days.

Dr. Frankl, an existentialist psychotherapist, has a great outlook on life and is a religious man who through his trying experiences can help others get through bad times.The first part of the book describes his pain and suffering in concentration camps and \\"the why and the how\\" he made it through the injustices unfairly brought upon him. His mother, father, brother and wife all died in the concentration camps. But, it was only when he got home that he found out their destiny. With all the pain and suffering that occurred, his will to live endured because of his research which gave meaning to his life.Logotherapy, was covered in the second part of the book.

In the first part of Man's Search for Meaning, Experiences in a Concentration Camp, Frankl engrosses the reader the feelings and general experience of the average concentration camp prisoner. He does not focus on the horrific details of the camps, but rather, he poignantly expresses the psychological state produced by these experiences. The second part of the book, Logotherapy in a Nutshell, is a brief overview of the system of psychology that Frankl founded. The third part of the book, The Case for a Tragic Optimism, was added to the 1984 edition and is based off one of Frankl's 1983 lectures. In it, Frankl expounds logotherapy a little further. This work has won its place in history. In conjunction with being one of the main texts in the field of logotherapy, its gripping description on the concentration camps makes it not only compelling but also highly informative. This is a must read for anyone who has ever put thought into psychology, spirituality, or the meaning of life. Man's Search for Meaning is well written and not difficult to read. This short work will have an impact on anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"At a time in my life when I thought there could be no hope, no God, and little goodness - when I had seen such cruelty through my profession that I despaired at the horrific reality of man's evil soul - Frankl's book was a beacon of generosity of spirit and unwavering belief that there is meaning in all experiences. Frankl's highly personal account of war crimes and his practical logotherapy that resulted deserves careful reading - he earned that respect with blood - and for military or law enforcement professionals who are burdened with the worst of humanity, Frankl offers mature understanding and legitimate hope for us all.

The book itself is split into two sections: the first half covers the authors account of his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps, and second provides a quick introduction to his school of psychotherapy (Logotherapy) which he developed as a result of his experiences in the camps.Freud focused on desire, Nietschze on power, and Frankl focuses on \\"a will to meaning\\" (Logotherapy) as our primary driver.

The author illustrates all of these questions with his experiences in the concentration camps, as well as from his medical practice.Perhaps only due to my own ignorance, but I am amazed that I have not come across Frankl's works before. Out of all the \\"self-help\\", \\"personal growth\\", and psychology books I've read in the past few years, this one has left the most profound impression.

He is most commonly thought of as the founder of \\"logotherapy,\\" the third \\"Viennese School of Psychotherapy,\\" Freud and Adler being earlier founders of psychoanalytic and individual psychology respectively.SYNOPSIS OF THE BOOK:The book is divided into two parts. The preface to the first edition is by Gordon W. Allport (1897-1967), at the time of the first edition, former professor of psychology at Harvard. Allport was chiefly responsible for the spread of Frankl's logotherapy within the U.S.[1]The preface to the 1984 edition is by Frankl himself. In that preface, Frankl explains the relationship between the two parts of the book. The first half is a story of life in a concentration camp and serves as the existential validation of the second, theoretical half of the book, which is Frankl's introduction to \\"logotherapy.\\"In the first half, Frankl relates some of his own experiences during World War II, during which he spent time in three concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Dachau. He divides the first half of the book according to the three phases of life he and others experienced in their internment in the camps: (1) the initial shock of camp life, (2) the routine of camp life, and (3) the experience and aftermath of freedom. Highlights are as follows:From the beginning, camp life is dominated by a sociological structure made up of Capos (collaborators who rule over other prisoners), other prominent prisoners (e.g., cooks, storekeepers, doctors, nurses, and camp policemen), foremen, wardens, and theSchutzstaffel (SS). At the bottom are ordinary prisoners. Despite the hierarchy and the evil it represents, no group is entirely villainous. Humanity is made up of two \\"races\\" -- the decent and the indecent -- and they are found at every level. The mere fact that a person is a member of a particular group does not indicate to which \\"race\\" he may belong.At first, prisoners experience hopelessness mixed with \\"delusions of reprieve.\\" Homesickness and nostalgia are intense. Abnormal responses to abnormal circumstances are pervasive and entirely normal. Everything conspires to eliminate the basic humanity of victims -- yet some manage to rise above the downward pull of bestial circumstances. But sadly, as Frankl says, \\"the best of us did not survive.\\"As camp life becomes routine, grim humor and cold detachment take hold. The world outside the prison camp becomes unreal. The torture of others no longer provokes sympathy or revulsion. Apathy and the blunting of emotions become functional in making inmates insensitive to routine beatings. The sole task becomes survival. For most inmates, inner life is reduced to its most primitive state. Lack of sleep, lack of food, sickness, mistreatment, and hard labor amplify irritability. Violence begets violence among those who are routinely violated. Food dominates dreams and conversation. A few even resort to cannibalism. Yet politics and religion remain topics of intense conversation. Inmates still join each other in appreciating the beauties of nature. Amazingly, art and entertainment still survive, while sexual deviancy is strikingly absent in their all-male environment.The most telling influence of all is the \\"provisional existence\\" inmates experience in not knowing if or when their confinement will end. Psychic time runs counter to actual time. Days seem to last forever, but weeks pass quickly.In the midst of it all, some inmates manage to maintain an inner hold that helps them rise above their degrading environment. In so doing, they bear witness to the reality of human liberty despite the unimaginable constraints of camp life. In the worst of circumstances, humans still have a choice. Present existence can still have meaning in the face of profound and unavoidable suffering. Opportunities and challenges are continually present. It is always possible to make something positive of life -- even life in a concentration camp. In Frankl's words, \\"it does not really matter what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.\\" In contrast, those who lose faith in their future are doomed.Liberation from camp life has its own dangers. Surprisingly, it does not come with overwhelming gladness, but with timidity and with depersonalization. Prisoners have to relearn joy. The sudden release of enormous mental pressure puts inmates at risk of moral and spiritual deformity. Liberty does not mean the prisoners do not need spiritual care. The oppressed have almost irresistible temptations to become oppressors. Bitterness comes from disappointed expectations of how great release would be. The dreams that kept prisoners going in the dark days of imprisonment clash with the reality of loved ones who no longer exist. Disillusionment comes when inmates learn that suffering does not cease. Eventually the experience of camp life becomes unreal -- more like a nightmare than something that really happened. But in the end, former inmates have the comforting realization they have nothing left to fear except their God.Man's Search for Meaning differs from Frankl's original intention in two important respects. He originally intended only to write the first half of the book as an anonymous account, content simply to have his unattributed experiences of deepest suffering demonstrate the possibility of finding meaning in life despite the worst of circumstances. His friends, however, convinced him to add his name as author and his publisher requested he add a description of the basic tenets of logotherapy and a bibliography, the former of which constitutes Part II of the present work. The 1984 edition addresses more recent concerns in a postscript entitled \\"The Case for a Tragic Optimism.\\"REFLECTIONS:Logotherapy provides deep insight into the basic nature of humanity. Its tenets are so easily taken for granted that Frankl's contribution seems to be, not so much as telling people something new, but more for articulating so well what they knew all along. The idea that humans cannot survive without meaning has explanatory power that can hardly be questioned. As Frankl says, \\"suffering ceases to be suffering once it has meaning.\\" And to paraphrase him, suffering is not a prerequisite to meaning, but meaning can be found even in suffering.Logotherapy is valuable in highlighting absence of meaning as a common source of psychological problems. Frankl is astute in seeing meaninglessness as the motive behind destructive pursuits of pleasure and the constant need for more and more entertainment.[2] There is little doubt that boredom,[3] depression, aggression, and addiction[4] are often traceable to a loss of meaning. It is useful to see such problems as possibly arising, not from psychodynamics, but from Frankl's \\"noodynamics\\" and the \\"existential vacuum\\" that meaninglessness entails. Frankl's examples of how quickly aggression within a group is \\"cured\\" by a collective task and how rapidly depression gives way in the face of new meaning to life are compelling. He is right in observing that people may have the \\"means to live,\\" but they are in deep trouble if they do not have a \\"meaning to live.\\" Most people will agree (although they may not act accordingly) that happiness cannot be obtained by pursuing it directly. Rather, as Frankl points out, it must ensue as an unsought consequence of pursuing something else.Logotherapy provides a useful counterpoint to much of Freudian psychology. Freud predicted starvation would reduce people to an identical urge. But Frankl found that starvation heightened the distinctions among individuals rather than diminishing them. Freudian psychology equates length of treatment with the depth of cure. But logotherapy suggests the possibility of deep and lasting benefits from the shortest of consultations. Freud sought cures in introspection and retrospection. But logotherapy finds answers to problems by looking outside oneself and to the future. Freud saw the deepest motive of humans as a \\"will to pleasure.\\" But logotherapy sees the most basic need as a \\"will to meaning.\\"[5] Freud saw inner tension as a problem in itself. But logotherapy sees inner tension as healthy in leading to the resolution of existential frustration through the discovery of meaning in individual situations. Freud provided modernism's third blow to human dignity[6] in challenging human free will. But logotherapy holds that humans always have a choice.Frankl is a realist and an optimist in arguing that, although humans are not free from circumstances, they are free to take a stand against circumstances. He is provocative in asserting that no circumstances exist that can rob humans of all freedom. He opposes reductionist understandings of humanity in affirming the main characteristic of humans as the ability to rise above determinants -- determinants that Freudian psychology would find insurmountable. As Frankl says, \\"man invented the gas chambers, but it was also man who entered those chambers with head held high.\\"On the surface, Frankl's assertion of the \\"unconditional meaningfulness of life\\" sounds troubling in apparently asserting meaningfulness for all choices, good and evil. The phrase is best understood, however, in opposing nihilism, which asserts that nothing has meaning. Frankl would probably say that even bad choices have significance -- how much more the good ones!Frankl correctly points out that humans find meaning in three kinds of choices: (1) through deeds or actions, (2) through encounters with something or someone, and (3) through their attitudes toward unavoidable suffering. The latter is most important in religious matters because it is the fact of suffering that calls God's goodness or even His existence into question.[7] For religious people, the personal meaning of particular situations is inseparable from the meaning of those same situations to God. For them, the search for meaning is the pursuit of what God intends in a particular circumstance.So Frankl's denial of any absolute meaning for a given situation may be a bit problematic for religious people who are accustomed to thinking of one big divine Master Plan that comprehends and judges every decision. That apparent dilemma can be resolved, however, by appreciating the radical nature of human freedom. True righteousness does not mean choosing the one right course of action out of a multitude of wrong ones, but rather pursuing one choice out of many equally good choices with an attitude of faith.[8]Of course, non-religious people need logotherapy too. Logotherapy is well-suited to an increasingly secular Western world where psychiatrists are increasingly encountering, not cases of disease, but questions of meaning. Unfortunately, many psychiatrists have been educated, as Frankl notes, into a philosophy of nihilism, which they in turn pass on to their patients with tragic results. They are also wrongly trained to see human beings as \\"brain machines.\\" They are too inclined to debunk that which is truly human in terms of it being simply a mask or facade for subconscious mechanisms.[9] So logotherapy provides a needed corrective for both secular patients and their secular care-givers in its \\"re-humanizing\\" of psychology.Frankl disavows any dogmatism in logotherapy. Although Jewish, he easily speaks of \\"crosses to bear.\\" Frankl's eclectic impulse is evidenced in his adoption of techniques that have no necessary connection to logotherapy itself. An example would be \\"pseudo-orientation in time\\" -- a strategy of clarifying decision making by adopting a future stance looking back on a present decision. Another would be \\"paradoxical intention\\" -- a treatment of disorders (e.g., stuttering, insomnia) by intentionally trying to incite them (hyper-intention). A third would be \\"dereflection\\" -- a treatment for hyper-reflection and hyper-intention.One of Frankl's most intriguing thoughts is his assertion that man is most human when focused on something outside himself. Couple that notion with the idea that man is made in the image of God and the result fits perfectly with the self-emptying nature of Christ in the \\"kenosis hymn\\" in chapter 2 of Philippians. Moreover, it should not be surprising that the good theology of Philippians 2 finds expression in physicalities of God's good creation. For we see humans who are made in the image of God endowed with the same kenotic impulse -- the same need to empty themselves for the sake of something outside themselves. Achieving that transcendence is healthy. Failing it is dysfunctional.Compared to existentialists in general, Frankl is more optimistic, less nihilistic, and more accommodating to the notion of God than most. But his is an odd form of existentialism in those respects. Existentialism and traditional Christianity do not mix very well. Existentialists say, \\"existence comes before meaning\\" -- i.e., no meaning exists until humans create it. Christianity says just the opposite -- \\"meaning comes before [human] existence\\" -- God has imposed a meaning on human life in advance of human existence. Therein lies the friction. Frankl, like all existentialists, comes down on the side of the notion that humans create \\"the good\\" by choosing. A better, Christian alternative is the idea that the real choice for humans is not whether \\"to create 'the good' by choosing\\" but rather to \\"to enter into 'the good' God has already chosen.\\"Present-day preoccupation with the \\"search for meaning\\" is a rather recent development. Gerhard Sauter[10] thinks it comes from the loss of a common story that religion, tradition, law, and community once provided. In times past, people did not have to \\"give meaning\\" to their lives because their shared understanding of past, present, and eternity had already done so in advance. Many people today, however, have no \\"story\\" but the one they create for themselves -- thus the prevalence of Frankl's existential vacuum. The answer to that vacuum is to discard the credo of individualism and return to the biblical story shared within a biblical community.-- Bill Brewer[...]NOTES:[1] See the publisher's note beneath the preface.[2] Readers should consider Richard Winters' book,Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment, for a Christian psychiatrist's view of the symptoms, causes, and cures of existential emptiness.[3] Use of entertainment to alleviate boredom avoids the hard task of making sense of life. Use of drugs to dull existential frustration in the depressed does the same thing. Logotherapy would work on the problem by creating tension in the life of the bored and the depressed, not resolve it. Frankl's illustration in this regard of fortifying an arch by putting more weight on it is a good one.[4] Frankl's belief that the libido runs wild in the presence of an existential vacuum matches everyday observation.[5] Frankl says the search for meaning is primary -- it is not simply a rationalization for Freudian hydraulic forces operating within the subconscious.[6] Copernicus argued that humans were not at the center of the universe. 2. Darwin argued that humans were not different from the animals. 3. Freud argued that humans are not even in control of their own minds.[7] Suffering is especially good at exposing an existential vacuum that might otherwise remain hidden.[8] Of course there are moral boundaries, but they are not necessarily narrow.[9] Frankl is superb in noting, \\"'I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my 'defense mechanisms,' nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my 'reaction formations.' Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!'\\"[10] Gerhard Sauter,The Question of Meaning: A Theological and Philosophical Orientation, trans. and ed. by Geoffrey W.

Caveat: you better be interested in psychology and not merely a historical narration of Auschwitz. There's a lot of pscyhology in this book...and to me that made it great. I didn't give it 5 stars because it didn't floor me. Unfortunately, it'd been built up way too much by the person who recommended it to me. However, if you come in with no real expectations, i think you'll love it (so long as you're interested in both historical events and related pscyhological aspects)."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I have read this book many, many times. These are the words I live by. If I was told that I could only own one book for the rest of my life, this would be it. Viktor Frankl's harrowing testimony of surviving in a concentration camp seems incomprehensible. Even more unbelievable is the attitude he adopts during his struggle as he remains apart from his family, starving, cold, and forced to perform hard labor with no relief in sight. Through it all, he decides that even though his body is being held captive, he is still free to control his mind and his attitude.When he is ultimately liberated from the concentration camp, rather than be bitter and remorseful, he uses his tragic experiences as a basis for logotherapy, a counseling theory that helps people to find meaning in their adversity. He also influences a generation of existential psychotherapists including another favorite writer of mine, Irvin Yalom. This is an incredible book that significantly altered my life and way of thinking. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of main idea of the book, an idea that is quite enlightening when you read it from Frankl's perspective, is that that you can have everything stripped from you: your family, your clothes, your food, your freedom, your rights, everything, but there is one thing that no one can ever take from you, and that's how you choose to respond to those situations. When we realize there is a higher purpose for living, and we want to live, we will find ways to make it through. No matter the circumstances.Very powerful stuff!This book is about Frankl's experience through his time in a concentration camp during World War II and how he managed to survive when hundreds of thousands did not. Frankl lived through the very core of camp life. It was horrific and he was staring death in the eyes every day. To live through this dreadful experience is amazing in itself, but Frankl came out with more than just horror stories. He came out of it with the knowledge that there was a reason for his existence, for mankind's existence, and he passed on that knowledge to millions.The first half of this book tells us about POW camp life; the other half of the book is about what Frankl learned. The concepts are universal, and you've probably heard them before, but Frankl puts them in a way that is new and so enlightening you can't help but live your life in a whole new way.Frankl's book is a must read for anyone who is feeling low with overwhelming thoughts that things are bad and getting worse. The power to \\"choose one's own way\\" can help one transcend the appearance of ugliness and chaos that surrounds us and create for ourselves an inner peace that is ours to keep.

Frankl's take on his experience separates because he did not entirely focus on the complete horror and gore he experienced. He illustrated how bad it was, but the main objective of his illustration was to convey his message to us that:No matter what your circumstance, you have the freedom to chose to either become a product of your environment or remain who you are; a person of character and compassion.It was interesting to see how those in the camp who had no purpose (in their own mind) gave up the drive to live and gave into their circumstances; even if that meant 'to die', or to 'BECOME the oppressor'.If you find purpose in life, no matter how extreme your circumstance is and no matter how much a being may attempt to imprison and/or oppress you, NO BODY can take away your freedom to live. In your mind, if you have a purpose, you may decide to either give your oppressor the keys to your freedom, or you may decide to keep your keys.No one can take away your happiness. ...Unless you allow them.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a bit of inspiration in their lives :-)"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"What could a man like this teach us about the search formeaning??

It is not surprising that there are more than 12M copies in print and that it's been named one of the ten most influential books.In the first 100 pages, Frankl recounts the time he spent in the camps from 1942-1945. Anyone who has read other accounts of the camps or seen movies of them knows the depravities there. But Frankl's account is somewhat unique in that he approaches the experience as a psychiatrist, in a very clinical fashion, only using emotion here and there to spice his writing. His writing is perceptive, showing a keen empathy for not only those who were heroic in such places, but also those who were not. This goes for both the prisoners as well as the German guards. He explains the psychology of lowered expectations, how a simple de-lousing, for example, could be the source of so much happiness for the prisoners. And given the title, it's not surprising he spends much time talking about meaning. The whole premise of his book is that humans are driven by their search for meaning. And in these pages, he demonstrates how meaning in a prisoner's life, whether it be a family to get back home to or work still left to be done, literally was the difference between life and death in many cases.This leads to the second part of the book, called Logotherapy in a Nutshell. Logotherapy is a therapy Frankl pioneered after his experiences in the camps. In it, a patient is \`actually confronted with and reoriented toward the meaning of his life'. He talks of the existential vacuum, in which so many people now languish due to the complexity of having so many choices and a lack of traditions to fall back on. Logotherapy simplifies this for us. According to it, meaning can come from three places: creating work or doing deeds, experiencing something or encountering someone (love), 3) or by our attitude to unavoidable suffering.To me, this puts logotherapy in the realm of religion, especially eastern religion. It's about human transcendence. Frankl says here that we derive meaning by helping others (through deeds or work), putting another above ourselves (loving someone), or by seeing unavoidable suffering as something of meaning in its own right. These ideas seem Buddhist to me, and in this case I applaud the convergence of science and spirituality in a space that needs it.I found this book inspirational. The experiences of the concentration camps by themselves are enough to put matters in harsh perspective for anyone living in freedom. But Frankl's expanding of this information into a book that can help so many others is a fine example of his own theories. We are lucky to have such a work available to us."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is a must read for all those \\"woe is me\\" people always complaining about everything.

Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is.

I will always remember Dr. Frankl and his story when I am sad or suffering.

Frankl's book is split into two sections, the 1st half is him telling about his experiences as a POW, but it is not only horror stories, he also tells you how he and other prisoners were feeling. The 2nd half is more about his philosophies on the meaning of life. Frankl's Nazi Concentration Camp stories are very interesting, they were sad, but I enjoyed reading them. It also gave what the rest of the book was about great meaning. It made you definitely realize what suffering was about. For me, I listened more to what he had to say because he told you his stories. Had I only read the 2nd half of the book, I really would not have understood so much exactly what he meant by suffering. However the 2nd half of the book was harder to follow. This is the only complaint I had about the book. Some things he said did not have much meaning to me- in one ear and out the other, perhaps if I were a psychologist I would have understood more! When he told stories, gave examples or it meant something in my life, then it had meaning. Also, if I could relate it back to the 1st half of the book it meant something. The main points that I got out of the book were:People survive the worse conditions by knowing their life has meaningIf people give up, they dieThe book makes you understand reasons for suffering and helps you overcome itSuffering has value if it lets us see the meaning in our livesI really enjoyed reading Dr. Frankl's book and I would recommend it to others.

The first part is a mesmerizing and horrifying account of Victor Frankl's suffering and agony while imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. His analysis of why some died and why some survived the camps is encapsulated by Nietzshe's words, \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how\\". In other words, people who had religious faith, or someone to love, or something beyond just themselves to live for, were much more likely to survive.This forms the springboard for the second half of the book, \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\", which is the theory of psychiatry that he developed as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps. In it, he argues that \\"man's search for meaning is the primary motivation of his life\\", and that people exist in an existential vacuum unless they can find meaning through \\"creating a work or deed... by experiencing or encountering someone... by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering\\". In other words, a person finds meaning in life by \\"giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love\\".The book describes the Hell created by a brutal twentieth century religion, National Socialism. It also discusses Man's need for the transcendent in his life. There is an inherent contradiction in the book, because the Nazis were inspired to create a transcendent vision of life (at least in part by Nietzsche), which gave them a \\"why\\" to live. This also affected \\"how\\" they lived, engaging in activities such as building concentration camps, invading Poland, etc etc. These were evil deeds: clearly the \\"why\\" and the \\"how\\" both matter.

This is an inspiring book full of valuable lessons."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Great books are often great testimonies. This is one. Frankl's message is not so much about man's inhumanity to man as about how everyday life in the Nazi death camp was reflected in the minds of the prisoners. Beyond that, what can his experiences mean to us today? A great deal, writes Frankl: \\"Do not think that these considerations are unworldly and too far removed from real life. It is true that ... of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is sufficient proof that man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate. Such men are not only in concentration camps.\\" What has this to do with Abraham Maslow's concept of self-actualization? And, what are the metavalues Dr. Frankl referred to? Why, of course, Truth, Beauty and Goodness: \\"... by experiencing something--such as goodness, truth, and beauty--by experiencing nature and culture or, last but not least, by experiencing another human being in his uniqueness--by loving him ... by love [we are] enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, to see that which is potential in him; which is not yet actualized but which ought to be actualized ... By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, [we help make] these potentialities come true.\\" Too bad these contemporary geniuses and champions of the invincible human spirit, Frankl and Malow never met. Readers who are taken by Viktor Frankl's remarkable testimony in Man's Search for Meaning may want to examine his first book, the precious manuscript the Nazi's confiscated and he recreated shortly after WWII ended. Originally titled \\"The Unconscious God,\\" it has been republished as \\"Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning.\\" Written for his peers, and not laypersons, it is a challenge to read. But it is also a spiritual gem of equal value to Man's Search for Meaning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Professor Gordon W. Allport writes in the preface to Dr. Victor Frankl's book, \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" that, \\"A psychiatrist who personally has faced such extremity is a psychiatrist worth listening to\\". I could not agree more.With a gentle yet critical eye, Dr. Frankl documents in great detail the physical, emotional and psychological conditions endured by the prisoners of Nazi concentration camps during the insanity of the second World War, based on first-hand experience. Although of Jewish background, Dr. Frankl presents a perspective more secular than religious, with values that all humanity can identify with and learn from, yet he never disregards the possibilities inherent in something \\"higher\\" than human understanding.The book is divided into two parts. The first - \\"Experiences in a Concentration Camp\\" - is Frankl's autobiographical narrative, while the second part - \\"Logotherapy in a Nutshell\\" - contains a brief summary of the system of psychotherapy that Frankl developed throughout his life. The style of writing does not appreciably change between the sections, and the language is relatively simple and pleasant to read, which I always take as a sign of a talented author.The experiences that Frankl describes make for fascinating and shocking reading. The level of deprivation and brutality the prisoners were subjected to does not seem comprehensible at times, and yet Frankl's humble and matter-of-fact style insists upon the reader's serious attention. As well as the anecdotes of concentration camp life, Frankl outlines various psychological states and phases experienced by prisoners - both those who did and did not survive. Interestingly, he also classifies people into two distinct types based on the conditions - the \\"race\\" of the \\"decent man\\" and the \\"indecent man\\", and these \\"races\\" were seen in all groups - Jew, Nazi, guard or prisoner. Frankl's observations along these lines seem especially interesting when viewed in the context of Ponerology.Although Frankl's work carries a warning of the suffering and misery that human beings can allow to be perpetrated on a mass scale, his writing always turns to the optimistic, hopeful and meaningful, and what can be learned through suffering. Indeed, his system of psychotherapy - logotherapy - is based on hope and finding meaning. The second part of the book contains more information on this.I strongly recommend this book to anyone with the even the slightest interest in psychology or history. Well written, insightful and touching, its success to date shows clearly that Dr Frankl has overcome immense suffering and touched something of the human soul in his life and work. He stands as an inspiration to all who aspire to express the creative aspects of Existence."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very simply, a book everyone should read.There's no point saying more than that, because Frankl says it himself.Go, read, reflect, be enriched."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for Meaning is considered among the most influential works of psychiatric literature since Freud.It begins with a moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. The second part of the book describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps and the resulting belief that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The profound lessons for me from this book are key messages in my workshops and in my book and audio book,Managing Thought: How Do Your Thoughts Rule Your World?-- that what we think is a matter of choice, that no one else and nothing else is responsible or to blame for what we choose to think; and that thoughts of purpose and possibility are powerful thoughts that bring us peace and inspire us and connect us with our highest awareness."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"The 4:8 Principle: The Secret to a Joy-Filled LifeThis is an excellent book that continues to impact and influence a new generation of readers. Frankl's account of his time in Nazi death camps where he experienced the death of his pregnant wife, parents, and brother as well as other horrors placed Frankl in a position of real authority to share wise counsel in this area. His experiences and observations, ultimately leading to an incredible understanding of human nature.Though he experienced unimaginable tragedy and adversity, he nontheless realized great truth. After reading and even re-reading his story, it is hard to imagine he authored these famous words, \\"The one thing you can't take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one's freedoms is to choose ones attitude in any given circumstance.\\"This message is a profound reminder to all of us who, in our more routine lives, may, from time to time, forget that regardless of what is going on around us, we can maintain control of what is going on within us.This is a \\"TOP TEN\\" classic and should become a part of your self-growth library.Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Man's Search for MeaningOne of the most important books I will ever read.

It took me awhile to finish it, sometimes because it gave me a lot to think about and other times because it didn't quite hold my interest. It inspired me in many ways because it focused on how you can have an optimistic attitude during really tough times and that this attitude can help you find good in every situation.

I also have been to the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam. This book speaks volumes as to what really happened. Never mind what you learned in school- the truth is more cold & maniacal. Read a first hand account of the holocaust like it really happened.This is what this book offers. The two things you will learn from this book: 1. History- what happened to a guy during the holocaust in everyday life + 2. Human nature- in the worst of situations people are true angels or people suck- Victor Frankl's story exemplifies this like no other story can."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Just hearing about his time in Concentration Camp was very inspiring and amazing. Even in those conditions, those who found meaning and future in their suffering were able to live. I like how he puts it, If you break your neck, don't let it break you.CASE FOR: I was very impressed with a lot of the information he provided, my favorite is on success. The whole book unfolds beautifully. He touches up fear, love, sexuality and clears up some of the distorted views, explaining why we miss certain targets in life.CASE AGAINST: his answer to man's meaning is no true meaning at all. He provided example of a man who thought he was going to be released on a certain date, and so he lived for that date. But when it didn't happen, he got sick and died. So he was saying how we need a meaning, a goal in life. He was pointing how we each have an earthly meaning to fulfill. But that example contradicts him and proves how foolish it is to put a meaning in earthly things, here today and gone tomorrow. And when they disappear, so does your meaning to life. Yes, man creates a meaning to life, but just like everything else man builds, it is temporary and deadly"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"First half of the book was good.

In fact, I really like the overview of the book at the book's beginning."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Very interesting book. I didn't know it was about a doctor's view of concentration camps. It was sad but I totally get his point of view on turning suffering into a purpose to survive.

I know this is a bold statement directed at someone who had suffered so much to bring us this enlightening read. However I cannot give one hundred percent support to confined experience, which trys to encompass complete meaning to life. I know this book will help many, but writers at this level need to be reminded of balance in their supportive evidense. Persons in modern day prison settings grope for meaning especially when their terms are lengthy, or crimes have abased their position.

The accounts of Frankl's experiences in the Nazi death camps in part one alone will make your trifles seem like a pleasant Sunday in the park. Frankl describes how he was able to keep his will to live alive at Auschwitz. It was by keeping his mind from disintegrating that he was able to survive the horrors of the Nazi death camps. In the end he is completely dehumanized but his psyche is intact. I have read adventure stories of men at war, men at sea, faced against unforgiving storms or mountain ranges, but no tail to me rings of such incredible human strength and perseverance. This is a story of incredible human will power.Since this man was a Doctor of Psychiatry before the war it doesn't surprise anybody that he came out of his experience with a new school of Psychiatry. The second part of the book which outlines his Logos theory didn't interest me much although his differences with Freudian psychology I found valid based on my readings of some of Freud's books. A layman's knowledge of psychiatry ought to get you through this.Whatever the case, if you ever think that you are having a tough time, this book is instant therapy. It should be required reading in this country."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"What is the meaning of life? Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\\"In the end, there is that need for a reason.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"I first heard of this book years ago through a strong recommendation by Stephen Covey in the 7 Habits, but didn't think about it until earlier this year when I was at Half Price. I was at the bookstore to buy another Covey book, \\"The 8th Habit\\", and then I spotted Dr. Frankl's book.Nothing against most self-help/productivity books (I know I've read more than my share) but after a while they can seem kind of stupid. There's a point where some random dude telling you how you should live your life becomes a highly ineffective approach to growth.Which is why Man's Search for Meaning appealed to me. Not only does the author back up his thoughts on suffering and meaning through extensive research, Dr. Frankl applied his ideas to help survive his three-years in the Holocaust, and so has a huge personal connection to the ideas he's presenting.What he's talking about, as many others have agreed, is pretty straightforward: by creating meaning in life, you have the capacity to move beyond any hardship in life. But Dr. Frankl provides a way to really help internalize this idea, which is why I highly, highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Frankl believed that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose - that neurosis is caused by \\"frustration in the will to meaning\\". Frankl's belief in meaning was formulated in the horror of a Nazi concentration camp. His essential optimism comes through in the following: \\"It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future...and this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task...the [Auschwitz] prisoner who had lost faith in...his future was doomed. With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and become subject to mental and physical decay...he simply gave up...lying in his own excreta, and nothing bothered him any more\\".My own book \\"The Optimistic Jew: a Positive Vision for the Jewish People in the 21st Century\\" (www.theoptimisticjew.com) is an attempt to encourage the collective mind of the Jewish people to once again believe in its own future (and stop wallowing in its past) lest we end up lying in our own historical excreta with nothing bothering us anymore."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Viktor Frankl's journey and his amazing survival techniques in the Auschwitz death camps prove to be one of the most meaningful books ever written.

Victor Frankel survived the concentration camps of the Holocaust during World War II. If anybody knows about suffering it would be Frankel. This is an about Christianity or Judaism... it's about believing that there is value in suffering and that nobody can take away your ability to decide how you will think about things in your life. Only you control your own thoughts. This is of course not for children."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This marvelous work does for the psychologically wounded what Peter Drucker's \\"The Effective Executive\\" does for the time-impaired. That is give people a feel for what tools to use to construct their own framework for achieving happiness (not someone else's concept of what another person's happiness ought to be).Both \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" and \\"The Effective Executive\\" should be taken up and re-read at least once a year (pardon me for offering so specific a prescription). Both works are short enough so they can be read quickly. But don't go too fast. Consider Speaker Newt Gingrich's advice when he recommended people go through \\"The Effective Executive\\" stopping at salient points (there are plenty of those) and making notes about how something relates specifically to one's life and incorporate that into one's operating system.Dr. Viktor E. Frankl's logotherapy (or \\"meaning\\" therapy) springs from his experience in World War II concentration camps. His writing is refreshingly free from veiled (and sometimes not-so-veiled) invective of Holocaust literature. The terms \\"Jew\\" and \\"German\\" are scarely to be found. The Jewish identification is raised only when unavoidable to give a complete picture such as when Dr. Frankl's words give an Eastern European rabbi a new lease on mental health. Frank's statement about mankind's only two groups -- the decent and the indecent -- is telling.Among other Frankl profundities ---- Suffering is unavoidable.-- Man in metaphysical tension is normal and worthwhile.Perhaps his most important statement is that life is meaningful yet the meaning is different for each person and it changes more often than one might think. Keys to following this bouncing ball include taking responsibility and developing a sense of humor, according to our author.Freedom is not an end in itself, Frankl correctly notes, although others (especially libertarian thinkers in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises) have suggested that it needs to be treated as such societally to that the road to happiness be as wide as possible for individuals. Recognition that life is meaningful is essential to a successful navigation of this road, no matter how wide.Frankl: \\"Freedom is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness.\\"Frankl and many libertarians/classical liberals would agree that freedom and responsibility call for a delicate balance in the human mind. But who am I to say? Read Frankl, Allport and Fabry alongside Mises, Hayek and Rothbard and judge for yourself.Something you can't miss about Frankl -- he refuses to be a dictator. He was persecuted through the caprice of at least one hideous dictator yet denied the enemy victory by not taking on the enemy's characteristics. This represents a high level of moral reasoning. Although Frankl isn't an explicitly religious author he has earned the title of \\"Rabbi Frankl\\" through such choosing.The opposite of the spirit that animates Frankl and other greats (arrived at through attainment of true knowledge coupled with respect for all mankind) was wonderfully encapsulated by Stephen Crane is his story \\"Above All Things.\\" Of this all-too-common unholy spirit of the imperialist, the dictator, the socialist \\"reformer,\\" Crane wrote:\\"...The stranger finds the occupations (read: lifestyles) of foreign peoples to be trivial and inconsequent. The average mind utterly fails to comprehend the new point of view...'How futile are the lives of these people.'...This is the arrogance of the man who has not yet solved himself and discovered his own actual futility.\\""},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"This is the first book I read that can offer ordinary people with extraordinary power to overcome unimaginable difficulties. If one is equipped with such power, he becomes invincible. Such power is not money, ranks, social status, and etc. Instead, it is \\"man's deepest desire to search for meaning and purpose\\". That desire will not only shape how one will lead his life, but also make all troubles around him less upsetting compared to the meaning of life. Most of all, he is happy no matter what happens."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"One of the great books of the 20th Century. Frankel as a philospher and psychologist is to be admired for his legacy to mankind. A must read for any serious thinker."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Inspiring story about the triumph of the human spirit over the worst kind of suffering. The first half tells the author's story of surviving the most deadly concentration camps in World War 2. The second half discusses Logotherapy, which is the brainchild of Dr. Frankl and later became known as the third school of psychology. The memoir of the first half is engrossing and hard to put down. The second half is a slower read and very academic as it gives an overview of logotherapy, but it is nonetheless interesting."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"For all its complexities and mysteries, life boils down to one aspect that should ALWAYS allow a human being to keep his dignity if nothing else: We have the ability to react to any situation any way we want. That is, even in the awfulness of the Nazi extermination camps, a person can still keep his dignity if merely by being able to control how he reacts to a situation.Also, Frankl continously refers back to a qoute by Nietzsche that says, \\" He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW.\\" In a concentration camp, Jews often found that the will to live no longer existed within them. They had lost all hope and it was their despair that often led to physical illnesses that led to their death. As a response, people like Frankl tried to reinforce to their friends that they did in fact have something to live for. That \\"something\\" could be their family back home, their kids, their other loved ones, their careers that they may be able to once again resume after the war, etc. Now, one may question how this relates to his main idea of people reserving the right to react to any situation however they choose to. Well, Frankl argues that once a human has hope, that is the WHY to live for, then he can bear just about any HOW. That is, no matter how long the SS made the Jews stand out in the bitter cold, often with no shoes, and no matter how often they whipped them and kicked them and punched them, it was always the victim's right to react to those situations as he wanted to. Whether it was by giving up and perishing or by replying with even more fervent prayer and hope that they will once again be reunited with their loved ones; therefore, survival, Frankl argues, is up to the individual.The first section of the book is divided into three periods of a \\"prisoner's\\" life; the period of shock, the period of being a prisoner, and the period after liberation. Frankl provides specific examples for each period and then ties them back into his main idea. The second part of the book explains Frankl's notion of Logotherapy. I found this second section to be not as important as the first section, because I'm not really interested in psychology.If I had been asked to only rate the first part of the book, I would have rated it 5 stars; however, the second part of the book isn't as interesting. I would recommend that you read this book either before or shortly after reading \\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\" by Imre Kertesz. You will find differing philosophies on what happens to the human mind during such tragic and degrading conditions as were the Nazi extermination camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"\\"Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.\\"What is the meaning of life? Frankl try's to answer that through his experience as a prisoner in a concentration camp in Auschwitz (among others) and in his psychiatry practice after the war. Be it by grace, a miracle, or chance, he made it out alive. And now he is here to tell this powerful, optimistic story and help us with an age old question.He try's to answer this question: \\" How was everyday life in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?\\" This would later influence psychotherapy. Even being surrounded by so much evil there was still kindness to be found in an occasional guard. The prisoners were not always kind to there fellow inmates: there were sellouts and CAPO's; Capo's were Jews that watched over their fellow captives for favors, food, and extended life. Who is to say what any one of us would do. With misery and suffering beyond comprehension, \\"having a why to live for enabled them to bear the how\\". I will never look at that last leftover pea the same way.Writing on his concentration camp experience Frankl briefly discusses \\"logotherepy\\". In a later chapter he goes into detail: Logotherepy (which he coined), the \\"striving to find a meaning in ones life is the primary motivational force in man\\". In his practice he uses a form of reverse psychology. The last chapter is on optimism during tragedy.Freedom is only part of the story, he writes: \\"I recommend that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast\\"There are many quotables from Frankl, I will leave you with this: \\"Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.\\"In the end, there is that need for a reason.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"Amazing book, gives the reader many things to comtemplate.

This book is based on the author's own life experiences, so it makes you have a more empathetic view of the story he is telling. This is an actual account of his time in the camps. His story moved me through a variety of emotions: anger, sadness. It really brought to light some of the horrible things that were done in the camps."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"In the first section of this book, the author describes in great prose his and others' experiences as prisoners during the Holocaust and the horror of it all. Then in the second section, he relates the logotherapy theory (or the therapy by looking for meaning.)The connection between the two sections clearly is that the fellow prisoners of the author's who did not have a meaning/objective in their lives to live for or who gave up on any meaning were the ones who gave up on the will to live (and actually let themselves die without being taken to the gas chambers.) Those who had a meaning to their life or something to strive for were those who tried their best to survive those horrible conditions.Another way to look at it is: if those people found the will to live in such horrific circumstances (some of them didn't as mentioned above), then one must conclude that life in and of itself must have a meaning and is worth fighting for.I highly recommend this book for any serious reader."},{"Title":"Man's Search for Meaning","review":"We are all yearning to find meaning in our life in order to pursue our human vocation.

He explains how these experiences helped him to build upon his psychological theory which he termed Logotherapy.

This allows it to answer questions that other accounts not often have an opportunity of answering. To me it's still difficult to read without being overwhelmed by emotion, but the calm tone and clear analysis of the author constantly refocused my attention to the lessons that can be learned from experiences like these. For readers with a special interest in the subject, it's certainly a book that adds a lot to everything that has been written about the holocaust throughout the years, because of this particular analytical point of view.

Suspense builds from page one as Alexis is forced to interface with people she dares not trust. Someone is out to destroy her, someone who will go to any lengths, and she has no idea who it could be. Her only hope is to find a way to stop the madness before it begins. But, in a world where no one can be trusted, how can she do that?For gripping suspense and top-notch science fiction, this book cannot be beat."},{"Title":"Eternity's Handmaiden","review":"The concepts of this novel are thought-provoking, causing the reader to question the morality of man's advancements, and humanity's very existence. A gifted artist, Ubtrent paints a picture of words. His descriptions of untouched landscapes are without flaw.

Twisting our conception of cyclical time, it ends where the story begins."},{"Title":"Eternity's Handmaiden","review":"Set in a future that is not that far away, in either concept or time, this adventure/mystery takes you on a ride whose ending is just one of the many plot twists you'll experience.

It can be mild or severe. For Seth Taylor (the principal and mentor to Cassie Smith in Shay's book &quot;Cop of the Year&quot;), it's a combination of things. Being a principal is not easy, and Bayview High School students suffer from the same garden-variety social ills that most suburban schools do. He's haunted by the mistakes he made with two students. One of them he didn't crack down on hard enough, and the other he maybe have been too hard on. It doesn't help that the latter student was the son of the local newspaper editor/publisher, who has looked under every stone and twig for reasons to discredit Seth's standing in the community and get him fired. Up until now, though, Seth has hung in there and implemented some innovative programs that are just now yielding good results for students. But the newspaper won't give him a break.When Lacey Cartwright--the publisher's granddaughter--puts her own dynamic career on hold to come help her grandfather run the paper--she is challenged by Seth and her old friend Cassie to look at the &quot;rest of the story,&quot; to quote Paul Harvey. What she discovers about the school and the man who keeps it running could change her life forever.Like &quot;Cop of the Year,&quot; this is more than just another romance. It's a reminder that teachers and newspaper reporters touch lives in ways that they may never know about, and they do make a difference. This one also has inspired me to look for more ways to connect with the university students I teach, and to pass on good things I hear about my colleagues to them, so they can keep fighting the good fight another day, week, or year.Seth is the best kind of sexy man there is--responsible, a good father, and one who cares about the people around him. The testimonial dinner--like the farewell party in &quot;Cop of the Year&quot;--had me in tears. I had to keep reminding myself, &quot;this is fiction.&quot; Kathryn Shay is one heck of a writer!This is a good one to read in December, when the semester is winding down at school and you're burned out with classes and just want to get to the celebrating and relaxing. Enjoy it. . ."},{"Title":"Because It's Christmas: Love That Man (Harlequin Superromance, 815)","review":"First, let me say this is a sequel to COP OF THE YEAR. Anyway, I loved this story. I never thought a 46-year-old high school principal could make a sexy hero. I was very wrong! That is what makes this story irresistible. It is modern and about everyday people. At the same time, it is so wonderfully different from what I'm used to reading in romance. This is the fifth book I've read by Kathryn Shay. I've loved them all. I highly recommend COP OF THE YEAR and her 'America's Bravest' trilogy: FEEL THE HEAT, THE MAN WHO LOVED CHRISTMAS, and CODE OF HONOR. Along with Judith McNaught, Patricia Gaffney, Laura Kinsale, and Susan E. Phillips, Kathryn Shay is my favorite author."},{"Title":"Because It's Christmas: Love That Man (Harlequin Superromance, 815)","review":"Bayview Heights is a small town just outside New York City. Like many small towns today, the townsfolk struggle with teen problems. However, led by the efforts of the high school principal, Seth Taylor, the educators have taken an active role to divert youthful energy into productive endeavors. This has not stopped the local newspaper from a non-stop critical barrage on Seth and his school due to increases teen violence.The current editor of the Bayview Herald is Lacey Cartwright, who took over from her beloved grandfather when the senior citizen suffered a devastating heart attack. Both Cartwrights have a personal vendetta towards Seth, who they blame for the incarceration of Lacey's younger brother Kevin. After the latest assault on his school, Seth challenges Lacey to come to the high school to observe the full picture. She agrees and is amazed with what she sees. She agrees to partnering with Seth to oversee a student task force. As the duo falls in love with one another and Lacey realizes how biased her editorials have been, her grandfather increases the pressure on her to destroy Seth, which, if accomplished, will kill her in the processBECAUSE IT'S CHRISTMAS is a super, modern day retelling of the classic \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". The lead protagonists are a charming duo and the support characters add the depth to the two opposing camps. Kathryn Shay's tale is a beautiful Christmas story due to the burned-out Seth, who believes he has had no positive impact on his community until his former students stand up and are counted. Readers who peruse this novel will understand that it is in deed a wonderful life when one reads novels like this one.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"FROM GANGLAND TO PROMISED LAND","review":"This is a fantastic book, one of the best I've read in ages.

This book, written for ten to twelve year olds, describes the adventure of Apollo 11 from the launch, through the docking, moon landing, and return to earth from the point of view of Buzz Aldrin's oldest child Jan Aldrin who along with NASA chief historian Roger Launius, helped write this book.Unlike a lot of books on the moon landings that cover in great detail the training, flight experience, marriages, etc of the astronauts, this book refreshingly opens with Buzz Aldrin and his daughter standing on top of the launch tower viewing the rocket (Saturn V) that will take him, Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins to the moon. The book then proceeds to the liftoff, docking with the Lunar Module, voyage to the Moon, lunar landing, the voyage home, and splashdown. Throughout the book, there are numerous sidebars, which describe in more detail, various aspects of the mission. For example, there are small sections, on \\"Becoming an Astronaut,\\" \\"Space Food,\\" \\"The Saturn V\\" and many others as well. In addition to the text, there are many high quality photographs that bring to life the first moon landing.While this book is geared to ten to twelve year olds, I feel that many adults will also find this book enjoyable as well, because of its well written text and great photographs."},{"Title":"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman (Special Edition)","review":"This book gives a very vivid account of how things really were in the old West.

S. Eliot","review":"700 pages of commonplace minutiae is probably tons more than anyone wants to know about Vivienne Eliot but, even allowing for such proffered particulars as V.E.'s 1934 cockroach problems, the story told by Carole Seymour-Jones is fascininating...and repulsive. If they are ever to pick up The Collected Works again without a shudder, devotees of T. S. Eliot will have to study a juggling denial/avoidance, while those who regard him as little more than a purveyor of era-bogged, clever-dick party pieces, will receive broad permission from this volume to dismissively despise him as an appalling, conniving, cheating, embezzling, slug-under-a-rock. (Of the \\"Uncollected\\" works , the less said the better.)Difficult as it may be to generate sympathy for a person who set up household shrines to Oswald Mosley, Jones leaves us little doubt that Vivienne Eliot was certainly as talented as many another Bloomsburian, disgracefully dealt with--abused--by Eliot and her own family, but simplemindedly, to her captive last, holding out for the theory that Tom was not to blame.With so much material to deal with, it is not surprising Jones occasionally seems to lose track of precisely what went before (early on she lays it out that TSE at least enabled V's affair with Bertrand Russell, certainly profited by it, possibly connived at it; hundreds of pages later Jones speaks of how hurt Eliot was by her infidelity). Jones' oracular certainty of who-felt-what, who-thought-what, who-did-what-why and her psychological pontificating become irksome to anyone not willing to concede her omniscience.But for a microscopic view of a time-dated literary milieu and its peculiar, self-aggrandizing denizens, and a disturbing look at what intellectual creeps can get up to, this book will reward even the non-trivialists among us."},{"Title":"Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot, First Wife of T. S. Eliot","review":"This book, with much more detail than I wanted to know, opens up the \\"secret\\" life of Eliot as no other writer has done. Vivienne is no sympathetic character here, but she clearly did not deserve the way she was treated by Tom and his buddies. While he needed to keep his homosexuality in the closet for good reasons, it was a criminal offense, he could have managed to contain his hatred of women physically by leaving her soon after the marriage. It does not appear that he used the marriage as camouflage, but he certainly behaved as if he did. I suppose one can defend the oversupply of detail as needed because her subject is still \\"controversial,\\" why I do not know. The book can also be recommended as a depressing picture of the treatment of mentally ill people at that time. And her portrayal of the social set to which they belonged reminds me of nothing so much as the twitter society of today's teenagers, all gossip and drama queen behavior, floating at a level of pampered imbecility."},{"Title":"Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot, First Wife of T. S. Eliot","review":"Carole Seymour-Jones has created a ponderous tome without a great deal of innuendo. She has allowed the reader, if willing to slog through the mire, an opportunity to come to their own conclusions about the marriage of Vivienne and Thomas Stearns Eliot. Ample use of largely unedited letters, diaries and detailed sources allow a slowly emerging picture of a completely dysfunctional marriage built on lies and misrepresentations on all sides. Ms. Seymour-Jones clearly has a bias towards Vivienne Eliot, yet I would be naive to believe that Vivienne was an entirely hapless victim in the dreadfully destructive relationship. There is little doubt of T.S. Eliot's homosexual leanings in the excerpted letters to Ezra Pound, and the infidelities that occurred on both sides are obvious. Perhaps the most disturbing picture that emerges was the absolute power of Vivienne's devotion to a man that clearly was not dedicated to her in any way. This inequitable situation eventually led to a schism in her personality that led to frank mental illness. Her plight was also compounded by medical problems that ravaged her from youth, and were untreatable in her lifetime. Her condition was treated with bromide, a poisonous neurotoxin that was a widely used medicine at the time. The constellation of characters (or villains) that made up the British literary intelligentsia, including the Bloomsbury Group is highlighted as well, including Bertrand Russell, Lady Violet Ottoline, Virginia Woolf, Ezra Pound, and Ford Maddox Ford. Let's just say that after you have read this book, the \\"Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" will never sound as sweet."},{"Title":"Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot, First Wife of T. S. Eliot","review":"I read the book in 2002 while living temporarily in London. I disagree with critics who pan this biography, and say instead that it is a refreshing thing that this woman, long in the grave ( I blame TS Eliot in part), has finally been given a chance to be shown as a real woman, as something other than a footnote of Eliot's fame. What struck a chord with me was, in part, the unveiling of a tricky malfeasance by TS Eliot and Vivienne's brother. If she went insane, it was the two of these men who drove her into the asylum!The woman was brilliant in her own right as a writer, reviewer, as well as editor and advisor (along with Pound) to TS as he composed the rantings that would become The Wasteland. In fact, I have a hunch that part of the writing is hers, not TS. As a woman who once suffered from early peri-menopause, I can say that Vivienne was likely such a sufferer. In her day, we did not help these women because we chose to lump all such \\"female complaints\\" as crazy, hypochondriac ravings, or as manipulative. I think the book shows the pitiable state she was in at the end of her life, and I take her behaviour to be at worst sad and at best brave. Seymour-Jones wrote a masterful biography. Those who moan on and on about its being ponderous or whining are simply WRONG. A biography does not need to be simply scholarly.

Savior and indeed, founder of modern navies, crafter and imposer of the rules that require proper Log Books to be kept and duly surrendered to the \`properly constituted authorities' at trip's end, the fair quality of victuals and fair treatment of all ranks, and the recognition of merit of both \`tarpaulin' and upper-ranks. To his credit, to this day, is awarded the founding of polite command and perhaps of little less merit to some us, the creation of the Civil Service and its language of obtuse evasion!Arthur Bryant makes reference in his forward to this brilliantly crafted work to the \`yet to be written' account of Pepys quite retirement years when he built up the stupendous library that bears his name, and prestige, in Magdalene College.Alas, it seems the biographer's own retirement and death left that edition to his collected works on Pepys unwritten, and we see only a glimpse of the diarists closing years, Pepys gratefully enjoyed with Hewer, his prodigy, in enforced exile from his life-long role as \\"Savior of the Navy\\"."},{"Title":"The Art of \\"Judge Dredd\\"","review":"Although i did not like the film very much, this beautifully illustrated book caught my eye immediately.

They loved the food.That gave me the confidence to have a dinner party, something I'd never dared to do before. It was just a few friends, but it was a big step for me.Everyone loved the food, and I suddenly got a reputation as a great cook.Much to my surprise, my next dinner party was standing room only. I brought out folding tables and chairs to try to accomodate everybody, but people still had to eat in shifts. Nobody seemed to care. People enjoyed themselves, and everybody said they loved the food.I had one smashing dinner party after another. My social life had never been so good.

Romancing the Stove is awesome"},{"Title":"Romancing the Stove","review":"How can you possibly entice a head of cabbage and a few potatoes to tango with your taste buds, strengthen your liver and clean your blood in less than 40 minutes? When billions of dollars are spent annually on drugs to treat anything from hypertension, heart disease and obesity, Samahria Ramsen has discovered the ancient art and science of preparing your favorite vegetables with a backdrop of carefully selected spices that will end up making you feel more energetic and creative and ready to face your day with power. Some spices are stimulants, digestive aids, some open the flow of energy while others strengthen the nervous system and heart. Did you know that coriander actually helps the body absorb the minerals and vitamins from the vegetables you are eating? Most of us who grew up on salt and pepper diets will be thrilled to get to know ginger (helps relieve head-aches and colds), cumin (helps to balance the solar plexus chakra) and mustard seeds (destroys accumulation of toxins) in a variety of main dishes, snacks, teas and even shakes. Besides the exotic flavors, the ease of preparation, the inexpensive ingredients, my real attraction to \\"Romancing the Stove\\" was the Exotica de Bengal cabbage recipe (page 50), which catapulted this sauerkraut loving German into new heights of eating."},{"Title":"Romancing the Stove","review":"Believe it or not, today I have already recommended this book to 3 people - that was before writing this review.

And then after getting to know the people, the reader is captivated by the trial and the events which surrounded Mr. Gillette's life immideatly after the verdict. All in all, a great read. I escpecially loved it as a Cortland County resident."},{"Title":"Murder in the Adirondacks : An American Tragedy Revisited","review":"Craig Brandon's \\"Murder in the Adirondacks\\" is the first complete nonfiction account of the Chester Gillette - Grace Brown tragedy of 1906. The case was front page news throughout the country and provided the inspiration for Theodore Dreiser's classic novel \\"An American Tragedy.\\" Dreiser's tribute, however, was a double-edged sword. It revived public interest in the case, but the creative license that was necessary to tell a good story (and protect the author from a libel suit) altered the facts and, over time, came to be accepted as truth.In researching his book, Brandon, a former reporter and editor from upstate New York, went straight to the original sources, such as trial transcripts and newspaper coverage of the murder trial. He located previously unpublished information about Chester Gillette's early years as well as letters and photographs from private collections. The end result is a definitive account of Grace Brown's death at Big Moose Lake in the Adirondacks and Chester Gillette's conviction for her murder.Brandon outlines the known facts of the case: Chester Gillette met Grace Brown, a farmer's daughter, at the Cortland, New York, skirt factory where both of them worked. When she became pregnant in the aftermath of a clandestine relationship, he refused to damage his growing social standing by marrying her. After she threatened to expose him, they traveled together to the Adirondacks. Grace thought she was going to be married, Gillette had other plans. On July 11, 1906, she ended up at the bottom of Big Moose Lake, and Chester Gillette was accused of murdering her. Public feeling against the accused was high, especially after Grace Brown's beseeching letters to him were read in the courtroom, and he was sentenced to die in the electric chair at Auburn. Despite fervent attempts by his devoted mother to have his sentence commuted, Gillette was executed in March 1908.Those who had read \\"An American Tragedy\\" have assumed that Chester killed Grace because he intended to marry a wealthy young socialite. Craig Brandon argues that Gillette had no plans to marry anyone- he simply didn't want to be forcibly connected to a woman who was his social inferior. The author also raises the uncomfortable question as to whether or not the youthful philanderer was really guilty of murder: Grace Brown had expressed suicidal thoughts to friends and in her letters, and Chester told the jury that she had jumped out of their boat after he declined to marry her. The district attorney pointed out that a gash had been found on the victim's head, suggesting that she had been struck and thrown overboard, but the defense team offered the plausible explanation that a grappling hook could have caused the injury when the lake was being searched for her body.Although \\"Murder in the Adirondacks\\" doesn't offer any final answer as to what really happened that July afternoon on Big Moose Lake, it dispells long-held assumptions about the case and its principal players. It's also the first book to quote from the official record and not from sources spawned by Dreiser's fictional account. It will be the cornerstone for all future study of the case."},{"Title":"Murder in the Adirondacks : An American Tragedy Revisited","review":"I read a lot of true crime books and this one is well done.

MA is more of an historical novel than a tale of true crime. Author Brandon has a background as a newspaperman, so MA is written in the who-what-where-why-when-and how style of a hard and straight news feature. Its' strength lies in Brandon's very thorough research and the poignant photos which give full context to the story. As true crime, MA is fairly tame stuff, raising little emotion. Brandon also delves into Theodore Dreiser's \\"companion\\" novel, \\"An American Tragedy\\", and the Hollywood movie \\"A Place in the Sun\\", starring Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters. All the bases are certainly covered. This reviewer believes that the 4 star rating above is a tad generous, but author Brandon deserves his due for the sheer research effort he put forth. Folks from the Southern Tier/Central New York areas of Cortland-Utica-Herkimer should pounce.

Mark Thurston's guidebook teaches how to use synchronicity to access our inner wisdom and answer our questions. I didn't have three weeks to practice the eight-step program, so I tried the method in a shorter period of time. By the time I had finished the book, I had learned about synchronicity, focused on my spiritual goal, formed a question, practiced the exercises and had a meaningful response from the I Ching &quot;with parallel wisdom from the Edgar Cayce readings.&quot; If that offends you, don't buy it. If you are open to Cayce, the exercises are powerful. For example, how do you identify your spiritual ideal? Thurston had me recalling peak experiences and remembering feelings from when synchronicity had worked in the past. The energy from this and the other exercises helped me receive and trust my insights from the I Ching/Cayce messages. I will keep this book and refer to it often."},{"Title":"Synchronicity as Spiritual Guidance: All of Life's Working Together to Leave Your Little Hints","review":"A light introduction to synchronicity that pays more attention to the prophecies and teachings of Edgar Cayce than the theories of Carl Jung, this book is far from an absolute text on the subject. The author even refers to occurences as being &quot;synchronous&quot;, instead of the proper &quot;synchronistic&quot;. It also contains a poor translation of the I Ching. I didn't find this one very helpful, and would recommend instead &quot;The Power of Flow&quot;, a book that has much more of a grasp on the essence of synchronicity than this one."},{"Title":"The Dragon Masters ; The Last Castle","review":"About thirty years ago, I saw this paperback in the throw-away box in front a bookstore on 57th street in Chicago, and picked it up on a whim. A few days later, I opened it up...and didn't close it again until I had absorbed both stories, as well as neglected a meal or two and a few important errands. In half a century of reading sf, these - and Sturgeon's Microcosmic God, remain my favorite sf \\"stories\\". Jack Vance is a gifted storyteller...a true artist, with your imagination as his canvas. These are parables of pride, greed, ambition, small-mindedness and hypocrisy, and their consequences in two possible future worlds. Not aimed at hard sf junkies, perhaps, but sufficiently plausible to keep one aboard. With stories as well-crafted and entertaining as these, the ride is good enough for one to forget his critical faculties, and just enjoy!I loaned my copy of this book to a friend many years ago, and have no idea why it took me so long to think of looking for another on Amazon. Eagerly awaiting the arrival of a small package in a few days...."},{"Title":"The Dragon Masters ; The Last Castle","review":"\\"The Dragon Masters\\" was the first novel by Jack Vance I ever read more than 3 decadea ago, and it remains one of my all time favorite works of fiction to this day.Vance's style and themes have been remarkably consistent over the years. His special gift (and the real reason to read him) was an amazing ability to construct and describe exotic cultures and civilizations in dizzying detail; colors, textures, cuisines, music, religious doctrines and sexual practices, nothing is left out or skimped over, but such is Vance's talent that he only needs a few deft verbal strokes to accomplish these miraclous vistas. Detractors might artue that all this detail sometimes came at the expense of the plot or character development, but in my mind, the cultures depicted in his books are practically supporting characters in themselves.And rarely has a writer, even a fantasy oriented writer, effortless demonstrated such a command of archaic and obscure language. Maybe J.R.R, Tolkien and Stephen R. Donaldson could keep up, but not too many others. But this exotica is never forced or labored. it just flows endlessly, like a stream of melody from the Brandenburg Concertos.Anyway, \\"Dragon Masters\\" and \\"The Last Castle\\" are typical Vance. Laconic and dour heroes; mordant wit and arch dialog; bitter struggles for power between human civilizations and their would be successors; lengthy descriptions of the mores and philosphies of both human and post human societies; eldritch powers and advanced technologies casually yet thoroughly described in simple yet convincing ways; brutal violence and heroic and derring do all delineated in understated, unemphatic terms. And unresolved endings that leave room for hope but also will hardly satisfy the casual fan of space opera endings. Most of all, the reader gets the experience of really, really alien and unusual worlds and a future almost completely unlike the typical hard science scenarios or even the usual dragon/fantasy/magical worlds, that more conventional minds might create.I can't guarantee that you will enjoy these two short novels as much as I have; but I can guarantee that you won't find a more unique talent in science fiction or fantasy."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of Imported Cars 1946-2002 (Standard Catalog of Imported Cars)","review":"This book looks superficially like the Standard Catalog books dealing with American cars, but the data is incomplete and the editing is grossly inferior. Just a few of the problems I noticed flipping through a few sections:They lump model years together into big chunks, when there were substantial differences in models within those years.Information is incomplete or wrong. Example: I looked here to find an answer to the question, &quot;When did Toyota first build a Celica convertible?&quot; The text refers to one in 1987, but I know for a fact that Toyota built one in 1985! No mention at all.They have pictures of cars that are never discussed in the text or production statistics. Example: Under Volkswagen, they have several pictures of the Thing, but it is never listed or discussed anywhere in the data or text. (And, they have a seemingly infinite number of pictures of the Beetle, which barely changed over several decades, but there are a number of models of which there are no pictures at all.)These are just a couple things I remember off the top of my head, writing this review without the book in front of me. I have found lots of other similar omissions and mistakes. I'm sure some of the information is accurate, but how to tell?And this may be a pet peeve, but the Standard Catalog of American Cars didn't include the Nash Metropolitan, apparently because it was actually built by Austin in England. But the catalog of import cars doesn't include it either, apparently because it was sold by Nash.After the excellent catalogs of American cars, I had high hopes for this book, and I was sorely disappointed. Hopefully a new edition will fix its shortcomings."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of Imported Cars 1946-2002 (Standard Catalog of Imported Cars)","review":"The first edition, edited by James M.

The author should have provided instructions specifically for a convenience store.Research statistics that the reader could use for starting one of the myriad of possible types of convenience food store that is hinted at, but not described in even a cursory attempt.No guidelines are evident for categories of merchandise with typical markups (or margins) experienced by convenience stores. Further, as a rough guide, what portion of the typical store should be devoted to each category?What about slotting fees. Yes, for C-stores these do exist, particularly from tobacco vendors.No data is given by category to demonstrate what is the typical cost of doing business, as a percentage of sales?The only chart provided is on Page A-5 of the appendices. This was simply a reprint from a Small Business Administration pamphlet to advise researchers regarding the needed population base for specific types of consumer-oriented businesses. It would have helped to include an explanation, but the patient reader is able to decipher something of value, so I give one star to the book author.Page A-7 is a checklist of items readers should check. Checklists should result from discussions in the narrative, not be stand alone lists. Each item on the list should include the page number the user can refer to for a detailed discussion.Finally, near the end of the book (just before Appendix D) there is 16 pages of typographical errors and very ambiguous data that I could probably get myself while having a coffee at the local Circle K or 7-11.Too often this book tells the reader to do their research by consulting others and reading other books. People by a book about starting a convenience food store so they can get at least some of that research accomplished.If readers want to dream about owning a C-store, buy the book. If they want to learn how to manage a C-store, go to work for Circle K or 7-11 for a year."},{"Title":"Instant Gratification: Ornaments: Fast and Fabulous Projects (Instant Gratification)","review":"I bought this book last year when it was published so there were no customer reviews thenm, and i wish there were.I bought the book based on the title, i expected easy and fast projects which give creative and lovely results.

It was commissioned by Rome in order to quell rumors of foul play in the 33-day-Pope's death raised by David Yallop's best seller \`In God's Name'. In exchange for Cornwell's promise to conclude the Pope died of a 'heart attack', the Vatican permitted him to interview some of those who had been in the papal palace the night the Pope died. The most important of these witnesses to Cornwell's conclusion the Pope died of'pulmonary embolism' was John MaGee who, by coincidence, at about the same time (1987) was made a bishop. One can only surmise this was a tit-for-tat deal. (seatch Google: Bishop John MaGee).A more recent book has the advantage of time - things we know today that we didn't know when these things happened. Lucien Gregoire'sMurder in the Vatican: The CIA and the Bolshevik Pontiffemploys what is known by the medical community today which was not known when Cornwell wrote his book. Any member of the medical profession today will tell you it is impossible to determine the cause of an unwitnessed death unless the cause of death is obvious. The cause of such a death can only determined by autopsy - something the Vatican refused to perform.To conclude the Pope's condition of 'low blood pressure' contributed to the Pope's \`heart attack' or, for that matter, 'pulmnonary embolism' may have been a sound conclusion twenty years ago, but not today. As late as 1987, when Cornwell wrote his book, it was believed that low blood pressure could be a factor in 'heart attack' or 'pulmonary embolism.' But, today, we not only know that low blood pressure is not a factor in 'heart attack' or 'pulmonary embolism' Conversely, it materially reduces the risk of heart attack or pulmonary embolism. (Search Google: heart attack low blood pressure). John Paul's physical exam taken three months before his death showed a blood pressure reading of 112/66 - outstanding today for a man of sixty-five, but at the time considered low as \`normal' blood pressure in 1987 for a man of 65 was 100 plus one's age - coinsidered dangeously high today.\\"Yet, Cornwell's book is a fundamental part of any investigation of this man's mysterious death as he interviews the most important witnesses to the events of the time except, of course, Yallop's star witness Sr. Vincenza - who by divine coincidence had died in the meantime.All witnesses agree on one point, \\"he was sitting up in his bed reading papers held upright in his hands.\\" That he did not pull the bell cord that hung a whisker to his right which or press a service button an arm's length to his left which would have brought the guard stationed outside his door and did not drop his papers points to murder.Nevertheless, \`A Thief in the Night' is a well written book - a good read - a good example of how the Vatican works. I believe Cornwell to be a man of impeccable integrity when he wrote it twenty years ago. Yet, at the time the medical community did not know what it knows today. I think if he were to rewrite it today - if he does I will be first in line - he will come up wih a different conclusion.Murder in the Vatican: The CIA and the Bolshevik Pontiff"},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"A \\"Thief in the Night\\" was commissioned by the Vatican (1987) to quell the rumors stirred up by David Yallop's masterpiece \\"In God's Name\\" (1983). The author was allowed by John Paul II to interview several people who were in the Papal Palace the night his predecessor died. The primary witnessinterviewed is John MaGee - at the time of the Pope's death he was John Paul's secretary.That John MaGee was elevated to the rank of bishop a month after he gave his interview with John Corwell is telling evidence that a payoff or at the very least a conflict of interest was invloved in his testimony. The author concludes everything that the Vatican wants him to conclude concerning the death of John Paul, including the absolute conviction that the Pope died of a heart attack. Since no autopsy was performed it is impossible to conclude what he died of as his death was unwitnessed - only one of two Popes in the two thousand years of Popes whose death was unwitnessed.If you want a more riveting tale of the times \\"In God's Name' is a much better choice. If you want all of the facts and circumstances surounding the mysterious death of this Pope then \\"Murder in the Vatican\\" by Lucien Gregoire is the only choice - the latter is also the only existing complete biography of this good man written by a man who knew this Pope."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"When Pope John Paul I died suddenly after only 33 days into his Papacy, conspiracy theories and rumors of murder erupted because of inconsistencies in the Vatican's statements. Officially, the Pope died of a heart attack, but there were conflicting stories as to who found the body, what time the body was found, what time the Pope died, which spawned further questions outside the Vatican about things like why there was no autopsy, why the embalming began so soon, etc. And as time went on, the murder-conspiracy theories got really out of hand.John Cornwell, who also wrote Hitler's Pope, investigates these allegations as an independent journalist, ten years after the fact. He interviews all the major Vatican players, gains access to the current Pope, and learns very little new information. Except that there is all sorts of confusion about aspects of that night which seems to be inherent to the way the Vatican is run, not specifically to why this pope died. Cornwell ultimately comes up with his own theory of what happened that night.Each chapter is pretty much a transcript of one of Cornwell's interviews. It goes something like this: I arrived here, had to get through red tape, finally got permission to talk to so and so, and this is what they said to me: transcript. I found it pretty uninspiring.If there is any interest to be found here at all, it's the glimpse you get into the Vatican. One of the advantages of having so much of the book be in other people's words, is the immediate access the reader has into the personalities that make up the Vatican. There is so much gossip going on it and so much back-stabbing, at times it feels like a soap opera. As far as Cornwell's investigation goes, it's pretty wimpy. Yeah, he talks to a bunch of people, and he does find out some interesting tidbits that clear up a few minor points up, but all in all, there was very little here to warrant a book. He should have written a magazine article and been done with it."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"Cornwell admirably and intensely approaches the task some ten years after the event, of sorting out the rumors and innuendos surrounding the sudden death of the 33-day pope, John Paul 1.All of his extensive look into this quagmire called the Vatican can be summarized by his words: \\"The whisperings, the rumors, the theories--farfetched, sensational, fantastic--all serve a purpose: they deflect attention from the most obvious and shameful fact of all; that John Paul I died scorned and neglected by the institution that existed to sustain him.\\" (pg. 336)This well capsulizes what his peering into the event surfaced. Amazing inner look at this huge, off-limits to most of us, major religious institution.His analysis his thorough, he wants evidence that is credible. He sifts out things well, and strings them together to make sense, or breaks up strings which won't hold together.The stuff with the Vatican Bank and its director is shameful, and Cornwell discloses this with dignity, yet allows real inner struggles to be seen.Worth the read. His hypothesis of what occurred from his investigation is fascinating, and has all the signs and tastes of close to the truth."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"As I wish to leave no stone unturned, I read the book. Supposedly it was commissioned by the Vatican to \\"clear up\\" all the misinformation concerning the death of Pope John Paul I. Not only did it come ten years too late, but interviews that Mr. Cornwall conducts are all based on hearsay.He is a good writer and novelist as he describes the characters we are introduced to: Marcinkus has warts, another priest has decaying food particles on his clothes, another yellow teeth, the Pope peers up at him through scrutinizing eyes. The chapters are, thankfully, short and his \\"investigation\\" is light reading and light lifting.Compared with Yallop's multi-layered almost incomprehensible depth, this is a walk in the park.While applauding his effort, I am not convinced."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"This, Cornwell's first book on the Vatican, has been given a comparative amount of praise compared to his other misinformed screeds, including the atrocious \\"Hitler's Pope.\\" But in fact \\"A Thief in the Night\\" is just as bad as the others. Even many Catholic reviewers took it at face value, especially since the subject (what happened in the Vatican the night John Paul I died) had never been covered by someone relying on tape-recorded interviews with eyewitnesses. David Yallop's previous sensational best-seller on the subject \\"In God's Name,' had been almost completely undocumented. But does reliance on eyewitnesses testimony mean what Cornwell reports is genuine?In short, no. In fact, Cornwell's record is no better in this book than it would be in \\"Hitler's Pope.\\" Cornwell's lies begin with the way his book was researched and written. He says that he just happened to be visiting the Vatican researching another subject in October 1987 when Archbishop Foley practically begged him to drop what he was doing and write about the death of Pope John Paul I. Not only is this entirely contrary to the Vatican's usual methods, Archbishop Foley and the Vatican have repeatedly denied that they commissioned the book. And though he does do something to counteract the absurd conspiracy theory about John Paul I's death put forward by David Yallop, Cornwell did the Vatican and the Church no favors with his work.Many of those interviewed for the book, including Marjorie Weeke, Sister Irma Dametto, and the Pope's niece, Lina Petri, as well as Cornwell's two main witnesses, Don Diego Lorenzi and Bishop John Magee, John Paul I's secretaries in the Vatican, have denounced Cornwell for his MANY errors and misinterpretations of fact.To begin with, Cornwell did poor research: he tells us that Albino Luciani was a good and holy but intellectually incompetent bishop, ill-equipped to deal with the problems of the modern world and completely unsuited to be Pope. He managed to do this in a simple 3-5 pages of summary scattered throughout his book. He has one or two quotes, which he completely twists around, but he could have completed the \\"research\\" he did in about 5 minutes flat and still had time left for a cup of coffee. He evidently never read any of Luciani's abundant writings as a bishop and cardinal, never read any of the around two dozen biographies of him published in Italian and almost completely ignored the public record of his deeds as Pope, not to mention his speeches and audience talks, all of which had already been translated into English at the time he was writing. All of these would have given him a very different picture of Luciani's qualifications to be Pope. The many different subjects he addressed from Marxism and liberation theology to birth control, test-tube babies, the problems of moral theologians, the relationship between faith and culture and the responsibilities of artists and the way he addressed them are abundant proof of how qualified he was to address the problems of the modern world.As for the one in-depth interview he did with someone who knew Luciani her whole life, his niece Lina Petri, he ignores her portrait of her uncle as a man of great moral strength and integrity when he himself comes to judge his character. His only other source is a bunch of gossipy Vatican monsignori who made fun of John Paul I, but who clearly never met him in their lives, while those who did work closely with him in the Vatican, Cardinals Casaroli and Caprio were not interviewed, though they told an entirely different story.I myself have documented Cornwell's distortion of his written sources by mistranslation, very similar to his technique in \\"Hitler's Pope.\\" And there is very good evidence that he distorted and altered his interviews as well.Two very important items: In his attempt to show that John Paul I was almost suicidal, Cornwell records Don Diego as saying that the Pope had said \\"thousands of times\\" during his papacy, \\"Sometimes I ask the Good Lord to come along and take me away.\\" I myself have met and interviewed Don Diego, and have exchanged a number of letters with him. In 1990, after Cornwell's book came out, he wrote in answer to my question as to whether this statement was true: \\"Only on one occasion (it was at the end of the evening meal) I heard the Patriarch saying: \\"Every now and then I ask the Lord to take me with him.\\" In other words, he never heard him say this as Pope. And something he said before becoming Pope should certainly not be quoted as evidence of his state of mind while Pope.As further proof of John Paul I's desire to die, Cornwell cites a published statement by Sister Vincenza describing a conversation with the Pope. The original text is an article in the periodical Humilitas, the original Italian text of which I have. Cornwell completely mistranslated it to make it say things that aren't in the original. He has the Pope telling the nun: \\"Look, Sister, I should not be sitting here in this seat. The Foreign Pope is coming to take my place. I have begged Our Lord.\\" The original reads in a correct translation: \\"You see, it isn't I who should be sitting in this chair, but a foreign Pope! I had asked (avevo pregato) the Lord for it.\\" That is, he had asked this of God before and during the conclave, at which he had actually voted for a \\"foreign\\" cardinal, Aloisio Lorscheider of Brazil. The emphasis on \\"begged\\" is also added to the original. It was not a request to die.Cornwell speculates feverishly about the torn sleeves on the cassock the secretaries dressed the Pope's body in; he thinks it must mean that his body was moved after death. But all this speculation was also based on a mistranslation - his niece Lina had only said his sleeves were wrinkled!Put this all together and you have here one very unreliable investigative report. I attribute the intrusion of so much fantasy into this so-called nonfiction book to the fact that the author is also a novelist. At any rate, it is a complete injustice to Pope John Paul I and to those inside and outside of the Vatican who got suckered into being interviewed for it.The best book on John Paul I so far in English isThe Smiling Pope: The Life And Teaching Of John Paul I"},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"Cornwell, ten years after the death of Pope John Paul I, looks into what many have termed a \\"cover-up\\" of the true facts.He is very thorough in his efforts, taking all of the \\"murder/conspiracy\\" theories, and basically knocking them all out of contention. What he does is investigate each lead and scrap of information he receives the best he can, and is able to debunk the \\"murder/conspiracy\\" theories by providing explanations, ruling out many of the wild and conflicting theories that have been expounded over the years. This Pope was the victim of poor health, and neglect; a man not suited for the calling, who knew it, wished he headn't been chosen, and one that suffered from ill health (and prayed to die) which was not communicated to the proper people at the Vatican who could have monitored him more closely.In the end, Cornwell shows us a tragic figure, ill when chosen, overwhelmed by the responsibilities of his position, who in all probability died from the stress of it. Alas, we will never know the truth, but Cornwell makes a very strong case, and is convincing."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"Being a Cathoic and paying particular attention to the short papacy of John Paul I, I was skeptical that there was more to be said. However Cornwell goes into great investigative depth, separating the theory from fact - and explaining each in extraordinarily interesting detail. His journalistic and religious backgrounds serve him well, but above all he's an excellent writer who knows how to make the details interesting.This book will give you tremendous insight into centuries old traditions blended with modern politics. It will strip away the &quot;intrique&quot; of John Paul's death and short papacy. Above all, it will be a very interesting and enjoyable read - highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"Cornwell does a superb job of cutting through the highly-charged murder theories to get to the bottom of this tragedy. This is a balanced, truthful view of the sometimes ridiculous paranoia that runs rampant in the Vatican. This is perhaps one of the best books on showing the inner workings of the Vatican, as well as being a definitive book on the short papacy of John Paul I. If you are a progressive Catholic, or one who is comfortable with the human foibles of the clergy, you'll really enjoy this book. Some Catholic reviewers have screamed &quot;blashphemy&quot; in the past, but truly there is nothing in this book that is sacriligeous."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"Considering the subject matter, this book could have been a very difficult read. However, because of the format that is was written in, the book kept the readers attention the whole way through - well written and compelling.Mr. Cornwell's hypothesis of what really happened on the night of Pope John Paul I's death is highly plausible and is more than likely what did happen on that faithful night.Through both confusion and escalation of commitment, it is easy to see how being economical with the truth, by the Vatican hierarchy, that conspiracy theories have developedIt is pleasing to see too that while the \\"Vatican\\" sets standards for mankind as a whole (which there is nothing wrong with,) as an organisation it appears as flawed as any other man-made organisation.All-in-all, a great read !!!"},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"This a true story investigating the death of Pope John Paul 1 who died, amidst a maze of contradictory reports about time and circumstances of death a mere 33 days after becoming pope.This is one of the most compelling mysteries I have ever read. I simply couldn't put it down. Along the way you receive a glimpse into the, to me, mysterious and unknown world of papal politics and diplomacy. How fortunate, that someone who can write so clearly and invitingly obtained access to the papal archives.For anyone with an interest in history, mystery, or the papacy, I cannot recommend this more strongly."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"This is an enjoyable read on several levels. Cornwell really gives the reader a great inside look at the Vatican and the politics involved. The amount of backstabbing and shady dealing that goes on behind the scenes is incredible. The cast of characters is very interesting and Cornwell does not spare individuals when they deserve to be criticized (and this turns out to be just about everybody!). John Paul I was a good human being who was used, abused, and ignored by members of the Vatican heirarchy. It is in many respects a very sad story since we are left with the impression that a humble and sensitive man such as JP I cannot make it as pope with the current environment at the Vatican."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"An investigation by John Cornwell, an editor of the 'London Observer', into the mysterious circumstance surrounding the death of Pope John Paul I just thirty-three days after he assumed the papacy. The author answers ten specific questions about which there was disagreement with the Vatican, such as exactly when and where the pope died, and whether a secret autopsy was performed. It is written in step-by-step narrative format on the writers' investigation and his interviews appear to be the transcripts themselves. His investigation tends to lead to the conclusion that the Vatican Hierarchy was responsible for the popes' death through neglect of his medical well being. This book was written at the request of the Vatican and is a recommended read."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican (Apr 1, 2001) originally released asA Thief in the Night: The Mysterious Death of Pope John Paul Iby John Cornwell (May 25, 1989, see my review for that too) is a stunning, surprisingly gossipy book that seems to be nothing more than a direct slap in the face of David Yallop, and a debunking of his bookIn God's Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I(see my review).Cornwell - who got talked into this book by Archbishop John Foley, and goes at it with glee - was welcomed into the Vatican with open arms. I was especially moved by his audience with John Paul II, who brought \\"his large, bloodless, Slavic ear\\" close to Cornwall expecting some kind of shenanigans. Cornwell told the pope he was merely there to receive a blessing before undertaking the writing of this book.And write he does. Cornwell is out for the 'truth', he says, and he appears to get it. From the anonymous, hag-like old queens who populate the Vatican (which \\"floats on a ... sea of ... brilliant bitchery\\", one monsignor tells Cornwell) to the poor Swiss Guard Sergeant Hans Roggan (who was deeply betrayed by Yallop) - everyone's talking here.It shocks me that Cornwell didn't manage to find a personal tell-all letter from Pope John Paul I himself. When I read this book, I was certainly relieved to learn that Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, former head of the Vatican bank, had no guilty role in John Paul I's death. On the other hand I know this archbishop was not a man with clean hands, either. Cornwell finds him charming and forthcoming.The feeling one gets from this compelling book, fun as it is to read, is that it is Cornwell's touch&eacute; contra Yallop. He's on a mission from God, all right: to expose Yallop and Yallop's treachery, which Cornwell finds is a treachery that runs very deeply indeed.The whole question here is whether Yallop is as treacherous as the book seems to paint him. Get this - and I strongly recommend you get and read Yallop first, because Yallop, whatever one might think of him, is a damned good writer.This takes a tack opposite Yallop's page-turning thriller style, a kind of I'll-lay-back-and-appeal-to-the-nice-priests attitude. Where Yallop seemed to have invented whole plots and interviews, Cornwell seems to magically enchant everyone into talking to him. Of course, they'll talk ... as long as they can paint John Paul I in a light less than flattering as well. Why is that?There are passages I find suspicious and just plain fictitious in here. One example is Cornwell's insertion of a mysterious lunch he had with an obviously gay English monsignor, who dished the dirt as expertly as he dished his lunch into his mouth. The whole thing sounds made-up, ready-for-the-publisher-to-swallow-whole. I'll bet it is. After all, who's to check on Cornwell? Especially after all these years. Cornwell claims he is a former seminarian, at one point actually calling himself a former \\"cleric\\", and is certainly capable of inventing a convincing English monsignor.Oh, Cornwell does eventually sputter out the allegedly true - the 'hidden but official' - story of Pope John Paul I's death and its circumstances. What is most important is that you should read both this book and Yallop's book in order to get some vaguely weird idea of what this pope was really like. Yallop in his excellent minibio painted him as a rock-willed, tender-hearted saint; Cornwall tries to make him look like an incompetent Peter Sellers-type figure, a clown tripping over his cassock, with robes that are too big, a crooked skullcap and a nervous rather than saintly smile.It is all of the above that makes me wonder whether or not Cornwell really did his homework here. It seems as though he did - but there are nagging, disingenuous-sounding passages. Lots of the conversation reads like badly made-up melodrama. Cornwell really stumbles when he has Americans talking in British English ....It's a good read for all that - and what do I know, perhaps Cornwell tells the whole truth after all."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"The month-long papacy of Albino Luciani (John Paul I) was one of raised expectations for a pastoral papacy less obsessed with preserving theological purity and more interested in extending Christian love toward the world. It was Papa Luciani who shocked the hard core in the Vatican (and delighted the rest of us) by congratulating the parents of the first test tube baby. It was \\"The Smiling Pope\\" who said that there was \\"more of Mama in Almighty God than Papa,\\" catching attention of even me, who had fallen away from the Church at that time.Papa Luciani's death after 33 days was a profound shock. It's no surprise that rumors arose quickly that the pope had been murdered. Cornwell was asked to investigate the rumors, and \\"A Thief in the Night\\" is the result. What Cornwell uncovers is not a murder, but a Vatican culture of clerical bitchiness, lackadaisy, professional malfeasance and deferral to papal prerogative. Cromwell reports that Luciani was not respected at the Vatican. His precarious health (he had a history of life-threatening blood clots) was not monitored by the Vatican medical staff. He admitted to being overwhelmed by the job and he prayed for death often. Yet these signs of distress were ignored or misunderstood by the clerics surrounding him.The book is the best narrative of the pope's death I have read. Cornwell interviewed members of the Vatican news media, the undertakers who embalmed the body, the head of the Vatican bank (who was implicated in a scandal that some thought connected with the pope's death), family members, medical experts, and \\"Monsignore Sotto Voce,\\" Cornwell's inside-the-Vatican \\"Deep Throat.\\" What rings true are the contradictions in the various recollections of what occurred the night the pope died. Too many conspiracy books tie all loose ends together, leaving no room for lapses of memory and plain human stupidity. Cornwell avoids this trap except in one instance, in which he attempts to reconcile the somewhat conflicting stories of two of the pope's closest aides. Cornwell accounts for the discrepancies (spoiler ahead!) by having the two move the body in order that it be \\"found\\" in a more papal posture - reading sermons in bed. This conclusion would require that each aide be involved in a decade of lying about his own movements and those of the other conspirator. While it is not out of the question for clerics to desire to put the best face on a bad outcome (even to the point of hiding the truth), it is up to the reader to determine whether Cornwell made his case.Long story short? Papa Luciani was a victim of his frail health, his own sense of unworthiness and of his aides' excessive deference to the papal office. A little more hard-headed and gospel-based love might have saved his life and given us a few more years of smiles."},{"Title":"A Thief in the Night: Life and Death in the Vatican","review":"The vatican has been dominated by John Paul II for more the 20 years.

Mr. Corwell's investigative reporting method in writing this book clearly shows that John Paul I died of medical neglect. Did someone murder him? No! But the neglect he experienced from Vatican Insiders was enough to kill him. I am so grateful to Mr. Cornwall. His access to people in the Vatican and what they told him clearly shows what really happened. This is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Sisters Around the World: The Global Struggle for Female Equality","review":"December 2008 - I just read this book and it was eerie.

She has a delicate touch and paints vivid images of El Nino's glory and its fury, effortlessly explaining seemingly impenetrable science to make it relevant and, more importantly, interesting to the lay reader. Nash has a journalist's way of getting to the point, so there's nothing extraneous is this tightly written narrative. If you liked \\"Longitude\\", \\"Cod\\", or \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\", or you're simply a fan of the Weather Channel, \\"El Nino: Unlocking the Secrets of the Master Weather-Maker\\" is one you don't want to miss."},{"Title":"El Nio: Unlocking the Secrets of the Master Weather-Maker","review":"Warm wet winters, hot dry summers - calling cards of the weather pattern El Nino. How something so huge, impacting so many lives across the globe was not recognized truly until the past couple of decades is one of the points that Nash tries to make. After the first few chapters, looking at historical meteorological records and the understanding of El Nino, she continues on and places this weather maker in a larger historical, social and political context. How El Nino and La Nina patterns can affect disease spread, the life cycles of other animals and coral, and the growth and destruction of civilizations are topics for exploration. For El Nino truly defies the traditional way of thinking about climatology and pulls back the view to the global scale.Despite being so focused on a weather maker, the book is fairly jargon free. You don't need to know you isobars from your relative humidity. Some basic science knowledge makes it easier to follow many of her points, but you are not lost in geek speak. I did find that often she would talk about glacial formations using words that she never defines, which makes it harder to make a mental picture, but these problems are few and far between. I walked away with a better understanding of what is going on, and understand the how far we have to go in truly understanding this climate controller.

The main character was a little shallow, and not very likable."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I enjoyed the mystery, but I also enjoyed the static of the mother-daughter friction that was an interesting undercurrent of the story. Though Amanda may seem cold and in a sense, uncaring and rebellious toward the first half of the book, I was intrigued by the way Fielding gradually \\"warmed\\" up Amanda's personality by unveiling things from her past that explains where she's coming from and why she is the way she is, to a certain degree. As I got to know more about Amanda and her relationship with her mother, Amanda's behavior becomes more understandable to me and curiosity is aroused as to why certain things happened the way they did and why certain people behaved the way they did. The mother-daughter tangle adds well to the story. The conclusion is satisfying and twists an initially cold character into a warm-blooded human being with a wide array of feelings."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Here we go again.

Is it to save mom? No, she needs to escape an angry wife. You see, Amanda thinks nothing of sleeping with the husbands of neighbors or gym pick ups. If they're married, all the better.Be prepared for long passages of internal (poor little me) dialog. Amanda just isn't a character one can like; She runs rough-shod over others--treating them to her temper tantrums, sharp tongue, and paranoic suspicions. The privacy of others is irrelevant when she thinks they know something about her. In fact, it all centers around her. So much so that the \\"plot\\" disappears and one feels like a sudden transportee to a therapist's session.

Amanda debates back and forth whether or not to return to Toronto. It is apparent that she and her mother have had a falling out and that Amanda is in no rush to see her again. As fate would have it, Amanda does return to Toronto to attempt to straighten out this dastardly deed committed by her mother. Amanda tries to figure out why her mother would do such a horrible act.

She is an up and coming attorney living in Florida who is twice divorced, does not like losing cases, and thinks it is ok to sleep with married men.Out of the blue, her first ex husband Ben calls from Toronto to tell her that her estranged mother has been arrested for shooting a stranger in the Four Season Hotel and he would like her to come home to help. After much deliberation and some extra heat from past relationships knocking at her door, Amanda decided to take a quick trip home. Ben takes Amanda to see her mother the day after she arrives only to be told that her mom, Gwen does not want any kind of defense. She just wants to plead guilty and take her sentence. Being the attorney that she is, Amanda can't take that as an option so she starts digging around to find out the truth behind the shooting. What Amanda gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for when the truth about her past starts catching up to her and life will never be the same.Puppet was a very quick read with a lot of dialog so be forewarned if you do not like that format in a book. For those of you who have read many of Joy Fieldings past books you will not be surprised to know that she once again throughs in a zinger that you would not have originally guessed and thats all I am saying."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I have to admit that this book started out a little slow, but the minute the pace picked up, it never slowed down until the shocking, surprising ending. If you enjoy suspense, you'll love this well-plotted tale of a dysfunctional family full of hidden secrets!"},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"It's surprising how many readers commenting here seem to feel that the main character in a popular novel always must be a real role model or at least someone with minor or understandable flaws. The white-hat syndrome. Why is that? Here, Joy Fielding clearly presents a main character who is not very admirable or very happy, either. The character's fast mind and quick wit keeps us turning pages, but the author does not intend for the reader to look up to or admire the main character, as shown by her bitterness and unhappiness. (Probably she doesn't want her condemned outright, either--just accepted as a character.) It's too bad that so many people gave up on the book just because the main character is who she is. The plot explores how she became the cynical, self-destructive person she is, what experiences made her who she is. The author is not endorsing such behavior, or else the character would not be so dark and brooding. It is kind of silly to judge a novel like a person for its supposed morality or immorality, anyway, but if you are going to do that, the judgment should be based not on what the subject is (a woman whose life ignores traditional morality) but on what attitude the book takes toward that subject. The attitude here is analytical--to show how she became the way she is (and how, in a very cliched happy ending) she eventually gets beyond all of this behavior to a new beginning.Popular fiction can seem to cover such extremes (fantasy, history, horror, romance), but all of that, I guess, is really misleading because underneath whatever genre is being used, the range is really pretty constricting--all readers seem to want is a main character who is supergood, someone to look up to, no matter how unrealistic that may be or how unsuitable it is for the kind of conflict that makes for interesting fiction. Readers should consider widening their expectations from the novels they read. Books can provide a role model to look up to--and sometimes other types of people, too, people who can be better understood as we see their pasts. In the book An Experiment in Criticism, C.S. Lewis talked about people who \\"use\\" literature for \\"egoistic castle-building\\" rather than surrender themselves to the book they are reading open-mindedly. He makes a good point."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Although Joy Fielding had written several books, I have only read two titles before this. One was The First Time which I thought was OK. The second book was Whispers and lies which I loved. When I found Puppet at the library, I couldn't wait to read another psychological thriller because of how I felt about Whispers and Lies. Sadly while I enjoyed three-fourths of the book, by the end, I was left feeling rather disappointed.Amanda is a 28 year old lawyer living in Florida. With two failed marriages behind her Danielle now finally enjoys a wonderful career, great home and single lifestyle. But this may not last much longer after she receives a phone call from her ex husband, a practicing attorney from her home town in Toronto, Canada. Now Amanda's carefully ordered world is about to crumble when she learns that her mother, whom she has always had a strained relationship with, has just killed a total stranger in the lobby of a hotel. Initially Amanda tells her ex husband this isn't her problem and refuses to fly to Toronto. But then realizing her mother has no other family, Amanda decides to make the trip if even for only a few days. Once there Amanda must not only deal with her mother's refusal to discuss what happened but her mothers stubborness about pleading guilty without explaining her actions. What ensues for readers after this was a roller coaster of events which kept my eyes pealed to the page. But only up to a certain point.While I raced through the first 200 pages of the book I found there was one real problem I had with the book and that was I didn't find Amanda a totally sympathetic character although she should have been, especially by the end. And the zinger at the end, as I call this revelation proved to be way too creepy for me to really rate this book higher which I originally planned to do. Still when I thought about lowering my rating, I did rate this book higher than I might have because for most of the book I was sitting on the edge of my seat.I look forward to reading more books by Fielding. But I do hope that her next endings might not be as creepy and disappointing as this one was for me. My feelings reminded me of those readers who also felt cheated by the ending in Whispers and Lies although fro me I never saw that ending coming and therefore loved it. This ending I would never have predicted and when I read it, was really disappointed that Fielding would resort to this rather bizarre shocker."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This was my first novel by Ms. Fielding. Quite a disappointment, sorry to say. The protagonist inspires no empathy.

I lost count, too, of how many times she \\"whispered into her coat collar\\" or spoke out loud \\"without realizing it.\\"I can't recommend this book as there are so many well-written thrillers/courtroom dramas/mysteries to choose from. Pet peeve: the references to anti-depressants as \\"psychosis inducing\\" and a \\"nightmare world\\" really irked me.

After some soul-searching, she knows she must face the demons of her childhood and her ex-husband, who she left abruptly ten years ago and for whom she still has strong feelings. Amanda arrives in Toronto and confronts her mother about the man she killed. Her mother just wants to plead guilty and be done with it. Amanda cannot let it go without answers to who the man was and his connection to her mother.PUPPET was an intricately plotted novel. It was suspenseful and hard to put down.

As far away from Toronto and her mother as possible. She gets a call from Ben Travis, her first ex-husband that turns her life upside-down.

However she does fly to Toronto to find out what happened. Her mother, much to her dismay is not the evil monster she remembers from her childhood. Many memories are created by us as adults, and lack the truth. Amanda is perplexed by her mother's determination to plead guilty. She battles her own past demons and stays at her childhood home. Amanda, the determined lawyer, pursues the case details further and finds out the unsettling truth. The action moves quickly in Puppet, you have to hang on for the ride."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I usually find Joy Fielding's writing to be exceptional. This book did not disappoint!

I preferred Missing Pieces over this AND Whispers and Lies."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This is the first Joy Fielding book I have \\"read\\" (it was an audio book, unabridged). Like many of the other reviewers, I found Amanda to be very unsympathetic. I found myself telling her not to be so stupid several times and to get over it. Some reviewers complained about other characters being two-dimensional. Since the whole book was written from Amanda's viewpoint, although not in a first person narrative, it would be difficult for other characters to be more than two-dimensional. Amanda is written as a very self-centered person. But, the ending...ugh. One reader called it creepy. I call it downright gross and disgusting. I cannot conceive how somebody could do that and do it for 22 years. At the very least, Fielding could have had Gwen make one more stunning announcement about John's relationship to Haley. I think the story would not have left such an unpleasant odor(?) at the end."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I listened to the audio CD version of this book. I find it very difficult to give up on a book once I start reading/listening to it, but this was a bit of a trial. I didn't like Amanda much, nor did I enjoy the snarly, hectoring tone of the reader on the CD--I kept having to turn her down because of the unpleasant tone all the way through the book. I know the character's tone is the reason for this, but it might have been easier to take with a reader with a lower voice. It put me on edge. Nor did the book make it easy to understand why Ben would ever want to mess with Amanda again. She was not a likeable character in the least, either when she was married to him or when she returns to Canada. She uses pretty much every man she meets, and it's doubtful that the big reunion at the end is going to change that aspect of her character. Too many of the mysteries were just ridiculous: Amanda's half-sister disappears from the face of the Earth, and none of the neighbors ever mentions her to Amanda? Her parents never, ever slip and mention the half-sister's name? Yada-yada-yada. Too many details are slipped in right at the end, so you never have the chance to mull them over to try to figure some of it out yourself. Definitely not a satisfying book."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Amanda Travis is another unappealing, unpleasant, unsympathetic character who can join the ranks of Fielding's other unappealing, unpleasant, unsympathetic protagonists.

Her first husband, Ben, a 1950s wannabe bad boy calls her to defend her mother. Seems Mandy's mother shot a man outside of a hotel and nobody can figure out why.

Mandy drags her feet at returning to her hometown of Toronto and she certainly wants nothing to do with her mama dearest. Naturally, Mandy and Ben relight one another's fires and admit that when they married, both were too young. Mandy's second marriage to Mr. Travis was the opposite extreme - she married a man much older than she who was genuinely a nice person.

She had a pathological aversion for nicknames of any kind and the word \\"puppet\\" sent her into orbit. Mandy had no compunction about picking up men and sleeping with them. She just used people and was a tiresome drone. It didn't matter to her if they were married or single. She picked someone up at a gym and later a seatmate on the plane. He went from seatmate to sackmate and Ben actually catches them together. One gets the impression that Mandy the Puppet staged that little scene for Benny-boy's benefit.No, Mandy the Puppet just isn't a character you can like. She puts one in mind of Elvis' 1956 cover of \\"Hound Dog,\\" where he says, \\"they said you was high class, but that was just a lie...\\" so true in Mandy Puppet's case. The supporting cast of characters are dull and tiresome. The \\"mysteries\\" as it turns out is simply a) why Mandy Puppet's mother killed that man; b) the man's identity and c) what connection did a woman with two pre-teen children staying at the hotel have with that man.By the time you get to the end, you just don't care. You kind of wish they'd all just hop off the puppet stage and run behind the curtain. Talk about a Punch & Judy show! A good song to sum up this book is James & Bobby Purify's 1966 hit, \\"I'm Your Puppet.\\" The ending, as duly noted by other reviewers was indeed unsatisfactory and yeah, even \\"creepy,\\" just like Mandy Puppet."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This book was one of many I've read by Joy Fielding. I've always enjoyed her work. However, this novel was easy to put down and dragged on forever with details of things I could've cared less about. The main character, Amanda, was not likeable at all. In real life, I wouldn't want to be around a woman like her. No morals, values, it's all about her. I agree with the other reviewers. The ending was a shocker, and I was surprised when I couldn't figure it out myself. Only after reading the book did I realize why I couldn't predict the ending. It was way too gross. I'm surprised the author went in this direction. If you want to read one of Joy Fielding's best novels, read GRAND AVENUE. You won't be disappointed with that one. I wouldn't recommend this novel...skip it and read something better."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Nothing about this book was appealing to me...not the style of writing, which was fractured at best and tedious at worst, certainly not the characters who got lost in their flaws and the jerky movement of sequences, and the ending was just plain disgusting, not to mention unbelievable. I know you have to suspend your disbelief for much fiction to be enjoyable, but my disbelief just won't stretch that far!"},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Well it speaks to the storyline and gripping writing style of this novel that has me finished in 8 days. Yes, it was a quick read. The fact that the story had me guessing and flipping pages trying to put the pieces together in this murder mystery, i'm delighted to have had a chance to read this book.I didn't like the main character's whinny, over the top personality. It prevented me from really sympathizing with her much. Sure she had a rough childhood and the truth that rocks not only those in the story, but the readers themselves was a lot for anyone to go through. It still had me telling her to grow up a lot.I have never read any of Joy's books so this was a positive introduction to her books. I look forward to the ones I plan to read in the future.If you're looking for a book to captivate your mind and keep you guessing to the very last pages, then this is the quick mystery for you!I'm rating this as high as possible, 5/5, because the writing was so intriguing and the twists and turns in this book rival those of my favourite books and writing styles. You can't do much better than that."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"In this novel, Amanda Travis is an emotionally-closed-off woman in her late 20s working as a criminal defense attorney in Florida. When Amanda gets an unexpected, urgent phone call from her ex-husband, she is shocked and dismayed to learn that her estranged mother has shot and killed a man in her hometown of Toronto. Her ex urges her to come home and assist in dealing with her mother, who appears to want to plead guilty and go directly to prison. Amanda wants nothing more than to hide in Florida and pretend she has no past. Her relationship with her mother is rocky, to say the least, and she left her ex under less-than-ideal circumstances too. But Amanda is drawn back to Toronto where she is forced to confront unresolved issues and demons from her past as well as investigate things she never knew about her mother. The necessity of investigating the charges against her mother force Amanda to open up emotionally and reevaluate her own life.Amanda is a complex, less than fully likeable character, but she is not entirely unsympathetic. In some ways, it is refreshing to have a less-than-perfect \\"heroine\\" who doesn't always handle things with perfect aplomb and total control. Putting aside the bizarre factual circumstances driving the plot, the novel is essentially about Amanda confronting her past and the journey to finding out who she really is and how she wants to live her life. It's about choices and mistakes and having the courage to attempt to correct things you regret. It is a relatively quick read, although the plot develops a little more slowly than would be ideal in a mystery/thriller. This is far from Joy Fielding's best offering in this genre but certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"This is from a guy. Actually, I liked the book. I listened to it and thoroughly enjoyed it. Yeah, I yelled at her a dozen times that she was being stupid and a teeny-bopper, but I still enjoyed the read/listen. I am a lawyer and the way she reacts as a lawyer is quite realistic, but being a guy I cannot tell you if her swoon over her ex is real or contrived (it feels a bit much to me). I found the gimmick of the ancient business cards a bit -- well -- gimmicky. Still, all in all, enjoy the read read or, better yet, listen to Hick's reading of it."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I have now read several of Fielding's novels. Some of her earlier work remains among my favorites, while \\"Whisper and Lies\\" (see my reviews) has one of the best endings of most books I have read. Anyway, \\"Puppet\\" was a hard one to put down, I read it in one sitting. Ms. Fielding always guarantees a page turner, and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. As usual the author also almost always presents us with a great ending as well, this ending was more than interesting to say the least, however, a little peculiar for most tastes, hence the four star rating instead of the five. I still love you Joy! Next up...Heartstopper."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Although a good novel, it was not as spell binding as her previous.

The author throws in some interesting twists that will probably surprise most readers; I found some of them to be a bit of a stretch, but suspending disbelief isn't too difficult.All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"you will like this suspensful story. Although by reading the back cover excerpt you certainly can get the impression that this is going to be a \\"closed case\\" as the book is all about a lady who shoots a total stranger in the lobby of hotel. When confronted by her daughter, the mother clams up and wants to plead guilty. Now you really know that she is hiding something from her estranged daughter who happens to be a lawyer. The daughter lawyer who resents her mother for the way she was treated growing up can't help herself and starts digging into the mystery of who was the total stranger that her mother shot in cold blood. Once she starts digging, each layer is revealed and somewhere along the line the ick factor comes in. Some people might not like this book because of the ick factor but since we live in such a crazy world and I have watched all the crime drama shows on TV, I was surprised by the shocking revelations but not disgusted as some of my co-workers were. I think this another great read by one of the masters of suspense."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Joy Fielding is one of the authors that I buy a book just by the author name alone. This book was not her best but still wasn't a waste of time. The plot was interesting. The angry daughter comes home because her estranged mother shoots and kills a complete stranger. The plot is interesting but not the sit on the edge of your seat suspense that is the norm in books by Joy Fielding. The ending was definitely a surprise so you can't call the book predictable. It was just slow moving and could have been condensed probably about 100 pages."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"PUPPET by Joy FieldingSeptember 9, 2007Amazon Rating: 4/5 starsAmanda Travis is a high powered lawyer who will do what she can to win a case. Her latest client is accused of raping his girlfriend, and despite the evidence against him, she is successful and gets him off most of the charges. She always gets what she wants, and has been successful because she's aggressive and is not afraid to step on anyone that gets in her way.Amanda has been married and divorced twice, and ex-husband #1 has been calling her constantly, almost to the point of harassment, asking her to call him back. While she's in the middle of having sex with a stranger she just met, she decides to pick up the phone and find out what is going on. She eventually learns that her mother has killed someone with a gun in the middle of a hotel lobby for no apparent reason. The man her mother murdered is a total stranger, and Amanda cannot for the life of her figure out why her mother would do something like this.As Amanda explores her mother's crime, she begins to unravel secrets of her own life, including the connection the murdered man has to her mother and her family. PUPPET may read like a sensationalistic soap opera, but while some readers may find the events totally unbelievable, one has to agree this made one hell of a story, and I had a hard time putting the book down. Riveting with a lot of action and suspense, PUPPET is yet another book by Joy Fielding that I enjoyed a lot. I have only one negative comment about the book - I did not like the main character very much. I believe the author intentionally wrote the character of Amanda Travis as a very manipulative and self-centered woman, in order to arrive at the end of the book where her life takes a turn for the better, despite everything she's learned about her family history. With that said, PUPPET was definitely one of the better books by Joy Fielding that I've read, and recommend the book with the warning that the main character is highly unlikable."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Please note that I would give the narrator of this audio book five stars. I've listened to her before & she never disappoints; excellent & keeps the reader interested with her change in voices for each character, etc.In the first half of the story there are lots of characters, so many in fact that I took notes of who was who so as not to get confused & to find out they had no purpose in the story, I don't even know why they were mentioned so that was a bit frustrating; it could have easily been condensed with the key ten or so characters.The ending was too far fetched for me to grasp and made me uneasy.Like Whispers and Lies, the mother-daughter relationship is strained & touches on Florida for a location; hoping for something a little different in the next Joy Fielding I pick up."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"I agree, this book dragged on way too long. The 'surprise ending' was a real shocker. The fact that I made it to the end is a tribute to Joy Fielding - even not at her best she is still better than most."},{"Title":"Puppet","review":"Puppet is a fast-paced read with twists to the plot.

She drowns her emotional pain in mindless sex, leaving two ex-husbands when they threatened to get too close. Now a lawyer in southeast Florida, she has organized her life just the way she wants it, not letting anyone get too close. Her calm is suddenly fractured one night when her ex-husband calls her from Toronto to tell her that her mother in jail on a murder charge.Despite the fact that she tells herself she doesn't care, she flies to Toronto where Ben represents her mother Gwen. Ben tells her that Gwen isn't talking, insisting only that she killed an unknown man in a hotel lobby because she felt like it and she is perfectly sane. Gwen's stonewalling is infuriating Amanda who believes there is a reason for what she did; for once in her life she isn't going to run away from adversity but plunge into it and expose the secret her mother is so desperate to hide.Joy Fielding once again delivers an exciting crime thriller that will keep readers' interest from page one as they wonder why the protagonist's mother committed cold blooded murder. It is a question that will haunt the audience as the protagonist seeks to find out her mom's secrets that were responsible for her traumatized childhood. As Amanda gets close to the truth she finally comes to terms with her own feelings and turns more sympathetic in the minds of the audience. PUPPET is a nail biting suspense thriller taking readers to the ultimate level.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Evangelical theology: An introduction","review":"The book, which was originally a lecture-series, begins with a definition of what &quot;evangelical&quot; theology is. From this point on, Barth elaborates (further) &quot;biblical&quot; definitions -- which is the starting and ending point of all of Barth's theology; the theology of the Prophets and Apostles, of God Himself, as He has made Himself known to His specially-selected &quot;witnesses&quot; throughout history.One will find hints of Barth's (so-called) &quot;crisis theology&quot; here; the Bible, attesting to and confronting, humanity with His Word, Jeusus Christ -- who speaks, and has spoken -- and will continue to speak to all....Karl Barth disdained the term &quot;neo-orthodoxy&quot; which was designated to his 'type' of theological-beliefs, or as &quot;his&quot; system. For him the Gospel was &quot;ever anew&quot; and always &quot;fresh&quot; to each generation, as well as every individual in it.He has maintained a patent and resolute singularity with the Reformers, being regarded as one of the greatest Christian thinkers in the Reformed tradition. At the same time, he continually challenges both the orthodox and heterodox to &quot;re-think&quot; our theology and to make sure we are in conformity and within the blessed assurance of the theology of Prophets and the Apostles: God's Word (New Testament Greek: theou logos = &quot;theology&quot;).This isn't &quot;past time reading&quot;. (Not for the theologically uninformed). Yet the style, method, and &quot;logic&quot; is easily followed -- if one doesn't &quot;skip&quot; a thought here or there. I (personally) use the book as both a &quot;devotional&quot; and as a technical-reference.Chapters on: Prayer, Solitude, The Word, The Witnesses, Community....more!Buy it (you'll like it)!"},{"Title":"Evangelical theology: An introduction","review":"Among 20th century theologians, Barth is arguably without peer. Here we have a beautiful introduction written in his later years to Barth's entire theological output. If one were serious about beginning to read Barth, there is no better book through which one could enter into his thought. A very helpful book for those interested in what Barth has to say about the nature and purpose of theology. A treasure."},{"Title":"Evangelical theology: An introduction","review":"In this series of lectures, Barth outlines what it means to do theology. He begins by outlining four components of the context of theology. He then treats four characteristics of a theologian. After that, four threats to theology are listed. Finally, four essential components of theological work are listed. Central to the work are Spirit, faith, hope, and love, the final components of each section.As one would expect, central elements of Barthian theology are present. The Word of God and the community of faith are central to the theological endeavor. God is the ultimate object of theology, rather than humanity.This is an excellent introduction to Barth. It is also a good way to begin theological exploration."},{"Title":"Evangelical theology: An introduction","review":"Originally published on my blog [...]Let me start by saying this is my first real introduction to Barth. I know he was talked about briefly in my college Systematic Theology class. I do not remember discussing him at all in grad school. And most of what I know about him prior to this is from biographies of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. I am attempting to rectify that hole in my theological background and this was recommended as an introduction.This book is based on a series of lectures (originally in German). Barth then delivered these lectures later (or parts of them) in the US, based on an edited English translation of the book. The introduction to the book is to the English edition and was written by Barth primarily about coming to the US to give the lectures. Because I have associated Barth with Bonhoeffer it is hard to remember that Barth lived past World War II. But these lectures were given in the US in 1962 and Barth lived another six years after that.These lectures were written at the end of a career and are intended to summarize what it means to be a Christian and Theologian. He has a different meaning of Evangelical than the common modern US word. For Barth, Evangelical is a theological position that is not bound to politics or even Protestantism. The lectures are divided into four main sections. Basically they are: where we do theology (the church, the community, scripture and the Spirit), theological existence (the hardest to define, but it is about wonder, faith and commitment), threats to theology (solitude, doubt, temptation, hope) and the work of theology (prayer, study, service, and love). This is not a systematic theology, but directions about how to be a theologian.Honestly, I think I missed far more than I got. This is a book I need to read again, not necessarily because it is so good (although I think it might be) but because it is so dense I need a second run. So here are some things I did get out of it.First, for Barth Evangelical Theology starts as being modest. I am all about modest theology and I appreciate that he started there.Second, one of the things that makes this book hard to read is that it was originally spoken in German, translated into English, but quotes a ton of phrases in Latin and Greek (not all of them translated). Honestly, one of the biggest things I got out of this is how weak our ability to talk about God is when we only have one language. A short section of this book was discussing the problems of using one language or another because there was not a good word in English or German or Latin or Greek, etc to talk about that aspect of theology.Third, because of my inadequate preparation for reading Barth, I have him pegged as a Liberal Theologian of the early 20th century in my mind. I knew he wasn't going in. But that is still how I have him pegged. Most people reading this book without preconception would believe him to be an orthodox giant of the faith. I know there are some that complain about his view of scripture. But in context of the rest of this theology he really does value scripture. He just does not think we should value scripture above Jesus Christ.Fourth, I do think this is a book that I need to read again and struggle through because he is concerned with what it means to really follow Christ. I know I am not going to agree on everything. But in the end, Barth is far more concerned about the struggle to follow Christ than he is about a particular doctrine. I think it is interesting that he particularly talks about how the tendency among theologians is to reject those that came before us, especially the immediate generation. But he challenged the reader to really struggle through the wisdom of their elders because that is how we get the gospel.Finally, I think it interesting how he cordons off theology from the rest of the sciences. It is not a new view to me, but presented in different way. He suggests that while we can use other sciences to serve theology (history, textual criticism, linguistics, etc.), theology is about God. God cannot be studied through human sciences so we always have to be aware of the limitations of using human sciences to talk about God. His sections on the Holy Spirit and Prayer make it clear to me his devotion. I still have a lot to learn about Barth but I found this relatively short book very helpful.I listened to this book, which limits the ability to go back and read, but keeps me moving forward. I will find it in print later to read again."},{"Title":"Evangelical theology: An introduction","review":"Thus book was ny introduction to the author and theologian Karl Barth and although he demanded that I read some of that which he had written twice. Both his insights and the mental stimulation I received caused me to purchase many of his other works. If anyone is looking for a book of substance look no further, his examination of the WORD and its relationship to the church/individual is excellent.

(Language 30) (German Edition)","review":"I have been learning German for over two years. I've bought quite a few tools to help me learn to speak it. I bought this late last year, and must say that it's one of the best German language sets I've owned. It's quite thorough, plus they don't say the words or phrases so fast that you get frustrated. Everything is also repeated, which is very important. You also not only have the two cassettes included, but also have a nice informative book with everything that is spoken in written form. They even give you a little history about how half the English that we speak comes from Old German; that was very interesting to hear. The book also gives you a history of the German language, grammatical notes, and important signs. You shouldn't feel ripped off if you buy this pack. It's worth it."},{"Title":"German: Start Speaking Today! (Language 30) (German Edition)","review":"I've used the Language 30 learning cassettes for learning/reviewing 5 languages, and have found them to be the BEST out there. What makes them the best? The words and phrases included on the cassettes are the most relevant, they are repeated twice at a normal, yet understandable speed and you can follow along with a guide book which is well-formatted and has a pronunciation guide next to each word/phrase. There is also plenty of time for you to repeat what you've heard. Berlitz wishes their tapes were this good!"},{"Title":"German: Start Speaking Today! (Language 30) (German Edition)","review":"This course from Language/30 has been a helpful tool in my study of the German language. This revised, expanded edition was released in 1992. It comes with two audio cassettes and a phrase book. The cassettes total up to 100 minutes. The book--which contains 49 pages--has a transcription of the audio material. As for the German phrases, they are spoken by two native speakers of the language (a man and a woman). The English phrases are handled by a man. English phrases are recited once, while the German equivalents are said twice. The letters of the German alphabet and the sounds of the German language--diphthongs, vowels, and consonants--are spoken only once and are also transcribed in the book. The social customs section, following the German phrases, is not only in the book but also on the cassettes. Even though the audio material is represented in the book, there are things that the book contains that are not heard on the cassettes; there is an essay from Charles Berlitz (a world-famous linguist), a table of contents, an informative introduction, pronunciation hints, phonetic pronunciation, footnotes, grammatical notes, a list of important traffic signs, and a vocabulary index--which is only partial. The spoken phrases cover many things: general expressions, numbers, time, colors, personal needs, communications, transportation, and emergency situations. My favorite aspects of this course are the repetition of the German phrases and the clear pronunciation of the native speakers of German. According to the back of this course's plastic encasing, this program is &quot;Based on the widely acclaimed, accelerated learning method developed for U.S. Government personnel.&quot; It also states that this course can be used while driving or exercising, and that it is geared towards beginners, business travelers, vacationers, or as a refresher course. I recommend this German-language course."},{"Title":"German: Start Speaking Today! (Language 30) (German Edition)","review":"As far as phrasebooks go, this is one of the best. It actually gives phrases you might use. On the otherhand, it is really not for learning German as it says. For learning grammar, conjugations, declensions, etc. you will have to look elsewhere. For the most part this is not a problem, you should be using multiple programs anyway to get the best effect (I also checked out Pimsleur German and Living Language German Complete Course, and will write reviews for each.) Some of the problems that I had with this course are: 1) I would prefer longer pauses after English, in which to practice the phrase before it is given in German. (Pimsleur calls this the \\"principle of anticipation\\") 2) I'd like to see similar ideas expressed with similar (preferrably the simplest) constructions. For those with minimum time, this is best. 3) The pronunciation guide is rather pointless, and can be misleading. Everything is on tape. Better to practice and get the pronunciation as it really is. 4) Not all the sections are well organized. \\"Visits and Introductions\\" is 5 pages long (most are less than one page), and includes phrases irrelevant to visits or introductions.Some things that I like: 1) everything is on tape. One can get lots of practice in listening and speaking, and not even need to look at the phrasebook. 2) Phrases are useful 3) phrasebook is small, and contains all the phrases in written form.In conclusion, I recommend this course as a partial source in learning German, but cannot recommend it as your sole source."},{"Title":"Science and Sanity (selections)","review":"An interesting view that is not to be overlooked.

Majority of positions look like something that can happen in the real game, however, there are several \\"weird\\" looking setups. I consider myself very experienced in practical studies. I believe that solving clever practical study will improve your Endgame knowledge as well as enhance your calculation skills. I have constantly utilized studies in my personal training as well as with my students. I have to admit that the of the number of studies that I tried to solve from Nunn's book, almost all were very challenging and not as entertaining as I would expect.Quality:Certainly, this book is very high quality - both presentation and content. Nunn claims to have extensively check every study using the latest and strongest chess software available.Who will benefit:Composition/studies aficionado will enjoy this book. Also, extremely high rated player (GM or close strength) who run out of challenging studies to work on.Overall:I think that 99% of active players - from beginners through GMs will benefit much more from studying various Endgame books (including some of Nunn's own) then by studying this particular Nunn's book. The reason is that all good endgame books include practical studies and eliminate weird once, while mixing in some important theory. Also solutions are a lot more realistic and involve some strategic planning in addition to pure calculation that is common to studies. Thus you would improve your endgame skills and train calculation skills at once.When I saw a title \\"Endgame Challenge\\" I was expecting a work similar to the book by John Hall with identical name. While not perfect, that book is one of my favorite Endgame exercise books. All of my students own it and utilize it a lot. In addition, you should have a good theory book - works of Fine, Averbach and Alburt (depending on your level) are among my favorite. Also, new book Fundamental Chess Endgames looks very interesting.

These themes cover the almost all major subheadings of endgame theory: king and pawn endings, knight and pawn endings, bishop and pawn endings, rook and pawn endings, bishop vs knight endings, rook and minor piece endings, and queen endings. Each section contains about 60 endings, arranged three to a page. Each puzzle is accompanied by a verbal hint and a rating of the complexity of the puzzle - one of easy, moderate, or difficult. Comprehensive solutions to each puzzle are presented at the end of each section.Through its puzzles, the book is able to convey much of the basic theory of endgame study. Many of the \\"standard\\" endgame positions can be found within such as the Philidor position in rook and pawn endings and \\"Reti's Idea\\" in king and pawn endings.Endgame puzzles are a great way to increase ones calculation ability, and this book isn't short on puzzles which require 7 or 8 moves of accurate calculation to reach a favorable outcome.Studied alone, this book is sure to increase ones endgame understanding. However, I prefer to use it as a supplement book. I'll follow each chapter of endgame theory from a more comprehensive book with a series of puzzles from the equivalent section of this book. In this way, the lessons from the theory book are reinforced through exercises."},{"Title":"Endgame Challenge","review":"Most of the Chess world considers the endgame boring.

By theorizing the decolonial imaginary and third space feminism (and drawing eclectically from feminist and critical theory) she creates a new and expansive narrative which allows us to think in original ways about Chicana identity, the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, the cultural and gendering effects of the Mexican Revolution, and the process by which dominant historical forms are canonized. One of the most impressive things about her book is is that she simultaneously does two very different things through a connected yet multifaceted narrative. On the one hand, she posits a category for thinking and acting on new forms of social interaction, in other words, if we examine our lives -- as feminists, historians, gringas, or people or color -- in the context of a decolonial imaginary, some of the recalcitrant and insidious limits and lines of racism, homophobia, and othering dissolve. This is especially highlighted by her inventive reading of the John Sayles's film &quot;Lone Star,&quot; in which the female protaganist (a tejana) says to her anglo boyfriend (and half-brother), &quot;Forget the Alamo.&quot; For Perez, this means not that history can be forgetten but that we can relive and reenact historical forms in the name of love and human connection. On the other hand, through a wonderful archival strategy which includes research in the Yucatan, Los Angeles, Houston and other sites, Perez successfuly and eloquently writes the diffcult genre of transnational feminist history. She examines the making, sexing, and naming of Chicana identities while *both* highlighting the importance of the circular migration of women, families, and ideas across borders and emphasizing the centrality of boundaries (through urban segregation or Anglo anti-Mexican sentiment) to the formation of Chicana lives and spaces. This is exemplified by her wonderful reading of the &quot;Letter from Chapultepec&quot; written by a Chicana group in Houston in the 1930s. Overall, I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in feminist studies, Chicana/o history, borderlands history, U.S. Western history, and Mexican history."},{"Title":"The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History (Theories of Representation and Difference)","review":"Ignore the reviews below from embittered graduate students from UTEP who still can't get over the way the Perez takes apart the history of Tejas.If you believe in Sam Houston, and Steven Austin, and the Texas Rangers, this book is going to get your goat.If, however, you are interested in how reading Chicanas into history changes our notions of both \\"history\\" and \\"the American West,\\" then you are in for something good.I particularly value the first chapter, where Perez turns her keen eye to the different modes in which history is written and how they all drop Chicanas out of the picture.

There are numerous modern culturaland historical analyses (especially in the area ofgender studies) which use him as a touchstone, ofeither inspiration or deflection.Though it might be very modern to insist uponseparating the man and his life, from his thoughtand his work, if the thought and work serve asthe guide to the way one pursues one's way in theworld (or justifies that way), then it seems only fair(if not self protective) to examine the end productof where that thought and work will lead, or haveled [have you noticed how many people don't seem toknow the correct spelling of &quot;led&quot;? -- a risinggeneration seems to think that &quot;lead&quot; (pronounced&quot;ledd&quot;) is the past tense of &quot;lead&quot;...I lead(pronounced leed), I led, I shall lead (leed),I have led, I had led, I shall have led...justthought there should be some helpful advice herefor those who will be upset with this review).This is not to say that perhaps a reader shouldnot read (pronounced reed) him...just do so withcaution and good judgment. Know where you arebeing led (pronounced ledd)-- lest you wind up dead(pronounced dedd)."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"This text is perhaps Foucault's most well-known, although it might not be his best. It is an important work, so if you are at all interested in sex as an abstract and organizing principle, this is a must-read. (Note: it is not a history in the proper sense of the term). While not a terribly confusing book, it is WIDELY misunderstood, including by many of the reviewers. First off, do not make the mistake of reading the first section as Foucault's thesis (it may seem that way)--he is presenting the common approach to the issue, one that he will eventually CHALLENGE. &quot;Sex&quot; was never repressed--on the contrary, there has been an explosion of discourses, a productive manifestation of power. Foucault admits that this was partially organized through technologies of confession, normalization, etc.-BUT THAT IS NOT THE MAIN THRUST. The main idea of the text is that there is no commanding, Platonic principle &quot;sex&quot; that we must uncover or saturate ourselves with, and hence, while prudery seems suspect, liberation through &quot;sex&quot; or &quot;sex-desire&quot; is entirely nonsensical, since sex is subordinate to sexuality and not vica-versa. Foucault, with much uncertainty, thereby envisions a different economy of bodies and pleasures, more like the ars erotica, that focuses on the local and individual, with all their multiple possibilities for deeper value and communication. Hence, depite what people make of Foucault's life, this book is more &quot;conservative&quot; that one would imagine... It is ideal for anyone who wants to free themselves from either a deep-rooted fear of sex or the incessant demands sex makes from on high (from the media, etc.) To Foucault, the idea that sex is seen as a requirement for one's deepest sense of being is absurd (and almost comical). A fascinating exploration which you might have to read twice, the History of Sexuality demonstrates Foucault's otherwordly insight. Do not fall into the traps I mentioned--Foucault's purpose here is not to free sex from all controls, but merely from one in particular--the reader is given the freedom to reflect and counter it with a more positive and meaningful grasp of his own sexuality and sexual experience."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Foucault's three-part History of Sexuality begins here with an examination of the ways in which our contemporary interpretation of sexuality has been shaped by historical trends. Foucault makes a compelling case for the construction of sexual identity as a function of political and economic forces. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in sexuality, psychoanalysis, gender studies, queer theory, or feminisms, or indeed anyone who wishes to confront his or her own personal assumptions about gender and sexuality. Think you know what normal is? After Foucault, you may not be so sure. (One more thing: while this book is a fascinating read which can stand alone, I strongly advise anyone interested in this subject to go on to read the second and third volumes)"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"This book can be seen as a perfect example of a brilliant mind at work. Foucault surely considered this book as an introductory piece, a draft of brilliantly posed ideas and problems about sexuality as a dispositive, not in the traditional sense of the word that we have all become so acquainted with. This book works in many respects: Foucault succesfully makes his case for an open refusal of the \\"repressive hypothesis\\", explaining in a very precise manner why the discourse on sexuality in the XVIII and XIX centuries, far from being shy about it, positively promoted discussion... what he calls a \\"discoursive explosion\\". Foucault quite brilliantly introduces the two ways in which sexuality has come to be assumed by the human race: as an art (in ancient Greece) and as a science (in our present era). He also develops his own ideas (ideas that also appear in his courses at the Coll&egrave;ge de France, particularly \\"Society Must Be Defended\\") about bio-power, disciplinary societies and biopolitical regimes. He successfully questions the fact that we have come to place sex under a veil of secrecy which must be undone... how sex has become the key to our personality, our \\"identity\\".The last verses of the book are revealing: how is it that we still consider sex to be liberating when in reality we are always under its gaze, when it really has become a burden to be dealt with?This book is astounding. Maybe not as brilliant as \\"Discipline and Punish\\" (which says a LOT about Foucault's creative nature)but certainly a key text toward understanding the problems Foucault tackled in final years of his life.Note: the last two volumes of the History of Sexuality display a shift of focus and a leap back in \\"history\\"... you'll have to read the introduction to volume 2, \\"The Use Of Pleasure\\", to see what I mean. Still, it all makes sense if you dig deeper into the final developments of Foucault's work."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"More like a 3.5 if that was an option. Part of me hates rating this book so low, but I really have to. Here's why.I love and hate Foucault more than just about any other philosopher. He is probably the pre-eminent French philosopher of his generation. The problem is that he is probably also the worst French historian of all time.Foucault certainly has his moments and he's consistently entertaining (he's a very good writer and judging from his lectures, a great lecturer), but underneath it all, he's fundamentally lazy - he never does research studies or clinical work, he never looks outside France, he uses translations and secondary sources when he should be using original texts, he cites literature as if it is representative of the masses in the society in which it was written. Yet his writing is so confident, and his ideas so interesting and self-assured people believe him without checking his sources or his historical assertions.He reminds me of the student I always have in my class who comes up with the best ideas but is unwilling to follow them through. The B student that should be an A+ student. He doesn't do homework, he doesn't show his work. I have to give them split grades. I'd give Foucault a split grade if I could - Ideas 5/5. Reasoning and Research 2/5.In Foucault's case, he didn't do research outside France, he didn't reference or respond to contemporary History of Ideas works on Sexuality (e.g. Otto Kiefer's Sexuality in Rome and Greece, Van Gulick's Sexuality in Ancient China), he failed to develop a basic understanding of medicine, he cherrypicked texts that suited his arguments and failed to consider opposing arguments, and his Greek and Latin leave something to be desired.His concept of the \\"repressive hypothesis\\" in this book is extremely interesting and well-reasoned (apart from the historical examples). His notion of biopower is also fairly intriguing, though not fleshed out in sufficient detail here (Psychiatric Power has more on it), and seems to be a kind of extension of the Hegelian for-itself (which is conceived in terms of relationships). He also very briefly, mentions third sex/intersexed individuals, which became a jumping off point for a lot of queer theory. Buyer beware - if you're looking for queer theory, it's only about a page or two, so you'll probably be disappointed.Here's the real problem with this book - the examples, the historical scholarship. Foucault, determined as he is to prove (like Nietzsche did quite a bit more convinvingly in Beyond Good and Evil) the lack of foundation of contemporary morality bends the truth and fails to see things that are very obvious to medical professionals and more objective historians.Case in point:In a passage (31) and elsewhere in references to Ancient Greece, Foucault more or less writes an apologia for pedophilia. There is a problem though with all this - the unstated biological injunction. As someone who was an EMT - I can tell you something that should be obvious to someone as smart as Foucault, but wasn't - apart from normative moral concerns (which wouldn't concern an anti-foundationalist) - sexual intercourse with children physically and biologically injures them. I won't go into the gory details. If they're young enough, it could kill them. There's also the way young people respond to STD's. Sometimes, that's different, too.Even if you completely dispense with normative morality and enact purely utilitarian laws based upon simply minimizing biological damage or instead engage in a minarchical system with protective services, this would still be largely prohibited either by law or contracted mutual assent.In addition, Foucault does not understand biology very well and often uses outdated medical references like Pinel to represent current medical practice. The thing is Foucault is clever about it. It's a straw man, but it's a clever straw man, because he cites Pinel in a historical context and later as a means of (falsely) explaining the contemporary. Either that, or he just doesn't get medicine all that well.Then there's Christianity. Oh, God, is Foucault ever wrong on this frontier. He even claims (117) the first treatise on sin was written in the 15th century. Off the top of my head, there are writings on sin as early as Augustine of Hippo in the 4th century (and perhaps earlier). You're ten centuries off, Foucault! That kind of oversight borders on ridiculous. How no one else has picked up on that baffles me.I'd definitely read this book, but read it critically. It's not as inept in the scholastic sense as Madness and Civilization (which famously contains references to the non-existent Ship of Fools) but some of the scholarship is abysmal.The French/Greco-Roman focus is a tad trying too, especially considering the wealth of available laws of quite a number of other major civilizations, which Foucault overlooks, presumably because they have male to male sodomy prohibitions which problematize his central arguments, or because of his obvious ignorance of other languages.If this sounds overly negative, bear in mind - I like this book, and wholeheartedly recommend purchasing it. Just take it with a grain of salt. It has some extraordinarily interesting ideas, but alas, when I see it, I see what could have been if the author was more disciplined in his approach. If there wasn't so much there that was good, I wouldn't be nearly as upset by Foucault's sloppy scholarship."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"In &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;, Foucault enlightens us with sexuality as a tribute benefiting from knowledge and power. Sexuality before the 18th century, was in a sense, located in the body and the flesh. There was no established fetish. Sex had not come under the scrutiny of science (psychoanalysis). Sex was just sex; for procreation and physical enjoyment. When the confessionals started to become a ritual in religion we see a shift or rupture in history. Priests in the middle ages became concerned with what people did sexually. It was the confession that would free, but it was the power that reduced an individual to silence. Thus the titillating game began and repeated and repeated. Freud and his psychoanalysis came along, which defined and categorized sexuality and its dysfunctions. Psychoanalysis became a scientific confessional. Thus society has become a singularly confessing society; Western man has become a confessing animal. Foucault then begins to posit anchorage points in institutions such as in the home; anchorage points which standardizes roles of family classification. It's roughly 160 pages long and readable. This was probably my favorite of Foucault's work."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Foucault is one of the most important thinkers of our time. He is a historian, a cultural theorist, and a philosopher. When looking at the History of Sexuality Foucault does not see powerful figures repressing sex, but actually encouraging people to discuss it. This discourse was encouraged so that sex could be controlled and this discourse actually created what is today called sexuality--a norm that we believe to be culturally independent or universal. The belief that sex is repressed is only another strategy formed through a series of power relationships that desires for people to keep discussing sex in order that this \\"sex\\" can be classified and controled. For example: Encouraging a discourse on the act of sodomy enabled a catagory of homosexual to be created. Instead of sodomy being a act that a person may engage in, that person instantly became a homosexual, his sexuality constituting his entire being--how he/she should talk, act, and live in general. The discourse that was encourage to develop around sex enable power to classify and control sexuality--power actually created what we believe to be the \\"real sexuality\\". Foucault explains the complicated relationship between power and discourse that developed a set of complicated and sometimes contradicting--and always changing--ideas about what sex is and how we are to approach it.This book is not easy. I will have to read it again. However, I believe that this book is a good intro to Foucault's very important theories on power relationships. An important factor to be recognized is that this book is a translation from french and, as many people have already expressed, has made it more difficult to comprehend. I did not understand everything in totality but I feel that the most imporant concepts were revealed. If you get confused take a deep breath and reread the previous paragraph, doing this helped alot and gives your brain a second chance to wrap itself around the really difficult parts. This is a very rewarding book that will give you valuable tools for confronting and interpreting the ideologies and power relationships we are confronted with. Good Luck!"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"There is no doubt in my mind that Foucault is one of the most important thinkers of the 20th century and without a doubt among the most influential. His philosophical inquiry into material history of systems and their construction/perpetuation has revolutionized the way in which we see the world around us and has led to fruitful and fascinating inquiries in the field of cultural studies.No volume articulates Foucault's ideas with greater clarity than this first volume of his history of sexuality. More a manifesto than a true history, Foucault outlines with astonishing deftness the ways in which our perceptions are molded by systems of knowledge and power. These systems, which he describes as &quot;intentional but non-subjective&quot; (in other words, having a purpose and goal, but not directed by any guiding intelligence) are like natural forces that shape and mold our understanding of the world while they perpetuate themselves. His analysis of the formulation of ideas of sexuality in the 18th and 19th centuries illustrates his argument both forcefully and clearly. Readers may, by the way, want to compare Foucault's ideas with Louis Althusser's in his essay on the Industrial State Apparatus in his collection &quot;Lenin and Philosophy,&quot; which provides a similarly materialists, but more politically Marxist, view of how subjectivity is constructed and limited by existing modes of power."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"This is part one in Foucault's three part series on Sexuality. It doesn't have the gripping opening few pages that Discipline and Punish has (quite possibly the most engrossing beginning of any book I have ever read), but it still grabs you. What this volume does have is amazing clarity in the ideas that he presents. The general idea is that society controls sex through how it talks about it and organizes it (this is pretty much the idea in all of Foucault's works) and Foucault examines this power structure of society. How marriage controls sexuality, why there has been such a veritable explosion of discussion about sex in the West since the seventeenth century, why do we believe that talking about sex will make us less repressed about it, etc. Foucault addresses many questions in this work.I did have some problems with it, however. I'll only mention one or two here. In the closing chapter of the book Foucault discusses the Right of Death and Power over Life. He begins by talking about the Right of the Sovereign to compel to war (Foucault is very anti-War) and how it has changed from wars being waged to protect a sovereign to wars being waged to protect people and ideals and an entire nation. We have this line: \\"In any case, in its modern form - relative and limited - as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life and death is a dissymmetrical one. The sovereign exercised his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only through the death he was capable of requiring (emphasis added). I'm not sure I agree with this statement. Nor am I convinced that history does - and Foucault offers neither text nor argument to support this. He expects us to take it as fact. Gone are theories of divine right and other power structures invoked by sovereign's (taxes, services, \\"For England\\", or \\"For France\\"). Patriotism isn't only a modern day invention. Joan of Arc drove the English out of France so that France could be it's own nation again. \\"Power in this instance was essentially right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize hold of life in order to suppress it.\\" The implication is that \\"Power\\" has changed (and it has) so that now society (through it's mechanism of discussion and examination) has power even when the \\"right of seizure\\" isn't enforceable - or doesn't exist. These themes tend to come out over the course of reading several of Foucault's books, but never does M. Foucault state them so precisely and with such clarity as he does in this volume."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"While Foucault is a must-read in nearly all social science fields, this book should be read in conjunction with several other articles and books by Foucault--most notably, \\"Nietzsche, Genealogy, History\\", \\"Schizo-Culture\\", and 'Discipline and Punish'. There are far too many misconceptions regarding Foucault's thought, which is inescapable given the scope of this book and the sophistication of langauge used. I would also recommend having a basic understanding of Freud's theories on sexuality and the Critical school of thought.The largest problem I have with this book is that it is a terrible translation of the original French work.

Unlike Madness and Civilization, this work has very few historical details, and those it includes basically just support the theory of the text. Also, unlike M&amp;C, this book is almost entirely theory, and the theory isn't even very interesting. You thought Victorian society was repressive? Well it also showed an unheard of explosion of sexual discourses! Foucault questions why we have made sex the bearer of a secret truth that must continually be sought, and continually elude us. This is likely the least sexy book ever written on sexuality; probably owing to Foucault's belief that sexuality is a &quot;historical product.&quot;"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Foucault's work, particularly that on sexuality, is not so much a contribution to philiosophy as it is a part of the &quot;Everything is political if I say it is&quot; movement that has blossomed in academe since the 60s. Without the rise to power of gender fascists in academe, Foucault would never have been considered anything but what he is: a professor who seeks to secure a position in his profession by wild rhetorical exaggeration, outrageous posturing, feverish &quot;networking,&quot; and pandering to hot topics that excite adolescents and graduate students in need of a dissertation topic. There's no question that Foucault has been very popular in the past fifteen years, and remains so. But the truth is that what he says is actually not original: take some French Structuralism, mix with some Nietzschien platitudes (one can only scream with laughter at the thought of what Nietzsche would have thought if someone suggested that there was anything in common between himself and Foucault!), rip-off Derrida's notion of differance, place in an envelope entitled The Personal Is the Political, and there you have it. He's a god to the PC people in the US, but, in fact, no one reads him in France, where he's regarded as passe and part of the Stalinist/Maoist period when thought was always made handmaiden to politics, with the predictable result that thought was either &quot;politically correct&quot; (as the 20th century Marxists used to say long before the phrase ever reached the popular press) or it was corrupt and oppressive. Since this latter notion is dominant in American academe today, with feminists and other gender fanatics calling the shots, it's no surprise that Foucault should still be taken so seriously there. Foucault's History of Sexuality is a perfect example of PC politics in academe, and has been a rhetorical model for thousands of awful dissertations, articles and books since then.

The chapter about The Repressive Hypothesis was very interesting to me since I am a psychology major; it was neat to correlate both of my classes to this book by Michael Foucault. I would definitely recommend this book, if you would like to be challenged but are definitely ready for a good read!"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"In \\"the History of Sexuality\\", Foucault tried to use Nietzsche's genealogical approach that views concepts as changing constantly to fit the needs and provocations over time. Nietzsche used the genealogical approach gracefully in Beyond Good and Evil, and though I'm not completely convinced his ideas are correct; the gracefulness of his argument, and his personal experience with the chaotic political and moral nature of the European society he reacted to, form a compelling argument for his genealogical theory.Foucault mocked Nietzsche's approach but prematurely formulated his \\"repressive hypothesis\\" of thinking by which concepts result from the inexorable avalanche of history, and that sexuality has been repressed throughout our political history, therefore the only way to political liberation is sexual liberation.A side note: Foucault's \\"The History of Sexuality\\" is one of the basic justifications for the queer theory that proclaims the intersection between politics, sexuality, and gender. The whole normals vs. abnormal arguments are pointless and vague, as no one can tell what is normal or abnormal in the world. The arguments presented make no sense to me, are too relativist and do not rely on any scientific reason. It is a world devoid of absolutes where we must assume that anything and everything is permissible. This queer thinking recalls my college years, when I was irritated by new societies such as \\"The Society of Women Engineers\\" and the \\"The Society of Black Engineers\\". Next we will have\\" The Society of Queer Engineers\\" and \\"The Society of Tall Engineers'. What happened to treating humans as humans, who share life regardless of their gender, color or physical appearance? How can we ask for equality between genders when we defeat the whole purpose by being feminists or some other separate group?Back to \\"The History of Sexuality\\", Foucault reviews history to find out why our sexuality became the key to unlocking the truth about us, and arrives at the relationship sex has with power and knowledge. Foucault traces the emergence of sexuality to the seventeenth century, when the Christian emphasis on sins of the flesh led to an increasing awareness of sexuality in family relations. His road to the genesis of human sexuality ends with the bourgeois of the nineteenth century, who effectively invented what we think of as \\"sexuality,\\" and used it as a way of protecting and separating themselves from the other groups. Foucault acknowledges that sex is not our essence, but rather it is a social construct that makes it easier to control humans. Here Foucault didn't provide any definite prove to his theory. It even sounds more convincing that the opposite is the truth: Sex and all its biological drives are an essential part of our nature and, therefore, it makes us more susceptible to control.The point Foucault tried to make in many lengthy ways is that how we understand certain concepts has a lot to do with what other concepts we link them to, and in this thought construct, sexuality is not a concept as much as means of linking concepts to each other. Foucault strong, initial argument that our sexual desires or behaviors themselves do not express profound truths about us, rather it is the discourse we have built up around those desires and behaviors that suggest the profound truth. These discourses are not fixed and changeable with time and needs. The growing importance of sexuality in our society reflects the fact that we have found more and more concepts that we can connect through sexuality, and in this way the \\"deployment of sexuality\\" is the way that we use sexuality to join different concepts. The history of sexuality is a history of class dominance, where sexuality is a social construct that can be used to link power and knowledge to sex in a variety of different ways.Finally, Foucault arrives at the conclusion that human life (and its aspects including sexuality) throughout history came to fall under the control of politics, where \\"bio power\\" or the new power over life controls life through the discipline of the body and through the regulation of population. It's beyond me how Foucault arrived at this conclusion while discussing how wars got fiercer than ever, how the death penalty became a safeguard not an act of destruction, and how power seems now to control life and population.I suspect that Foucault, through his arguments, wanted to weaken the concept of sexuality. By simply calling it a social construction, he will weaken the political powers themselves. I also suspect by the way that Foucault identified the four centers that have power and knowledge related to sex(hysterization of women's bodies, pedagogization of children's sex, socialization of procreative behavior, and psychiatrization of perverse pleasure) that he was trying to differentiate by what is socially considered a normal behavior and what is not. This is again a losing argument since it's purely a personal way of looking at things.As a big fan of Nietzsche (his method of debate not his actual ideas), I don't think that Foucault even came close to Nietzsche's genealogical approach. Foucault took a very exciting topic and managed to destroy his argument with a lengthy complicated delivery, the biggest problem with some philosophers is that they are trying so hard to be original that they overlook the obvious or they wrap it up in such a complex knot you can't possibly untie it. ."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"unlike his idol bataille who did write some very good books that you can read with one hand, foucault on sex is just about as erotic as a discarded coke can.but his method of 'reverse-engineering' a knowledge industry that craves out a human activity or phenomenon and imposes control and power over it is fascinating. he probably overstates his thesis but it is still a lot of food for thought."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"The History of Sexuality Three Volumes by Michel FoucaultIt is clear for the reader that sexuality as a reflective archetype sensually, historically and exegetically speaking is a rebounding dispotif which is carried throuhgout these conceived volumes by the author. They range from from (Volume 1: 'The Will to Knowledge&quot;, (Volume 2: &quot;The Use of Pleasures&quot;) and (Volume 3: &quot;The Care of the Self). They are treated in such a manner that here the author reflects on what one could call the 'literature of geometric triplexes' for each cannot exist without the other. Foucault background on Renaissance resemblance could have played much influence on the morphology of these volumes. They are dependently self-referential to each other and themselves whilst exhuming the psycho-body oddities and subterranean elements of sexuality from the pagan world to the present. Volume One is a treatise on why sexuality was constrained for a long time in the West. Foucault argues that it was such because of &quot;confessional faith&quot;. Man was coerced to be a confessing animal because of Christian faith. Excessive hedonism of sex was labelled a sin. Through Christianity sex was expurgated and even taken to a climax where mentioning the name itself became a moral sin. Voyeurists, heterosexuals, faggots and prostitutes were seen as oucasts from society. Foucault with his concrete arguments freed sexuality from human established constraints. He set sex free from moral bondage. In our times where people have a fear to speak openly about sex issues especially regrding AIDS, one will find the author's treatise the most relevent concerning &quot;sexual strangulation&quot;, the fear to speak openly about sex. Volume Two is on the sexuality of hedonism prohibited by the church. Hedonism here goes way to pagan cultures. In this treatise Foucault invites the reader to voraciously dissipate in the sexual orgy. It is all about abounding joys of eroticism. Volume Three is a secret of the libido. Thoughtfully intrinsic, it invites the reader to look into the innate ontology of the self. That which makes us sexual animals.

References are made to Greece, the 18th Century, or \\"at least since the Middle Ages\\" but, strictly speaking, the vague and general concepts in the book are not related to any particular time or place in history. The author is not a historian, rather he is more of a pompous intellectual philosopher given to odd word forms, complex sentence construction, and extremely obtuse conceptual ways to say simple things.

It is not an easy read but it is worth the effort."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Michel Foucault first wrote The History of Sexuality in 1976, and to this day, we are still continuing to question and examine the very things he has just recently shinned a light onto, which is sex. He does a wondering job questioning the very ideas that have been believed for decades and supporting his thoughts with powerful evidence. His main goal for writing this book is to disprove the long believed theory of that sex was repressed physically and verbally and to show that it was actually prevalent throughout the past three centuries. He questions why this idea was ever believed in the first place and how society has changed throughout history.In today's society, we submerge ourselves with sex so much, it seems that everywhere you look it's on billboards and out on the streets and the TV with those provocative ads and music videos. But when we are asked to think of how sex was viewed in the past three centuries, we immediately think that sex had been repressed and was avoided in conversations. We draw this conclusion from our interpretation of the Victorian times and how we believe that they remained reserved in terms of sexuality and limited it to only in the household. Foucault however, disagrees with this theory and states that those who believe it are victims of the \\"repressive hypothesis\\". This hypothesis simply states that it's the belief that sexuality was repressed by society due to the rise of capitalism. He retort to this idea, stating that people started to believe this because by portraying past sexuality as repressed, it in turn, makes sex now feel more innovative and uninhibited. Foucault does a wonderful job explaining his theory, stating that future sex would be \\"a garden of earthly delights.\\" Essentially, what he is saying is that if we think sex in the past was repressed, us having sex now in the present time would be rejecting past moral systems, making it more exciting to do. He explains that if society had always had sex and was very vocal about it in the past centuries, it would make sex today less exciting. People love to think that what they are doing is the best new thing, something that nobody has tried before, and if we can envision sex as a symbol and act that was once silenced and avoided, it would make it more devious and thrilling.Once Foucault explained why he believed the repressive hypothesis was created, he turned his focus on why sex was actually revered and prevalent rather than repressed and silenced. Foucault informs the reader with historical periods and effectively explains why these incidents in history actually caused an increase of sex in society. Foucault starts his explanation focusing on the start of the 17th century, where people started using \\"authorized vocabulary\\", where they determine where you can talk about sex, when you can talk about sex and with whom. This increased discussion of sex started from the Counter-Reformation from the Roman Catholic Church. The church would ask their followers to confess to all of their sinful desires and behaviors. By repeatedly verbalizing it for the first time, many people in society found it rather thrilling and desirable, causing the increase in sexual discussions. Along with that, it wasn't only just the Church wanting control of sexuality, it was the government as well. In the 18th century, with the emergence of innovative economic and political ideas and procedures, it was important for a government of a state to not only control their subjects but the population as well. Foucault states that this was vital because some of their political and economic concepts were based on the type of population they had in society. If government can control the population, then they can make an effective choice for what is best for their society. Once this became known, government became more interested in birth/death rates, types of marriage and types of birth control. This attention government was giving to sexuality sparked an interest by people on sexuality, making it more communicable.Lastly, Foucault discusses the gradually shifted from sex with only married couples to non-limited sex. Previously, sex had only been seen as productive and used only for reproduction. However, once society's attention shifted to other forms of sexuality other than with married couples, it began to be more established in society. This is where the act of prostitution and pedophilia became more widespread. This was the change from married sex to other types of sex. Foucault then states that this change impacted society in three major ways. First, people started categorizing others based off of their actions sexually. So if someone were to enjoy the act of sodomy, would be labeled as a homosexual. Society then begins to define these people by their actions rather than who they truly are. The second effect this change had on society is that by labeling these people, you are providing them with a sense of pleasure and power to those committing the acts. Lastly, society itself encourages such behavior by regulating where it could take place and when to do it. All of this were results from sexuality being more common in society, forcing it to expand to areas of unknown.Overall, Foucault does a wonderful job explaining and supporting his theory that sexually was not repressed but actually liberated and unshackled. He effectively showed that society was under the repressive hypothesis impression and why it was actually the opposite that was true. Foucault also does a wonderful job defending his claim with detailed and colorful vocabulary, easily describing his thoughts without confusing the reader. Foucault's History of Sexuality is universally prevalent and is important to understand about history. I found the book to be extremely informative as well as engaging, consistently hitting me with relevant strong points and always making me think of new different ways of looking at a given situation. I would recommend it who is interested in how sexuality took it's form in today's society and how much it has changed throughout history. It was a very informative and interesting to read and enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"The History of Sexuality, Volume !: An Introduction by Michel Foucault, is this major French thinker's last work, and since so many others have given a good sense of what the book is about, I will be brief. My only demur to their opinions is that while this may be his most popular book, it is not his best, or his most influential among scholars.It is very important to note that this is not a history of sex. It is not even a history of talking about sex. It is a history of the way in which talking about sex was structured over the last three hundred years, his primary thesis being that contrary to popular belief, the Victorian era, roughly between 1835 and 1903, was NOT a period where talk about sex was repressed. To be sure, Freud and the other psychoanalysts made major influences in how we talk about sexuality, but Freud was as much a milestone as it was a cause of the change. The book is devoted to two critical shifts in attitudes about sex. The first was from the onset of legislation about sex early in the industrial age, to the formation of sexual archetypes or \\"types of sexuality\\". The second major shift, which contributed to the first, was the simultaneous change in the value put on human life. This was brought about by agricultural advances which abolished famine in many countries, and the advance in medicine which showed that by attending to good practices, one can substantially improve and lengthen one's life. This trend was embraced by governments, which discovered the need for lots of people to keep the new industries running.Make no mistake. Foucault is difficult to read, but you have the assurance of those who have gone before that the journey is worth the effort. One nice perk of reading thie book is that you get a chance to read sn iportant contemporary thinker who is totally imbued with Nietzschean concepts. One can almost hear Nietzsche talking over Foucault's shoulder. Unforturnately, Foucault does not have Nietxaxhe's flair for writing sparkling prose.I will warn you that the editor of this translation would have done us a favor by providing footnotes to explain some of Foucault's references, such as the fact that \\"The Plumed Serpent\\" was written by D. H. Laurance and that Jean Martin Charcot was the founder of scientific neurology, and Sigmund Freud's teacher at the Paris Saltpetraire hospital.

He emphasizes that power is ever-present in the mechanics of sex, and goes on to explain how sex is more than an act, or an identity, or a gender-class.Foucault suggests that sex is \\"a problem of truth\\" (pp.56). He delves into the context in which truth is experienced and produced, so that when we discuss the experience of the sexual sphere, we are contending with an experience of truth made valid by the exposition of our own fears. These fears have been programmed into our social bodies by the powers that thrive on oppression, discrimination, and subject anihilation.Ultimately, this volume carries the power to illuminate the conditions around the experience of truth in action. In our nudity, we bear no cover for our own self-deprication, self-martyrdom; an arrogant body peeled from its social cell now free to learn new conversations of truth and meaning...all through the experience of sex.Fascinating and illuminating, this work paves the way for questions like: If through the naked encounter we proclaim an awareness of truth, we internalize the desire to validate our selves, then what does the introduction of web-cams and internet porn offer, or challenge, this relationship of power, truth and the recognition of meaning?"},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Foucault has an extraordinary Nietzchean ability to dismentle accepted ideas and raise new paradoxes. The irony he poses: the more we cultivate individuality and pursue personal freedom, the more hopelessly entangled we become in the menacing net of science and &quot;bio-power.&quot; Is Foucault truly unique, or is he being clever; is he a thinker or simply an iconoclast? It's for you to determine. A very interesting book."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"My only real complaint about the book is that Foucault did not not provide enough historical information to support his primary ideas. The notion of the proliferation of sexualities(there is never just one) is intriging in light of many of our struggles in the present to create autonomous and diverse sexual cultures against the the Purity brigades who believe in maintaining the status quo where desire and bodies are constanly policed to insure they are behaving properly (this seems to hark to Foucault's other work, Discipline and Punish). This book should be read by everyone who is concerned about the fate of our sexual autonomy and how we are going to articulate ourselves in the coming millenium."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"History of Sexuality shows the way power shifts in relation to sexuality. Foucault goes down through history since the Age of Reason, and describes how sexuality was used by the church, and the state in order to control they way the &quot;individual&quot; behaves. Truly an exceptional book. Very few books are able to question history's own construction within its own definiton as this book does."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Once again I purchased a book and get a book with a different cover, its the same book, but it's not what i expect to see when i open the package. Product was in excellent condition, it was NEW. Overall satisfied with the product."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Michel Foucault has based his entire corpus of history on the premise that society has been waging a battle between those at the center of society who wield power and those who live at the periphery and lack it. In THE HISTORY OF SEXUALITY, VOL I, he does not present a history of sexuality so much as yet another opportunity to delineate another marginalized subgroup, those who wish to succumb to their inner sexual desires but feel refrained by society. Ironically enough, Foucault notes that until the Victorian Age, prudery more often reigned over licentiousness throughout history. It was not until the 19th century, that society began to allow greater freedom for those who wished to explore their own sexuality. There is an inner irony here that is not present explicitly in the book. Foucault himself was a total sexual hedonist who frequented San Francisco's bathhouses where he may have caught the AIDS virus that killed him in 1984. Further, he openly expressed his belief that adults should feel perfectly free to have sex with children. He alludes to this in the book as he writes of a simple minded country youth who shares a \\"milk curdling\\" experience with a prepubescent girl.Foucault saw the 19th century as a true explosion of discourses on sexuality, the totality of which was to demolish the then emphasis on keeping sex and the topic of sex behind closed doors. The struggle for power shifted from a repressive state controlling the environment in which sex might reasonably be expected to thrive to one in which those who had been previously bereft of the right to deal openly with sex to now having an overabundance of that very right. THE HISTORY OF SEXUALITY then is a minor variation on Foucault's obsession with accusing the center of massed power of first identifying, then declaring aberrant, then ultimately marginalizing those on the fringes. Oddly enough, this book is one of Foucault's more coherent explorations of those on the fringe."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"Michel Foucault is a shallow, superficial writer with a one-track mind. He dips into history and ancient writings with a rather hasty slipshod scholarship, parading knowledge rather than understanding. His thesis is that sexuality can and should flourish without unnecessary interference from morality, which according to him was invented by stupid Christians in about 1400. Foucault is not aware of the immense amount of evidence that ancient civilizations had moral systems just as strict as the Jews or Christians. (For instance, in the 42 laws of Ma-At, the ancient Egyptian goddess of Justice, adultery, fornication, impurity and polluting yourself are all listed as sins, thousands of years BC.) He completely disregards all the possible outcomes of any sort of behaviour even in the immediate, let alone the longer-term, wider social context. If the rape of the Sabines was fun and guilt-free for the rapists, Foucault thinks that was just fine. He knows nothing about women and gives them little attention, focussing mainly on male homosexuality which he refuses to define as distinct from heterosexuality. That is a denial that verges on the psychotic. It is just ignoring all the evidence from biology, anatomy and evolution. Sexuality has its roots in procreation and to deny that is just stupid. Foucault was a homosexual with obvious pederastic tendencies, who dies of AIDS, and he seems to have written this book to console himself. Incredibly he is regarded with reverence by the left wing. I would call him a pseudo-intellectual."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"i saw a pretty woman in a nun's habit once and i had an overwhelming desire to have sexual relations with her, and i felt guilty thereafter for my desire in the same way i would feel guilty for desiring to have sexual relations with my mother. understandably, these were desires i wanted to keep secret, until I read freud and learned about the incest taboo put in place to control normal incestuous desires prevalent in most societies and cultures.foucault credits freud for \`placing sex at one of the critical points marked out for it since the eighteenth century by the strategies of knowledge and power, how wonderfully effective he was ... in giving a new impetus to the secular injunction to study sex and transform it into discourse.'a discourse foucault charts historically for a sexuality that functioned since the seventeenth century paradoxically as secret and a disclosure. even in the twenty first century when many people speak of sexuality they speak of repression and of the authorities in power in social institutions who do the repressing. foucault writes of a sexuality of obsession and how that obsession became discourse, first in the confessional booth of the catholic church where the confessor was urged to tell everything sexual and how later sexual confession was picked up by confessional writers, in particular the marquis de sade and the anonymous author of \`my secret life'; and following was \`a multiplication of discourses concerning sex in the field of exercise of power itself: an institutional incitement to speak about it, and to do so more and more ... toward the beginning of the eighteenth century, there emerged a political, economic, and technical incitement to talk about sex ... . sex was not something one simply judged; it was a thing one administered ... .'it was administered in discussions for population control, the architecture of school space and sex education, and, within the family, as normative sexual relations -- and the sexual relations, outside the norm, were heard and discussed as perverse by mental institutional workers, and sexual transgressions were relegated to discourses of civil law. those in power had sexual knowledge, and the powerless had silence about sex, secrets about which they were incited to talk. once the secrets were revealed they could be corrected, regulated and proscribed.something else about my own confession: a few days later I saw the woman in the nun's habit again, on stage as part of a theatre production."},{"Title":"The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1: An Introduction","review":"It would be easy to consider this book part and parcel of the literature on sexuality but that would be very reductive. In the Will to Knowledge, sexuality is a mere example of Foucault's archeology of knowledge. It is the new bourgoise pre-empting the inevitable by engendering sexuality as a field of knowledge only to regulate, discipline and control the manner in which it is consumed, talked about and propagated. Sexuality was not silenced nor repressed, it was invented in the Victorian era along with new rationalities pertaining to it. Compared with the second volume of the history of sexuality, &quot;the use of pleasure&quot;, it is easy to decipher the problematization of sexuality that occured in the 19th century concering sexual idenitites, queerness, gender and conseuqntly the whole social fiber. Foucault once again lends credence to the power of discourse to color reality almost irreversibly."},{"Title":"G Is for Grand Canyon : An Arizona Alphabet (Alphabet Series)","review":"As a former educator and current author, I really enjoyed this book. There is so much you can do with the 2 tiered writing style in teaching kids. This approach lets the book grow with your child. The pictures, by Katherine Larson, are filled with great details too.

But just about everything described in this book has happened for real since it was written.First the Iranians attack the USS Makin Island with a devastating bombing that almost sinks the ship (can you say USS Cole). The United States retaliates with an attack on Iran's main oil depot at Kharg Island (cruise missiles and high technology weapons). The Iranians respond with a command attack on a major oil pumping station in the United Arab Emirates, and then go one step further. They decide it is time to take the war to the United states and target the President. A small dedicated terrorist group penetrates America and slips behind the barrier of missiles, ships and planes defending the country (it is a 9-11 style attack except with commandos).Through it all defense analyse Rich Welsh suspects the truth and tries to get somebody to listen. (I suspect he has a few real life aanalogues who saw the coming storm, but whose warnings went unheeded.) The Welsh character conveys the author's feelings about structural problems that plague the Marines and the Pentagon mentality.This is a well written and well paced book. Get a copy today, this guy deserves a better sales ranking!"},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"Although superficially like scores of other apocalypse-touting espionage thrillers, this book has two unusual strengths. Firstly, the sheer plausibility of the terrorists plots: Christie, a former Marines officer himself, has clearly thought hard about how to wage war against the world's sole remaining superpower, and has effectively written a manual on just how to go about it, while at the same time keeping the story moving along sharply without getting bogged down in tedious technical detail.Secondly, he refuses all temptation to demonise the Iranians, but draws a clear picture of their motivations. Indeed, he often seems to have more sympathy with them, outnumbered and outgunned as they are, and yet resourceful, determined and daring to the point of heroism, than he does with his over-complacent countrymen."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"AWESOME! I actually bought this for $1 in a hardware store, thinking it was gonna be junk! Non-stop action and a REAL believable story. The shootout at the end in the White House was insane!This is a book that HAS TO be made into a movie."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"After Iranian commandos sink a US warship in the Persian Gulf, the US retaliates by destroying the facilities on Kharg Island, vital to Iran's oil industry. Rather than risk a head on confrontation with the vastly more powerful US military, the Iranians seek their revenge on US soil. A daring planned is conceived, using commandos and suicide bombers, to first strike the marine base at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and then launch an attack on the White House to kill the president. The rest of the story unfolds with the perfect combination of action, exposition, and characters. In a genre where it's easy to resort to the use of cliched stock characters, this book offers characters with depth, particularly the Iranians. Instead of portraying them as nothing more than religious fanatics, the author does an excellent job of explaining their tactics from their perspective. Add to this the chillingly plausible, relatively low tech methods of attack and you've got a real page-turner."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"The Warriors of God is a superb thriller. The hardcover edition is only 255 pages, so it's pretty short. But then, unlike most authors, William Christie does not load his books with repetitive and overlong action scenes, subplots that go nowhere, and loads of technical or background information. From beginning to end, the story flows smoothly and unhindered.The novel depicts an an undeclared war between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States. Beginning with an Iranian-sponsored terrorist attack on a US Navy ship and the US's resultant cruise missile strike against Iran. An Iranian terrorist force is then sent to the US to launch attacks against the US Marines Camp Lejune and, finally, the White House. The narrative follows events from both the perspective of the Iranians as they prepare and carry out their missions, and the men and women of various branches of US military and law enforcement. The central character is a former Marine now working at the Pentagon as a civilian. He's sort of like Jack Ryan, except he's not a flawless superhero.The books provides great detail on how state-sponsored terrorists go about planning and carrying out their attacks, as well as into the operations and procedures of elite units like the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and SEAL Team Six.This is a really great thriller, and it's too bad it never became a big hit. Vince Flynn most likely read it, as his novel Transfer of Power revolves around a similar siege on the White House. Also worth checking out are William Christie's more recent novels, \\"The Enemy Inside\\" and \\"Threat Level.\\" These also deal with terrorism and special operations, but are set within the Global War on Terror, and are far grittier and realistic than anything Flynn or Thor have written."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"This turned out to be a very exciting book.The book begins witha bang when Iranian Commandos sink an American shipin the Persian Gulf.There is much loss of American life as a result of the sinking.The Americans retaliate by bombing the Iranian oilproduction facilities on Karg Island.Iran decides to gain vengance by sending a well trained team of commandos into America to attack the Marine base at Camp LeJuene and to commit the ultimate act of terror by assassinating the President of theUnited States.The only person who percieves a threat from Iran isa Department of Defense aid named Welsh.The book is fast paced and very action packed.You will find it hard to put this book down Read it and you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"Really points out the weakness of our coutry to an organizedterrorist attack.I am looking fo more from this author"},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"If you have ever put up with mickey mouse bull in the military, or been horrified at the actions of politicians, you will feel right at home with this book."},{"Title":"The Warriors of God","review":"Bill,Excellent book, an edge of the seat read that I couldn't put down.

Armed with a roommate wanted ad she is sent to the home of stay-at-home writer Laura Taylor, by a friend of Laura's. Moved in while Laura was out, Laura returns home where she, much to her dismay, soon discovers her new roommate has a few not so agreeable habits. Not certain they can be compatible, Laura nevertheless agrees to let Crystal stay...on a trial basis.The weeks pass and the two women begin to sort through the many differences they have, the biggest one being Crystal is straight and Laura is a lesbian. When Laura discovers Crystal seems to be suffering from nightmares, she begins to suspect that something terrible must have happened to Crystal in her past. Bad enough it seems, that it causes Crystal horrible nightmares? As they begin forming a tentative friendship, Laura broaches the subject of Crystal talking to someone - professionally - about her nightmares. Crystal picks Laura's ex-lover Jenny, who is a therapist and still Laura's friend, and Laura finds herself experiencing feelings of frustration and just a touch of jealousy. Why?More time passes and Laura and Crystal begin to discover that feelings of friendship are turning into feelings of a different type. Will Laura, once convinced she was meant to be alone, allow herself to explore these new feelings? Can she help Crystal overcome the traumas of her past and show her that she is worthy of being loved? Will Crystal let herself love and be loved in return?Verda Foster and B.L. Miller, each an extremely talented writer in their own right, co-author well together as displayed in both Crystal's Heart and their other co-written, wonderfully intriguing book - Graceful Waters. And B.L's co-authorship with Verda's sister Vada, of the bold and endearing book - The Western Chronicles also denotes an outstanding ability to write well in collaboration. Come along as both Verda and BL take the reader on a tremendous journey experiencing the characters' feelings of life, love, loss, drama, and heartbreak. Verda's terrific solo works - The Gift and These Dreams, and B.L.'s wonderful book - Accidental Love, prove that both writers are also equally adept in their individual efforts."},{"Title":"Crystal's Heart","review":"Crystal Sheridan is the victim of child abuse - actively by her physically abusive father and passively by her alcoholic mother.

Her realtor friend (and resident matchmaker) rents her spare room to Crystal.Opposites in almost every way, Crystal and Laura learn to understand each other and help each other start to heal with the help of Jenny, Laura's ex and a psychiatrist who specializes in abuse cases.As with most by B.L.Miller and Verda Foster, solo or as a team, this is a very good book. It is thought-provoking, well-written, and hard to put down."},{"Title":"Crystal's Heart","review":"Excellent Story and to me it seemed to cover all the bases on recovery and finding love. Unlike other books that gloss over the hard topics that are covered here, this book takes you through the rollar coaster that Samantha and Laura are going through. You will love humor that Lauras friends bring as you can see any group of lesbians acting as they do. You will be rooting for these two women and love the romance and you actually wonder at times if they will get together. The thoughts that were going through these two women made perfect sense and you could 'feel' the turmoil both were going through.As was stated by another reviewer I would love for the authors to do a story on Jenny. As soon as I was done with this book I wanted to read a sequal to see how Samantha was doing in her recovery and to see how she was growing."},{"Title":"Crystal's Heart","review":"This novel is a winner from start to finish. It deals with weightier subjects than the usual romance novel (child abuse, drug abuse, incest, adultery, prostitution) but at it's heart it is a wonderful romance. It also has wonderful humor laced throughout. Many times in the book I wanted to reach out and hug Crystal as she struggled to make a life for herself in a better place (physically and later emotionally). Her new roommate and new friend Laura was a complete rock of support the whole time. It was interesting to watch Crystal becoming supportive of Laura when she needed Crystal.I hope the authors revisit Jenny some day - she is a very interesting person and deserves good things to come her way.I have read this novel many times and it is on the top shelf of my bookcase to read again."},{"Title":"Crystal's Heart","review":"I can't say enough good things about Crystal's Heart.

She ran away from an abusive home when she was fifteen, ten years before. She lived alone in a seedy run down apartment, that is until she accidentally caused a fire and it burned down one night. After spending the rest of the night in her car, she goes apartment hunting. For the money she can afford, she is offered a chance of sharing an apartment with lesbian author, Laura Taylor. It's actually Laura's friend Peter, that rents the place to Crystal in Laura's absence. When Laura returns to her home and meets Crystal, she is horrified. The two roomies are as different as night and day. Crystal drinks, smokes and does drugs, to say nothing of her stripping job and is an untidy slob. Laura on the other hand, hardly drinks, abhors drugs and is also an obsessive neat freak. How are the two women going to exist living together? Time elapses and both women find themselves becoming more tolerant towards each other. Laura sees a vulnerability in Crystal that changes her outlook of the woman all together. She sets out to help Crystal overcome her fears. In helping Crystal, it also helps Laura overcome some of her own fears. It's not long before Laura begins to feel more for Crystal than just friendship. But Crystal is straight, isn't she? Also as the two women have nothing in common, will they even be able to become friends?I first read this book online a few years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed the book then. Both BL Miller and Verda Foster have covered some extremely sensitive topics brilliantly. Child abuse, drug and alcohol abuse, prostitution, and infidelity are just some of them .

Instead the title could have more accurately been \\"The Step-by-Step Therapist's Guide to Assertiveness.\\" The chapters are written in a dull, simplistic manner that encourages readers to get in touch with themselves. There is a little practical encouragement, but it's all stuff that you can hear every day from a counselor or pastor. It's no surprise then that the authors are a female social worker/counselor and a male psychologist/pastor.The book is written under a vague Christian theology that doesn't really deal with concrete issues--instead it just assumes we are all going to get along well together if we all act assertively.

The authors explain why Assertiveness is the best of these three options, hold up Jesus as the ultimate example of Assertiveness, and give practical advice for becoming more Assertive. The authors liberally use anecdotes and examples to illustrate their points, making this book an easy read. However, although the information is laid out simply, the material itself is certainly not simplistic. Kock and Haugk know their subject matter well, they have a good understanding of Christian theology, and they are prove able to teach the material in an understandable and engaging way.Although this book is intended for Christians going through Stephen Ministry training, you don't need to be either a Stephen Minister or a Christian to benefit from \\"Speaking the Truth in Love.\\" I, personally, am not going through the Stephen Ministry program and found the book highly beneficial; Jesus is treated more as a historical figure to emulate rather than True God and True Man. It should also be mentioned that, while other similar books tend to assume the reader is Passive, this book strikes a balance between addressing a Passive reader and an Aggressive reader.In all, \\"Speaking the Truth\\" is highly recommended.

Being able to say no is your right as a human being, especially if you know doing something is going to leave us stressed or tired. Not only that, but the book succinctly demonstrates the differences between being assertive, aggressive, and passive agressive.

As well, few recognize that Mother Teresa, astronaut William Georgry, actor John Belushi and Dr. Ferid Murad, Nobel Laureate in medicine for his work in the development of Viagra, are all of Albanian heritage.Even today Albania remains one of the least-known European countries since it was isolated by post-war Communism until 1991. Books on Albania in the English language are scarce, an issue which American-born Albanian Lou Giaffo seeks to remedy in this engaging but limited book.Giaffo writes Albanian history from 1500 B.C. to modern times without the drab, cumbersome academic prose that one often finds in histories. He has a fresh writing style that keeps the reader engaged.However, there are significant weaknesses in this work. Most Albanians who I spoke with cite four events in the last 60 years that significantly shaped Albania: Communism/Hoxha 1945, the Religious Purge 1967, the fall of Communism 1991 and the Pyramid Scheme 1997. Giaffo does an ample job covering the first and third of these critical historical events, but he failed to include the second and fourth. For a historical text with a 1999 publish date, these are significant omissions, as is the absence of an index (unheard of in any serious historical text). It is my hope that Giaffo follows up and addresses these issues in a second edition. As a writer he is both engaging and informative, a wonderful combination for a writer of history.Conditionally Recommended"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Enjoyed reading this book, although it's not really based on the main characters of the first few books it's still a nice side story."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I loved this series! I am new to the Dragonriders of Pern series, and this book was wonderful. Full of imagination and excitement."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is a delightful book, one of Anne's extensive Dragon series, and one of my personal favorites. I discovered the two Dragonsinger books in the local library while I was recovering from a work injury and devoured them both in 48 hours.I bought both many years ago, and now have purchased them again as Kindle books.They are about a young and gifted girl and are ideal for young readers. I have just re-read them (again)in my 50s and still love them both."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A good way for adults or young-teen readers to begin their journey into the genre of fantasy or science fiction, Dragonsong is more the story of a girl trying to grow up in a world where she fails to meet the expectations of her people and the self-imposed exile that follows. The struggles of growing up and the difficulties in breaking the gender barrier fill the pages, with only a sprinkling of fantasy element to decorate them. We only catch a glimpse or two of dragons at the beginning of the book, and only meet them very near the end. Firelizards, which are basically miniature dragons, befriend Menolly and help her along her journey by keeping her company and providing a lightness to her situation.If you've never read a book about Pern before, it is a short and easy book to pick up and fall into. If you have started Anne McCaffrey's series but have felt you were missing out on the life of people in the hold and hall, this is a great, quick read that you must pick up. There may never be many beautifully descriptive draws to the story, as the emotional connections between the characters and their dragons or lizards are what the series counts on to pull the reader in, but to be honest, that's really all it needs. Anyone who has ever wanted to spend some time with a dragon will certainly enjoy this series."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern books. Come on - riding dragons! What's not to love? But my favorite McCaffrey books are actually the \\"Harper Hall Trilogy\\" books, \\"DragonSong,\\" \\"DragonSinger,\\" and \\"DragonDrums.\\" In this trilogy we meet Menolly, a musically gifted 15-year old girl growing up in an isolated community with rigid rules. She's put in charge of teaching children the traditional songs, but forbidden from making her own music. Over the course of the trilogy, we follow Menolly's journey as she runs away from home, gains self-confidence and independence, and is finally recognized for her talents. I returned to this trilogy over and over growing up, and it never failed to delight. If you're a fan of McCaffrey's works but haven't yet read these books, I highly recommend them.

It's not the first in the series, but a good entry point for a teen reader, as the main character is also a teen. I love the series! Another good reason for a start here is that there are no sexual references. Don't get me wrong, this is not a \\"sexy\\" series, but as in life, sex has a role. When the dragons mate, their mentally bonded riders do, too. None of that here, though, since dragons have only a passing role in this book.

My arthritic hands and eyes that don't focus as well as they used to would sure appreciate being able to download these wonderful books of yours.

I feel that I am wrapping a warm familiar old blanket around me and going far, far, away.(Loved reading the books but didn't like the CD narrator nor do I care much for the newer Pern books written by McCaffrey's son.)"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong is the first book of the Harper Hall Trilogy (Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, and Dragon Drums). Menolly, the daughter of Half-Circle Sea Holder, Yanus, is a tall, gawky teenager. Although she demonstrates outstanding musical talent her father is ashamed of her, because music and teaching are not proper roles for women. When he allows her to become physically disabled (thereby destroying any chance she may have had with music) she runs away. As she attempts to hide out from the searchers and the periodic threads which fall from the sky and burn all organic life, she discovers fire lizards, and saves some. During this time, the Harper Hall is frantically searching for the musical talent that is at Half-Circle, not knowing that they are really searching for a girl. When Menolly is saved from threadfall by dragons, she figures that the weyr (dragons' cave) is the place she should be because of her fire lizards (which resemble small dragons). Harper Hall finally realizes that Menolly is the true musical talent and she is coaxed into realizing her greatest desire... living, eating and breathing MUSIC!This is such a good book that I have read it and Dragonsinger numerous times. Anne McCaffrey does an excellent job of character building, even secondary characters have depth and touchableness. Pern is a world inhabited by humans, very similar to us in thoughts and actions but different in many ways, from the indigenous creatures to the food humans eat. Dragonsong is a book that you won't want to put down until you are finished and then you will want to immediately pick up and read Dragonsinger, which continues the story of Menolly. I wish Ms. McCaffrey would have continued the story of Menolly, but Dragon Drums takes one of the secondary characters and builds a story around him) This reviewer gives Dragonsinger a rating of 8 out of 10 stars."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read.

Once I went into high school, I bought it and have read it countless times since. The land of Pern is fantastic and I hope Ms. McCaffrey intends to keep teaching us about this world. Menolly is a great heroine and an inspiriation to keep dreaming. A note to people who feel this was unresolved, this was the first book of a trilogy know as the harper hall trillogy. Read Dragonsinger and DragonDrums, the two sequels, as well as the later Pern books like The White Dragon and All the Weyrs of Pern, which continue the story of Menolly, Master Robinton, and the other dragonriders, harpers, weyrleaders, holders, etc. It is a fantastic read for any SF-fantasy lover."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love this book and reread it often. My intro to Anne McCaffrey and I continued on into the Pern series from my start with the Harper Hall."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The first book in the Harper Hall trilogy by Anne McCaffery, Dragonsong remains one of my favorite fantasy books to reread when I get a chance.It tells the story of a young girl named Menolly, who wants nothing more than to be a Harper. There's a problem with this plan though: only boys can be Harpers and Half-Circle Sea Hold is horribly old fashioned.Stuck doing nothing but teaching the littlest the history of Pern, Menolly is banned from ever playing anything of her own creation because, in the eyes of her father and head of the hold, only a Harper can do that, and she is not one of them.After a fishing accident leaves her unable to use her left hand to play any instrument, Menolly leaves the hold on morning and finds herself stranded outside when the deadly threat of her world comes upon her: Thread. With the choice of either finding shelter or burning when the Thread touches her, Menolly happens upon a cave on the seacoast where she finds the eggs of a rare species-Fire Lizards-beginning to hatch. In an attempt to save them from the deadly Thread, she feeds them all, and finds herself with nine new friends who could do with some more to eat.Here starts the tale of Menolly living outside of the hold and on her own for the first time in her life. Living with the Lizards isn't easy though, and when Menolly finds herself outside of the safety of her cave during another Thread-fall, she nearly runs her feet to the bone before she is rescued by those who protect Pern from Thread as best they can: the Dragon Riders.Healed by the Dragon Riders, Menolly discovers that another guest of the Riders is none other than Masterharper Robinton himself, the head of the Harper's guild. At his request, Menolly joins the Harpers, all nine Fire Lizards in tow, as they journey off to the Guild hall to begin her education.While the story of \\"the youngest girl who doesn't fit in\\" might seem old to fans of fantasy now, McCaffery was actually one of the first to do it. Her world of Pern bound together the idea of fantasy dragons and space travel, though the sci-fi aspects of Pern aren't seen in this novel.I will likely be tarred and feathered for dare saying it, but some of the motivations of the characters left a bit to be desired, such as just why the Hold was so against Menolly singing her own songs or becoming a Harper. While it is explained by \\"no dishonor to the Hold\\", that explanation leaves me wondering just how a good singer/Harper could be a dishonor.The book is quite short as well, so it's a nice read if you're after something quick in between meetings or classes-or that is easy to hold up with one hand while you have a broken elbow!If you haven't read it, I suggest it. If you have, well, then you already know that it is worth the reread. I give it five out of five starts."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"After owning this book for 25 years, I FINALLY got around to reading it. What was I thinking back then? How could I have missed out on such an incredibly good book?Simple story-- teen girl is mistreated by family and community because of her talents, runs away, discovers dragons, finds people who appreciate her. The end.But WOW, McCaffrey proves why she is the master of the genre. Wonderfully written, well-told. I was up to 2 am reading it! Could not put it down!Thank you, Anne, for this adventure!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"A brief forward to the review: \\"Dragonsong\\" is the first book in Anne McCaffrey's Harper Hall trilogy. The series is generally catalogued as children's (at least in the nypl catalog) but is really for any readers. Like many of McCaffrey's novels, it's set in the world of Pern. I haven't read anything but this trilogy yet, but am pretty sure these novels (from the 1970s) operate as prequels to the other more adult oriented novels. Oh, and I absolutely loved the entire trilogy.On to the review:Menolly was born in the small fishing village of Half Circle Sea Hold on Pern. Despite her father's leadership position in the community, Menolly finds herself with very little freedom--especially freedom to make music, her one bliss. When Petiron, the village's old Harper, passes away Menolly's parents realize with some horror that their daughter is the only one who can take up the Harper's duties until a replacement is sent from the Harper Hall.Once this replacement arrives, Menolly is ordered to abandon her music (even in her head) on threat of physical harm in order to save her family and the hold from the scandal of having produced a girl Harper. Her hopes shattered, Menolly runs away from the hold and takes refuge in a beach cave where Menolly discovers a nest of the much sought after (and semi-mythical) fire lizards. After finding her new friends, things begin to look up for Menolly who realizes that anything is possible if you aren't afraid of going after what you want.There's more to the plot, of course, but all of that is better learned by reading the book instead of this review.\\"Dragonsong\\" is written in what I would call an understated style. McCaffrey isn't at pains to illustrate her talent as a writer--she knows she's good and has a story worth telling. Having never read about Pern, I wasn't sure what to expect. Despite a mildly confusing start, McCaffrey created a story here that functions as a standalone from the larger world of the Pern series. Furthermore, she also expertly builds up the landscapes and cities of Pern the better for readers to imagine them.The other thing that I really like about this story is that it has a fairly narrow focus. The novel centers on Menolly and her journey to the Harper Hall. There are a lot of stories out there about girls who are told they don't deserve much from life, or girls who think they can't do what they really want to do. In a way, Menolly has that problem--especially because of her parents. But she's more than that too. As the novel progresses, Menolly begins to realize with the help of her friends (fire lizard and otherwise) that she deserves better and that there is more to life than pleasing others.So, on the one hand we have a wonderfully written fantasy novel that is arguably the first word on Dragon stories in the genre. On the other hand we have the story of a girl finding her own way in the world as she discovers that she's a much stronger, smarter and more vibrant girl than her parents would have her believe."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I enjoy reading good books during my leisure time and I have just finishing reading Dragonsong. Dragonsong was an imaginative book written by a lady named Anne McCaffrey, showing the paths taken by a young girl named Menolly. It's amazing how the story gets more and more intense as you read chapter by chapter. Anne McCaffrey uses her imagination when Menolly actually kind of communicate with the fire lizards on a steep cliff in the story. Another one of the imaginative parts of the story is when she kind of talks to the Mother of the fire lizards, and through their conversation, she is able to save her and the fire lizards from an upcoming tide hitting the shore.Despite the many troubles Menolly encounters to fulfill her dream of becoming the new Harper, she comes through it all with the strong faith she has in herself. I believe this book would be an inspiration to those who love a book filled with imagination coming from the mind of Anne McCaffrey. I recommend this book to anyone who may happen to like reading a good book during their leisure time."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love reading fantasy books. A good book to read if you love fantasy is Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey. Dragonsong is an adventurous book that keeps your attention. It is at times a little hard to understand but worth reading if you love dragons and mystical places. Dragonsong was an adventurous book because of the things the characters get themselevs into. One of the more exciting events in Dragonsong would be the dangerous threadfall. Threadfall makes an exciting twist to the plot providing adventurous situations for the characters. Anne McCaffrey did a wonderful job of making Dragonsong an exciting and mystical book filled with adventure. Dragonsong was a good book that was written well. It had a good plot and a i would recomend it to people who like short fantasy books."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"DragonSong was written by Anne McCaffrey. She made the story very interesting.This book is an imaginative book filled with fasntasy and is fun to read. Dragonsong was a very interesting story because of the dragons and firelizards. It was interesting because of the way the dragons and firelizards were able to go &quot;between&quot;. The way the people of Pern used the dragons to kill the Thread was also interesting. Seeing how that was the fastest and best way to kill the Thread. The story in the book was unclear as to how the firelizards helped the people of Pern. Altogetherthis was an interesting story with intriguing characters. I enjoyed reading Dragonsong, because of how interesting it was. I think that it is a good book to read if your into fantasy,and mild si-fi,or if you like to read about dragons. This is a book for you. Dragonsong was very captivating towards the end of the story, and I encouage you to read this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The imaginative and sometimes complex story of Dragonsong is an involvong read. Dragonsong was a complex book in which the author introduced foreign and new fictional concepts. The entire story of Menolly is derived from the ongoing drama of a fictional land called Pern. The story is complex because it explains a twisted tale of a moon that sends deadly bacteria to Pern. The story goes on to describe how the dragon lizards were formed and why. The complexity continues with the ancient art of being a harpist, which is a singer of ancient story-songs that describe ancient times. The novel Dragonsong although imaginative was over all a complex and foreign story. I personally found it hard to believe and understand at all levels. Unless a person is intrigued by fantasy and the magic I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I happen to enjoy reading a good book. I am always ready to open one up and get into it as soon as possible. Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was an exciting book. Dragonsong was a book filled with excitement. The author adds many things that help fill it with excitement. For instance the threadfall provided much excitement with its deadly charactaristics. Therefore the author explains that the fierce dragons battle this deadly thread to maintain life on Pern. Menolly was almost killed by this treaturous thread and that experience was exciting enough to exemplify the the excitment of this book. I found this book to be very complicated yet hidden in all the complexities I found a very important moral and that was to never give up on what you truly love. This was a very good book but due to its complexity I recomend it to all high school students."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I love this book and recomend that you read the others.

Now, the good thing about this book, is it has things that are funny! And it's about Dragon riders too! I loved the details in the story, and you will too! The only thing I didn't like (which won't count for many), was when Menolly (the girl we're talking about) get a really icky cut.... but I've said too much!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I changed my mind. I wrote the review about it being boring. I red the end and I knind of liked it. The neginning was a total bore. I must admit that. But, it got very good. In fact I decided to read the whole Harper Hall Trilogy and liked that too. It's a good book. (Except for the beginning)"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I usually don't enjoy doing homework at all. When we were assigned to read this book, I thought the book Dragonsong by Anne McCaffrey was exciting, but unresolved. The book Dragonsong was very exciting. Especially when Menolly was outside of the hold during thread and she had to find protection. Also, when Elgion and Menolly were rescued and were in the same place but didn't realize it, that was exciting because you didn't know if they would figure it out. In another instance, Menolly cut her hand, and it was kind of intense until you find out that she won't lose her hand and she would be ok. Another example would be at the end of the book when Menolly got to play with the Harper, which she had wanted to do since the beginning. I felt that Dragonsong was unresolved also. The story was interesting, but it didn't seem finished at the end. I thought that Menolly was going to go back to the hold, and her family. It didn't sem like she had resolved things with her family which left me hanging. Also, it said something about Harper Elgion finally realizing who Menolly was, but he didn't do anything about ti. Another example about the dragon lizards, it didn't say what happened to them so it left me wondering. Also, Menolly cut her hand, then she said that it was ok, but I didn't know if there were any more side effects or problems concerning that. The whole story seemed like it needed another chapter to finsish the story line. I found that Dragonsong was a good book if you like mythical or imaginary stories. I enjoyed reading the book, but found it sort of confusing. I wouldn't say this is one of the best books I've read , but I think if a teenager enjoys fantasy books, they would enjoy Dragonsong."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This first volume of the Harper Hall Trilogy focuses on legendary fire lizards. Rukbat, a golden star in a far off universe, housed the habitable planet Pern. The story unfolds on Pern quickly. People and farm crops are being destroyed by spores from another planet. Menolly, a young farm girl sets out to both fit in and find individualism amongst her new found friends, the sailors. As the story unfolds we are privileged to her private thoughts as well as those of her counterparts. She becomes the center of attention, intrigue, and marvel when she sets out on an adventure whereby she is kidnapped and subsequently escapes. Her visions of the famed fire lizards, something every sailor has heard about but has yet to see, makes her unique among her peers thus giving her the undying adoration she so desires. Children of all ages, especially those in high school, will love this book for its intrigue and rapidly developing plot. The difficult names and syntax add an extra challenge for young adult readers."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Menoly is a lot like me. But that is only one reason I absolutely love this book. Menoly is in a spot of disfavor with the people who reside in the hold by the sea. She learned the harpers'craft from the ailing harper. When the harper dies, Menoly is forbidden to sing or make songs. Just to make matters worse, her hand is injured while gutting fish. Then, the lonely girl runs away, teaches fire lizards to sing, and proves that you don't need to be a boy to make songs."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Menolly lives in the world of Pern, a magical world where Dragons and their riders protect the people from the hazardous thread that falls from the sky. Menolly loves music and shows a powerful talent for it. Her voice is beautiful and she possesses perfect pitch. Her hands seem to be made to play instruments. She makes up tunes all of the time in her head, many which are considered extraordinary by the elderly Harper that trains her. But when the Harper dies and a new one comes to Menolly's hold she can no longer make music like she used to, just because she's female. Menolly's is devastated by this and takes solace in wandering outside of the Hold, away from her family and friends. Here she makes an amazing discovery, fire lizard. Fire Lizards are just like miniature dragons, although many people mistrust their existence. Menolly meets and befriends these fire lizards, forming a strong bond with them. But in the world of Pern, where the thread falls everyday, Menolly's peaceful existence will be disturbed.Ever since I started reading fantasy, people told me that Anne McCaffrey was an author that I needed to get into, especially her Pern novels. I'm very glad that they recommended this to me. This is a fun adventure book. It moves quite quickly and if filled with action and suspense. The character of Menolly is quite easy to relate to. She's so talented yet because of things she can't control, she's not allowed to display her talents. She's quite easy to sympathize with. While this book is often found in the adult fantasy section, while reading it over I almost believe that it was written for a more YA or younger audience. Some of the characters are a bit shallow and I wished that the book was longer so I could get to know them more. from the little info we're told about them they sure seem like interesting characters! I guess we'll learn more about them in Dragonsinger, and Dragondrums, the two other books in the series. This is the first Pern novel I've read and I would recommend it to fans of fantasy, especially fans of dragons."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I checked out Dragonsinger on accident, not knowing it was the second book.

She's a very strong independent girl, and you can really understand how she's feeling. McCaffrey does a wonderful job with this book.Dragonsong is a fast read, adventurous, exciting. The only catch is that it's not thought provoking at all. So if you're looking for something that will make you think, don't read this. Otherwise, go for it! It's a great book.If you do like it, I would advise you to read Dragonsinger and Dragondrums, the other two in this triplet.

She has many adventures. She discovers and help a group of fire lizards(smaller versions of dragos).This book has a predictable plot and ending.

My dad recomended it to me, and I put him down.A few months later I found it hidden in the corner of our local library. I am obsessed with anything fantasy/sci-fi and books. So obviously, I picked it up and started to read it. I took it home and finished it with in 1 - 2 days of getting it. I was mesmerized, and I couldn't put it down.I was amazed that even though this isn't the first book in the series, and I had absolutly no clue what it was about, I understood almost everything about the dragons and Impression and everything like that. It's very easy to understand, comprehend, and you'll soon find yourself loving the book and it's characters.Overall, I loved it, it's fun and easy reading, but I wouldn't recommend it to little children, and most pre-teens. I'm 12 myself and read it 2 years ago, but I was only alowd to read it because my dad screened it. I would recommend that if your child wants to read it.Even though this book has good info in it, I would recommend reading the the first books of the series first."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"In dragonsong Mellony is a seaholder with a mind for music. But when her hand was injured and her hopes lost she finds the legandary fire lizards that make the story exciting and dreamlike. Kids of all ages from 8 & up should read this for a wild adventure"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I've always been fond of fantasy and Anne McCaffery's series Pern. Even if you have nothing much in common with the characters, you are drawn into a relationship with them. Empathizing with them in all their trials, tribulations and joys. I just can't put this book down even though I've read it so often."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Ann McCaffrey has a way of writing so her world intrudes into ours. I swear, when traveling I see dragons sweeping the mountain passes, and hear the fire lizards chattering."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"It will show you the most graphic encounter of the mighty dragons and the deadly spores but this book will also show you one girls struggle to find a way to have and use her abilities to make music and her kindness toward the fire lizards. This book made me want to read the whole triology to be back to pern and expierence the likenesses of the planet and ours. This book is one that I will recommend to readers that love sci-fi books. Anne McCaffrey is a genius as to her extensive description of the world of pern and all that surrounds it she has added so much detail that it makes you feel like you are in the world of pern an that you will be helping the dragonriders. This story tells of truimph and hard work to achieve your dream and has a hidden moral if you love something don't ever let it go because if you stay with it, it will help you in many ways more than you think. Menolly has taught me to love the things that I like to do and if I really work hard to get them I will receive for my efforts and my sacrafces will bring fortune. So if you do have a chance to read it I hope you will have the same feelings I did about the book."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This is the beginning story of a great trilogy!! I think that it's a great story of a girl who wishes she could be something she can't, and then in the end making her wish come true. Another fine work by Anne McCaffrey!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I loved this book! It was the second Anne McCaffrey book that I had rread, and it was wonderful. Menolly is such a dynamic character, and the book is well worth the time it takes to read to meet her. A warning though...once you start this series, you will have to finish it to the very end!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I have truly enjoy the books: Dragonsong, Dragonsinger, and Dragondrums. I love them because Anne makes her books sound so real, even if it has nothing in commain to our planet, Earth. I also like the books because the mighty dragon is my favorite animal. The only problem is that the last book left you hanging, I wish their was a 4th book. I would like to thank Anne for the joy she has given me by writing her books. Thank you and may God smile on you always."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The book took me forever to read! But I still finished it and loved it! I am now on the second book DragonSinger. Menolly is kind of like me and kind of not like me. I would suggest it to any one who likes Science fiction. But you should be a good reader and enjoy reading if you consider to read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This was the first book I've read by Anne McCaffrey, and I loved it. That led to reading every single other bit of Anne McCaffrey's stuff that I could get my hands on. I've since read around 12 of her books. Menolly's character is wonderful, and her struggle to be who she is, not who she's wanted to be, is delightful. A must read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Menolly is just like me when I was young. But Iwanted to act, not tune. I would of done anything to act. Just like menolly wanted to become a harper and was willing to do anything to do so. This is a book that everyone should read! It's a must!!! It's a winner to me and my whole class!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I have read this trilogy about a dozen times. Whenever I need a short vacation, Menolly's story is just the ticket. Her love of music, denied by her hidebound father - her love for the Fire Lizards, expressed at impression and in song, her redemption from a self-imposed exile into a more tolerant society, all serve to entertain, inspire and cleanse. I too, a 44 year old male, cry when Masterharper Robinton offers Menolly his gitar (that's how they spell it) and then wisks her away to... but that would be telling... read the book. If you are not too jaded, I am sure you will grow to appreciate even love this story as much as I have. I found the second book to be a great romp through music. The third book, while good, is not perfect as are its elder sisters. JRB"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Menolly is good discribed character that faces the challanges of everyday life on Pern. The Thread is almost the same as acid rain only more distructive. That is why I love the the book Dragonsong."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The students from California who make up a large portion of the reviews claim this book is confusing. To tell the truth, I have never found this particular Pern book confusing. The plot to me is fairly straightforward, but that is only my opinion, a am a fantasy fan and do a lot of that kinmd of reding, maybe my brain is attuned to this predictable happy-ending style! To those students: they were lucky to read such a popular book. I haven't progressed past Brian's winter and Ella Enchanted, both really are good books but not as good as DragonSong."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's nothing like a good fantasy book, and Dragonsong was good. Very good. Menolly is so well realised, her story is beautifully expressed. The plot is enthralling, I could barely put it down. It is imaginative, magical and truly awe-inspiring. Read it."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This book is a very thrilling. Its only good to people who like fic-fan. My favorite part is the ending when Menolly goes to the Harper Hall."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Must admit, I heartily DISAGREE with the &quot;the anonymous_12&quot; person. For one thing, if he/she is going to write a review of a book, please, learn to spell. The book was NOT boring. I guess Anon_12 has never NOT been allowed to do something that was in intregal part of his/her being, and just how far someone will go to be able to just BE, as Menolly did.. Oh well. &quot;With age comes wisdom&quot; might apply to that harsh review of Anon_12."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This was the first book of the series that I read and i loved it. I went to the library the next day and got Dragonsinger, Dragondrums, all the weyrs of pern and dolphins of pern. IT is great how the next book(dragonsinger) carries on right where this one left off."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I first picked this book up in class, not for an assignment but due to boredom. I found the plot and the characterization excellent. I read it in three hours! As soon as I could I went to the local bookstore and purchased the rest of the trilogy. Upon finding out how many Pernese novels there were I was ecstatic. Over the next month or two I bought all of the series and await all her new ones eagerly. I find that these are some of the few books that I can read over and over and never loose intrest in. Pern has become a real place to me and the characters are like good friends. I encourage anyone who read and enjoyed DragonSong to go purchase the rest of this fantastic series!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think that in some ways, this book was very realistic compared to some teenagers lives.It is well-written, original, and AWESOME! I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"i REALLy got into this book, and finished it in less than 2 days...this is the only 'PERN' book ive read and i know there are about a billion of em... and once i know the names of the other books i'll read them to...."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"I think this is one of the best fictional books I've ever read. I love all of the characters and I especailly loved it when they talked about the dragons and fire lizards. This book is well written, has good descriptions, and is very entertaining. I couldn't wait to read on, and had to read it all in one day. There were a few holes in the plost and a few things that didn't quite make sense, but besides that a great fictional book. I loved how creative Anne McCaffrey is. This is the first book of hers I read."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"What is wrong with those people out there? You say that this book is imaginative and good, and then you proceed to say that high-schoolers should read it. Then, you give it one or two stars. While this book is not a must read, it is interesting and quite good. I don't think that it is boring.By the way, why do several review say the exact same thing but say that the location is different?"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This was the first Anne McCaffery book I'd ever read and after I became a loyal reader. I picked it up used and finished it the same day. I admit I cried. Even though I don't usually read books of this age level I enjoyed it and soon started to read the Dragonriders of Pern."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"When I read this book, I was thinking that it would never become my favorite. But I found that I was smiling and laughing at good parts, and enjoying the firelizard stories. I actually felt for Menolly, and all the other characters. (except for Yanus.)"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"this was a skathic book, although it wasnt too exiting i could never seem to put it down. so get this book and read the 2 after it also...Dragonsong is about this girl named menolly who is forbidden to play music by her parents(who don't seem to care about her at all) . Menolly, discouraged, leaves half circle hold and rediscovers the legendary fire lizards and impresses them with her music who help to save her world."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"This was the first Anne McCaffery book that I read.We read it at school and it was like no book I'd ever read before. I laughed.I cried.It was great!"},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"Dragonsong/singer has become one of my favorite books of all time. No matter how many times I read it, I still feel excited every time I read about Menolly impressing the fire lizards."},{"Title":"Dragonsong","review":"The way anne has created her characters and thrown them into thier plots is unbelieveable. I am a fan of the dragonriders trilogy but these two books are my personal favorites from a lifetime of reading. No other books have ever captured my attention so throughly time and time again. I must say High Praise for the Dragonlady...:)"}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],z={key:0},W={key:1};function j(n,e,s,u,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(p,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),w(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",z,"See more"))],8,q)):b("",!0)])}const C=c(A,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-0f66759c"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/15.md","filePath":"quotes/15.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/15.md"},N=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(C)]))}});export{P as __pageData,N as default};
