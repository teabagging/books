The reason is because I didn't find any interest in it at all. But after seeing the movie and finding it very interesting, I wanted to read the first book to see what it was like. And I must confess, I found the world of Harry Potter to be rather fun!Ever since he could remember, Harry Potter had been living with his awful Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and abominable cousin Dudley. He cannot remember his parents and does not know how he came about having the strange lightening scar on his forehead. Then surprisingly, on his 10th birthday, he finds out from the giant Hagrid that he is really a wizard! And not only that, he is now being offered to be enrolled into Hogwarts School of Wizardry, a very distinguished and best school. There, Harry makes friends Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger and begins to learn the art of wizardry. But something is amiss, something that concerns a mysterious trapdoor guarded by a terrible three-headed dog. And that something has something to do with Voldemort, the evil wizard, and... the sorcerer's stone.A totally enchanting book, it's one of the best fantasies I've ever read. J.K. Rowling has made up a world of imagination you could never dream of. Parents who are worried about the books involving wizardry should be warned though in this way. If children cannot understand that there is a difference between reality and fiction, imaginary places, and magic, I suggest that they should know that. Other than that, I think it's fun for kids to read, mostly around the ages of 8 and or older. I cannot say anything about the other books in the series though because I have yet to read them.But I have to agree with some people who said that the Harry Potter series aren't the best. &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; are so far the best fantasies ever written of its kind though these books are mostly recommended to older kids and adults. Another series that draws greater attention for all ages are the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C.S. Lewis (by the way, writer J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were the greatest of friends!). So if you have enjoyed the Harry Potter books, I greatly recommend all books by J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter And the Sorcerer's Stone is about a wizard boy who lives with his muggle relatives.(Aunt&amp;Uncle) When he finds out that he is a wizard he gets transfered to Hogwarts School for wizards and witches. Harry has lots of fun and adventures,but gets into a lot of trouble. He plays a sport called Quidditch. Its when your on a broom and you have to hit four different balls and capture the snitch. Harry Potter is a great book. I'm sure many kids will enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The only reason this should be a children's book is because the syntax and words are very simple (even though they're confusing due to word order sometimes, but that may just be because it's by a British author). I found some of the messages inappropriate for children. Overweight people are made fun of and likened to pigs. Even the password for the portrait of the &quot;Fat Lady&quot; is &quot;pig snout.&quot; Kids can understand Dudley is a negative character without having to make him grossly obese. Rowlings, it's imagery like this that prompts kidergarten children to say they'd rather be crippled than overweight. Yes, this is what a survey found. Makes me feel sorry for all of the overweight readers of this book.Secondly, Rowlings thinks it's acceptable for people to kick cats just because they don't like cats. Maybe Rowlings has a thing against cats because she says Hagrid is allergic to them, and students (Ron, specifically) want to kick Filch's cat, and we're supposed to find this funny. I wasn't particularly amused, and this is a VERY negative idea to teach children.Thirdly, why is the ONE female child portrayed in a negative light, and we are made to think Harry and Ron have a right to dislike her? She is right when she tells them they should obey the rules and have regard for Gryffindor, but they tell her to mind her own business and to go away. Hermoine is very intelligent, can think logically, and studies well, and we are supposed to see her as a &quot;nag&quot; and a &quot;know it all.&quot; How nice. Hermoine becomes the boys' friend because they rescue her from a troll while she cowers against a wall in the bathroom. They don't treat her kindly because of who she is, but because of a shared dangerous experience. Smart girls out there, better throw yourselves in front of cars if you want to make friends...Overall, Harry and Ron have NO negative traits (the book tries to get across, anyway), and Hermoine is an annoying, condescending teacher's pet. Thank you, Rowlings, for further discouraging girls from trying to excel academically.Also, Harry is very bland, and Hermoine tells HIM that HE'S the better wizard because there are things more important than tricks and cleverness. Um, like what? HERMOINE got Harry to the last room under the castle. Harry was a dead blank with the logic puzzle, and all his skills are innate (flying, skin that burns monsters, you know, the usual). He didn't earn any of his talents, which is okay for fantasy's sake, but he doesn't have a kind personality to make us sympathize with and root for him. He talks about hating people, is vindictive, and never displays any sort of depth in the least. He gets sad when he thinks of his dead parents--not very deep. For all the development of Harry Potter, he might as well have been a supporting character. Rowling's tries to make him interesting by describing his past, but that still doesn't make his personality (or lack thereof) interesting. All we can really conclude is he is brave and misses his parents. And I REALLY do not appreciate the kids telling eachother to &quot;shut up&quot; all the time. I don't say this in front of my kid, and I certainly won't read it aloud from a book.Maybe things are supposed to be this simple because it's a children's book, and in that case, I don't see why anyone with above a high-school education gets all worked up over Harry Potter. The movie made the characters more loveable than the book, and the book painted some very negative images. I bought it to read to my daughter, but I won't be doing so now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As soon as i opened the book i couldnt stop reading.

Millions of readers have gone wild over Harry Potter and his magical friends, and I am proud say I am one of them.The Harry Potter series is a excellent series because all of the books grab the readers attention straight away and have made me feel like a witch. All the characters are respectivaly different. Harry's two best friends, Hermione and Ron, and who could forget Draco Malfoy? The sinister Slytherin who absolutely detests Harry and his friends.It's so hard to choose a favorite character, they're all so brilliant! This book is marvelous! J.K.

To share a grand adventure of a young boy, and create some lasting moments in time -- as you and your children sit down and read together.The book, for what it's worth, is completely enthralling. It's an adventure that's sure to keep both you and your children entertained for hours. And there are two others (three on July 8) in this series to ensure the adventure continues for a long time.So I urge you to pick up a copy of this book, and start creating happy childhood memories tonight.P.S. This book is fabulously addictive for adults as well -- you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"hi, my name is matthew, i'm 21 years old, one of my favorite bands is korn, and i love harry potter ('hi matthew')...i know most of you people who have never read harry potter don't know what to think so it is my job to tell you.

For once I was not disappointed by the hype. Although this book is very simple minded it still intrests adults because of how well crafted and magical it is.I think that is what appealed to me the most about this story is how vivid the descriptions were and how much they made me want to see all these places. To bad Hogwarts doesn't really exist I would love to see it.I loved all the magical beasts, the creation of the specail sport quiditch. I commend Rowling on how she has created this world without going overboard. She uses her charcters to keep the book grounded in reality. Harry, Ron, and Hermoine suffer through all the anxieties of school and life, of course it is wizard school but it still seems real. The other way she grounds her story is to show the Muggle world and how charcters live differently in it.The one complaint I do have is that everything seems to black and white. The lines between good and evil are to clearly draw, there is very little grey. However, I think that is because this book is written for a younger audience. On the whole this is a really good book and well worth the read no matter what your age is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was the best book I have ever read.

As a lifelong reader, Harry Potter's first adventure has joined a select list of my personal childhood favorites: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; James and the Giant Peach; Charlotte's Web; and my all-time favorite, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Even though I was 37 when I met Harry Potter, that part of my brain that's still 10 went crazy! Needless to say, I immediately ordered all the sequels; there's no price too high to become a child again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had already READ the Sorcerer's Stone, so I thought I knew the plot line and the overall story. However, listening to the book is a very different experience than reading the book. For one, there are those &quot;proper&quot; English pronounciations that my eye interpreted differently for my ear (It's not &quot;Hay-grid&quot;, but &quot;Hah-grid&quot;), and the audio corrected. Secondly, Dale's interpretation of Hermione's voice also gave me a different slant on her, as it did on other characters. He often had characters say Harry's name &quot;Ha-reeeeeeeee&quot;, which somehow came across as much more British than my American idea of how to address him. It is through listening to the audiobook that you begin to appreciate how these books are perhaps slightly to certainly better when read aloud, especially with a masterful story-teller like Dale. I happened to like Chamber of Secrets better (both print and audio) than Socerer's Stone, but part of that could be that the first book spends a lot of time setting the stage and introducing the characters. The real action comes later. Still, Dale seemed to enjoy reading the second book better than the first. OVerall, I recommend that you get the audiobook and add it to your ever-growing Potter library. Better to buy the tape than the ensuing paraphrenalia that will soon be robbing our wallets. Dale IS truly Jim Dandy in his character portrayals!Oh, if long car trip is in your future and you don't plan to get there by magic, listen to the audiotape to while away the time!

For the series as a whole, five stars can easily be given. However, this book represents the beginning of Rowling's work and the beginning of her magic, which only improves as the series goes on.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the beginning of a magical journey where a young boy, abused and neglected by his aunt and uncle, with whom he has lived since his parents were murdered by the brutal Dark Lord Voldemort when he was an infant. Harry has grown without friends, yet he has often been flummoxed by the amount of attention he seems to get in some spheres of public.Harry eventually learns that his parents belonged to the wizarding world, hidden from the non-wizard Muggles, and he is rescued from his abusive relatives by the half-giant Hagrid, who would later become one of Harry's best friends. Taken into the wizarding world, Harry discovers not only the magic of everyday life but the lessons of friendship and the presence of evil. Harry is stunned to learn that he is, perhaps, the most famous wizard of his time upon his enrollment in the wizarding school Hogwarts, as he was the only known survivor of the Avada Kedavra death curse, which killed his parents but rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, ripping him from his body when he tried to kill Harry.Friendships are formed and rivalries are developed that last the entirety of the series. If you haven't read Harry Potter, do so quickly, for you will soon be anticipating your letter to Hogwarts along with the rest of us!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about Harry before he finds out that he's a wizard. This is his first year at Hogwarts and I think that Harry learns a lot more about his past than any of the other books because it's the start of Harry Potter as a wizard and since it's the first book in the 7-book series, we find out what Harry is like. Throughout the books, Harry learns a lot about himself, but I don't think he's ever been more shocked and surprised at his past before in his life because he didn't know the truth about his past."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, (I don't really know how to spell it), was an amazing book. I have read the Harry Potter series twice and this book is by far the best one. Every time I read it, I enter the magical yet practical world of Harry Potter. J. K. Rowling is really a genius.I believe that this would be the best choice to read because it is, in fact, the 1st book of the series. I like it because it shows you how even in times where you feel unloved, miracles DO occur.This book was awesome. I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recently read this book to my young nieces, who are in Kindergarten and the second grade. And, of course, I read the book when it first came out as well :)Let me tell you, it has been years since I read HP1. I mean, *years*, so it was all-in-all a little surreal for me, rediscovering the book while knowing how it all turns out.This review is going to be divided into two parts: My view on the book, and my view on reading the book with two small children.My view on the book: Yeah, it's overhyped. Lots of books are, of course, and lots of movies and TV shows and whatever. It's a good book, but JKR isn't actually as brilliant as all that. Quite aside from the fact that the woman can't do math (which leads, among other things, to any number of fan theories trying to put together why Hogwarts used to have thousands of students, but nowadays can't possibly have more than 300 - sometimes I prefer the fandom to the series, honestly!), she has a bad habit of telling instead of showing in all her books, and it's obvious even in this first one.But, when you overlook that (and most people do), what you've got is a good kid's book, and from there a decent series. You've got adventure, excitement, friendship, and happy endings up the wazoo. I may not think it is THE greatest book (and series) to come out of children's literature ever, but I certainly enjoyed it as a kid, and again upon re-read.My view on reading this book to small children: Well, truthfully, I think this book is not suitable for most kids my nieces' ages, and I probably should've put it off a year or a year and a half. There are a number of scary parts that might concern any sensitive child, and I found that there were simply too many characters for the younger niece to keep track of! She kept asking me \\"Wait, who is this?\\" because she couldn't remember who Quirrel was, or Dumbledore, or Hagrid! The plot of the first book also twists around a little, which is great if you can keep track of the fact that Harry found the Mirror of Erised or that Ron's brother keeps dragons... but it proved to be a little tricky for Evangeline. (And, just to brag a bit, but she tested as gifted by our school district and is currently working at least six months above grade level in all areas. You don't care about that, but I like to say it whenever I can wedge it into a conversation!)This observation does NOT affect the rating I gave the book. The book is a solid 4 star book in my mind, the series as a whole mostly rates the same, and my older niece did enjoy it except for the scarier parts.However, if you are itching to read this book to your small child because YOU read it as a child and you want to share it with your kid - think about it first. It may be best to hold back until your kid is slightly older, so he or she can REALLY enjoy it. (Or it might not, you know your own kid best, etc. etc. etc.)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I needed this book to complete my Harry Potter collection. It will be there for me to re-read and for my kids to enjoy. I am a believer in books....real books. They can be read under the covers by flashlight with no batteries or electric connections.

Books are a delight to the soul."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I listen to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone while commuting to work which helps me go on with my day.

Travaling 2 hours back and forth from home to work helps pass the time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As the last movie is about to come out this July, I've decided to go back and re-read HP. The first time I read HP was in 6th grade and for AR points. It was also when I was still learning English. As I re-read this book, I found that there were a lot of things I did not remember happening, and there were some things that happened in the movies that was not actually in the book. It's also very nostalgic, as I'm sure most people my age would feel since we grew up with the books.There's really no point in going into the plot, as everyone probably knows the story already, so I guess just a few words on my thoughts of the book. Ten years older from when I first read this book, I can really see how this is a children's book. Also, now that I know how each book and how the series ends, I can appreciate all the little foreshadowing Rowling did. She really planned the books very well.But sometimes the book has a rather somber atmosphere that does not quite read like a children's book. For example, the second Quidditch match, when Snape was the referee after Harry almost fell off his broom for the first one, states that Harry did not think he could survive this match. I doubt these thoughts actually occur to any eleven-year-old boy, but considering the circumstances, maybe.However, the book also is a lot more humorous than I remembered. There're certain dry sarcastic humor that may sometimes come off as rather cliche but I find them quite charming when I read through the book. It's always funny to revisit the antics of the Weasley twins and everything that Ron tends to mess up during class.Anyway, will continue on my way to reread the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can offer little more praise than has already been heaped on this and all of the Harry Potter stories.

Some parts I would just gasp. Other times I would be so sorry for the characters or want to see what comes next that I would keep reading.

I could not stop thinking of this book for the whole time I was reading it. I read this 309-page book in one week and loved every second of it. The plot of this book is very interesting. A boy, Harry Potter, is left on the doorstep of his Aunt and Uncle's house that are very normal and like being normal. They keep Harry in a cupboard under the stairs at night and make him work during the day. One day, a letter comes for Harry. This letter asks Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry goes and learns of a whole other world. He learns to fly a broom, becomes the quidditch seeker, and much more. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are Harry's best friends and Draco Malfoy is Harry's enemy in school. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is Harry's biggest enemy that wishes Harry dead. Harry and his friends as well as all the people at Hotwarts learn much magic. The author puts many unexpected twists into the book. For instance, Rowling makes you believe that one character has problems, but is a good teacher, but this character doesn't have any problems once so ever and is actually helping Harry's biggest enemy. This was what was compelling about it, because I never knew what was going to happen next. Harry Potter is very unique because no one has really done anything like it before. It has captured readers by surprise at how good it is. It shows a new side of fantasy writing and opens up doors for other writers as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Basically, this was a good book. It has a good moral, good description, and a well developed plot that goes on through a 7-part series.Now thats something you don't see everyday!A couple things JK. Rowling could've done better:1. Even though I appreciate her attempt at hiding all the clues, they tend to be annoying. However, the clues that are visible make good table talk!2. I don't think theres anything else...Things that JK Rowling did awesome on!1. JK Rowling has stunned people that otherwise might be bored, or don't have much appreciation for literature. Although some of it might have come from Tolkien, there were many original ideas.2. The clues hidden. True, I'm being a hypocrite. But these are for the visible clues. Like in the book, in one chapter were Hary saw an owl with a letter in it beak, after reading it several times, you'll realize that was the same owl that delivered the fake mesage to Dumbledore.3. Rowling's interesting use of names. Like Dumbledore, or Hermione, or Draco Malfoy.4. An interesting plot. Good plot, very original(however, I do recognize that some of it HAS come from Tolkien).5. Good characters. Rowling has developed good, well-made characters, with interesting motivations, and personalities.6. A well-done, interesting ending that leaves us begging for MORE.Things that really annoyed me about reviewers:1. Saying that magic is B.A.D. Have you bothered to read the book? I respect your religion (if that's what you've been taught). However, Harry Potter has nothing to DO with the Devil. I've had enough of listening ot people preaching to others the Harry Potter is a creation from the Devil. Give it a rest, guys.2. No reasons on WHY it is bad, but froma biased point of view. Most reviews I have read showed that they said it was bad, but without any reasons as to WHY. Everything was...so...soo...biased. As an avid reader, I know what good or bad literature is. A bad piece would be one like 'Gaurdians of Ga'Hoole'.3. Saying JK Rowling is a bad bad author. Not true. She has a good writing style, and I respect her for that.4. Saying that she copied. No, she did not. However, she has taken several items from Tolkien, she has changed many different areas.5. Not bothering to read the book. Have many of you people though why good books got such low ratings? Because people are being biased and decide that just because it doesn't look good, doesn't deserve a good rating. So, without bothering to read the book, they added their own reviews to lower the grade.All in all, this was a good book, and deserves 5-starts. It has a good plot, and is an exciting series. I can't wait for the 6th book, and hope you guys understand the some people just can't stand having authors being better than THEIR favorite authors. I hope you guys have read this, and I look forward to new books.Peace, guys!~Samantha"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books are one of my all-time favorite series' for both children and adults. This book, the first one, is no exception. Highly enjoyable. It has a slow start, but a beginning that many in this world can relate too. It opens the minds of the readers and lets them consider possibilities that they'd never thought of before.I won't reveal the plot of this story, but it's good. I will say, though, that it is nothing compared to the books that follow. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books get better and better as they go. In this there were times that it got a bit boring, but not enough to put it down.I would strongly recommend buying this book. I did...you should too. There's a reason it stayed on the New York Times Best Sellers list for so long.Not the best by J.K. Rowling, but still very good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With Book #6 on the horizon, I am remembering the first one. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book by J. K. Rowling. It is a story about young Harry Potter, a name now known around the world. Rowling is much admired for her writing technique, her ability to weave an intriguing story, and her ability to keep her readers on the edges of their seats. I read this book in 2000 because my grandchildren were reading it and loving it! I was hooked; and, let's not forget Mary Grandpr&eacute; whose illustrations add liveliness to the text.When infant Harry Potter's parents are tragically murdered, he has the misfortune to be taken to live with his mother's sister, husband, and their son. He is delivered to Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley, the Muggle family (non-magical people), on Privet Drive, London. They are a miserable lot, and so Harry spends the next 10 years living in an unloving household, unloving toward him. While his aunt and uncle treat him badly, they dote on their obnoxious brat, young Dudley. Then, at age 11, Harry receives a letter telling him to prepare to enter wizard school at Hogwarts. After a few fits and starts getting there, Harry is off on a fantastical adventure with new (and first) friends, Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley. He begins to find out who he really is. People he's never seen before know who he is as soon as they hear his name. Heads turn and whispers abound.This book takes us through Harry's first year at the Hogwarts School. We meet many characters along the way, including headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, huge and lovable Rebeus Hagrid, bad boy Draco Malfoy and his sidekicks Crabbe and Goyle. We meet menacing Professor Snape, changling Professor McGonagall and strange Professor Quirrell, among others. We learn about Quidditch, a most remarkable, challenging and dangerous sport, one in which only those possessed of magical skills could ever engage. This book is a delightful beginning to what is now a world favorite, akin to the Hardy boys series of another era.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Why? There are many reasons. First, this book doesn't have the major issue that all of the other Harry Potter books have, and that is the opening chapters. The opening chapters of this book are good, on Book 2 they are okay, Book 3 is kinda good, Book 4 is boring and Book 5 is unreadable. Then, when Harry gets to school and the real book begins, every chapter covers a different adventure, and it is fun reading how Harry meets Ron and Hermione and gets used to Hogwarts and completes all the challenges. All the Harry books got me hooked the first time I read them, and this one was probably the most hooking. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really liked Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I liked the book because I enjoyed the suspense of finding out what will happen next. I enjoyed following Harry's journey during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. J.K. Rowling did a fantastic job of describing all of the characters. She also kept you guessing about what would happen. You didn't want to put down the book while you were reading it. Other teens might think that the book is too juvinile. I thought this book was exciting and full of adventure. I loved Ron's sense of humor. I thought that J.K. Rowling did a great job of making Snape sound so mean. She also did a great job of leading us on to thinking Snape is the person trying to steal it. I enjoyed watching Harry struggle through all the challenges he had to overcome. I liked everything about this book.

The author always has a great ending to her Harry Potter books, and the way that Harry must confront Voldemort in the end is spectacular. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) hints throughout the book make you think that the wrong person is the one after the Sorcerer's Stone, but when you find out who it is, you wonder how it could have been otherwise. The final &quot;scenes&quot; where Harry, Ron, and Hermione must battle their way through each of the teacher's spells is just ingenious - the descriptions of the dragon's snare, lifesize chess board, potions bottles, flying keys, and all the rest are so detailed that you feel like you're there. The book is peppered with J.K. Rowling's sense of humor and you find yourself laughing out loud. This book is not evil, contrary to some people's beliefs. It is fiction. It does not promote evil as the other choice to Christianity. It is a colorful, wonderful STORY that will charm both children AND adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I picked up this book, I admit I did it because of the wild craze that hit America. I thought, &quot;Well, they've GOT to be good if everyone's raving about them.&quot; I clearly expected a little kids book that would take me a day to read and be nothing more than cute. Well, it did take me only a day to read, but it was the most surprising children's book I've read (even as a child). I'm twenty years old, and I found myself pouring over this one and then aching to buy the next. This book is wonderful, and the mystery is not so blatently obvious that anyone over age thirteen could figure it out by page 10. It's a great book, and for those of you wary to the idea of reading a kids book -- GET OVER IT and start reading already!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even though I'm older than the people this book was ment for I found it very interesting and can't wait to start on book #2.

My youngest daughter wanted to read it, so we read it together, and was I ever pleasantly surprised!This book introduces us to the mysterious Harry Potter. He lives a somewhat normal and incredibly dull life with his aunt and uncle for eleven years, until he receives a letter from a wizardry school named Hogwarts. With some help from his new found friend, Hagrid, he learns that he is not so normal after all. He is, by heritage, a wizard, and he just happens to be famous.This first book introduces us to many different and interesting characters, and sets Harry up with two really good friends in Ron and Hermione. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone allows every reader's imagination to run wild, as the descriptive scenes make for nice, fast reading.J. K. Rowling put together a true masterpiece in this book. Not only did it set the stage for the following books, but it allowed the reader to feel like he was right there within the story. This is one well written book, as it has a little bit of everything: a myriad of well-developed characters, mystery, suspense, conflict of good vs. evil, and an amazing ending that I personally didn't see coming.

It is left for those who have not yet read the book to discover after they select this book and begin their enjoyable reading. This book is in humorous language and gets increasingly interesting as the page number increases! A good read for both young and old. I have seen children nagging their parents to read the book out for them. I have also heard my friends saying that this book actually reminds them of their past -- they used to read children's stories by Green and Hans Anderson. So do not hesitate, but give it a try.

From what he has heard his mother and father had died in a car accident but he doesn't believe that, he had always had mixed emotions about that idea. He would have to live with his aunt and uncle even thought they treated him like mashed up dirt and make him do all the nasty work around there dread up old crusty junk of a house. He has always dreamed of being a normal kid and having a normal life.The older he got the weirder things had been happening to him. The next few days he had been getting letters in the mail. It had been an invite to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He had a vision of what the school would look like. The hallways where lined with red laced ribbon. The candle lighten lights where lined on the red bricked walls. Harry was happy right from the start, now that he was with his kind of people he felt right at home.His classes were far from normal and really odd. The one problem was that he had already made some enemies along the way. His enemies were pretty much the whole school. They thought he was weird and Harry was going to prove it that he wasn't normal but the same as them. The only way was to take his friends Hermoine and Ron to the secret chamber in the restricted part of the library. When they got there a huge vile 3- headed dog lunged at them.

At the time I really adored the Harry Potter books and still do, I will of course be reading and re reading the seventh book.I gave the book five stars because the idea is wonderful and it suits the purpose of being a childrens book. It's probably not the best book I've ever read, but the idea is brilliant.Another reason for my liking of the book/s is the pure luck that they have always suited my age in depth and violence.

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised that a book so designed for children could be equally entertaining to adults. Ms.Rowling weaves an imaginative tale that virtually comes to life in your mind's eye. Her writing style is smooth and easy to read and the pages seem to turn themselves. Upon reading the series I found many new frontiers to explore with my grandson and found him to be a pleasure in book review discussions. The Harry Potter series is highly recommended and I implore you to turn your imagination loose and see where it takes you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A few days ago I was looking over the reviews on my favorite books and I decided to look up Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone. I read a review that got some of it right, yeah this book is aimed at ages 10-14, (I'm 11) but then she said it was not for INTELLIGENT adults. Now, my parents read this book too and it is one of their favorites as well, so I despise that women. ANYWAY...Harry Potter's parents are killed when he is about one year old. With no better place to put him, the wizarding community sets him at his only other relatives house, his aunt and uncles house. Now, this wouldn't be so bad if they werent' the most Dursleyish people you would ever meet. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley want nothing to do with Harry, but they also don't want him to know about the wizarding community. When Harry is 11, they get punished for their untruthfulness. A half-giant named Hagrid comes to bring Harry to Hogwarts (a wizarding school) and Harry knows absolutely NOTHING about magic and is under the influence that his parents died in a car crash whil really the were murdered by Lord Voldemort (the evilest wizard in the world.) This story is incredible and you will feel like its your life and not his when you read this and create new friends, new enemys, new challenges, and a new life. This book is a book that you will read again and again. (in literal sense, I've read it about 15 times)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think what I like best about the first Harry Potter book is that it does not coddle its young audience. Instead, J.K. Rowling has opted to treat her readers' real concerns seriously: Rowling does not sugarcoat the truly dark feelings and thoughts kids can have towards each other; she trusts her readers' abilities to explore and understand death; she artfully explains the role of power in the world (and not just in fantasy worlds); she fosters competition in sport and gaming; and she values education and strategy. Thus, the intellectual and moral themes for almost all of great literature make significant (or at least cameo) appearances in this wonderful novel.Rowling could have easily written genre fiction instead of literature. Granted, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has a familiar coming-of-age formula to its plot (reminiscent, if only structurally, of Ender's Game), but the complicated characters that Rowling creates intrigue the reader. Harry Potter is not perfect, but the adults of the novel nurture and challege his talents, a rarity in children's education today. Harry is also a troublemaker and certainly not one to turn the other cheek when he's been wronged. And then there's Professor Snape - but I won't say any more about him. In short, it's the strong character development that drives Rowling's work.While this might seem minor, I was thoroughly impressed with Rowling's use of complicated punctuation. She exposes her young readers to a variety of intricate verbal expressions, yes, but more importantly, she uses punctuation to create plot suspense, develop a character, and cleverly turn a phrase. Thus, Rowling uses punctuation as it was originally intended - to teach one's readers how to read.Oh, yes, and the book is fun. The underlying qualities and structures of the book would not impress me as much if there wasn't an entertaining story in which to experience and find them.I've only just begun the world of Harry Potter, and I can't wait to start the next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As Harry's story unfolds the reader is &quot;enchanted&quot; by the mysteries that await him.

Maybe one of the reasons that I liked these books is the characters. They are strange, but real and believable. You almost can't have a neutral feeling about any of them. You either love them or hate them. If you haven't read any or all of these books you need to. And I hope that J.K.

It is so satisfying to see children ecstatic about the release of the next Harry Potter book and not so excited about the next Star Wars Movie. JK Rowling has done the impossible. She has torn children away from the TV set and glued them to books instead.It is for this reason that her books will be forever classics but why are they so popular? Personally, I can't find how she is so successful. Her books are undoubtedly marvellous but what is the secret ingredient. One review I read complained that this fantasy book wasn't in the same league as the Hobbit or books like it and it isn't. Harry Potter is a far better children's book than Tolkien's supposed masterpiece. A child, nowadays will find Tolkien's prose pretentious and boring. It has too much fantasy, it is out of touch with children's reality.What is great about the Harry Potter series is that it creates a whole new world but it also acknowledges our muggle world. Harry is forced to spend each summer as a normal muggle but his life improves drastically when he returns to school. Isn't this ironic! School is far better than the Summer Holidays! Is this the secret of Rowling's success. She is presenting the ultimate fantasy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read many different sci-fi series, but never one that was aimed at children. I did not at all expect to enjoy this book at all, in fact the only reason I read it was so that I would know what my students were talking about. My suspicions were confirmed - this book is not great literature. However, it is a wonderful story that says a lot about 11 year old children and the world they live in. It is no wonder that it appeals to kids of this age. With all of the fads in the past few years it is refreshing to see one that is actually beneficial to children. While the literary value of Rowling's book is not great, the fact that millions of children (and adults) have read and re-read her books says a great deal. Kids that otherwise would never read anything have picked up these books and love them. While this was decidedly not my favorite book, and I came into with poor expectations, it was good enough to get me to read the next book in the series (which I loved!)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't believe I am just now reading Harry Potter.

This is a series which will rank in future generations among The Lord of The Rings and The Chronicles of Prydain. To current readers, it already ranks among the best fantasy literature ever published. It isn't hard to decipher the secret of the appeal of the Harry Potter books- mystery, suspense, magic, good, evil, beauty, ugliness- each element is presented in a fresh light which will delight young readers and transport older readers to nether realms of their imagination and memories of when such notions as bleeding unicorns and whimsical wizards were not so imaginary.

I don't want to get into specifics or the plot of this book because I want you to experience the magic and adventure for yourselves. However, I will say some general things. I love how J.K. Rowling stresses the importance of friendships and morals and doing what is right as opposed to what is wrong (well, most of the time...Harry always seems to find himself in trouble because he has this strange need to investigate weird happenings and he usually happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time). J.K. Rowling does an amazing job creating and coloring the characters and the world in which they live in. She is very detailed with her plot and with each successive Harry Potter book, she gives little reminders as to what has happened in the previous book(s). She also has a great sense of comic timing and with connecting pieces of the puzzle and answering unanswered questions in later books--especially in books three and four when mysteries from Harry's past are finally answered. I recommend Harry Potter (books one through four) and the future Harry Potter books (five through seven) for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book on a whim, just to see what all the buzz was about. Oh and I loved it so much! It was such a refreshing break from the thin, one demensional children's books that are published today simply for marketing. It is long and challenging enough to leave the younger readers with feelings of great accomplishment, and it is enjoyable and enchanting enough to compell them to finish. My little sisters read it and, for the first time, they had actually enjoyed reading. They felt an immense sense of fulfillment when they finished this first novel. J.K. Rowling did a perfect job with this novel. She incorporated likeable, hateable, fun characters with a story so magical. 'Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone' is the best children's book to hit the shelves since 'Through the Looking Glass'. Kudos to you, J.K. Rowling; I can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Would you face a three-headed dog? Well Harry Potter did in J. K. Rowling' Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone. I really liked it because I thought it was funny when Harry stuck a wand up a troll's nose. I didn't like it because I thought it was too long. I would like to be able to have magic wouldn't you? And that is why I liked this book. The lesson or the moral is, don't give up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the book that started it all! By now you've seen the film. I finally got around to reading this cleverly packaged fast paced fantasy. The next time you see Owls flitting about you, stop and listen. Perhaps you are being summoned to the next meeting of the Hogwarts. The book approaches familiar themes of injustice to fragile, vulnerable children by transforming them into gifted beings. A little \\"divine intervention\\" keeps the action sparkling, crisp and \\"rights\\" a lot of \\"wrongs\\".If you liked both this book and the film, make sure you see \\"SHREK\\". It is another action filled fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You don't need to be a child to read this book. It is pure magic and joy. If you don't enjoy the magic of this book you are simply too hard to please. Let the child in you run free and escape to a world of muggles, witches and wizards."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a very good book for kids.It helps them expand there imagination.I thought it was good because I like thoughs kind of books.Some adults think that it is bad for kids minds but I don't think so.So if you haven't read it yet than i tkink you should read this one and all the other ones that are out.I really like this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have easily read more than a thousand books in my 30 years-- classics and Pulitzer Prize winners, mostly-- and I do not remember being so taken by a character as I am by Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling has created a masterpiece that would recommend without hesitation to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&iexcl;s Stone introduces the reader to Harry and the magical world at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry thought himself as a normal boy before he was eleven because he thought his parents both died in a car crash and left him nothing. He has been living with the Dursleys , his miserable aunt, uncle and cousin. They treat him like Cinderella and Harry spent most of his life under the cupboard under the stairs. However things start to change, when Harry receives a letter on his eleventh birthday from Hogwarts inviting him to join the school. Suddenly Harry finds himself in a whole new world when he discovers that Hogwarts is a school for wizards and that he is a boy wizard. He makes new friends Ron and Hermione, meets Hargid the giant and discovers that Voldermort the evil wizard who killed his parents is his enemy.It&iexcl;s a very interesting book. Once you get started you don&iexcl;t want to stop. It takes you to an imaginary world that is full of amazing people and things &iexcl;V owls delivering mails, teenagers playing sports on broomsticks, hidden platform at railway stations. All these things are hidden from &iexcl;Muggles&iexcl; like you and me. This is the most attracting thing about this book. I haven&iexcl;t read a novel for fun for a long time. Even though my English is not good enough to understand every single word I could still know what it is talking about and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Jim Dale is amazing!

Have they ever heard of free speech?!?! I have also noticed that some people think these books are two gory (The unicorn scene). Well, some good books are kind of gross. I don't mind. I love certain fantasy books and I love the fact that a lot of them have to do with wizardry. I even had a home-made Harry costume before the store bought costumes came out!

NO response from seller; book was in perfect condition just not right copy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For the first 90% of the book, Rowling is at her best. The reader shares Harry's wonder as he discovers his new life. The details are engaging and inventive and carry the plot easily.The last 10% is fun, but contrived and really outside the world she creates in the first 90% and continues in the later books. It only works in the end because Harry realizes he's been set up by Dumbledore."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an excellant companion to the rest of your Harry Potter series. It is very neat to compare the differances of the American: Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone and the UK's :Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Book 1)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"great adventure - book in excellent condition - timely delivery - story itself makes you want more"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter trilogy is an amazing collection of literature.

Bravo Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is wonderful. It is a great book(for adults and children) If you like magic or anything to do with this kind of stuff this book is definelty for you.

The story was good and quidwich was exiting. I liked it more for the deeper meaning. It was one of the only books that I have ever read that I just cant put down. I would put it up there with other great books such as Hachet (Gary Paulson) Redwall, Mosflower (Brian Jaques) and 2000 Leagus Under the sea (Jules Vern)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This series is the best, I can't wait for the 4th book. enough said."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I started reading this book I could not stop reading it.

Read all three books; it's worth your time!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I liked this book a whole lot. Once I started this book I did not want it to end.

Rowling's magic world is wonderfully invented and her characters are delightful. I can't wait until my children are old enough for this series. Easily the best book I've read this year, leaving Shreve, Roth, Pirsig, etc. in the dust."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Excellent Book! Fun! Full of Wisdom. Easy to read too. (I am more appreciative of that as I get older...) How Harry Potter learns how to become a Wizard: But really about how to become a true Master of life; how to grow up; how to have Balance and wisdom and happiness in life. How to BALANCE Power and Happiness. Great book for Adults (and I've been told children enjoy it too!)This was the 2nd most inspiring book(series) I have read in the last couple years...The 1st most inspiring book - - Which I VERY highly recommend - - is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK&quot; - by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane. It is also a Book of Magic - But the authors are pioneers of an easy yet extremely powerful approach to self-discovery and personal growth. In other words - How to have BALANCE in your life, between Success and Happiness. If you enjoyed Harry Potter - and you also are interested in psychology, self-help, or spiritual or inspiring ideas - then you must buy the Kane's book. It is more for adults, but if you are a teenager you might find it very valuable too. It is easy to read, yet profound and life changing ideas reside within...MAGIC and MORE MAGIC..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I just got finished reading the second book of Harry Potter.I must say that there are no other books like the Harry Potter series.I'm 19 years old and yet I love to read them over and over again.I would recommend this book for anyone who just wants to get away from real life and goto a world of magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I teach 4th grade and discovered this book last year. The content is inventive and child friendly. Children relate to the plot and experiences of the characters. Imagine my surprise when students who disliked reading started picking it up and reading it over a weekend! The whole Harry Potter series has been a wonderful inspiration and motivator. My heart felt gratitude goes out to Rowlings for inspiring so many of my struggling readers : )"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter books (all three!) are probably some of the best and well written books I have ever read. I am fourteen, and highly skeptical of anything labeled &quot;children's,&quot; but I absolutely loved these books. J.K. Rowlings is a superb writer and she brings Harry's world to life before your eyes and then sucks you into it. I finished all three books in the space of two weeks. Adults, teens, and kids should all read these books. They are highly entertaining and original, they are unlike any other book I have ever read! If you are even minutely considering buying these books, do it, they are great! I really really enjoyed them. Harry's world is so different from our own &quot;Muggle&quot; world--Harryspeak for non-wizards--that you just become absolutely enchanted. And don't think I'm some weird sci-fi geek, either, I'm just a normal teen who liked these books a whole lot. They ARE NOT JUST FOR KIDS! J.K. Rowlings should get a Newbery Award or something for these!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A couple of months ago, I asked my ten year old grandnephew Joe what he'd been reading lately. He proceeded to tell me about an unbelievable game called 'Quidditch', a wondeful place called 'Hogwarts', and an out of place but very special person, Harry Potter.OK, it's not Tolkien, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Gabaldon or Uris. J.K. Rowling communicates a remarkable perception of childhood fears, and the abdurd, out of place, self-defensive nature of early teenagers in an upsetting, unknown, uncertain and very dangerous world.Sorcerer's Stone is a fun read, replete with magical family heirlooms, talented sturigiforms and other family 'pets', plot twists that are interesting and unexpected, and solid, growing friendships between characters of very different age, size, likes, personalities and abilities.Remarkably, diversity and respect for the individual play a strong part in this and later Harry Potter adventures. Harry gets pushed, but doesn't push back too hard. His response to negative people and events is to wonder why, not to strike out - even when facing a deadly enemy.The recommendation for 9 to 12 year olds must be based entirely on the reading level, rather than the content. Adult readers will enjoy Sorcerer's Stone as a relaxing 'between book' as much as young readers enjoy it as recreational reading.But beware! If a group of kids sees you reading this book, expect to be quizzed on every detail!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book it amazing! I loved it and I'm 23. I am going to read it to my 8th graders. I can't imagine them liking it any less!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Afer hearing of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as being either 1) a great children's book or 2) something akin to a witches' bible, I bought this book, as so many others have done, simply to see what all the Harry Potter hype was about. As a middle-aged adult whose taste in books ranges from literature to history to current events, may I say that I have seldom enjoyed a book as much as this one. I wonder if the benighted people who condemn JK Rowlings as guilty of promoting Satanism also pass the same verdict on Hans Christian Anderson and the Brothers Grimm. The book was fun, fantasy, and pure escapism, and that is all it sets out to be. On all three counts, it succeeds brilliantly. I finished the first book yesterday and am looking forward to reading the sequels... hopefully, all six. Kudos to Rowling for creating an instant -- and enduring -- classic for all ages. (Now if I could just get hold of a real Nimbus Two Thousand.....)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was reluctant to read one of these books at first, for I anticipated them to be at a much easier reading level than mine (I'm in 9th grade, you see) and the teacher wanted us reading books at our level. However, it seemed like everybody else in class was reading these books.I was still skeptical on reading one of them. Wizards, witches, and flying brooms weren't the sort of thing that caught my interest.Finally, on the second day of my winter break, I picked up this book and began to read it. I found the first two chapters or so to be extremely vapid, but by the third chapter, the book was taking off.As I expected, the book was at a much easier reading level than mine, but it was all for the better, as I finished it in two days (I finished it today.) The characters are well described and by the time the ninth chapter rolls along, it makes you want to keep on flipping the pages... you can't stop.You can really sympathize with Harry in the first few chapters. He lives in a cupboard under the stairs of his aunt and uncles place. Uncle Vernon is a laconic, obdurate fellow. Aunt Petunia is, well... nuts, and porky old Dudley is a callow, obsequious brat who gets whatever he pleases. Sounds like a perfect family, right? (Actually, it's more like a semi-dysfunctional family, if you ask me)I'd recommend this book to any reader who can read fluently. It's not full of grandiloquent words, the plot is far from facile, the characters seem real enough to reach right out and pull you into the book, and the use of foreshadowing is excellent.For those of you who have not read the book and are still skeptical after over 1,000 reviews, pick up a copy and read it. You'll post your own five star review soon after."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had heard so much about Harry Potter and seen the books piled in every book store I visited, that I finally caved and said &quot;why not&quot;. Hey, I loved Lord of the Rings! I started with book 1, of course, The Sorcerers Stone and I'm hooked. Going to buy all the rest of them.The story is enchanting, the teachers and Harry's fellow students at Hogwarts are well developed characters and the life situations encountered by Harry and his friends are believable and touching.I generally read murder mystery books but I found J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter absolutely wonderful and as good as any murder mystery I've read. I highly recommend this book to anyone with or without children, for the child in all of us! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The tale of an out-of-the-ordinary boy with a lightning scar...

A normal life, right?...until his 11th birthday... all of a sudden he is thrown into a wacky mystical and magical world...of witches and wizards and dragons and creatures of all oddities! A school named &quot;Hogwarts&quot; where wizards &quot;like himself&quot; learn &quot;magic&quot;? And mail by owl? He learns of his past... The fate of you-know-who and his parents?

Anyone who enjoyed it should be sure to try books by Diana Wynne Jones (especially Witch Week, Wilkins Tooth, Charmed Life, The Ogre Downstairs, and The Homeward Bounders), E.

It would be a terrific read-aloud for younger kids. It's fantasy happenings in the real world tickle the funny bone of the 11-14 year olds.

Harry Potter and his friends are mature beyond their years, but they are still able to enjoy an exciting and magical childhood.

I was at the Doctors office the other day and I saw a little girl, she wasnt any older than about 9/10 yrs old. She was reading one of the Harry Potter books and she was halfway through it and she was throughly enjoying this book. So I told myself that I need to see what all the fuss is about...Let me tell you I started reading the book in the book store and I could not put it down. It was such a great story of imagination and adventure! This book completely kept my attention through the whole thing.

It was slow going, mainly because of his attention span. But he's been enjoying it, nevertheless. As I was reading it to him, I became enthralled with the adventure and wound up reading the book by myself. It was a great, fast-paced read that brought out the child in me.Like everybody else, I've been hearing the controversy. Yes, there are some situations in the story that might scare small children. Pick up a book of fairy talesor, better yet, turn on the TV. The cartoons and kids' shows are much more violent and graphic than anything in this book. The Harry Potter series is destined to be a classic for many generations."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Never one to jump on the &quot;current craze&quot; wagon I finally gave in to the Harry Potter craze! I am in awe as to the amount of fun, fantasy and the range of lesson and feeling in this book.

Then to see the craze and that kids are letting go of computer games, gameboy and TV to read! My 8 year old loves it and he has just started reading it. My son is a perfect match for Harry Potter as he is extremely dramatic and creative but also full of feeling.Is is easy to see why the range of readers is so diverse and why the craze. The book is not only well written but filled with interesting fun fantasy and above all lessons and feelings.As a parent who is always supportive in finding books both suitable and of interest to my children, I think this is WONDERFUL entertainment and a great vehicle to get kids back to books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A number of people I know were talking about this book.

The whole story takes on modern life and puts a magical twist on it. Think of when you entered middle school, you were barely eleven years old, and you were entering this whole new world. Which is exactly what happens to Harry Potter.The whole book is a very well written metaphor of life. Harry Potter the whole time is expected to live up to previously made expectations of him.And he does.Not very far into the book, he knocks out a troll with the help of his newly found friends. This shows that the power and greatness he is thought to possess, he actually does.He has entered into this world, where he's incredibly famous, and a hero among the people. He doesn't even know why. The witches and wizards all have high expectations of him. He's thought to be this great hero, when he doesn't even know what that means.Throughout the whole book, its trial after trial. He must learn what it means to use a wand, and how to just fit in.Then, he's faced with figuring out why the scar he received from childhood has been hurting. He teams up with his best friends to ravel the mystery.Along the way there are several emotional battles as well as mental and physical. He discovers a mirror that shows the person looking in it their deepest desire. He sees his family. The family that had been killed when he was hardly a year old.Eventually, at the end of the book, he and his friends go through a series of events that requires each of their skills. Harry is the only one who makes it to the end, to face the man he's been told about through the whole book. He has to beat and destroy the most powerful wizard in the wizarding world.He does.This book relates to my life in the way that other people have such high expectations of me that I often find myself scrambling around to fulfill them.Then, even just dealing with all of the emotional battles that go along with that, is an adventure of its own.In the end of the book, Harry does what is thought to be impossible, showing everyone he is as great as they thought.Though I haven't gone through nearly the same thing as Harry, people have told me how strong I am for getting through it all.It's kind of neat to see a book completely imaginary, and be able to relate to it.I promise you though, that you'll be able to do the same if you try."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have never read a Harry Potter book, but I always enjoyed watching the Harry Potter movies. For this unit, however, I decided to read the first book in the Harry Potter series: The Sorcerer's Stone. I enjoyed reading this book because for me, reading is like a movie, but a more thorough and imaginative experience. When I watch a movie where I've read the book prior, the movie gives me an expressed idea for the thoughts the author imagined. And vice versa for when you read the book prior to watching the movie. The ideas expressed in the movie in correlation to the book, in my opinion, are pretty accurate. Obviously, there are some things here and there that you miss out when you only watch the movie, but, depending on the book, do those things matter in a movie? I think that's the question you have to ask yourself when you decide to only read the books or only watch the movies or both.I really enjoyed reading this book, but I'm not sure if I enjoyed it enough to want to read the rest of the series, or just continue watching the movies. If I had plenty of free time then I would probably read the books and watch the movies. However, as we get older, we lose the free time we once dearly had and you find out the things you love to do most. Over the years, I've found out that reading is not one of the things I love to do most. I enjoy reading a lot, but under normal circumstances, I would choose other options over reading to spend my free time. In other words, for example, If I had a choice, I would rather watch the Lord of the Rings movies instead of reading the books. The point I'm getting to is that the book and the movie, for me, were so alike that I barely noticed a difference. Like I said before, there are some things you miss when you watch the movies. But were the absence of those things such a great impact on my experience in watching the movie? No. Would I be happy with watching the Harry Potter movies or reading the books? Yes, I would. It's a preference thing, and I believe I will have the same feelings and outcome if I do either.Now, onto the actual review of the book... I enjoyed the book. I enjoy the author's writing style. It's easy to read and it's a relaxed writing. It flows very well and I have no trouble going through the book. As I began to read things like Beowulf and The Odyssey, I noticed that I read easier material a lot quicker. Material that contains many big words and a complex writing style from way back when is usually something I will not pick up for leisure reading. Harry Potter, for me, definitely falls under the \\"leisure reading\\" category.The story for Harry Potter is a very captivating story and it makes you want to keep reading. I hated the fact that the Dursley's were so mean to Harry. Personally, I don't think Dumbledore looked hard enough to find close family. What about Serius Black? Anyways...I also really liked the train station. Platform 9 is a very good idea, in my opinion. The characters in the book are all very expressed and the author does a good job at balancing each character's importance and role. At the end, I really liked the trials they had to go through to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. Another thing, wouldn't someone notice that Professor Quirrell had a man on the back of his head!? Anyways, again, I really liked the story. It was full and made you want to be a wizard yourself.To conclude, I would have to say that I enjoyed reading this book. However, I think I enjoyed reading the book about as much as I enjoyed watching the movie. And that's my personal preference and that shouldn't stop you from reading or enjoying the book. J.K. Rowling is a great author and I hope she keeps doing what she loves.- Josh S."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an exciting adventure in a world like nothing else: a magical world. Harry Potter does not seem to have luck on his side, until a strange letter (actually, hundreds of letters) comes to him in a peculiar way, by owl. Soon his luck changes in a way he could not imagine. He goes to an amazing school for magic where he finds friends, enemies, adventures, and a destiny that is full of danger.The book starts Harry living with an unimaginably horrible family. He lives with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and abomination of a cousin, Dudley. They basically treat him worse than their pet dog (that is, if they had one). He sleeps in the spare cupboard, gets all of Dudley's old clothes, (who is about twice his size around the middle) and basically serves them as a slave. Then one day a letter comes to him, to his surprise, by owl. Uncle Vernon doesn't let Harry read it; he instead destroys it. Letter after letter keep coming to Harry, and eventually Vernon cannot take it any more. They moved to what he thought was a secure location, but then a person from Hogwarts showed up , Hagrid, and brought Harry to Hogwarts, a school for magic.At Hogwarts, Harry found all kinds of wonderful things. He found lots of friends, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and lessons on all kinds of cool courses and some not so cool. He got to fly on a broomstick, help hatch a dragon, hide under an invisibility cloak, and learn lots of cool spells. And through all this Harry is trying to solve the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone. Throughout most of the movie Harry and his friends suspect professor Snape of the bad things that are happening to Harry, but in the end we find out that it is the least expected professor Quirrel. Harry ends up having to face Quirrel, and realizes that Quirrel has secretly been serving Voldemort. Harry must defeat him to save the Sorcerer's Stone!I especially loved this book because of the mystery and humor qualities. Although I had already seen the movie, the book provided an entirely new sense of suspense and surprise. The book kept me guessing ,in that, I was unsure if it would be exactly like the movie because several things had already changed. The specific details gave me an entirely new experience and possibly a more vivid picture than the movie.There were certain things I expected from seeing the movie, but many things I never saw coming because the book had more time to describe things. Even though I love the movie, the makers not only had to cut out events, but they also had to change things they put in the movie to fit the time limitations. I love both the book and the movie and highly recommend them and the others in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I remember the first time I read Harry Potter, about ten years ago. I was in high school, and I enjoyed it even though it was a book written for kids. It had the appeal that kids and adults can go for, as evinced by the fanbase that grew around this series. The premise is a bit simplistic but fairly solid, and as far as children's series go, the plotline was fairly well-organized and thought-out, so this magical world hidden among the world of mortals/non-magic folk (Muggles) actually makes sense (as long as you have an imagination, of course) and it's fun to see Harry deal with being an unloved orphan/nephew to finding a world where he can actually belong.This book is the shortest in the series, but it is a wonderful first book that started off an incredible series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The item was as described by seller. It arrived quickly and the transaction was easy. Thanks."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book. This book begins my most favorite book series ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've read a ridiculous number of books of several different genres from the time I was small, up to the present. My personal favorite is fantasy, so Harry Potter slides right in, but I have particularly strong feelings about these books. I began reading the Harry Potter series when I was 11 years old, staring with The Sorcerer's Stone. I am now 22, and even though I have re-read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at least a dozen times it still has not lost its magic. I feel that every time I re-read the series I get something new out of it. Rowling has a tendency to wedge little statements in her stories that you may pass over with first read, but when you pick up the story again, you notice that every word she uses has a purpose - she doesn't miss a thing!The amount of effort that Rowling put into this series is incredible. For example, I've heard that she even has a class schedule made up for all of the students of Hogwarts so that it makes sense when they cross paths in the hallways at different times. This effort really shines through in the stories. The plot is extremely engaging and intricate throughout all seven books and the characters are just incredible. Each one is a totally full rounded person - even down to the minor characters in the series. You feel as if you get to know these people. I know when I was younger, I used to love reading Hermione's lines out loud in an awful British accent because I related to her and I felt I was genuinely friends with the characters. I could imagine being at Hogwarts myself. Even to this day I am not reading the antics of characters in a book, it feels more as if I am experiencing things with them and learning with them.One thing that I have noticed after going back and reading the books again is the progression in age of the main characters. Reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone now when I am 22 makes it seem much younger in comparison to when I read it when I was 11. The book was meant for children to read after all, so it must be written to resonant with that age group. However, if you are an adult picking up this book, do not be discouraged by the simple language and youthful elements of the book. Throughout the seven books, there is a definite age progression. By the time you get to the seventh book, Harry is dealing with much more adult scenarios and it may appeal to an adult more over the span of the series. Several of the people who I work with who are in their 40's have said that they had trouble getting past the first chapter of the Sorcerer's Stone because it felt too young for them. Keep in mind the first book is a quick read, so even if you feel this way I strongly encourage you to continue through to the end. If then, you decide that you do not belong in Harry's world, that is okay, I just feel like it would be worth giving the series a chance.In saying that, anyone who has kids who is around the pre-teen age should really at least get their kids hooked on these books. It can really inspire them to get excited about reading and seek out other books to enjoy. The books are popular for a reason - they are INCREDIBLY entertaining. I feel they have great power to get kids to realize that you can get just as much enjoyment out of reading if not more than watching television or movies. The Harry Potter experience is something very unique that everyone should experience at some point in their lives. The hype is valid, I promise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I hesitated about buying this copy of this book seeing as I already have a couple copies of it here. I'm very glad I did. I loved the little hand-drawn picture of Snape by JKR and the full-page color picture of the adventure across the Black Lake. Those features aside, I reread the story and forgot just how magical and wonderful it is. In comparison to the later books, it is a quick read and I forgot how much I love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book! Ever since I was a young child I've been enthralled with mysticism, mythology and magic. I heard the controvery and decided to check it out for myself. What a wonderful thing! How lucky for children to be able to attend a school of magic and have adventures. Not only is it about magic but this book teaches about loyalty to self and to friends. It teaches right and wrong, good and evil - oh my gosh, are we talking morals here? I do believe so! If I had a magic wand I would wave it and predict that Ms. Rowling indeed has a success on her hands. I'm in my 40s and I can hardly wait to buy the next book. And by the way, I'm saving my books for my grandchildren!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"product came promply and in great condition/great for listening in the car with the kids"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A new name in fiction at the time of this book's first publication JK Rowling has since catapulted her books into the top of bestseller lists the world over. With her unique style that combines a sense of breezy childhood with simple and easy readability this book is perfect for anyone. Part of the charm of the book is that its main character is easy to understand and relate to from any age group. Since by now it is hardly necessary to summarize the plot, I will avoid doing so.Rowling styles her books so that anyone can appreciate them. For the children it is a mix of wonder at this new world discovered by their protagonist, a world of magic and spells, flying broomsticks and an unusual staff of teachers. They love it because even though it is fantasy of the highest rating the characters are real and understandable. For the adults all these are still enjoyable but they might have fun with the names as well. Rowling is a veritable genius when it comes to second meanings in those things most people would usually just ignore in general. For anyone of any age these books can be enjoyable and become one of the best loved series they will ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got into the Harry Potter books a few years ago. My mother had bought it, hearing it was a good book, and thinking I would like to read it. I was thoroughly unconvinced, for at that point, I would read books about horses only,(which I now realize was a very boring decision) and Harry Potter definitley did not fit that description. One day, when I was unbeleiveably bored, I decided to give the book a go. After reading two pages, I could not put the book down! My parents had to force me to let go of the book so I could get some sleep.Here is a breif description of the book: Harry Potter (a 10 year old boy who, though miserable with his hateful relatives, beleives himself an ordinary kid) starts to receive letters. Readers already have an idea what is going to happen thanks to the first chapter, which is similar to a prolouge. Finally on the eve of his eleventh birthday, he finds out that not only is he a wizard and going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he is a famous one at that. At Hogwarts, he finds friendship, magic where ever he goes, Quidditch (a sport played on flying broomsticks), and a destiny he never imagined.J.K. Rowling spins along this rich, funny, imaginative, action filled novel. The characters all have uniquely different personalities, and it is all too easy to beleive that they are real. Rowling writes the novel so that you feel exactly the same as Harry nearly all the time. I feel bad for anyone who does not read the book. The story stops you beleiving that it is uncool to read.I have read all of the books, and they only get better as they go along. I admit that after reading the first book I couldn't help but hope that maybe, just maybe, I was a witch and could go to a magical school like Hogwarts.Harry Potter is just that kind of book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My friend said I should really read this book so I did I am glad I did.It is about this boy who finds out he is a wizard.

In the end of the book everything works out.It was full of mysterious and interesting things. Some of the things they have in the book are really cool.I really think you should read this book because it is really good!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finally decided to read the 1st Harry Potter book because of all of the hype of the 5th book being released. I had heard this book was great, but I wasn't too excited about reading it because i'm not into science fiction involving wizards and magic and such. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a fun, light-hearted read, and I think that is because the Harry Potter books are typically children's books. Of course there were dark moments in this book, but I loved every word of it! The characters were so realistic and believable. This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I can't wait to read the others! I would recommend this book to ANYBODY! :) I couldn't put this book down! It kept my attention the whole way through, and the ending was amazing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In elementary school, I absolutely loathed reading for some reason. Most kids did, except for the REALLY smart kids with really responsible parents. Well, my mom, in an attempt to get me to read, took me to the nearest Borders book store, and asked me to pick out any book that I wanted. I wasn't so sure about what I wanted, and not that interested for that matter, but I saw a random Harry Potter book standing upright by itself in a corner, all alone, and I thought, \\"Why not. I heard it was good...\\" This was the summer before 6th grade. So, I actually ended up reading the third Harry Potter book first, but it captivated me, and I went out to purchase the first, second, and when it came out, the fourth. My parents were shocked! Four books on my shelf! They were the first big chapter books that I'd bought in a while, my last before them being a second grade biography book. I consumed these books quickly and diligently. The Harry Potter books taught me how good and enjoyable books can be, and they started my reading craze, which hasn't stopped since, to the delight of my parents. I now consume at least one big book a week (which is a lot, considering that I used to consume squat books, hehe), and here is a look at the book/s that sparked my interest in reading...Harry Potter is a famous boy, known as the only survivor of one of the evil Lord Voldemort's attempted murders. The first book begins when Harry is 11. He is utterly mistreated by his maternal aunt, uncle, and cousin, Dudley. Harry is shocked and delighted when he finds out that he is in actuality a wizard, as were his mother and father, and it's off to wizarding school for him! It is at this school that Harry gains friends, learns spells, gains enemies, and has a very interesting time. If you'd like more information, just read the other reviews or excerpts or whatever, because reviews are for opinions not information, hahaha, so I suggest that everyone who likes to read or who would like to learn to love to read should read the Harry Potter books. J. K. Rowling is a magnificent author, and I hope that after the Harry Potter series, she will produce more and even greater pieces of work. Good luck to her and all emerging authors!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Would you be surprised to find out that you are a witch or a wizard? Well, Harry does in J.K. Rowling's: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry finds that being a wizard is tougher than it seems when he goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Harry Potter, an eleven year old boy who lives in London is a slave of his aunt, uncle, and his incredibly spoiled cousin, Dudley. He receives a letter inviting him to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry then goes to the secret platform 9 at the train station. On the train to Hogwarts, he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, the greatest friends he would ever have. He also meets Draco Malfoy, his greatest rival. At Hogwarts, Harry got sorted into the Gryffindor house by the sorting hat. Then he helps a friend get an item called a rememberall that is flying through the air and catches it on broomstick and gives it back to him. Doing that makes him become Gryffindor's seeker for quidditch (A game where wizards fly around on broomsticks throwing a ball called a quaffle through goals). Along the way he learns spells, mixes potions, wins one quidditch match after another, and even fights a mountain troll. But Professor Dumbledore's warning of going to the 3rd floor corridor made Harry wonder what it was all about, and why does Professor Quirrel wear that turban?Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a \\"wand\\"erful book. It's a magical, action-packed story.

When the first one came out in paperback, I decided to test the waters, and I found the reading experience to be one of the more pleasurable I 've had, and that includes adult fiction as well. &quot;Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; not only transported me to a state of childhood bliss, but I found the novel well- written, capable of being read on many levels, and at times genuinely moving. The characters, and terminology are easy to learn, as the reader easily takes them to heart, and the book does not have the academic pretentiousness of such fantasy classics as &quot;Watership Down&quot; or the Tolkein trilogy, both of which I have read, and enjoyed, but not enough to be sucked into a taste for fantasy. 'Harry Potter' has changed all that; I not only can wait for the next installments, I intend to buy them in paperback so I can own the entire series, and someday curl up on a rainy day and read the entire chronicle cover to cover.

Might have been her first flight to the states. She was on the Rosie Odonnell (sp) show. Rosie loved the book and was ranting on (in a good way) about how this book is a classic in the making. On how she was on the edge of her chair with every word. Rosie even read this book to her children. After I heard J. K. Rowling talk. After she explained how poor she was and how she just had a dream of writing something. How she sent this book to publishers, each one an original because she couldn't afford to get them copied. This lady has real vision and I admire this. After hearing her speak, I decided that I had to read this book. I LOVE THIS BOOK! It's a good read for all ages who know how to day dream when they read. I'm not going to get into the story of the book because I am a firm believer that you should read something without knowing anything. It's more exciting that way. Just trust me and read the book.

This series is not just for children, as anyone who has read it will tell you.Harry Potter, just for anyone who's been living under a rock, is a browbeaten 12-year old kid who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his parents were supposedly killed in a car crash. Shortly after his 12th birthday, he is informed that his parents were a witch and a wizard, they didn't die in a car crash (they were murdered by the most feared dark wizard ever), he's going to a school for magic, and there's a whole world out there he never knew about. It would take far too long to explain the whole story in one review, so I suggest you go out and read the book.This is a book that has universal appeal; written simply enough for kids but with a plot to grip adults as well. Other people have compared it to the Chronicles of Narnia, but I believe it is better than that. You can actually believe Harry Potter is a kid with his own problems and worries--I never could get involved in the Narnia Chronicles, they were too stilted to be real people.Rent it at the library if you want to read before you buy, but I can almost guarantee that you would not find your money ill-spent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"OK OK how long has this series been out? 1997-98? I am an avid, avid reader, but I never really felt the need to read Children's books! Then of course NUMBER 4 came out, and I saw GROWN PEOPLE reading and OK OK I crumbled under the unbelievable peer pressure - or was it media pressure! And just like I hate to say &quot;my mother was right&quot;, I will admit that this is a BRILLIANT first story. I literally felt myself plunge into Harry's world, envisioned the giant, the ugly, ugly aunt and uncle, and cannot even describe to you the picture I have of the nasty cousin. The school is wonderful, and please can I get a letter, I want to be a sorceress. The character developemnt, the scenes, nothing, absolutely nothing is left out. Rowlings does a brilliant job. Everyone is a hero, Harry, his friends, the teachers, with even a few surprises. Please, please forget the hype about sorcery, and church and not being able to read this wonderful wonderful story. Imagination is a life saver. Please get these books for your children, for your nieces and nephews, for your neighbours, and even get them for yourself (don't be shy). And let yourself become a 12 year old again"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter isn't handsome, unnaturally brave, or popular but still he fills the role of the hero! Harry dosen't like his life with they Dursleys but when he finds out the truth about himself, that he is actually a wizard, and his parents where killed by Voldemort, the most powerful dark wizard ever. His whole life suddenly changes. He goes to Hogworts, a magical school where he is automatically a hero and everyone knows his name as the one who defeted you-know-who!I recommend this book to absoultly everyone. It's so incredibly well written that even if you aren't to intrested in the fantasy genre you will love this book! I guarentee it! JK Rowling follows the tradition or C.S. Lewis and Tolkin proudly. This book and series will certinly be a remembered book for generations to come!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was one of the most phenominal books I have ever read. Harry Potter is a young boy who has recenlty learned that he is a wizard. Rowling accounts his amusing adventures. She writes clearly and uses such vivid detail. It is a book that children, teens and adults would find entertaining. An easy read and most definately a page turner!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wanted to know what all the hype has been about, so I bought this book to start off my adventure. Suffice it to say that I wasn't disappointed. Harry is a great character and this book is a great buy for young siblings, nieces, nephews, boyfriends, girlfriends, etc... you get the picture. Rowling has created a character that is SO human and that's what makes this story so great. His adventures at wizard school just tickle me pink. The mystery behind &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; is intriguing enough to keep me turning the pages. For those of you still skeptical, this book reminds me of the other greats: &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot;, and &quot;Stuart Little&quot;. Final word: great book for the kid in all of us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I reviewed Harry Potter and the Sorcerers's Stone. It was a great book with lots of action, adventure, and humor. One of my favorite parts was when Professer Quirrell, the defense againt the dark arts teacher revealed that Lord Voldemort had been under his turban the whole time. Another of my favorite parts was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to get past the obstacles to get to the Sorcerers's Stone. Here's what obstacles Harry had to surpass. They had to put Fluffy, a three headed dog asleep with a flute. Which was Hagrid, the gamekeeper at the time's pet. Then they had to play a game of chess against giant living chess people provided by Professer Mconogall, the configuration teacher. After that, he had to do some flying to catch a flying key. Finally, Hermione (Hogwart's best student) had to do some logic with potions provided by Professer Snape (not to mention Harry's least favorite professer.) Harry drank the smallest glass and went through a fire Snape had made. When he got into the last room, he saw Professer Quirrell, and Lord Voldemort burst out of his turban, tried to kill him, and again failed. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great book to review."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an amazing book. I have read this book alone at least 20 times. You really get into the story, which makes it fun. J.K. Rowling is a very good author. I hope she writes much more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As there are more than enough reviews of this book, I will not bore you with yet another. I will instead tell you about the lovely collectors version.My daughter had read Sorcerer's Stone a few times and really enjoyed the story and characters. I found this collectors copy one day when looking for some gifts on Amazon. It looked quite attractive and I had bought her a collectors copy of Lord of the Rings which she really liked. I thought this would be a good edition to a the collection I was hoping to start. The price was also attractive, I saw the same version at a bookstore for about $30 more andas much as wanted to get it, was not going to pay that much. When I saw it on Amazon, I was ecstatic, quite reasonable. When it arrived I was not disapionted, it was even nicerthanthe picture. My daughter loved it. When I had a mantle in my apartment, she set it up there so people could see it. It has such an attactive cover."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say that 5000 people have not? For the past five years I, like everyone else on this planet have been captured, mesmirized and enthralled by the Harry Potter books (192 million copies sold worldwide). The full blooded characters, rich landscapes and spectacular detail make these some of the best books out there, one of those EXTREMELY rare books that pale everything you read next for a long time after that. Now for those that have not read these books yet, (you are missing out on a great time, believe me) here is a small plot sumamry..........On a cool winters night, a cat sits on a garden hedge in England. Surprisingly, the cat is not moving. A bearded man then appears over and speaks to the cat. Magically, the cat turns into a woman with her hair in a bun. As the two collaborate with each other, a man on a flying morotcycle flys down and places a baby on the doorstep and all of them leave.Now this is a very minor, very vague plot summary. I am refusing to add anyhting more to this review regarding the plot. I am just going to say that you will have a grand old time filled with suspense, magic and detail that you will look foreward to reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Paganism, Satanism, and Occultism have been in decline since the Dungeons and Dragons trend died out in the mid-80's. Fortunately, these things have found an unlikely Saviour in Harry Potter.Harry is an 11-year old (eleven being a sacred number to famed English occultist Aleister Crowley) who is tired of Christian oppression and wants to live the life of a wizard. Satanic symbols abound in this delightful book: the owl, which has long been held sacred in Devilry; the lightning bolt on Harry's forehead; riding broomsticks (although that's more of a symbol of witchcraft, which is Satanic by nature)... Plenty of occult references, black cats (the standard guise for demons who wish to walk the Earth un-noticed), Latin-esque spells, and the like. If you add up the letters to Harry's name using the Roman system, they add up to CLVXVI, a.k.a. 666. The little girl is named after \\"Hermes\\", the messenger god, who was basically interchangeable with \\"Lucifer\\", the Bringer of Light. Now, this book in and of itself won't turn children into card-carrying Satanists, but it WILL steer them in the right direction. If you enjoyed this book and are more interested in learning about the Dark Lord, I recommend J.K. Rowling's accompanying piece about casting spells; followed by \\"The Satanic Bible\\" by Anton Lavey. Hail Satan! Hail J.K. Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A Review by PeteThere is a young outcast in a family of jerks and lots of magical and things that are just [messed] up. He lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin and they are all mean to him. He finds out that some guy killed his parents and then he ends up going to a school of wizardry. He also has a weird scar that tells a story. No one ever liked him before he went to the school but a lot changes.The characters were really unbelievable but imaginable. I don't really think that it is all as good as it is supposed to be. One thing is that this really bad guy they cant even say his name its like a sin or something. For example \\" It is just forbidden to speak of Voldemort!\\" I don't know. The subject was just odd is all I can say. Well, not really the subject just the sort of imaginary thing of it.I would really not recommend it, but I hope that the movie is a lot better. I'm sure that a lot of people disagree with me but that's the way that I see it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...had to settle for E.T., which was a great movie, but only an average book. Harry Potter was a great book before becoming a movie, and appeals to children's natural love for magic and imagination. I pity the children whose parents wrongly accuse Harry Potter of promoting 'evil' sorcery and magic. We all grew up enjoying magical fairy tales and fantasies, and it didn't turn us into devil-worshippers. Potter is fascinating, VERY original, and will eventually be a classic of children's literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&lt;&gt;It is not often that you hear adults openly confessing to having read a book written for &quot;kids&quot;. Not only confessing, but GLEEFULLY so. I could not resist. I crept into my 18 year old daughters room and swiped her Harry Potter books. It was the most fabulous thing I have done for myself in years!&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;All of the sudden I was transported into a world of make-believe that was so wonderful and believeable that I found myself eying my kitchen broom with new respect. What a gift to be able to release the cares of the day in such a delightful way.&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;I am aghast at Christian groups who find fault with Harry, and I ask everyone to realize these are the same people who made &quot;The Lion King&quot; an evil nature worshipping film, and turned a wee little Teletubby into a bad example to children because he is purple and carries a purse. PLEASE ignore the extremists and encourage your children to read about a little boy who had every dissadvantage in the world and despite earning the dislike of &quot;You-Know-Who&quot; he always manages to do the right thing.&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; Harry Potter is not perfect, he looses his temper, thinks about getting even and does not always obey the rules, but in the end the inherent goodness in his heart guides him to the best and kindest conlusion.&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; I LOVE Harry Potter! He is not perfect, but despite all the odds stacked against him he is discovering that in the end, with right intent, there really is no evil that can overcome the good inside of him. Just like the rest of us!Imagination and possibilities, we need to be GRATEFUL to J.K. Rowling for getting a world of children interested in books again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the saorcers stone is the book that started it all. It was the book that made the world have one less strugling single mom (J.K. Rowling) and truned her into a millionare. This book is where the series begains. Harry Potter was never quite your average kid at number 4 privite drive but bye the end of the book he is no where near average. This book uses great writing, humor and supenese to make a great book. I have heard two major complaints of this book.1,) that this book is a childrens book and does not belong on a list with other classic and on the best seller list. This is not true. I not exactly a kid and I love the book and I know many people older than me who have loved it.2.) That the book is to scary, NOT TRUE! The book is not scary at all. True VOldomart is not exactly some one I'd want as a room mate but he is the only cariter for the job.The Harry potter series are if not the best, one of the best series of all time. (in my mine only the cronicals of Narnie are a challenge) and Harry Potter and the Sorcers stone is a classic in its own right."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is Charming, magical, full of dark secrets, and learning the wretched truth.

These books got me back into reading. By far my favorite series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the debut novel of JK Rowling and begins the story of Harry Potter. Harry, left an orphan as a baby when his parents were killed, lives with his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, and their horrible son, Dudley. Ignored all his life, he has no idea that he is revered by wizards around the world. Suddenly, one day, a letter arrives that changes his life- he is a wizard and is expected to begin school at Hogwarts. Little does he know that he may need to battle the very person who killed his parents- Lord Voldemort. This first novel is an excellent children's book, worth reading by adults. The characters are well written and developed and the plot moves nicely. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter seares is a great set of books i have all of them and the best in the first it is a great book for people of all ages my mom read it and liked it it is just a great story line and I cant wate for more books to come out"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My twenty-one year old little sister referred this book to me, and it has rejuvenated my imagination.

Rowling's Harry Potter series a try. My mom bought me Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at a book fair she was volunteering at, and I picked it up and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it (much like the title of my review).Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an imaginative, charming, complex (but easy to follow) novel that you'll love. It has an awesome plot, believable characters, and a twist that you'll never guess.The book is about an eleven-year-boy named Harry Potter, who has lived all of his life with his mean aunt and uncle, because his parents died. He's treated like a piece of dirt at home, and he is amazed when he finds out he is really a wizard. He attends Hogwarts, a wizarding school, grateful to get away from home. He finds a magical world that he has been awaiting him all his life . . . and he finds out he is famous for something he can't even remember. As the story progresses, Harry finds out that a specieal stone is hidden somewhere inside Hogwarts. I don't want to spoil the surprise, you'll have to read the book yourself.These books are perfect for anyone for anyone. I've had friends that were allergic to books until they discovered Harry Potter. It doesn't end with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: if you like the first book half as much as I do, you'll have to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter. . . .I had heard of him in book reports, went to the library to check him out, and found that there was a waiting list of 32 kids to borrow it. I decided to buy it. At my school's book fair, they had the books for sale. Unfortunatly, they only had the first one in paperback, and I didn't have enough money to buy the 2nd and 3rd in Hardcover. I read the first Harry Potter book in 2 days, finally going to the bathroom, which is the only room in my house that has a lock, to read the final chapters in peace without being bombarded with chores, as it was Saturday. I absolutly loved it. I wanted more. I waited for FIVE months until Christmas, when my Mom had promised to get them for me. I was SO enthralled in them that I read BOTH the second and the third books in 2 days. No kidding. That's fast, even for me. Most books that size take me about 2 or 3, maybe 4 days to read them each. I liked Harry that much.I am very much a critic when it comes to books, and I can't find a single flaw in any of the Harry Potter books. The only thing that's missing is romance, and J.K Rowling has promised that Harry will like somone in the fourth book. The first book I rate 5 out of 5 stars, the second 6 out of 5 and the third 7 out of 5 stars. They're good books. VERY good.All I have to say is I'm very upset that Ms. Roling isn't going to write about Harry after he gets out of Hogwarts. We only have 3 books to go after Harry Potter 4!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;! I don't think I will survive after that, unless I can write them myself!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit I did not want to read this book.

I promise that you will love the whimsical descriptions and humorous quotes and the characters themselves. Whether you're 8 years old or 88 years old, it makes no difference. Even people who don't like to read will find that they fly through Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as if they own their own Nimbus 2000 (you'll have to read the book to find out what a Nimbus 2000 is).

Like another girl that wrote a review on this book, I didn't want to read it because of the popularity and I thought that only superficial people would read it. My teacher wanted to read it to the class too but I convinced her not to. I mean, come on, boredom right? Well thats precisely where I was wrong. My mom bought the book and made me promise I would read it(I ran out of books and was desperate then). So I read it and Potter's adventures,pains and over all confusion enveloped me and I couldn't put it down... nor the one after that and even the third one. I finished all three books in a week(busy,busy,busy). Needless to say when Potter finds out he is different and goes to Sorcerer's school you will be hooked. I can't tell you the other goodies because you'll just have to read the book to figure them out. Just DON'T let someone read it to you because in my opinion its a personal book that only you should see your reaction to and tell others about(the book that is).

It is about Harry Potter, a normal 11 year old who lives with his evil &quot;Muggle&quot; aunt and uncle:Petunia and Vernon. Potter finds out that he has magical powers and is send to Hogwarts, your unusual school for becoming a wizard(a boy), and a witch(a girl, but they are good;remember, this isn't The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). He has to defeat Lord Voldemort, a former wizard who became a sorcerer and, with his cult of ex-wizards and spies, killed Lilly and James, Harry's mom and dad.

I know people think it is considered a fantasy because of the magic, but to me that was just the baseis. First of all this boy named Harry Potter lives in a normal home in England where he is horrably mis-trearted by his Aunt and Uncle. But then he gets this letter from a school called Hogwarts this is when he finds out he is a wizard, but he is not only a wizard, but he is a VERY famous wizard, he is famous for defeting the dark lord Voldemort. Off at Hogwarts Harry makes friends and also discovers something else that is there. Be sure to read this book because it is GREAT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot; Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone &quot; is not unlike Clive S. Lewis or J.R.R. TOLKIEN. Roald Dahl, too, can be seen here ( the Dursleys highly resemble James' aunts ( ...&quot;Giant Peach&quot; ) and the Wormwoods of &quot;Matilda.&quot; So if you like British authors like that, you'll enjoy Rowling.The Dursleys, a normal English family, recieve an unpleasant surprise: a wizard baby. Disgusted, they mistreat him ( H. Potter, of course ), while spoiling their son, Dudley Dursley. Then, when a friendly semi-giant tries to contact them, Mr. Dursley frantically tries to avoid everything. Nevertheless, Harry is whisked off to the world of wizardry.Then the real fun starts. While not dwelling on the school cirriculum, the book bristles with novelties such as a goblin bank, Every Flavor Jelly Beans, Chocolate Toads, Diagon Alley, Harry's friends ( Ron and Hermione ), his rival ( Draco ), his hated teacher Snape, a mountain troll, Hagrid ( the semi-giant ) and his three-headed dog and well-treated dragon, centaurs and a mysterious mirror. In the middle of it all lies the book's namesake, the wonderful Sorceror's Stone. It has something for everyone--sports stories, mystery, horror, heroism, some well-placed humor, along with powerful warnings against wandering around at night."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this book, is so - whats a word that can describe it? Intelligent. You probably think that these books are not intelligent, but I think they are. So what if they are a little &quot;off the wall&quot; or the point is they keep the reader reading! you can't stop, you just want to find out, and then after to read to the end you want to read it again, because the 2nd time you can pay attention to the close details. I have to say these books are so awesome the way JK Rowling makes every page, paragraph, none the less, every word fits together in one big puzzle that make the book even more interesting. I've read all of them and I have to say, each one gets better! So keep reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"you might receive from others while reading this on your commute to work. I'm a 28 year old woman who decided to see what all the hype was about. Now I get it! Harry Potter is not just for kids...I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats. I couldn't put this book down. I'm an avid Anne Rice fan, and J.K. Rowling's prose is just as elegant and imaginative-and suitable for the under 18 age group. I ran out to buy book #2 within hours of finishing book #1!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 26 years old and I loved this book...even more so, I loved this series :::peers into her mailbox waiting for the delivery of #4:::While this book is not on a literary par with such works as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Carroll's Alice, it is an enchanting look into the realms of possibility. The book reads quickly, and is easy to relate to.As an 11 year old, I was thrilled and enthralled by A Wrinkle in Time by Madeline L'Engle and the House with a Clock in its Walls by John Bellairs.

The Dursleys are a bunch of stupid muggles who should not treat Harry like they do. If I was Harry, once I am grown up, I'd turn them into a bunch of frogs!

Rowling a compelling author and she is extremly talented and should keep writing I am just upset that thier are just 7 books in the series! For a ten year old Harry Potter has a miserable life with his awfull realitives. He then recives a letter telling him of a wonderfull place free of his cousin Dudley.Harry thinks he's dreaming but there he finds friends, fun,a sport played by riding on a broomstick, and danger after he learns one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world killed his parents and tried to kill him is coming back into power, and try and kill him again,but not if Harry Potter can stop him!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are looking for an exciting but scary book to read, read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I read this book in a week and it even has over three hundred pages! It was so exciting that I couldn't stop reading it! First of all, Harry lives with the Dursley's on 4 Privet Drive. One really funny thing is when Harry lets one of the snakes out of the cage and his cousin falls into the cage and then Harry makes the glass come back up. Also, Hagrid gives Harry's cousin a pig tail because he eats so much. Harry\`s parents are killed by he-who-must-not-be-named. Harry amazingly was not killed when his parents were. Hagrid takes Harry to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry meets Ron who is scared of a lot of things. He also meets Hermione, who is very smart and her cleverness helps Harry with a lot of things. Harry also becomes the youngest seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Quidditch is like the sport of Hogwarts. One day, Ron, Hermione, and Harry go to the forbidden third floor. Filch, the maintenance worker hears somebody and looks for them but they went into another door. This is where they meet Fluffy, a three headed giant dog. Fluffy actually belongs to Hagrid. Hermione soon finds out what Fluffy is hiding. Fluffy is hiding Nicholas Flammel's Sorcerer's Stone. The Sorcerer's Stone can give you the elixir to live forever. During the rest of the book Harry, Ron, and Hermione encounter a fully grown Mountain Troll. Hermione is in the girl's bathroom near the dungeon. The troll goes into the girl's bathroom. Harry and Ron save Hermione and kill the troll. Harry also finds the Mirror of Erised, which shows what you need to be happy, Harry sees his parents. Also, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione get detention for being out of bed, they go into the Forbidden Forest with Hagrid and Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy is Harry's enemy, and he is in the Slytherin house. When in the Forbidden Forest, they are trying to find what is killing the unicorns. When somebody slays a unicorn, it assures them they will live longer, but it is a horrible sin. Harry find out the he-who-must-not-be-named is actually slaying the unicorns. Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to the forbidden third floor, the go into the door where Fluffy is. Fluffy is asleep so they go into the trap door. They experience many obstacles such as finding the right key out of 1,000 to fit the door, a game of Wizard's Chess, and a plant the almost strangles them. Finally Harry goes into the last door where he meets is professor for defense against darks arts. The Mirror of Erised had been moved to the room and Harry looks into it. He sees himself pulling the Sorcerer's Stone out of his pocket. All of a sudden, his professor takes of his turban and Harry sees he-who-must-not-be-named, or Lord Voldemort. He tells Harry to give him the Sorcerer's Stone, but he doesn't . Lord Voldemort tells his assistant to kill Harry, but Harry touches his face and it burns. Then he touches Lord Voldemort and he burns, too. Harry was in shock so they took him to the hospital wing. Professor Dumbledore tells him that the destroyed the Sorcerer's Stone. At Hogwarts, they have something called the House Cup. The four houses, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw get points awarded to them every time they do something good. Gryffingdor wins because Harry, Ron, and Hermione found the Sorcerer's Stone. To read more about Harry and his friends read the sequel to this book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this as a child, and have scince read it again for an english class, and the second time around it was even more fun, expecially being able to compare it with the movie. The movie did change a few thigns, but it's still fun to watch.If you have ever considered reading anything with the slight'est bit of magic in it, check this out.Some people said it's a long introduction to the other books in the series, but i found it very action packed and funny. Not many books can be called funny.If you like this i highly recommend you read the other potter books.Note: This book is not just for kids.~hope this helps"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"THIS BOOK IS SOOOOOOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!! THERE IS AT LEAST ONE NEW SURPRISE IN EVERY CHAPTER, AND ONCE I STARTED READING IT... I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN!!!!! i RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Intelligent, interesting, well written, carefully plotted, and most importantly it doesn't insult the reader's intelligence. I managed to read all 4 books in less than a week, a personal record for me. It reminds me a little of such equally plotted and thought out sci-fi/fantasy classic as Lord of the Rings, The Mars Trilogy, Babylon 5, and the highly underrated classic French film City of Lost Children. I wonder if Rowling truly KNOWS how good she is, and in addition to excitedly awaiting the next novel and the next movie, I'm also very interested to see what her non-Potter projects will be like."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The best accolade for this book: I read it aloud to my first grader and kindergartener over about a month. Most nights they were clamoring for another \\"Harry Potter\\" session.And what's not to like for young kids? This book features an English boy Harry Potter, living an utterly miserable life with an aunt and uncle who wish he had never been forced upon them. Potter's cousin is big, fat and make's Harry's life unbearable. Auntie and Uncle force him to live under the stairs, though a spare bedroom holds their son's toys.Harry's life changes when he is informed he is a wizard - an not just any wizard, but the son who defied the evil Voldemort, the darkest practitioner of the Black Arts, by living when \\"You Know Who\\" (as he is referred to by magic types to terrified to say Voldemort) came to kill Harry's entire family when he was a toddler.Harry is soon off to magic school at the wonderful Hogwarts. Without spoiling the book, understand that many magical and interesting things happen at Hogwarts: broom flying, the impossible to understand game of Quiddich, baby dragons, potions and spells, journeys into forbidding forests and plain old fashioned school chumming.It's a little tough for me to judge this book as an adult read, since I read the entire thing aloud. My kids were enchanted. That's enough for five stars in my book.A note: This is a fun book. Yes, it's about witchcraft and magic and good and evil. Those who liken this to some type of threat to God and morality by its' embrace of the Halloween Arts should lighten up. It's just a ripping good yarn aimed at young kids - not the type of thing that will set youngsters off dressed in black clutching an Ouiji Board. My youngsters had no problem realizing the fantastic story was just that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Given the publicity and hype that has surrounded the Harry Potter book series and the movie, I am going to skip the synopsis of the plot, assuming that everyone is familiar with it.I picked up this book originally to find out what all fuss was about and was immediately drawn into the world that J.K. Rowling has created. The components are familiar, ie., wizards, monsters, evil step-parents/guardians, the reluctant hero who comes into his own, and etc but JK Rowling has combined them into a very entertaining plot.I may be guilty of reading too much into the book, but what impressed me more than the creativity of the universe that Rowling has created is the undertone of menace and darkness that is present in the book. Yes, good does eventually triumph over evil and yes, it would be fun to be able to perform magic. But good is also tempted by evil (Harry's initial meeting with Draco Malfoy, the Sorting Hat's attempt to place Harry into Slytherin) and power (ie. magic) is a double-edged sword to be used either for good (Harry and friends) or evil (Voldemort and minions). There are scenes in the book that surprised me with their maturity. One of them concerns the centaur Firenze in the Forbidden Forest in which the consequences of abdicating the responsibility of countering evil whenever it is present are discussed.I am unsure of what some of the criticism of this book is about (ie. promoting &quot;amoral behaviors&quot;). Because in the end, Harry and his friends make the moral choices and they do the right things knowing the significant risks to themselves. How this is &quot;Machiavellian&quot; is a puzzle to me (perhaps the previous reviewer should familiarize himself with the &quot;The Prince&quot; by Nicolo Machiavelli).Overall, I would strongly recommend this book for both adults and children. It's fun and it takes you into an unique universe. I also think that it would be worthy for an adult to discuss the underlying themes of this book with a child who reads it. Too bad that the movie edits out most of the more complex material."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes I borrowed that title from the book of the same name.I hope this will not be edited for comments OTHER than a review on the book because I feel many other things have been attached to this book that concern parents of different faith's. Caught up in curiosity of all the hype, a few weeks after it's release I went (to my mother's objection) to see The film based on this book. In curiosity of where the film lacked I turned to read the novel of the same name. Where did I find myself after checking it out for myself? Like all things that attract children Harry Potter is filled with ALL the things Children love. Magic, Fantasy, Courageous boy/girl characters, and a villian that is scary but you know he'll get it in the end. Its a formula that Rowling just couldn't fail with. Its why this book series is so popular.These books are MEANT for children. So my complaints about them being a bit Juvenile at times, is not valid, I'm just an adult looking at it from my point of view. My mother hasn't read or seen the movie and she thinks its all witch craft poisoning young minds. I was quick to remind her that she let me watch GhostBusters when I was very young, and other movies of the Supernatural and weird. And I turned out (so far) a well adjusted, Good hearted Christian.There are far worse things in this world left to poison the minds of children. (Music, Tv, Movies) Harry Potter is just a witch hunt so we can blame all thats wrong on whats popular at the time. Harry Potter's first book was, to me, lacking alot of emotional depth, which I also felt the movie lacked aswell. There is lots to fill the senses but very little that touches the heart. My hopes, in continuing the series, is to find the heart I know it can develope. I have picked up the second book, already feeling more for the characters, and this odd little boy we call Harry.Its written very simplisticly, and get's to the point very quickly. These books are not for any kids younger then ten, because Children should have a good sense of whats make believe and whats real to read these books. Its not so much for YOUNGER kids but for the pre-teen crowd. It is dark at times, and thats an added bonus for us older readers.Where will these stories take Harry?, as I continue the series with every book. I am honestly intrigued, and I think you will be too.So what are Christian's to do about all this? Make it known that REAL witch craft is not fun or to be dealed with. But don't burn poor harry at the stake, for the mistakes of others. Fantasy can be fun, as long as it stays a fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes I am 10 but I still loved the book. Like many others i just read or started the book on the 3 day weekend (well for us at least). Anyway I found the book so great i just wouldnt stop, but my parents caught me reading it at 4 am and grounded me. Well dont laugh but at first I had thought the book was childish like some had thought of the other Fairy Tells but I read them in 1999 I think and couldnt get in to them and laid the book down at page 63 exactaly. But then I saw the peviews of the movies and looked facanated with them ( I thought the previews were so great that my stmache would learch and would try so hard to hide my exhillaration and smile). So after tat I wouldnt let the books down and read the first and secon book in about a 24 hour period. Read the 3 book in another day and finished the 4th in a day. GREAT BOOKS!!! People have had riots on the books recently and I FOUND NO CONTENT AGAIN RELIGOUS BACKROUND wat-so-ever in the books words.(Im Cathloic) Again at the end of the book i was so moved and i dont know why but i just kinda got all tearry eyed. And I tought the best book with the second novel JK wrote. It sacared my pants OFF. Thank you for whoever read this and i hope you found this very useful."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I admit, I had never read any of these books until recently. I've been reading fantasy all my life, and I have always loved Lord of the Rings, the Shannara series, the Thomas Covenant books, and many others. But, I had somehow managed to avoid the HP phenomenon. With the upcoming release of the movie and the accomapnying hoopla, plus all the tirades against this book from the Far Right (I'm a Christian, by the way), my curiosity was aroused enough to finally pick up this book.I read through it in two days. It was an excellent book, though obviously written for kids. But, this 32 year-old, college-educated reader enjoyed it thoroughly. It is, to me, very reminiscent of children's fantasy of the past, especially the Oz series and the Chronicles of Narnia.The plot of the book is already, I'm sure, familiar to most of you out there: Harry Potter goes to live with his cold, unloving relatives after the sudden and mysterious death of his parents when he is but an infant. On Harry's 11th birthday, he finds out the truth about his parents - they were wizards, and he is too. Plus, he has been accepted into the prestigious Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft for a seven-year training period to become a full-fledged wizard.My favorite part of the book deals with the game Quidditch - a kind of polo-like game, but with a few twists, such as the presence of the Snitch and the fact that the game is played on broomsticks. Another highlight of the book is Harry's trip to the Diagon Alley shopping mall - I'd love to do some Christmas shopping there!Some have criticized this book as &quot;a tool of the devil&quot;, but this is COMPLETELY untrue. This book is nothing more or less than a harmless work of fiction. There is nothing in here that's even remotely anti-Christian. They even celebrate Christmas, for goodness' sake! It's a great childrens' book that is enjoyable for adults, too. If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone J.K. Rowling uses setting and suspense very well. Rowling sets up the book on Privette Drive. This is home to the Dursleys who are Harry's relatives. Rowling shows in great detail how the Dursleys act and how hard it is to live with them. Rowling also uses suspense to get the reader involved in the book. I didn't want to put the book down. I will admit that in the beginning though the book was rather stale. It takes too long to get to the exciting parts in the book. One of the most suspensful parts is when Harry has to face Voldemort in the end to try and save the Sorcerer's Stone, and all of the wizarding world.

My friend, this is your book. Combining fantasy elements with a storyline that you can actually follow, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the beginning of a wildly popular series.Harry's story begins at Number Four, Privet Drive. He is staying with his aunt, Petunia, his uncle, Vernon, and the kid who is the new definition of the word \\"obese\\", Dudley. Harry hates it there- and they hate him being there. However, Harry's life changes on his 11th birthday, when he receives a letter stating that he has been accepted into Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unfortunately for Harry, Aunt and Uncle refuse to let him go... that is, until Hagrid bursts into their house and takes harry with him.As the story progresses, Harry gets a lot of new friends, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and a few enemies, like the nasty Potions teacher, Severus Snape. From the beginning to the end, including a harrowing scene with Harry, Lord Voldemort, and the Stone, J.K. Rowling weaves a terrific tale.

They were fascinated by this new world and new images. A good book and a good story should encourage discussion and thinking - HP and the Sorcer's Stone delivers!! We spent time discussing what had happened, rehashed the hints and clues, tryed to guess what would happen next. As soon as I finished the last page, they immediately handed me the second the book and expected me to keep reading without a pause. I expect them both to go back and read this book when their reading skills have improved. I know they will both enjoy the book again and again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book. Do not think this book is just for kids (I am 14 and still found it a very absorbing book). I hope J.K. Rowling releases plenty more of these books even past when Harry graduates Hogwarts. I recommend this to everyone (but I bet you some overzealous hypocritical activist group will protest against it)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter was a very famous child but his fame was unknown to him until his eleventh birthday. Harry grew up in a closet with a brat for a cousin, Dudley. Harry makes you feel sad and glad for him at the same time. You are sad because he is mistreated and yet glad because he is at least not like the people who are raising him. Harry manages to get a few on them also as the plot thickens. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon have their work cut out for them when they try to keep Harry from his real mother and father's former school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft. We see Harry in his attempts to make his stand many times in this book. He becomes brave and courageous and you would never believe he was treated so miserably due to his very warm and considerate treatment to his friends. This story communicates many themes. The most prevalent theme is that of loyalty. Hagrid's loyalty to Harry's parents saved Harry from a cruel existence. The loyalty and honor of the friends that Harry made at school was expressed. The loyalty and admiration that Professor McGonagall and Dumbledore expressed for Harry and his parents was extremely enduring and strong. Other themes are friendship, companionship, child abuse, and of course self worth. As a media specialist I highly prefer this book among other fantasy due to the areas involved in the book such as loyalty, peer relations, child abuse, social skills, honesty, and just plain good literature for young adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The best way to enjoy this extraordinary book by a gifted author is to first read the book and then listen to Jim Dale. I say this advisedly since I have only listened to the four books (in my car driving to work and on vacation). However, the joy of reading should not be lost. My son, Geoff, has first read the books and now is listening to them - and is thrilled again. This wonderful combination of both gifted author and actor should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that this book was a wounderful book for all ages and it was interesting throughout the whole book. It is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I thought that the whole Harry Potter series were great and kept getting better in each book. These are my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an amazing book. It is the first book out of a set of 4 books. The author, J.K Rowling, is probably one of the most brilliant authors ever. It is amazing the way that she weaves each and every part of the book together. This book is full of twists and leaves the reader not wanting to put the book down. The 4 Harry Potter books that J.K Rowling has written so far are 4 realy amazing books, each one longer and better then the one coming before it. The first book, and the 3 that follow it are compelling and unpredictable. If you are unsure on whether you want to begin reading the Harry Potter series or not, I highly reccomend that you do, because I am sure that you will enjoy them very much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This first in the series of Harry Potter books is very imaginative and entertaining. Harry Potter is a young wizard temporarily raised in a world of non-wizards. When he reaches a certain age where he can be accepted for the famous wizard school \`Hogwarts', he is sent for by a giant and amusing experiences follow, eventually arriving at the school. The excitement really begins after that point with all sorts of magic potions, spells, charms, witches, wizards, very humorous ghosts, and much more! This book is filled with the imagination that spans several generations of readers, from children on up into adulthood. You can not help but be captured by the writing creativity of J.K. Rowling, as the story grows and grows and grows. You will simply love it! This is by far the most refreshing series of books that has come along in a very long time. Rowling is definitely on to something new and exciting, and I tip my hat to her. The world of Harry Potter is a great place to get lost in imagination. Exciting adventure for one and all!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After reading bad news in the paper, and watching the world's situation today, this book gave me an oportunitty to drift away in to a magical world, every time I picked up this book. I was amazingly refreshing and gave a very complete message. I'm reading the sequel immediately."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For the past year or two my little sister had been trying to get me to read her Harry Potter books, but I never did. Finally she mailed the first one to me and made me promise to read it. I finally got to it a few weeks ago, and I couldn't put it down the whole night! I had to borrow the next books from my friend and finished all of them within a week and a half, (not a smart thing considering this was during finals week). But needless to say, since then, I have become yet another Harry Potter fan and I've promised my sister I'd take her when the movie comes out :) Harry Potter is a wonderful series, and the first book is my favorite one. Honestly, I didn't think I'd enjoy them, but they remind me of elementary school when we read all those Roald Dahl books. J.K. Rowling recreates the magic of *Matilda* and *The BFG* in an amazing way. I can't wait til the 5th book comes out!! (hurry up!!!) Whenever I join the fantasies of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, I feel like I'm 10 again!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As you may have noted, this book is cataloged under the age group of nine to twelve. However, you may have also recognized that many, if not most, of those who you hear raving about Harry Potter do not fit into this age group. I personally was worried that this would be too much of a &quot;kids book,&quot; but by the end of the book, I knew that my worries were ludicrous.As an infant Harry survived an attack from the most powerful dark wizard, for which he bears a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lighting bolt. His parents, distinguished wizards themselves, were killed in the same massacre. The only family left are his aunt and uncle, who are as Muggle (those who aren't wizards, warlocks, etc. and don't understand magic) as is possible. Harry lives with them, and their incorrigible son, Dudley, for ten grueling years. The story really kicks in, however, when Harry is sent off to Hogwarts, where he will begin to learn magic. His adventures are enthralling, and the book easily makes and eager reader out of anyone, regardless of age. I look foward to reading the others!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A few years ago my mother INSISTED on getting me this book. I am not a fantisy type reader so i blew it off in a sec. Thats when the magic of Rowling took over. I picked up the book read a few pages and was hooked I read for 2 hours every night till i was done.(about a month) Now 2 years later i have all the books and 2 on Tape. Its GREAT! Hey you dont have to be 6-12 to know a good book! &lt;|:-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must admit I was more than a little skeptical when a friend of mine recommended the Harry Potter series. What could possibly be so captivating about the adventures of some freakishly furry horticulturalist? Was I in for a shock! Somehow, J.K. Rowling makes planting fun, exciting even. I found I couldn't get enough of Harry's sage adventures, and after speeding through several volumes, have developed not one but TWO very green thumbs!!! Thanks Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a marvelous book to read because once you put your eyes on it you will never take them off. The middle of the book is so interesting. The book is about a boy called Harry Potter who had a witch and wizard for parents. They went to Hogwarts Academy for Witches and Wizards. Harry lives with his miserable uncle and his aunt. One day when Harry went to get the mail, he found a letter addressed to him. They letter told him that he could go to Hogwarts. Harry didn't even know he was a wizard! It's a very eye-popping book because it is full of awesome details and there are some really cool pictures! I read this book in just one weekend. Hurry up and buy it before it runs out!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book tells you the real meaning of life, and it explains how a little boys life can go from famous to totaly bumbed. The heart of a little boy broken in half by his mean uncle and aunt, not to mention his puff ball cousin. The adventures just begin and Harry Potter has more to learn about his once grand life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I originally bought this book for my nine-year old daughter after reading the rave reviews but couldn't quite believe how it could be *that* great. It was! I read aloud to her, but found I had to finish it when she had gone to bed. I don't know how Rowling made a story so fantastic so believable, but she did. Maybe it isn't fantasy????? Loved the British boarding school references. Very funny, and am glad it has been popular in the United States too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. A really good part is when the Monster guy almost eats Harry and his friends. I would highly, highly, highly recomend this book to any age group. Me and my friends all love this book. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"At 18 years I am probably too old to be reading children's books but 'Harry Potter And The Philosophers Stone' was just too good to put down. It had all the elements of an Enid Blyton boarding school book but J.K Rowling made these ideas seem fresh again. I particularly enjoyed the ending where Harry, Ron and Hermione have to race against time to get to the stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was without doubt the best book I've ever read. I read one of it's chapters online and got hooked. I've orderded the sequel and I can't wait for it to come. Harry is a great character. This is a good book for anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very well written book that immediately captures your interest right from the start. There are many parts of the story that cause even people who don't read much to smile (the booger flavored Jelly Bean, platform Nine and Three Quarters, etc.). Once you finish reading this book, you simply can't wait to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Magic is a thing to wonderful to discribe&quot;.Thats what I thought when I sat down to read &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.I was wrong.

I just recently moved into high school, and I was feeling kind of numb. I love to read, but I hadn't read a good book in a long time. One day, I went to the library and checked out Harry Potter. My friends had all been telling me to read it. So I did. And I LOVED it! I stayed up 'til midnight four nights in a row to read it. (That didn't help my staying awake in class very much, or my paying attention.) The world of Harry Potter is like no other. J. K. Rowling is a genius to create such real characters and experiences. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes me want to get out of my drab Geometry class and go study Charms with Harry, Ron, and Hermione. While sweeping my kitchen floor, I find myself wondering what it would be like to play Quidditch on a Nimbus Two Thousand! Rowling's characters are lovable and exciting, from the trouble-making Peeves to the lovable giant Hagrid to the repulsive Muggle Uncle Vernon. The world of Hogwarts is fantastic, a creative wonderland. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book for people of all ages, of every personality. I am going to buy J. K. Rowling's book right away, and I look forward to reading all the rest!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Everyone talks all about Harry Potter and I wonder what it is about Harry Potter that everyone loves. I decided to read the book and I was taken to a far away adventure! The whole style and language of the book was very vivid and touching. You have many funny moments with the Dursleys, but you also go on adventures with Ron and Hermione. You love Dumbledore, Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione, but most of all, you LOVE Harry. There are moments of fun and excitement, but at the same time there are very tense and shocking scenes, which makes you continue reading on, wondering what will happen next.The book also brings feelings that are hard to describe. Being a teenager, I have forgotten much from when I was young. But when I read this book, I regained my childhood. I remembered all of the feelings and thoughts a child could have. Harry Potter has the qualities of a young person, in which one can be confused, but also brave and strong. Reading this book brings much hope and courage for the reader as well.ALL ages will love this book. My father has been reading this book out loud to my family and all of my family loves it. We love the humor and I myself love the tensity, adventure, and everythin else in this book. We love Harry's friends, we get mad at his opponets, and we share the feelings. Wonder, amazement, suspense, courage, and fun can all be found in this quintessential book. This is a big must! You will purely love Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You will need the batteries because you will find yourself reading this book late, late into the night. My mother (I'm 33) said I needed to read this book. So I grudgingly abliged, you know how mothers can be. I figured it would be a quick book I could skim, and be done with it. Instead I am yet another Muggle who is hooked.I finished this book in less than two nights. My co-workers noticed that it seemed that I was very sleepy at work. But, I could not put the book down.We are introduced to an 11 year old just before his birthday, which will not be celebrated by his Aunt and Uncle. After this introduction you will be wisked away to Hogsworth a school for young witches and wizards. Not all is fun and games, there is serious studying there (sometimes). In addition to learning about his parents, meeting other students who think he is not an outcast, Harry, Ron and Hermonie are drawn into the mystery on the 3rd floor. Never tell a curious person not to go somewhere unless that is where you really want them to go. These three teach us all how each person has their own strengths, and they will all be usefull at some point in time.J.K. Rowling introduces us to characters that are described so well that you can actually see them in your head. I found myself chearing on some characters and booing at others.This book should be mandatory reading for all kids, an ADULTS. Imagination is to be cherished.If you like the Madeline L'Engle books, or the Black Cauldron Series, this series is a must for you! (Adults and kids alike)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought the Harry Potter books for my 13 year old son. While waiting for an appointment I began reading and did not put it down until I finished all three of the books. (I even admit to reading them all a second time, and enjoyed them just as much- or more!). This is a brilliant series of books that are not only for children. They combine the trials and tribulations of a growing adolescent today with a rich and magical world of make-believe. The vocabulary is complex and creative, and my entire family is now 'hooked' on Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My friend was reading the Harry Potter books and his mom suggested that I should get some. So I went to the store and saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I bought this book and started reading. From the beginning to the end I could not stop reading it. Every chapter had one suprise after another, and after I was done I couldn't wait to get the 2nd one.(Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.) This book is a must read for anyone who likes action, mystery, or if you just feel like reading a good book.I reccomend it highly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 34 years old and finally decided to read this book because my 10 year old daughter is enchanted by it. She has read each in the series several times. I thought that I would struggle through it (as I've done with the C.S. Lewis series that she also adores), but I was very pleasantly surprised. I have read all three in the series and look forward to the fourth release. The characters are well developed and the plot is not entirely based on magic -- there is real human drama and truth about adolescent trials. Parents will enjoy reading this book and they will enjoy the peacefulness of a house without the blare of the tv."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter ruined my life. From this title, you probably wouldn't think that I liked this book. In fact, I liked it a little bit too much (I didn't say that). See, being the captain of the football and the wrestling team, it is pretty hard to keep my &quot;tough guy&quot; image while being seen reading a book such as Harry Potter. The story is about a little boy, Harry, whose parents died, and he is sent to live with his Aunt and Uncle. Harry is not a normal boy though, he is a wizard, and if there is one thing that his aunt and uncle hates, its anything to do with wizardry. He is treated terribly and he is forced to live in a dark cabinet under the stairs. Harry escapes though, with the help of Hagrid, a groundskeeper at Hogwarts, a school for wizardry, which is where Harry was to be going. At Hogwarts, Harry meets friends and has many adventures, including one that puts him face to face with the evil dark lord that killed his parents, and he found that the reason why he was able to survive from the attack of this villian was because of the love that his mother showed for him, as she died trying to protect him from danger. After I finished the first book, I had to read all three. I was reading them day and night, and this prevented me from sleeping and even doing homework. Yes of course I would recommend this to someone else. This book has everything, from killing and dark evil to savage beasts, and maybe when you get into the later books, you might see a touch of romance, all with that little dose of magic mixed in."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read this book and its 2 sequels after begging for them for months. It was even better than I imagined! I read all 3 of them in one day. I'm waiting for the sequels. I also suggest to read The Redwall Series as well as books by Edgar Rice Borroughs( John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, etc...) I am now in the process of re-reading them. I am a 14 year old boy and if I like it everyone will!

A warning, though: you'll probably have to reserve it if you go to your local library -- ours has about 25 copies of EACH Harry Potter book and they're perpetually all checked out!This is a book to engage a child's imagination, enable her moral development and sense of self-worth, and, for those of us a wee bit older, to return us to a more innocent time in our lives. It's an absolute delight.If you like Harry Potter, try my other favorite childhood book: ''The Phantom Tollbooth'', by Norton Juster. It's about a boy named Milo who finds everything dull and boring until, one day, a mysterious package arrives. On the package is a note: ''To Milo, who has plenty of time....''"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm over 30 and I LOVE Harry Potter! These books are just wonderful, every one of them kept me engrossed and surprised right up to the end. Just when I thought I had it figured out, the story would take a turn and I'd be wondering what would happen next again. Beautifully written, and great, complex characters!As for some of the criticisms, well, makes you wonder if the same people would give 1 star to the Hobbit, Narnia, and the Wizard of Oz books, classics that include quite a bit of magic and wizardry. All of these books have death in them as well, sometimes featured quite prominently, but I would certainly consider them great children's books regardless. Harry Potter is certainly in the same vein as these.As for saying it's unrealistic, HELLO! It's fantasy! It's not *supposed* to be completely realistic. Again, I would consider the Lord of the Rings one of the great books of our time, but you could say it was unrealistic too, with all the elves and dwarves and wizards. But that doesn't mean it doesn't draw you into that other world and make you imagine what it would be like. The characters become real people to you and that's what makes it great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is amazing! It was sooooooo great!

I have not looked forward for a moment of silence to escape into a book for some time - tonight I do. Some life hunh? but at least its not as bad as Harrys was with his Aunt and Uncle.

So I went and bought this book. My mum had also read the second book in the series, and she even paid $2.95 of this book so she could read it too! I even convinced my dad to read it! Just like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was a great book. It is exciting, funny and a bit scary too. I didn't want to put it down at all, because I was always wanting to find out what was going to happen next, and if everything was going to be okay. Everything that happens is completely unexpected.

While with his aunt and uncle's house he gets a letter to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At school he had two friends named Ron and Hermoine.

Ron is a friend of Harry's. He is with him all the time. He has red hair who's entire family went to Hogwarts. Lord Voldemort lost all his powers by trying to kill Harry. He killed Harry's parents. He is the greatest dark wizard ever. Albus Dumbledore is the principle of Hogwarts. He is very old and has a big beard. He is the only person Lord Voldemort is afraid of.

To say it had been highly recommended was an understatement, yet I could hardly bring myself to read a children's book. In the beginning, I was aware of the simple writing style and I had to coax myself into giving the book a chance. Very shortly after that, I found myself lost in the story. It is an exceptionally creative and delightful story about a young wizard boy who ultimately triumphs over evil. I am so glad I read it, and as soon as I finish this review, I plan to start the next story in the series. This book was easy to read and incredibly enjoyable. I still cannot believe it is a children's book. I liked it so very much!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was recommended to me by many peers so I chose to read it, and it was amazing. The book takes you on an adventure, one that I have never experienced. There is so much detail the book almost comes to life, in fact it does come to life in the theaters but that being a whole other story. J.K. Rowling and her novel Harry Potter is a book for all ages. It being easy to understand but at the same time containing some intellectual thought. By reading the first one, I know it will be impossible to not continue on and read the rest of Harry Potter and the amazing experiences he and all the characters go through.

How would you feel if your parents died and you were sent to live with your aunt and uncle who lie to you about your parents past? Finally, how would you feel if a man you had never seen before show up on your birthday and told you every secret that your aunt and uncle have been keeping from you? This is the enchanting story of a boy who lost his parents due to an evil wizard and is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to become a great wizard and uncover his past. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is an excellent book and a great read for everyone, even if you hate to read. J.K. Rowlings ability to keep the reader interested and guessing is amazing. She has the ability to tell great stories that will interest all age levels. I have not come across one person who has read this book and not fallen in love with it. It is a fast read and the pages will seem to fly by.

The first time I could not believe how wonderful it was and raved about it to everyone. Now to all you morons who gave this book 1 star and said the writing was terrible must be blind or maybe we're not reading the same book. The amount of hype and praise for this series is well earned.

Like everyone else in the world, I desperately look forward to more Harry Potter Books in the future."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I recently got into Harry Potter when I bought the latest Harry Potter book over the summer to check out what the hype was all about over this popular series. It is safe to say that I was immediately hooked. So for Christmas, I asked for the paperback set of the first four Harry Potter books (which I got of course). I have yet to begin reading the other three books since I am 3/4 way of finishing \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". I am enjoying the book immensely. It is nice to know how Harry ended up at Hogwarts and met his two best friends Ron and Hermione. Although the Harry Potter series was geared towards children, it is also makes for excellent reading for adults who just want to escape from the confines of reality. J.K Rowling does an excellent job at fleshing out the characters, including the Dursleys (Harry's awful relatives) who usually appears in the books in the beginning and the end. Another quality I like about J.K's writing abilities is that she doesn't make Harry out to be some perfect, flawless hero. Like anyone else, Harry is human and has his own faults. He and Ron often get into trouble through out the book and are punished for their actions. I still fail to grasp how some conservatives such as John Hagee would think that the Harry Potter books could promote witchcraft or satanism is beyond me. Thanks to J.K Rowling, children (and adults) are putting down the remote control and picking up her books. I'm glad to have discovered the joys of reading the adventures of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. The plot and the storyline are fantastic. It's like you are right there hating who Harry hates liking who Harry likes. You want to jump in the book and help him. Even though the books climax is at the end the begining is by no means boring. You get so wrapped up in the book that you don't want to put it down even if you have to stay up all night. This is the type of book that you can read over and over and it will never get boring. When you reread it you notice little connections, like in the begining Dumbldore says to McGongall he likes lemon drops and that is what the password to his office is. This is defonitly a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a great book about a famous wizard named Harry Potter who's parents died in a tragic death by a bad wizard and he lives with his aunt and uncle.When he finally knows the truth about his parents and being a famous wizard he is sent to Hogwarts a school for wizards and witches.Itis his first year and he does'nt know any magic!But he learns quickly and gets friends.Then diaster strikes!

Harry groes up with the Dursleys and doesn't know anything about his parents of his magical powers. When Harry meets Hagrid, he tells him all about his past, parents, and his gift of magic. Hagrid told the story of how his parents were killed by a powerful wizard. Hagrid told Harry about the new school for wizards called Hogwarts Harry would be attending. Hagrid took Harry to buy all the things he needed for school. When Harry got on the train to his school he met Ron, Hermione, and Neville who were all going to the same school he was. When they got to the school a talking hat told them what house they would be rooming in. Harry and all the others were in the same room as him Gryffindor. Snape was the most hated teacher in the whole school thought Harry and his friends. They also thought Malfoy was the most hated student in the whole school. Later on in the book, secrets start to unfold and Harry and his friends are determined to get to the bottom of all the mysteries that appear one after another. I definitely recommend this book to everyone. This book is great and shoud be read by everyone. This 309 page book can be read very easily and doesn't take that long to complete.

I had no idea that it was such an enchanting book, but I was pleasantly surprised. Harry Potter, for his whole life, has been just another kid. He lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin, who torment Harry. He lives under the stairs in a cupboard, he gets scrapes of food, his birthday is always overlooked, and he is unloved. Harry is stuck with this family because his parents died in a car crash when he was little (or so he was told). But suddenly, with the arrival of a strange letter, Harry's life is spun around. Before he knows it, he finds out he's a wizard, as were his parents, and that he's accepted to attend a wizarding school. Soon Harry realizes there's a whole world out there that he never knew existed. And he learns that he is famous in this world. Harry's parents did not die in a car crash at all, they were murdered by the evil wizard Lord Voldemort. Somehow, through trying to kill Harry, too, Voldemort was defeated and is now barely alive somewhere. But learning about his past is just the beginning of Harry's adventure as he heads off to the wizarding school, Hogwarts. He soon learns about things he never thought of existing; wizarding games, tools, even food. His classes include things like potions, spells, and other wizardry. Along with classes, Harry gets something he's never had before, friends. As Harry makes it through his first year of school, he finds himself in one the greatest adventures of his life. Will Harry survive against the evil wizarding forces? The adventure and magic is all found in this book. I would definitly recommend this book. It is simply enchating and delightful. I have also read all the sequals, and can't wait for the next book to come out. I'm another spell-bound, Harry Potter fan."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is well written and fun for all ages to read.

And it is definitely over-rated. I also admit that the charaters are flat and their actions predictable. However, the magic and imagination of Rowling are good enough for me.

It is very cool when they use magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone you are taken through an adventure outside of our world into the imagination of all people. This piece of literature uses imagery and symbolism to show the reader what it would be like to be in many of our dreams. Harry Potter allows you to become a kid again; it allows you to have an imagination that many people miss out on.Hogwarts school of Wizardry is a wondrous place that seems like the dream of many people in the world. When Harry receives numerous letters of hope he has a certain curiosity that all people can relate to. Harry Potter uses many instances of symbolism in it. For example the mirror that Harry finds in the mysterious and secretive parts of the school shows him his parents. This is a look into the past for Harry, but a part of his past that he never experienced. He grew up knowing nothing of what he had once had and what would soon come about in his life.When reading Harry Potter it is like you are there. It is a fairytale that everyone wishes they could too experience. J.K. Rowling expresses many things using imagery in this book, with an amount of detail that would be close to impossible to express. For example, \\"Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle...\\" (pg.109). Even the most random unimportant texts, like the previous one, in the book express detail to paint a picture in your mind of what is going on.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is strengthened by the immaculate word choice used by J.K, Rowling. Harry Potter becomes a fantasy that no one will ever experience and can convince you to believe that anything is true and that anything in our world is possible."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone implies that direct characterization can make a novel more exciting because it makes the reader feel like they know the character personally. The main character in this book is Harry Potter. He has a very confusing life with many problems and obstacles he has to overcome, however with the literary device of direct characterization readers can sense how he is feeling at times.The author, J.K. Rowling, did a wonderful job using this literary device. Direct characterization is when an author directly tells their audience what to think of a character. This is represented numerous times throughout the book. At the beginning of the story the author lets the reader know that Harry does not like where he is at all, and that he is not being treated correctly. Because the reader knew that, it gave them a sense of how he was going to feel the rest of the story and the tone that it would carry for the remainder of the novel.Although direct characterization gave readers a feel of the tone and emotions of the character, it did not present its self consistently during the novel. It was not regularly letting the reader know Harry's emotions of what was going on, and confused the reader of his feelings.To conclude, direct characterization is a literary device that applies knowledge to a reader of how the character is feeling, and keeps the reader interested."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The INCREDIBLE MAGIC WORLD starts with this book...all the fun and all the scares.

This book was a real page turner. Once you open it you dont want to stop reading.I gave this book 4 stars for a few reasons. The first reason is because this book is very well writen. Another reason is becasue it is not like any other book. It is vey original. The characters in this story are great because the way J.K. Rowling writes you really know what the characters are like.

Harry's first year at Hogwarts brings trials, tribulations, realizations, and acceptance through friendships that are sure to last through his seven years in wizarding school.

Her descriptive language draws you into the setting and you can feel Harry's emotions throughout the entire novel. It is definitely a family story!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...J.K. Rowling's debut is a fanciful one and will be rightfully regarded as a classic even 100 years from now. It is timeless. It speaks to the adventurous child in all of us; young, middle-aged or old, it doesn't matter. It is an especially fascinating read for a child, no doubt; however, it is also works for us adults as well. It is far more entertaining than some of the old British classics, such as THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS, but it offers the same timeless feel. Indeed, we can easily place ourselves in the young titular hero's shoes because, as he himself says at the beginning, \\"I'm just Harry.\\" Just an ordinary kid--could be any one of us. Of course, he isn't just any one of us--but what if...??Obviously, it would be a complete waste of time and energy to write a full-on plot summary of this or any Harry Potter books, so I will not do so. I do want to point out that I saw...the film version of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE first. I loved it and thereby became anxious to read the book from which it had been adapted. Of course, I was already aware from others of the fact that the film had stuck very closely to the book; however, it still amazed me as to how close the filmic adaptation actually was. Not that it mattered in the slightest; HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is an extraordinary debut novel from a very gifted storyteller. Especially coming out when it did, on the heels of the mindless Pokemon craze, it accomplished the seemingly impossible task of getting kids to read. That is the most monumental legacy that a book can ever have. The story of Harry Potter is timeless and--thank God--not merely a passing fad. Now I just need to catch up on the other books..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneBy: J. K. RowlingReviewed by: T. SunPeriod: 1Harry Potter was and orphan who was forced to live with is Aunt, Uncle, and cousin. Harry Potter was miserable for the first ten years of his life until the fateful day when he received a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a day of shopping in Diagon Alley, Harry waits for the train that'll take him to his new school. Once there, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor, one of the four houses at Hogwarts. Harry learns that he is a famous boy for vanquishing the evil wizard Lord Voldemort. As the year goes on, Harry has become the Seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He has also discovered what lies hidden in Hogwarts, the Sorcerer's Stone. It has the power to turn metal into gold and produces the Elixir of Life. In the end, Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through the trapdoor and stop Professor Quirrell from giving the Stone to Voldemort.I loved this book because it is told in a way that the author is actually is a kid. She tells the story like she knows what kids today are like, and I like that. An example of Rowling's understanding is this: \\"Harry smile weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot: Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. It only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\"Another reason why I like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is that it has a lot of fantasy. An example of fantasy would be this: \\"All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.\\" It's a very interesting description of a dragon. It's really cool.My favorite part of the book was when Harry was playing Quidditch against Slytherins. It was really exciting and I really liked the way the game went. I was worried when Harry was about to fall off his broom, but I was relieved Hermione managed to distract Quirrell from jinxing Harry's broom. I was very content in the end of the game when Gryffindor won. I was funny that Harry nearly swallowed the Golden Snitch."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 34 years old and hadn't even heard of Harry Potter.

This upsets me. It's fine for parents to decide want their kids can and can not read, but when you pull your child from school becuase of one book, you seriously need to think about how that will effect the childs abition to read latter on in life. Anothe thing. When your child reaches high school and it's required for him to read certian books for grades.

Then, there were the Internet warnings saying that since Harry Potter did not mention in any of its series about God, then it must be the work of the other side. Well, years after, I finally decided to take a look at it &amp; decide if it would be a safe read for my children. &amp; here is what I have to say:(1) It is an easy read. Kids age 9 &amp; above will comprehend the plot &amp; the underlying lessons of good &amp; evil. Surprisingly, as an adult, I found it entertaining as well, &amp; couldn't put the book down. It took me only a day to finish this &amp; I immediatly moved on to the next of its series.(2) As for the critics, I would say that this book is a welcome change in the very commercialized novel industry where the books' plots are almost geared to being made to movies (although, by now, a HP movie is already about to be released). It has a different setting, a different kind of characters &amp; therefore a different plot. However, it is no much different from the mugles' (ours) world as good continually battles evil &amp; as we would wish, good always triumphs at the end. &amp; in this light, I would say, if good always prevails, then, there's Divine intervention, &amp; if that's the case, then, this couldn't be the work of the 'dark side.'(3) I admired the way Rowlings created her characters --- full of imperfections. That way, not one single character overshadows the rest. Not even Harry, who we know is far from being muscles nor brain. In defeating his nemesis, he needed the help of his friends, who ont heir own, would not have succeeded either.(4) A little predictable but entertaining.I am giving it 5 stars not because I am a fan of Harry Potter but I believe this (&amp; its sequels) would be a good read for my children, given the above reasons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What's left to say after 3671 other reviewers got here first? Only that J.K. rules - okay?I was introduced to Harry Potter through lots of blurb on T.V., radio, magazines, in fact almost every form of media I can think of. Many years ago, I refused to read Tolkein because everybody else told me I should. This time I was determined not to make the same mistake and, when I met Bloomsbury Books Sales Director on a holiday in the south of France, he convinced me I should give Rowling's books a test drive... Thanks David.At first, I wondered why there were lots of owls flying round the place (as a typical Muggle would). But all became clear a while later when I discovered Hogwart's delivery service. And so I became a convert. Not just to Harry, the central character, but to Hermione and Ron. And I, too, booed the bad guys, Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and most of all, Voldemort. And the Dursleys and their horrible fat son, Dudley. YAACHSo here's a message to all you teeny-boppers who think you've got Harry all to yourselves... you haven't.

This book is the story of a young teenager who is a wizard by birth and is taken to a wizards&#8217; school to learn the trade. The adventures are the best I have ever read on the subject. It completely regenerates the art of wizardry and the literature that comes from it. It is a whole and complete world with real families, real children, real brothers and sisters, friends and fiends. But moreover it is a world deeply possessed by the fight between two different types of magic : the clean and respectable line that is the official one, and the dark line that is trying to take over. This dark line even has its spies and servants in the other line and the fight is always to the finish and death is the stake. The child, Harry Potter, is a brilliant naive and courageous child that has the guts to oppose the dark forces and to defeat them with the help of a brilliant wizard who is working in the wings. But what is most beautiful is that those kids are real kids, with all the interests and the passions of children. It is a mirror of our world that really teaches courage, truthfulness, resistance against bad forces and the need to only rely on real strong convictions and not on vain rules coming from a society that only tries to regulate the chaos we live in and are only able to let the door open for dark forces to take over....Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd heard the hype and wondered what could be so great about a children's book.

I'm over 30 and she's pushing 30 and our older sister thinks we've lost our minds (but just give us time - we'll get her hooked too)!Jim Dale's voices and his dramatization of the narrative made Harry, Ron, Hermione and the whole cast of characters spring to life. He's ruined my enthusiasm for other books on tape that fail to enthrall me... The irritating conceit of Professor Gilderoy Lockhart is still a running joke with us (...Harreeee), and I just love saying the word, &quot;Quidditch&quot;.I may have to resort to old mystery radio shows on tape to fill the void left when I finished listening to the last tape of the series, as I sadly whined to my sister, &quot;It's the last side of the last tape of the last chapter of the last book. There'll be no more after this. What am I to do?&quot;To which my sister quickly replied, &quot;You can always start at the beginning again!&quot;I'm currently listening to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - for the 2nd time!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book tells us about Harry, a boy left to be brought up by his aunt and uncle by some famous magicians.

A testament to this fact- I read it unabashedly on the NY Subway system AND over the course of two days I was approached several times about the book and my thoughts on the story.I highly recommend Harry Potter (1) and look forward to reading on..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not kidding - I try to read to my children every night, and I usually follow along with them and shut the book when they go down, but after a few chapters, I didn't want to put this one down. A couple of times I read a few chapters ahead - I HAD to read the final chapter the other night even though I put my kids to bed... and I still enjoyed finishing it with them. My eight year old even cheered out loud at the end!This is a great book to share with your children. It is magical, fun, and has something for adults and children alike. What a way to get them into a story - with misfits everyone can relate to, where good does conquer evil, and it is OK to stand up for your friends, and even against them when you feel you have to.As we closed the first book and said goodnight, my oldest child was begging me to start on Book 2 - we will hit that one tonight and we can't wait!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Just what is it about Harry Potter? He and his lovely author have incited a reading revolution at a time when reading has been considered on a perpetual decline. Why do children love him so? More importantly, why do so many *adults* love him?First off, 11-year-old Harry Potter makes the perfect hero for a children's story. His parents are dead and he lives with his cruel aunt and uncle. When Harry discovers that his parents were wizards and that he will attend the Hogwarts school to learn to become a wizard himself, his life takes a wonderful turn for the better. Problem is, his aunt and uncle have hidden from him just what and who his parents were. Little Harry has no idea how famous they were (in wizard circles) and how famous he is.In this first book in what has become a real publishing phenomenon, we come really to cheer the (at first reluctant) heroism of Harry and his friends at the delightfully quirky Hogwarts school. As the story progresses, Harry's resolve strengthens as he learns how special he is. What keeps the reader frantically turning the pages is the suspense that Miss Rowling deftly builds chapter after chapter. Will Harry be victorious? Will his courage and resolve continue to grow and thrive?So why do so many adults respond so favorably to Harry Potter? After all, this is *children's* literature. I think that adults love Harry Potter for the same reasons that children do. Harry Potter is a true hero. Since authors of adult fiction have long since abandoned heroism, something had to fill the void.As young readers of the Harry Potter books grow up, perhaps they will demand the return of romanticism in fiction. Perhaps they will discover the great romantic writers like Ayn Rand and Victor Hugo. Perhaps they will even write their own stories and novels about people, places and events that can and should exist. Until then, we still have Harry Potter.In closing, there are two words I would like to say to Miss Rowling: thank you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What a delightful tale! Immediately after finishing it, I sent it to my 19 and 20 year old knowing that neither would be able to resist. I was right. The 20-year old couldn't put it down. The story is fast-moving, grips the reader from the first chapter, and transforms the reader to the bizarre world of magic. It's wonderful for the avid reader as well as the not-so-advanced reader because the words contained therein are words for which we aren't instructed of the &quot;correct pronunciation&quot; so however one reads it, is exactly correct. I was reminded of &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth,&quot; another well-loved story that we've read to and enjoyed with the boys when they were young. Harry Potter is irresistable. It's as though we've all known there existed a parallel world and the author has managed to take us there where we are instantly delightfully swept away in the adventures of these totally lovable characters. This is my definition of a masterpiece! Reading this book to your favorite kid will undoubtedly bring you the finest quality time you can create. Reading this book to yourself will touch the most playful parts of your imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You won't read more than ten pages before you start loving thethin, bespeckled boy known as Harry Potter. He lives in a cupboardunder the stairs with his aunt and uncle, since his parents were killed when he was an infant. They don't like him at all, nor does his cousin Dudley, the spoiled brat who occupies himself with bullying Harry.The novel takes off, and soon we learn that harry is the son of two magical parents who were killed by an evil wizard--but that Harry somehow was able to defeat the wizard and live. Now he is called to go to the wizard school to learn to fly brooms and do magic spells.Rowling's tale is charming and bursts with imagination on every page. Hardly without noticing, she brings you into her world, where the rules are turned on their heads, where pictures always move, and the impossible is possible. It isn't hard to see why children the world over love Rowling's books.But what makes this first installment of a seven book series more enchanting is that it is equally enjoyable for adults as well as children. I read the first novel in three days--I couldn't put it down. Her book reminds me of two other classic children's tales-- the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis and Tolkien's The Hobbit. But Rowling writes with a lighter note than either of the former, and with a firmer sense of adventure.I laughed out loud--and it has been a very long time since a book made me do that. It is surprising that Rowling is so popular in America, since the book is so very, well, British. But Rowling's characters come to life, they seem to be people we have already met before and are (usually) glad to see again.Be warned: if you are buying this book for a child in your life, be prepared to buy the others. If you are buying it for yourself, be prepared to have a couple of sleepless nights until you finish it.

It is the story of a boy whose parents are killed. He lives with relatives he doesn't exactly get along with but eventually learns he can do a little magic. He goes off to school at &quot;Hogwarts&quot; a school for witches and wizards full of ghosts and magic spells. Here he encounters all sorts of poeple and things, gets into trouble and saves the day! This book is fun for kids and adults. I am the 27 year old nanny of a six year old boy. His parents recently started to read this book to him out loud. I picked the book up this week and started reading it to him in the fourth chapter. I was amazed at how it kept my attention and entertained me. I found I became very involved and wanted to learn more and more about the characters. Before I knew it, I was caught up in the story and began to read it for me, not for the child I keep. I hung on every word and each day, when I left my job, I hoped that the parents wouldn't pick it up and continue reading it...I didn't want to miss out on anything! It is a great book and I highly recommend it. If your child isn't reading much or thinks reading is boring, try this book! The six year old I read it to and I both loved it!

It is very dramatic the way they have Harry waiting for the first stroke of midnight for the day of his birthday and when Dudley's watch rings midnight, suddenly, there is a loud noise and Hagrid the game keeper of the school Hogwarts comes to the light house itself, just to tell Harry, that he is a wizard. J.K.Rowling has written a really good book about magic for children and adults, and it makes me really think there is a school for witch craft and wizardry somewhere on earth. She also made her writing very advanced and as if she was inside the person and was reading his/hers thoughts and then writing them down to make a book about them. Some people say that the movie is better than the book but I think that the book is better because it is more detailed and the scenes and characters make you have a picture of them in your head. It also expresses the opinions of the characters and if you can't hear the people in the movie then you can read them over and over again in the book.I think this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Awesome probably in my top 5 favorite books list. this story is packed with great moments though out the book. the book was so good i could not put it down when i picked it up. before i read this book i was not a harry potter fan. but now i am."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. RowlingPeriod: 1Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great book for all ages. In this story, Harry Potter, a young 11-year-old boy, has found out that he is a wizard, and that he must go to a very good school to learn magic. Though he lives with his dead parents' relatives, he will still go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is a awesome school run by the best headmaster Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore. A strange, large man named Hagrid has come to tell Harry, a orphan, all about his past, and also about how he will leave his relatives, who despised him, and go to a castle school to learn all about magic. There Harry has many adventures, makes lot of new friends, and saves the school from the man that took away his parents, though he couldn't kill Harry, Lord Voldemort. Harry then must return to his house to live with his relatives.I really liked this book. There were a lot of adventerous parts to the story. One of my favorite parts in the story was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione went through the trapdoor to get past all the teachers' enchantments and challenges to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. The first challenge that they have to overcome is the thing that was guarding the Stone, a big three-headed-dog named Fluffy. \\"They played music, and Fluffy went to sleep...\\" said the author. The second challenge was Devil's Snare, which is a plant. The third challenge was a broomstick chase after flying keys to find the door's key. The fourth challenge was to play across a giant life-size chessboard. The fifth challenge was to go past a troll, but someone already had. The sixth and final challenge was to solve a logic puzzle. Those are the challenges that I like about the adventure.There was only one thing that I didn't like about the book. It was the fact that the author didn't describe some of the parts too well. An example from the story is, \\"This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty...\\" says the author. This is detailed, but it wasn't detailed enough. My English teacher always told us that when we write, when we describe, we should always be able to paint a picture in our reader's mind. Some parts in this story don't really do that, though the movie does help with that.My least favorite part in the book was when Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Draco have to into the Dark Forest for detention. This part is very gruesome in my opinion. In the Forest, Draco purposely scares Neville, and Neville freaks out. Then, as Harry and Draco are walking on the path, they see a hooded figure. This hooded figure is wearing a black cloak, obviously with the hood on. The hooded figure was bending over a dead unicorn. The poor creature was having its silver blood drunken by the figure, who advanced on Draco and Harry teh moment he saw them. I got too scared and I couldn't read any more after there. I still love the book Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, though."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is about a young boy named Harry potter who lost his parents in a horrible accident.

This book strikes the perfect balance for humor, adventure, suspense, and even budding romance (Hermonie and Ron).

I asked him why did he read a kids book, and he just said \\"trust me you will enjoy it\\". Over that weekend I started reading, I could not believe how hooked I was I really can not believe that it took me this long to write a review about The Sorcerer's Stone I should have written this the minute I put the book down.All I have to say is this book is really a great book for many reasons first just the story line is not only for kids but a wonderful story about a boy who until one day was just Harry, then you ride on a fantastic journey to a magical other world.When I finished this book I was thinking that this would be a great book for troubled kids, I think this book would almost have some kind of healing power for some kids, just the thought of them reading how a once poor, abused, and neglected Harry had so much power within him and prevailed in his life and saved Hogwarts from Lord Voldemort, in our lives we all at one time have our own Lord Voldemort.I do get a bit upset to hear that some people do not allow their children to read Harry Potter because it has magic, spells, wizards and witches, if my kids get excited reading books and ones that draw them in to reading more books it makes me wonder how harmful can reading be. Do they not let their children watch Snow White or Wizard of Oz?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter, The only person that the Dark Lord Voldermort couldn't kill. It was a mystery why Harry didn't die because whoever stood up to him, died. So Harry's parents died, but luckily he didn'tUnfortunately he was stranded with the worst people to be stranded with when he was only a baby.The reason they were the worst was because they only cared about their only son Dudly. They spoiled him so much it was almost imaginable. They cared for Harry Potter like they would care for a rat. They gave him a little food and either told him to do things for them, or make him go in the cupboard under the stairs.Harry Potter's parents were wizards, and very decent ones so when he turned eleven years old he was eligible to go to Hogwarts School for witchcraft and wizardry. You learn how to do many things magic related. Harry was born a great wizard because his parents were great wizards themselves so it's in his blood. Luckily Harry went to Hogwarts that year because now one even thought that someone was going to steal something great. The thing that was great was the sorcerer's stone. It can turn any metal into gold and it can make you immortal, but if it gets in the wrong hands terrible things will happen. So Harry goes to Hogwarts and saves the Sorcerers Stone from Lord Voldermort.A moment that was very exciting was when he was in the chamber of the sorcerer's stone he had to play an enchanted chessboard but there is a twist, the chessboard pieces actually move! They use one of their weapons and destroy the opponent's chess piece and Harry was one of the chess pieces! So he was risking his life to save the life of others. It came down to the last couple pieces and Harry sacrificed one of his pieces to win the game.The author did many things to make the story interesting, but the most noticeable was cliffhangers. For instance at the mid-end of the book \\"Harry made it past the final challenge. Then the chapter would end, and during the time I was reading the book I only read a chapter a day so I would have to wait until tomorrow because I would want more then a reason to read the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is about a boy named Harry.

Admittedly I find some of her actual style not to my taste but nonetheless, Harry Potter us not a series anyone should miss out on. I think evreyone sould try the books at least once-- and I'm willing to bet more than one wary reader would become hooked as I did!As is characteristic of children's stories (and indeed many adult novels though perhaps not so obvious), the protagonist finds himself in a dull, sometimes even unpleasant, life when a fantastic solution presents itself. And so it is with Harry Potter discovering a wonderful, magical world he never knew!The reader familiarizes him or herself easily along with Harry and through this mutual discovery of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and other parts of this new world, the reader can identify with Harry. &lt;I>Sorcerer's Stone&lt;/i> is a fun read all-around and I'm sure even adults and older teens can enjoy it if they let themselves."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The stories of Harry Potter are definitely some of the most original and creative stories I've read.

When I finished this book (as well as the second one-The Chamber of Secrets) I thought that it was a very well writen children's story. It's almost like a fairy tale. It's not until later that it changes a bit to show that there actually are some serious issues in this fantasy world.

I figured that when i first read it, the reason why i didn't like it was because i wasn't used to reading books that were over 200 pages and i wasnt very familiar with the whole thing.Every time i turned each page, the story became more and more interesting, and I didn't want to put the book down! J.K Rowling is a very clever author. Though i'm not THAT crazy about Harry Potter, I enjoy reading the books alot, and the movies were pretty cool too.

I'd put reading these books off for the better part of three yrs, and when an associate of mine brought the first novel to me a few days ago, telling me that i must read it, that i had to read the magic that was Pottermania, well, i was all set to put it off for another three yrs....you see,everytime a new novel, which happens to be by one of my very favorite authors, as have been listed above, comes out, i usually desert the thought of reading anything else, for that time. Then, between reading a fantastic Bradbury collection of short stories, and a forray into the supernatural written by the enchanting Neil Gaiman, i picked this book up, just wanting to read the synopsis....that went from the first page to the third page, to the one hundredth page....one hundred pages in one sitting!!!! Now, i have done this before, nothing unusaul for me,but with high fantasy, well, i've never been a huge fan of it...which is what made reading this book such an experience.

Proffessors Snape, Messers Quirrell, Hooch, Dumbledore, Hagrid, all supreme creations.....Voldemort, worthy of Stephen King's scope of evil!!! J.K Rowling has instantly made me a fan.

I started the very next book last night,on the toilet no less, also, and already, it looks as though this one will go by in a flash, as did the first one. ..., i read the first one nearly all the way through all in one day. The characterization, the plot, the story elements, the enviornment, all of these things pulled me right into the tale, as they were most assuredly meant to be, i assume. Creative uses for magic, were it to exist(and how do we know that it doesn't?), believable situations, given the tale, and the furthering of several storys all at once, as a whole. If i enjoy the next book as much as i loved the first one, then God, strap me in, and hold me to my seat of imagination, 'cause this is the beginning of something big!!! I applaud Rowling.All Things Serve The Beam......."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I once read that Stephen Spielberg's philosophy of moviemaking was something like the reverse of the low budget strategy of allowing people's imagination to scare them by NOT showing the monster. Spielberg wants to scare the audience by showing the monster in all its glory. That's how I felt about HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. It shows the monster - all the monsters and fantasies that an eleven-year-old might have.Like Spielberg, Rowling only pulls it off because her monster really matches our expectations. In this case, the \\"monster\\" might be an actual monster - a troll, a dragon, an evil wizard, or a metaphorical one - uncaring step parents right out of the central casting of a child's angst; the discovery that, \\"hey,\\" I really am special; teachers who really are out to get me; and bullies that get what they deserve at every corner.The book works first because Rowling does not experiment with too many alien concepts. Centaurs, unicorns, goblins pretty much look and act like a child might expect them to. Other than the annoying \\"Quidditch,\\" game, there aren't too many new magical concepts or creatures needing explanation. A ghost appears and its place in the story is explained, but what a ghost is needs no explanation. J.R.R. Tolkien understood this when he wrote THE HOBBIT - although hobbits themselves required explanation, dwarves, elves, goblins, spiders and eagles did not. That's why THE HOBBIT works as a children's book, while THE LORD OF THE RINGS, with its Nazgul, ents, olephants, and balrogs is best appreciated by adults.The second aspect of this book that works is that Rowling unabashedly does with her familiar creatures and characters what an eleven-year-old would want done with them. The bully never wins the day. Nor does Harry Potter suffer from taking pleasure in seeing the bullies fail. This happens again and again, most dramatically at the end of the story when the good guys win the big contest because the benign but distant father figure somewhat arbitrarily awards them victory.All this works well together and kept me, as an adult interested enough that I now want to read the next book. I did have two small problems with SORCERER'S STONE. First, the book was enjoyable to me as an adult because in most respects, the child characters of the book thought like adults. The one exception to this rule is that they have a child-like fear of authority. They rarely go to authority figures for assistance, for fear of not being taken seriously. This is understandable for children and to children, but the reasoning, articulation and problem solving abilities of the characters are more fantastic for eleven-year-olds than their magic.The second problem I had was that the children overcome obstacles set by adults, or designed to stop adults, pretty much by repeated frontal assaults. At one point, for instance, the children out-maneuver a magical chess set. Surely the adult wizard who set the trap could out-play what amounts to a first grade wizardling? If not, how useful would the trap be in stopping a more powerful foe (it turns out the answer is, not much, but that's another matter). At another point, a clumsy child-wizard uses a basic spell to stop a troll. If it is that easy, why are adults afraid of the troll?But these are minor points. Part of the fantasy for the children for whom this book is aimed is to imagine beating grown-ups at the own games. That's a small enough demand for suspension of disbelief for a grown up to endure while enjoying this otherwise captivating story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wanted to know what the hype was all about!! So, I decided to check a couple of pages out, then \\"BOOM!!!\\", next thing I knew I was hooked. I couldn't believed that this book drew me in so easily!!! I was amazed and excited while I read and that doesn't happened to me often!! I must admit, I saw the movie first and I can't believe that the movie followed the book pretty well!! This book reminds of a modern Cinderella with a twist. The main character is a male, Harry, who is treated wicked but his Aunt, Uncle & porky cousin Dudley. Later, realizing he is someone special by people that are unknown to him (the witch & wizard society) and he is someone already famous!!! Now, what kid wouldn't want to be famous!!! This is an awesome read, I would recommend this to anyone not just children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I used to avoid these books because of all of the Hollywood hype. The merchandise and movies and everything just threw me off. However, curiosity killed the cat, and after Book 5 came out I couldn't help myself. I picked up the Sorcerer's Stone and was practically physically unable to put it down.From everything I've heard about the book, I expected the book to be boring, childish, and predictable. It is exciting, non-childish, and filled with plot twists and incredible surprises.Don't be decieved by those who say the book isn't all that great or by those scary fanatics who bought book 5 at midnight. Listen to all of these perfectly bright people who posted reviews on this website- how are you going to try and argue with thousands of people who say the book is great and took the time to tell you so?The writing is colorful, interesting, filled with loveable characters and infuriating ones. My only complaint is that I didn't pick the thing up sooner.To wrap this review up: This book is a classic of our time. I now compare Rowling to people like Tolkein or C.S. Lewis. People 50 years from now will be reading these books saying how magical they are. If you haven't read it yet, read it. I don't care if your 8 or 80. Read it. Now.P.S. To those of you who, like in my case, were avoiding the book because of the overpopularity and all, i have one thing to say. It was worth it to swallow all my pride to read the book. And trust me, there was a lot of pride to swallow."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you like books on tape, then get this one.

The Old magician in this book was almost prosecuted for doing \\"magic\\", as the king would say. He tried to tell the king that the so called \\"magic\\" that he did was nothing mearly tricks and something to make a living out of. The kings most trusted advisor let him be in the debt of the king. The king later found out that he needed a favor from the old magician. mangus ( the magician) is faced with a problem that he cant solve because he really isen't a magician, just a entertainer. The king won't beleive him and if the problem isen't solved, than he will be excecuted at once. These are just alittle of what happenes in the book. As you can see there are always problems that occur and its not boring at all. You always are woundering what is goin to happen next and you dont want to put down the book untill you see. This why i like, \\"Midnight Magic.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sweet Summer is about how the author, Bebe, grew up knowing and not fuly knowing her father. Every summer Bebe went down South with daddy where life was completely different than with her mother in the North. Everythign was 'easy living' as she put it, where you could run down the lane in yoru bare feet, pump water and boil it for a hot bath,and where ain't wasn't a word momma could yell at you for. As much as I had enjoyed the book, it stirred up a few emmotions i had though hidden as it became more clear exactly how much she idolized her handicapped father Through different flashbacks of the summers they had shared an the laughs they enjoyed though her youth and well into her adult and mother hood. A must have novel for every &quot;softie&quot; out there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say? I loved the book! It is easily the best one I have read in a long, long time.The audio version, however, disapointed me. I thought Jim Dale simply wasn't all that great. Being a Brit living in the United States, I told the folks back home this and they immediately sent me the Brit version of the audio tape (the Philosopher's stone, read by Stephen Fry) -- it was absolutely fantastic.Stephen Fry really did capture my imagination and really make me believe that Harry could be captured outside the pages of the novel.I beg you, if you can, to get hold of the Brit version (perhaps amazon.co.uk sell it?) and listen to that rather than the inferior US one (still read by a Brit). You won't be sorry you did.Anyway, let's all raise glasses to one of the greatest childrens books of all time!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I must be honest, I never thought I would find myself reading the Harry Potter series. After my friends started to read them, I joined the bandwagon expecting an average book. How wrong I was! I wish these books would have come out when I was younger, so I wouldn't be stuck with reading the Baby-Sitters Club series.As the initial book in the series, it sets the tone for the rest. He will always be up to some scheme, whether sneaking around school, or facing an evil villian. Hopefully, I haven't given away to much, in hopes that you will read the magic that is Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Which rounds to a 5. The beginning of this book is, to me, extremely boring.Harry Potter starts off as a regular person. He does not know that he is a wizard yet. His parents, (not real parents) the Dursleys, have been very cruel to him over the years. One day he finds out he is a wizard. Hagrid, the big man, barges into Harry's home and scares the Dursleys. Harry is amazed that he is a wizard. So Hagrid takes him to the school he belongs in, Hogwarts: School Of Witchcraft And Wizardy. There are houses that the other witches/wizards are in. This hat, called the sorting hat, sorts everyone into the right house. I won't tell you what house he is in because that would spoil everything. Now he meets his two best friends, Ron and Hermoine. He meets his three worst enemies, Draco Malfoy and his two friends. Harry learns all about becoming a wizard. The sports of wizards, the studies, the spells, the transformations, and of course, the dangers. Harry encounters many dangers while at Hogwarts while he encounters many good things as well.I gave this book a 4.6 rounded to a 5 becase the beginning was, again, extremely boring. The ending was not the best of the four books in the series but it was okay. If you don't know who or what Harry Potter is, get with it and check it out. It's a great book with a great story. The author does a great job. Be sure to check out the movie too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Anyone can love these books, young or old.

This book reminded me a bit of &quot;The Chronicals of Narnia&quot; in that they begin in a Dreary grey repressive British household and then gradually move into an enchanting world full of excitement, fun and even danger! Poor Harry Potter, trapped with his relatives, the Durdsleys who make him sleep under the stiars while their own son has two bedrooms. Then one day he starts receiving letters which they do not allow him to read. However everytime they throw them out the next day more an more keep appearing, under the door, down the chimmney, through the window.

The many characters are easily identifiable with Mr. Dale's wide range of British/Scottish accents, and they are brought to life by his treatment. As well, Americans will appreciate hearing the proper pronounciation of &quot;Her-MY-oh-nee&quot; (not &quot;Hermy-WON&quot;) and other British names. I'm very impressed with the quality of the performance and am anxious to purchase other cassette editions of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The HARRY POTTER books by J.K. Rowling are witty, mysteryous, magical, fun, scary, grupping, action-packed, adventurous, and daring. HARRY has gone where no book series has ever gone before--winning the UK's Smarties Prize Award three times in a row for the three books in the series so far: HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and, most recently, HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN.I just recived the audio of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE to my great delight. I have already listened to the first chapter, THE BOY WHO LIVED, and plan to enjoy many more experiences at Hogwarts--hearing them. Now I can only imagine what Quidditch will be like, what I will hear Harry say when he discovers The Mirror of Erised, the note of panic in his voice when he finds out Voldemort's plans, and the taste of victory over Slythern for The House Cup.Unchanged and in it's entirety, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE will be a treat--just as unpredictable as Every Flavor Beans!To sum it up, just say one thing:&quot;Once upon a time&quot; never sounded as great as in HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE and &quot;happily ever after&quot; never was as great a final treat for the ear."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I purchased this audio edition to listen to while knitting, after seeing interviews with J.K.

Lewis or Madeleine L'Engle's imaginary realms... although this Harry Potter book (and, I assume, the others) don't have a religious message, ethics such as sticking up for your friends in need, trying things even when you're afraid, dealing with loneliness, and other universal issues are covered.

Don't the mistake I made, thinking that just because they are popular with young kids, that they are stupid. I am only 12 but I read mostly adult novels. I thought Harry Potter was just some silly little kiddie book. But I was wrong as wrong can be! This book is intriguing, funny, and--well, just plain great. Everybody can relate to Harry because no matter how privileged they are, at some point in their lives, everyone has thought, &quot;My life sucks.&quot; He's also a good role model, I think. But we don't need to cross-examine Harry Potter to see how good it is! Just read the book. You WON'T be disappointed! This book is amazing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the BEST book I've ever read.

Also, if you absolutely love the Harry Potter books you should read Tamora Pierce's &quot;Immortal&quot; series, which starts with the book &quot;Wild Magic.&quot; Also by Ms. Pierce is the &quot;Lioness Quartet&quot; of which I recommend the first and second books but DO NOT read the third or fourth under threat of SEVERE DISAPPOINTMENT.

I'll refer to Philosopher, never Sorcerer.Well, this story begins the 7-part series on one boy, Harry Potter, a normal English boy living with his terrible aunt and uncle with their nasty son. Or is it? On Harry Potter's 11th birthday, a mountain-sized man comes to him and explains his true history: his parents were wizards who were killed by the viciously ruthless Lord Voldemort.Most people know the whole story so on to the critiques. I felt it was a tad too short (UK Version: 223 pgs) but still covered all the material throughly without rushing anything. JK Rowling's style of writing is quite an interesting one. She really seems to have a love of adverbs, especially in her dialogue segments. I felt that each book became better than the last (so far with The Order of the Pheonix out) especially in detail and story.Making a note on the banning of Harry Potter and similar books for \\"satanical\\" reasons, this book is in NO WAY satanical. The story is that of a boy (representing good) defeating the dark lord (representing evil) who murdered his parents. The story is a timeless one and if the magic had been taken out, there'd be no arguement and no interesting content. Even the Pope has told the Catholic world Harry Potter isn't a sinful book but one of Good vs. Evil and I suggest you listen to him if you felt this book evil.I recommend this series to anyone who loves to read or even those who don't becuase this should jumpstart their love of books. Other books of suggestion: His Dark Materials (Philip Pullman), Artemis Fowl Trilogy (Eoin Colfer), The Chrestomanci Quartet (Diana Wynne Jones), The Wrinkle in Time, Many Waters (Madeleine L'engle), Sabriel, Lirael, and Abhorsen (Garth Nix)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best books I've ever read.

Everyone young and old that I've know love the series that Ms.Rowling is beginning to make. The people who don't have got to have a better reason than that she is so called prejudice of fat people, or that she is &quot;copying&quot; someone else. For one thing Dudley has to be fat in some parts of the book for obvious reasons, and the Fat Lady definatily does not mind being called the Fat Lady, Dumbledore(my favorite character) even calls her that.

I'm only 12 and in an ninth grade reading level. I picked this up because everyone was raving about it, and it was excellent! I can't understand anyone who gives this book a 3 star rating or less. THANK YOU!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"YOU HAVE TO GET THIS ONE OF A KIND BOOK!! It was the end of the School year and my teacher read my class this book. We really got into it but never got it finshed. I bought the book and read and read!! LOved it!! I have am now reading the second. I can't wait to have the third!(second harry potter and the chamber of secrets)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is worth 5,000 stars. J.K.Rowling is one of the bestauthors in the world!!! I can't wait for all her other books. This onewas so perfect and funny!!!! I love this book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"we are a group of students who are talking about a book during our lessons. we all read harry potter! (what a surprise...)harry is a little 11 year aged boy who has a life full of hardship - living together with his aunt, uncle and cousin. his parents are dead - killed by the evil wizard Voldemort, but we will find out this fact later - and they are the only relatives.just before his birthday he is taken to the famous school of witchcraft - hogwarts. there he becomes a great star and saves the world - not only one time.very readable!! do not hesitate do buy the book! you will read it in one night - or watch the movie (you wouldn't waste as much time as reading the story :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first positive thing is that a book for everybody, and the children don\`t watch the tv all the time: it is a good way for children start reading because they will intend to read other novels as well.It is very easy to read, and very enjoyable it stimulate our imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I didn't expect to get caught up in this book. I thought it would be cute and that I'd enjoy it and put it down and move on. But, I was totally engrossed in it. It is way more than a kid's story. It's a great book for a person of any age to read and enjoy. I can only equate it to Shrek. I have a 3 1/2 year old stepson and he loves Shrek, but he loves it as a child. I love that movie as an adult. It's the same thing with this book. I loved it from the eyes of a grown up. And, the story awoke many sleeping emotions in me. I forgot what it felt like to feel complete wonder and endless possibility. Harry is a role model for children - he is just, honest, and a good friend. But, he is also a good lesson for adults too - it's important for us to remember to let our hearts lead us and not get caught up in the JUNK that clutters our lives.Harry Potter is a great character and the book was fantastic. Pick it up and be prepared to smile all the way until the last page.I have already started the next book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone was By far one of the Best books I've read. Surpassing even the J.R.R. Tolkein Trilogy: Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's been a long time since a fiction book kept me up all night reading, but I just could not put it down. Ms. Rowling is one of the most imaginitive children's writers I have read in years. I can see why this series is so popular.What I can't see, though, is why there is such a contorversy. I think if Ms. Rowling had claimed to be a Christian and sold it on Christian bookstore shelves the \\"Christian\\" community would have embraced it whole-heartedly as great entertainment. They have done the same with the Rings books.Harry is much more interesting, and less offensive, than the Tim LaHaye or Frank Peretti books or, quite frankly, any recent so-called \\"Christian\\" fiction. I would much prefer my children read this series than anything out there passing itself off as Christian these days. At least it is well written and does not deliberately distort doctrine.(Oh, and there's no \\"mushy-gushy\\" stuff. I can't stand all that romantic dribble in the \\"Christian\\" fiction. Worse than Sweet Valley High, ew!)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Great book! I actually read the book AFTER I'd seen the movie and the book of course adds much more detail (there's only so much you can squash into a two-hour movie). The book is a wonderful read for kids and adults alike. Harry is a loveable, loving, endearing character and I like how sweet and polite he is. I loved the scene where at the zoo; parts of it was funny. It was touching, though, how Harry had empathy for the poor snake and it was cute how he says softly, \\"It's annoying, I know, having stupid people banging...\\" (Dudley & Vernon pound on the glass of the cage and in the movie, Harry gets sick of it and tells them, \\"He's asleep!\\") The Dursleys reminded me of many narrow-minded, judgemental people I've encountered in the world, including people who feel threatened by those who are \\"different\\" (Harry's awful aunt and uncle call him \\"strange and abnormal\\" in a very cruel way right to his face). J.K. did a wonderful job creating little Harry, right down to the glasses and thick, dark, rather unkempt hair. Apparently the reviewer who said didn't like Harry and claimed that he \\"became self-centered and unwilling to follow rules and expects Dumbledore to save his butt\\" and \\"treated rivals badly\\" didn't get the depth of Harry's character. Harry is the LEAST self-centered character I've ever read about; the only rules he breaks is maybe being out of bed at night (a rule not really strictly enforced at Hogwarts) The times Harry does get into trouble (most kids do from time to time, he accepts the consequences willingly, even if it means serving detention with Malfoy for a weekend. Harry NEVER mistreats his rivals; he just refuses to butter Malfoy up. Harry's reasons for sneaking out of bed at night reflects his deep caring for his fellow students and for the future of Hogwarts; it's not just idle curiosity that he's creeping around the restricted section of the library at night (in the movie, he's so frightened he swallows when he almost runs into Snape and Filch). The ending was sooo sweet and touching when he's recovering from his confrontation with Voldemort and Dumbledore comes to visit and tells him about his mum's great love for him and saved him and Harry is overwhelmed with emotion and can't hold back the tears (a scene they unfortunately deleted from the movie, which I wish they'd included). I could picture Dumbledore holding his hand as he cried, then took off his glasses and wiped his eyes. I like how each of the Hogwarts Houses were described; the Slytherins weren't necessarily meant to be all-evil; they were noted for \\"cunning\\" which could be either a good or a bad trait. It was Malfoy and some of his cronies that brought down that particular house. It was good to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione recognized for their courage, even if they did have to skulk around to do it. I think if anything, the book teaches that sometimes kids won't always do the expected thing, but 90 percent of the time, it's for a good reason, not because they're just being \\"bad.\\" The book delves more into the psychology of the characters. I can't wait to read the other books; I do hope they have more of Ginny Weasley in it; she'd make a good companion for Hermione."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first book was my favorite. I love how JKR presents the characters and how she explains things so thoroughly. I've read each book at least 5 times each and still think the 1st is most definitely the best. The writing style was such that you didnt want to put the book down after you started reading. There is suspense and suprise at the end and that is my idea of a good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I didn't get around to reading the series until after I saw the movie. I regret stalling.The first book in the series is almost the same as the movie. You do miss some detail if you don't read the book, like the sorting hat's song.In the first adventure, Harry Potter doesn't know much about magic at all. He's not even aware of his fame in the wizarding world of Himblemimble. He finds himself accepted to Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He of course accepts the invitation since he lives with terrible foster parents. He has many adventures at school. If you like reading mystery or fantasy, you'll like Harry Potter.Adults, this isn't just a kids book, and you'll be able to pick up on a little Latin and Greek from the spell words that they use."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What else is there to say about Harry Potter? It is brillant, great, a pleasure to read, etc... The plot of the story is really supsenful and you never know what to expect. The characters are very well developed. I recommend this book to fantasy, mystery, adventurous type people. Any of J.K. Rowling's books are fantastic for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a gr88 fan of Harry potter. At first i was'nt keen on reading it but i had to write a book review for my school on any book of my choice.. so i chose harry potter. the 1st chapter of the 1st book was very interesting and but in the middle it got a little boring but then it became interesting again and i coundnt put it down. i had started in the beginning of my vaction and by now i am in the middle of the 4th book(the goblet of fire). the day i finish a harry potter i bring the next one. i am sure that i will finish the 4th book before my holidays finish. In the movie i almost cried when at the end Hagrid gave him the album which contined his parents snaps. the Quidditch match in which griffindor won (always)is the best part. Mr. Rowling is the best author in the whole world. i loved all the harry potter series .

J.K. Rowlings has a wonderful imagination. I love her clever twists and turns. This book is not just for children.. I am 38. I just ordered the sequel and can't wait. Every parent should encourage your children to read this story,they will thank you for it..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling has created an entire world in great detail and skill, pulling the reader into her imagination and allowing one to follow Harry Potter as if his shadow. It combines mystery, magic, a sense that anything is possible, witty humor, and fine characters that drive the storyline effortlessly. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the book is a sense of grey. There is &quot;good and evil,&quot; but there is also the people one simply hates, although they still fit under the umbrella of &quot;good.&quot; Rowling's characters are all very believable and not at all stock characters she pulled off the shelf. Although quite escapist as a story (I haven't been able to concentrate on work, chores, or food), I reached the end of the book having somehow changed myself, reminded once again that there is another world beyond the material, that life is mysterious, beautiful, and quite humorous. The story itself is both quaint and domestic while at the same time outrageous and tall. The characters struggle with common pettiness, fears, and responsibilities as they participate in a world that is so different and intriguing. Thus the reader can easily place himself or herself within the very company of the characters. I have waited a long time for an author to write a children's book seriously, treating children with respect as well as adults intellectually. J.K. Rowling has accomplished this task quite well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was very interesting. I loved all the characters and J.K.

This is one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is the best book I ever read. It starts with Harry discovering he's a wizard and that his parents were killed by an evil sorcerer named Voldemort. Then he finds himself in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy and all the adventures start. He gets to play Quidditch, learn the secret of the sorcerer's stone and even fight his worst enemie, Voldemort(well not only Voldemort).

I read Harry Potter last May and found it DELICIOUS! But before I even knew what quidditch, muggles, or who Harry Potter was I was bored out of my mind with all of those too grown up books and way to young for me books. Likewise I'm 15 and I always manage to make my way to the local bookstore every afternoon after church on sundays. After seeing the book on the newly released shelf for about 2 weeks I decided to get it. Boy was I surprised when I found myself reading till mid night every night. I found myself enjoying Harry Potter so much that when my dear friend Joan (worker at bookstore) told me that there were going to be 7 Harry Potter books I was stunned!! J.K. Rowling has the most innovative and delightful minds ever that she has created a reading phenomenon. It's not every day that good books show up on the shelf. I highly reccomend everyone from kids to senior citizens to read Harry Potter. It'll get at least a smile if not many fulfilled ours of laughter and enjoyment out of you while reading it. Well enough talk about the book so GO BUY IT!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought this book after my little sister (10 years my junior) begged, nay, ORDERED me to pick up a copy. As a first year law student, I bought it thinking that I would maybe have some time to peruse it on the long flight home. After the first page I was entranced and couldn't put it down. I spent a good evening cuddled with Sorcerer's Stone, my OneL reading glaring at me from my desk. It is enchanting, it is inspiring, it is a great read, even for a cynic like me. Buy it!

I got the sorcerer's stone for Christmas, and after reading 30 pages i absolutely had to go buy the other ones. They are so addictive once you start that you literally cannot put it down! I read the book late at night when i was supposed to be sleeping, and also i read two of them during the week that i was supposed to be studying for mid-terms (i'm in 7th grade)! so parents, if you really want you kids to read, get them this book. also, make sure you havenothing planned in the near future 'cause all your kid's gonna want to do is read these books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 37 years old and the mother of three boys 14, 12, &amp; 9. My Mom sent all three books to my boys for Christmas. My 11 year old devoured the first two before the holidays were over. I started reading book one not really knowing what to expect and I finished all three books within four days. I was up until 1:00 a.m. finishing the Prisoner of Azkaban. What a wonderful gift J.K. Rowling has. I want to offer my personal thanks to this author for creating a book my children LOVE to read! We've had some great discussions about the adventures Harry goes through. About how cruel people can be to those they deem different than themselves. These books have opened up a whole new line of communication between myself and my children.Anyone who can view these books with anything less than total enthusiam are missing the point. The reviews by the youngsters show just how much this series is loved by young and old alike.What I wouldn't give to watch a real Quidditch match! Try one of Hagrid's rock cakes and pet Buckbeak, explore the secret passages of Hogwart's, catch that fiendish rat Scabbers, who has deceived Ron and caused Harry such sorrow.I sincerely hope Harry will soon be able to live with his God-Father and get away from those awful Dursley's. Three cheers for Albus Dumbledore and the rest of the teaching staff. Please fire Professor Snape!Keep up the good writing, well written children's fantasy books are hard to find. As for the violence, go back and look at some of the original Grimm's fairytales...before condeming. BRAVA!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm forty three, and I wanted my son to hear better stories that those he got from his school. So I picked up the first Potter book, and we were both immediately hooked. And while the first book sparked childlike wonder in me -- and stirred the proverbial &quot;child within&quot; -- it also forced me to act more mature and adult-like than I wanted, in that even though I desperately wanted to chuck the Tom Wolfe novel I was reading and hunker down with &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, I knew that I had to be an adult, and force myself NOT to read chapters beyond what my son Ollie and I were discovering together.The Potter books are the very first books that my son (and I) will laugh out loud at...and get very quiet and attentive during the suspenseful parts. These books are inspirational, and my son and I look forward each night to reading a chapter or two. My only anxiety is that we'll be starting the third one soon...and we'll have to wait until the summer to read the next one!Harry Potter books are the best!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. One night Harry receives a letter from Hogwarts, the school witch and wizardy.Harry is excited to get away from his rotten Aunt and Uncle the Dusleys. But when he goes to Hogwarts danger strikes. Please read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, If you liked that one read the other two Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban. I really liked the book. The author is J.K. Rowling. She has a great imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am the mother of three children. I am sometimes considered very overprotective. I have read all three Harry Potter stories and absolutely loved every one of them. I hear now that there has been some protest about the books being too violent for children, where does this come from? I don't recall any real violent situations. I have seen cartoons more violent than Harry Potter. These books are a treat for your imagination and provide pure reading pleasure for people of all ages. Don't miss out on these stories because of the few negative opinions. Buy them and read them for yourself, you won't be sorry and I guarantee you'll want your kids to enjoy them also."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Imagine spending your entire summer in the back of an old red diesel truck traveling as a &quot;horse show nanny&quot; to a six year old girl. Some days we were in that cramped backseat for 16 hours - not fun, especially not for an active six year old. Thank goodness I had a little magic on my side. On one of those long, hot trips, I revealed my secret weapon, a copy of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; The young girl was immediately excited about reading the book because of the boy on the cover flying on a broomstick. For the rest of the trip, we did nothing else but read. The girl's mother and I enjoyed the book just as much as she did, and that was the best trip all summer... until we got the next Harry book of course. Harry Potter transcends all ages. Whether you are 9 or 99, you can't help but identify with the adventures of the young hero and the values his stories promote - courage, friendship, determination, strength. This is definitely the best series of books I have ever read. Buy them.

ChauhanPeriod: P.3Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone starts off at the Dursely's house where Harry Potter is handed over to the Dursely's. Harry's parents died when the evil, Lord Voldemort, killed them. No one can escape Lord Voldemort's wrath but Harry was able to. After ten years, Harry get's letters from Hogwarts School of WitchCraft and Wizardry where he can attend at and can learn magic. So the Dursely's drop Harry off at Kings Cross station for the train. The platform number was three and three quarters but there was only three and four. Soon he notices that there are other people who are going through a wall and those people are the Weasely's. He makes friend's with Ron Weasely and his mother helps both of them go through the wall. When he went through he got on the train and arrived at Hogwarts. He did all the classes throughout the year and found out who was Voldemort.I liked this book a lot because there were many interesting things that happen to Harry and all the cool features that it introduces about Hogwarts. There is like a cool background to this book and that is what actually makes it a great book. All the characters have interesing backgrounds and also what they could do. There is a famous game called Quidditch and that game actually sounds very entertaining. But this game is also dangerous because you could fall off your broomstick that flies. I always wanted to fly and a broomstick being able to fly is very cool and fun to do. That is why I liked this book.In this book, there are also two interesting quotes that sort of sizzle this title. One quote is: \\"Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\" A Nimbus Two Thousand is a very fast broomstick that can fly. It is the most famous and he got it from one of his teachers at Hogwarts. Another quote is: \\"Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\\"My favorite part of the book was when Harry, Ron, and Hermione played real chess with the living pieces. It was described so good that it was like you are really in there and playing. This real chess looked quite dangerous because the pieces were like armed soldiers and had harmful weopons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"WARNING (SPOILERS)!The story begins with Harry (an orphan) is living under the stairs of his aunt and uncles home the DEArsleys.Harry gets lots of mail that the DEArsleys refuse to give to Harry.Harry is not liked at the DEArsleys, they have a son named Dudley that gets all the attention and all the gifts.

For the first time since I can remember children are reading. Thats right reading; this is a very odd thing today. Most children would play video games that had the race cars and the murder, and yet this book is being called the devil's words. Please people leave the Holy stuff out of this and be glad that people are finally starting to read more and that is a blessing within it self.

She expresses feelings in such a way that when someone in the book feels pain, I can also feel it. What I like most about this book is that she is descriptive in every part.

The characters were all well-defined and the book is a fast-paced and interesting read. I've heard it compared to &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; by Roald Dahl, but &quot;Harry Potter&quot; isn't as dark as that; it's funnier and set in more contemporary times.

All in Hogwarts seems fine.. until a break-in at Gringotts, the highly-guarded Wizard Bank begins a mystery, which Harry and his friends seem determined to solve.10/10 - A Wonderful Book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book I read was Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone. It was a decent book that was really enjoyable. It starts off with a boy named Harry whose parents have been killed in a mysterious car accident. Harry is sent to live with the Dursleys, which are his aunt, uncle, and cousin who all dislike him. Harry hates everyday of his life that he spends there and living there is miserable for him. Soon letters start arriving in the mail for Harry which his uncle will not let him have and eventually Harry gets one of the letters. Harry soon finds out that he is a wizard and that he is to go to the school of Hogwarts. Harry soon meets Hagrid which is a giant strong man who is the grounds keeper of Hogwarts and he tells Harry about who he really is and what really happened to his parents. Harry discovers that his parents were never really in a car accident but that they were murdered by the evil wizard Voldermort and Harry was to be murdered also but somehow he had survived and that's where the scar on his head had come from. Eventually Harry makes it to Hogwarts and finds that he has friends and enemies of his own and his adventures would soon unfold to the final battle between himself and Lord Voldermort.

I really enjoyed the book and the movie a lot. I think it was probably my favorite so far out of the Harry Potter series. I think the reason it's probably my favorite is that it keeps you in suspense and you have to keep on reading to see what's going to happen next. I really don't like the way the Dursley's treat Harry, but I think he shows them by the end of the story!!!I like Hogwart's and all of Harry's friends he makes there. My favorite friend is Ron because I think he is the most loyal to Harry and also I think he is really funny. I also like Hermione because she's so smart and she is really nice. I like the way the book ends with Harry's house winning the house cup by winning points for doing so well.

While I am not in the age group for which the book is recommended, I am in the age group which this book satisfies.

J.K. Rowling is the heir apparent to Roald Dahl, who had the same gift for imaginative stories and vivid characters that Rowling has. Also like Dahl, Rowling does not write down to her young audience, which is why I and so many other grownups can read it without cringing. I literally laughed out loud many times while reading this. Friends have teased me about my love for Harry Potter (yes, I own all three books and am anxiously awaiting the fourth), but I have converted each and every one of them. J.K.

He is unloved and unappreciated by his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and his spoiled bullying cousin Dudley. Harry has been living with them for as long as he can remember because his mother and father died when he was only one year old. The only thing that seems special about Harry is a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.Just before his eleventh birthday he starts receiving mysterious letters which uncle Vernon snatches away. This part is very funny! The minute Harry turns eleven, a fierce-looking gigantic man called Hagrid bursts in and tells Harry the most surprising news of his life. Harry is a wizard and has the honor of being the only wizard ever to survive an attack from Lord Voldemort &amp; his lightening-bolt scar marks him so. Hagrid also tells Harry he is now ready for Hogwarts, the best boarding school for wizards.On the journey to Hogwarts via a magical train, Harry makes his first ever friends, Ron and Hermoine &amp; a new world opens for him full of magic, adventure, danger.I loved this book and so do many fans all over the world.

I soon found out: I began reading this book at every chance I had. After finishing, I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the second book immediately. The book has very interesting, colorful characters, although sometimes they are slightly childish (Dudley comes to mind). The plot is surprisingly interesting for a &quot;children's&quot; book. There were parts that were a little childish for me, but they in no way halted my enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My very dear friend brought this book to our Christmas party last year as a gift-exchange item. It was won by another one of my friends, and set aside until the hustle and bustle of the holidays were over. But as soon as she had read the book, the lending/borrowing began! Now a good number of my friends, my husband and I, and my 62 year old father (a Brilliant Man!), have read not only this book, but the other three Harry Potter books as well. And believe me, we ALL consider ourselves to be fans! (Don't worry, Ms. Rowling, we have all purchased our own copies, some of us have even purchased the audio-book versions as well.)Let me assure anyone who is undecided as to whether or not this book is all hype - the celebration surrounding these stories is well deserved. The story is well written, with enough fiber to hold it together, and enough whimsy to transport the reader to a time when we all believed Wizards and Dragons might just exist. For me, the greatest pleasure of this book was found in its ability to enfold me completely in the story; to make me feel almost as though Harry Potter was a part of me, and these were my adventures! It reminded me of the way I used to feel when reading stories by E.B. White, and I feel certain that these books are earning a permanent place in children's literature, not just a flash in the pan.Although I am no longer a child (my friends and I are all 30-somethings), I can see what a tremendous effect these books would have on a young reader. For Harry Potter, you see, begins his journey not as a realized wizard, but as an ordinary kid with problems and disappointments. But as the story progresses, Harry helps young readers to understand that there is no such limitation as &quot;ordinary&quot;, and there's more to each of us than may first meet the eye. As with all great children's books, when the protagonist wins, the reader wins! And win, Harry Potter does!So children and adults alike, don your Wizard Hats and delve into the magical world that is the Harry Potter series. If it's a good read and a great escape you're after, you will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finally read this book after hearing about all the hype and promptly finished it within 5 hours. For most adults, it would be a fast but enjoyable read. For children (I intend to give a copy to my niece who hasn't read it), I believe it will be entertaining and enthralling. Kudos to Ms. Rowling for her creativity and imagination that took me into a different world full of surprises and delight.As for those who &quot;condemn&quot; th book because of its violence or supposedly anti-Christian messages, my only answer is &quot;Get a life&quot;. If it wasn't for this book, your children probably will be playing Doom and killing Zombies on Playstation. As for all the magic and sorcery, it might be a good first step to teach your kids about &quot;fantasy&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;. This is no different from watching Toy Story and telling your kids that it's fiction.I gave the book a 4 stars because I am rating it from the point of an adult. I enjoyed the book but that's it.

The world of Harry and his friends (and enemies) is a world that we would all like to escape to. Having read all four books that are currently out at this moment, this book serves as a more than capable entrance to a land filled with wizards and creature, not to mention Muggles! I would recommend this book to everybody, young and old.

I would not like to sound to much as a billboard advertisement, however, I would also like to recommend that you order it straight from Amazon.com simply because the security is very good and all you need is something plastic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 10 years old. A book can't get any better than this. These are the best books I've ever read! J.K. Rowling is best! I read all 3 books in 11 days! I even read more than 100 pages in one day! Really, I did. This is a mystery/comedy book. Recommended for all ages. You won't want your money back. You cherish this book forever! Guaranteed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I bought the book after hearing the hype about Harry Potter. I completed the book in under 3 hours. It was the non complicated but plain and narrative way that got me hooked. I'm 18 this year and this is one of the best reads i would recommend for someone who just wants to retreat after a hard day at work or in college. Everyone has a child within and Harry Potter would be the one for me, maybe of a different gender *laughs* I guess the book is worth its hype ! going off to get the next one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for my 11 year-old granddaughter for Christmas, 1999. (I am a intermediate multi-age teacher with 39 years of experience.) I had read the hype and decided that it sounded like my kind of book. By the day after Christmas, Elise had finished the book so I picked it up to read. I finished sometime the next night. Both of us (intergenerational) loved the magic and excitement. I bought the other two books that next week. Elise again finished them before her vacation was over. Unfortunately, the books went home with her before I could finish them.Since my granddaughter and I had both enjoyed them, I introduced Harry and the Sorcerer's Stone to my class during Read-aloud. Every student in my multi-age intermediate class has loved the exploits of Harry and his friends at Hogworts. The interest has generated a flurry of book buying.....most students have book 1 and several have purchased the sequels. They cannnot wait for DEAR time when their imaginations can soar with Harry. To see children eagerly asking for extra time to read, as a teacher, I say, &quot;Thank you, J.K. Rowling.&quot; Personally, I cannot wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I purchased the book, wanting some light reading, and what I recieved was the best surprise of my year! I am in college, but anyone, young or old, will adore this delightful story. It was just what I needed to brighten up the wintertime. The fantasy world that Rowling has created is colorful, warm, magical, and fun. It is filled with suspense and adventure. It is amusing and clever. Very well written. The sequels, too, are well worth the hardcover price. Anyone would love to visit this world Rowling has created! I can't wait for her to write the rest of the books, because I am eager to return to her world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As an adult with no children, I had heard much praise about the Harry Potter books. I decided to try one. It was terrific! Adults as well as children will like the adventures of Harry and his friends. If I could give this book higher than a 5, I would have given it a 20! A must read for EVERYONE, young and old. Can't wait for the rest of the books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Being the first in a wonderful children's series, I would highly recommend this book to any child, and yes any parent as well. This book gives us a look into the life of an extraordinary young man named Harry, and the fumbles and foils he goes through with his friends Hermione and Ron. I believe that it gives us the escape that we need in our busy every day lives, to remember what it is like to be young. I truly appreciate the work put into this brilliant series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I first heard of Harry Potter's books from my mother. She suggested that my 14 year old son read one of them. I knew my son was more interested in computer games and skateboarding and had no interest whatsoever in reading. I did buy the Sorcerer's Stone book, hoping that I could find a way to get him to read it. I made a deal with him. If he read a chapter in the book, he could have the computer. At first, he fought it saying no way was he going to read this silly children's book. But, I stuck to my guns and he sat down and started reading. Right now, he is on his last chapter and he just asked me to order the next two books for him. Hurray for Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was wonderful and it entraps you right from the start with the story of a little boy.

Which is very short since I'm only 10. But the point is that this book is one of the best of over the 100 books that I have read. The reason is that the mystery because you really don't know what will happen.

It introduces all the characters with which we will become familiar through succeeding years, and provides a plot that will delight children while fascinating adult readers like myself who grew up on fantasy.One problem, not of the author's making. What on earth is a sorcerer's stone? The original title of this book, and the title used in most markets, refers to a philosopher's stone. Most educated readers will recognise this reference to an age-old quest for longer life, but the reference has gone by the time the American reader reaches the bookshelf. Do American publishers really think they have to talk down to their audience? Or did some nitwit in the publishing industry really have no clue? Either way, this is a monumental stuff-up which treats the American reader as an uneducated dummy rather than going with the author's original intent.Publishers, give your readers a little more credit. The relatively low score I give this book is a result of your error rather than the author's."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"what else can i say that no one else has?- this is a GREAT book like all her others!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"FANTASTIC SERIES.

An easy read, but it's also out of my age group. I loved some of the description in the book and I think Rowling does this well. Harry Potter was a pretty well-developed character and he was believable. I think the plot could have been more developed. I'll most likely read the next book since I liked this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K Rowling writes a truly magical piece of literature that captivates the attention of various age groups, ranging from adolescents to adults. The remarkable world of spells, magic, wizards and wands that appeals to all different age groups is solely based on the captivating premise Rowling presents to us. Rowling's idea for the story intrigues her audience, pulling them into the world of wizards. The story branches off into many multiple minor premises that keeps the reader interested in finding out what will happen next. To make the story interesting, Rowling uses illogical minor premises to create a world filled with illusions that separates the reader from reality. When we read this book, we feel relaxed and completely in tune with the text. Furthermore, Rowling creates characters like Harry Potter and Hermione Granger who are just like modern adolescents in an emotional sense, yet completely different in a physical sense. We experience vicariously the emotions Rowling's characters feel through the text that make us intimate with the story. However,the physical appearance of the characters is what pulls us in even closer. This is what attracts us to the world of Hogwarts; that people just like us can do things out of this world. Literally. Overall, Rowling dishes out an exciting, thrilling, and entertaining story that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, craving for questions to be answered."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 24 years old and I have just recently discovered the Harry Potter series. I grew up in a conservative household and Harry Potter was banned when I was a child. Now that I am an adult my beliefs are much more liberal than that of my family. I heard one of my friends (who is almost 20 years my senior) talking about how much she likes the Harry Potter series, so I decided to rent the Sorcerer's Stone movie. I liked it so much that I immediately ordered the book. I started reading it and found that it was really hard to put it down. I finished it this morning and I love the book. The story really draws you in. I found myself really empathizing with Harry and always wanting to find out what would happen next. I liked it so much that I ordered the second book. Thankfully it should be here tomorrow, because I cannot wait to \\"visit\\" Hogwarts again!To those who believe that Harry Potter is \\"Satanic\\": There is nothing satanic or evil about this book.

I felt kind of funny reading the first few chapters but the more i read the more i got drawn into it. Its definatly one of the best books ive read.

The villian is a moral relativist -- isn't that the philosophy they say they hate the most? The \\"Harry Potter\\" books are books that children (who don't read enough, thanks to videogames) as well as adults can enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Another review praising young Potter, you say? Well, yes. Yes it is. But there's one important thing i wanna tell adult audiences or christians who're skeptical about giving our Harry a go - and i know some of both these sorts.Adults - i urge you, this is NOT a kid's book! Well, it is, but its not JUST that. Firstly, its all-story. If you hate reading the kind of labourious over-thought trying-too-hard novels, if you ever want to just put your feet up and have fun after a hard day of work, or if you want to remember what it felt like to be young - HARRY HARRY HARRY! My little sisters finally convinced me to try Harry for myself after i'd finished high school, all the gruelling leaving exams we have here in Australia - and oh my god! It was the best thing i ever did. Harry Potter reminded me that books could be fun - that they were supposed to be entertaining. Rowling has done an amazing thing - she's found a voice and vocabulary that people of literally all age groups can get into and love. I tip my hat to her ceaselessly.Christians - the most important thing for you guys to do is lighten up. Harry is about fun. If anything, Harry reasserts your rigid ideas of good and evil. Witchcraft is not real - hate to break it to you! Its a fantasy novel, and its immensely fun!Lastly, just because the pope tells you not to read something - watchu gonna do - believe him? Believe everything the pope says? Damn it - give Harry a go yourself. Try him out - and judge for yourself. If you're going to be religious, at least have the courage to form your own opinions about non-Biblical things.I just wanna say - Hi Harry from Australia - the place where Dorothy's fantasies are real! We love you down here, Harry - and Ron! You legends!Oh, and finally - don't be put off by the kids school play acting of the movies - the books are the best - if you didn't read Harry before the movies came out you won't be able to help picturing Daniel, Rupert and Emma as the three young wizards, but that won't hurt. Long as its you delivering the lines, not them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ok dont get me wrong this is a great book.

AS i said earlier the harry potter series is okay but ive read a ton better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fascinating read for children and adults alike. You will be pulled deep into the story of young, orphaned Harry and his many escapades at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.This story, and the ones that follow it, are superbly written. The vocabulary is perfectly suited for its intended target audience, children ages nine through twelve, but still not so simply worded that it becomes boring in the least for its adult readers. This is a perfect book for reading aloud to your children. The hardest part for most parents will be resisting the urge to cheat and read ahead after the kids fall asleep.In the Harry Potter series, J. K. Rowling has created a masterpiece that will stand for all time beside such notables as C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Rowling blends reality and fantasy with a deft touch, making the reader wonder whimsically if Hogwarts truly exists, if wizards and Muggles are real, and maybe, just maybe, if you look hard enough, you might see wizard children playing Quidditch in rural fields.Even those readers who do not typically enjoy fantasy will love this book. There are elements of nearly every genre in existence flawlessly woven throughout the story. Suspense, humor, mystery, Rowling does justice to them all.I cannot recommend this book, indeed this whole series, highly enough. This is one of those stories that, at the last page, leave you both satisfied with the conclusion to the story and frantic to read more about the characters involved.I would, however, like to leave you with a warning about the Harry Potter series. They are highly addictive. Once you read one, you will want to read them all. This reader, for one, is counting the days until the next volume is released."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well, there isn't much else I can say about this that you probably haven't already heard, but well, I LOVE THIS SERIES! Why? The characters, the plot, the innocence of Harry, the pace. Here's why I LOVED Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and why if u read it, u probably will too!1) Plot: Like you have probably heard dozens of times, there is a boy named Harry Potter in the Withcraft and Wizarding world. His parents, Lilly and James Potter, had been murdered that very night by the most evil wizard in the world...Lord Voldemort. Yet when Voldemort tries to kill him, Harry (only a baby) somehow survives with just a scar on his forehead, while Voldemort...is gone! He grows up in his Aunt and Uncle's house (his mother's sister (Aunt Petunia) and her husband, Uncle Vernon), where he is loathed, treated like a criminal, and hated for who he is. They tell him lies, that his parents died in a car crash, that they were low, good for nothing, people who didn't care about him at all. Basicly, Harry knows nothing of his true life and how much his parents DID love him, and grows up as one of the most miserable people in the world, with NO friends, no family, and no one that he knows of who loves him in the slightest. But then one day, a letter comes in the mail...Within a few weeks, Harry (with a little coaxing of his Aunt and Uncle, who are GLAD to get rid of him) is out of the house, headed to a place called Hogwarts. There, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry learns to LOVE his new school, where he learns all kinds of abilities (how to turn a cup into a mouse, or to make a light at the end of your wand, how to make something float in the air, put spells on people that make them tickle uncontrollably), studies the history of wizards and witches alike, and make potions that can put a 'stopper to death' or even make someone fall madly in love with you...He also meets the first 2 friends of his ENTIRE life, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasly. He also learns how to fly on a broom, play wizard sport Quidditch, and so many other things I can't describe here. But something is terribly wrong at Hogwarts...something that could threaten Harry's very life...Voldemort is not dead, and is in a sense, BACK, and he wants Harry dead...and a way to get back to power. If Harry and his friends can't stop him, Voldemort could come back to power, and threaten the wizarding world once again!2) Characters: There are many characters in this amazing book, Harry's friends Ron and Hermione, the Headmaster and the only person Voldemort every feared, Profferssor Dumbledore, his teachers, Profferser McGonagall and Proffeser Snape etc..., his arch enemy, Draco Malfoy (who's father was rumored to be Voldemort's biggest supporter...hmmmmm), one of Harry's best friends, Hagrid the gamekeeper, etc... These characters really grow on you after a while, for example, Harry's childish innocence, Ron's wizardly sense of humor, Hermione's briliancy, Neville's shy sort of attitude, Fred and George (Ron's brother's) wild sense of humor, Percy's strictness. It all comes together in a way so that you almost feel like there is a Hogwarts school out there, and when the book ends, you crave more of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred & George, Hagrid, his Proffesor's, the headmaster, even the Dursley's (his Aunt and Uncle's family). Thankfully there are 4 book for you to read so far, the 5th coming fast (June 21st, 2003 I beleive), so there'll be plenty to read for awhile. But to the leave the sort of NEED to find out what happends next to these wonderful characters, gets you hooked on Harry Potter, and proves just how good a writer J.K. Rowling is!3) Length/Final Thoughts/etc...: This book was FANTASTIC in my opinion. It's 309 pages long, with about 20 chapters. The Quidditch, classes, and all of the mystery involved made this perhaps my favorite book series...EVER!!! You learn to love Harry and his friends, loath Malfoy and his enemies, and the whole story that not just Hogwarts, but the entire world J.K. Rowling creates is just...amazing!!! I reccomend this book to all ages, young or old. This is a GREAT book, and I for one know that I loved it, and have read the entire series 5 times already. Give it a try, and most likely, you'll get hooked...like the other 200 million people who read this amazing book!Thx!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The protagonist in this story is Harry Potter.The conflict in this story is when someone is trying to steal the stone.Harry just found out he is a wizard.

It was published in 1997. The main characters are Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Rubius Hagrid, Draco Malfoy and Albus Dumbledor.A lot of fishy things have happened in Harry's life that he could not explain like the time when he woke up with his hair so messy that his aunt, Petunia Dursley got mad and shaved his head bald. The next day he woke up a with a full head of hair again. This he could could not explain so his aunt and uncle shut him in a cupboard for a week. His cousin Dudley Dursley was not much diferent. Every day Dudley and his gang of pretty much Dudleys beat him up or pelted him with Dudley's old toys.One day Harry got a letter in the mail but gefore he could read it his uncle snatched it and ripped it up before his eyes. A couple of days later letters shot through the mail slot and Harry's uncle Vernon Dursley nailed up the slot and took Harry away.Then on his birthday a couple of weeks later Hagrid, the game keeper of Hogwarts, came and took Harry off to Hogwarts to learn witchcraft and wizardry. There Harry found friends and adventures and fun. The book is called HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERE'S STONE because towards the end of the book Harry goes looking for Voldermort and the sorcere's stone. Voldermort is a dark wizard who kills good wizards and witches. The sorcere's stone is what to believed a legend but someone created it, it can turn any metal into gold and it can also preduce the elixer of life which can give you everlasting life. The reason why they go together is that in the book Voldermort wants to get it so he can have everlasting life.On a scale of one to five I would give this book a four. It is a really great book and I suggest you read it. The moral of this story is: never try to hide something that shouldn't be hidden."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I told my friends that I am reading Harry Potter they laughed.

I was into the book on the first page and I stayed into it until I finished every single last word. It's a story about a young boy who becomes a wizard.

It's just a must read book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book for upper elementary to adults. Harry and his friends are well crafted and believable.

But, I was absolutely delighted by it! It hearkens to the masterful works of Roald Dahl; I found myself reminded of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, and &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;. Rowling has created a wonderful set of characters and circumstances here: Harry is an oddball who suddenly finds himself in a strange but accepting new world. Children will gain a sense of confidence in themselves from reading his adventures, and adults will remember what it was like to be the oddball, and empathize with this unique young man. I look forward to watching the charcter grow in his further adventures, and hope that Rowling keeps Harry Potter around for quite awhile."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter is a magical and wonderful book. I just started reading them two months ago and I can't stop. Until I got them I don't see how I lived but I loved them and will read all seven. I have read some reviews ythat gave it 1 star and I think that is very wrong but still that is there opinion."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After listening to friends and family of all ages raving about this series, I finally started to read it. I must say, as a 23-year-old reader, I was impressed, amused, and amazed. True, on the surface it would seem these books are written for grade-school children, but in reality Rowling appeals to all audiences with her intelligent and amusing storytelling abilities.When I told a friend I was reading this series, she told disgustedly me to &quot;try reading something for adults.&quot; Too bad she'll never enjoy this book as much as I had. The truth is that there is something in this book for every reader. It is a well-written book, with excellent character development, and story that is as gripping as it is fun to read. The dialogue and narration is witty and intelligent, but still enough fun for children to enjoy as well.Everyone, young or old, should forget what they think they know about childrens' books, and read this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter has to live with his Uncle, (Vernon Dursley)his Aunt, (Petunia Dursley)and his annoying cousin(Dudley Dursley).They didnt treat him with much respect. They only let him eat, go to school, and sleep in the cupboard.Harry didnt have a memory of his dad or even his mom.His aunt and uncle always told him they passed away in a car crash when he was still a baby.All this disrespect until one day, he got a letter... His uncle and aunt wouldnt let him see it and Harry had no idea why. After each day, another one of the same letters would come, except more came along with it. Harry tried countless times to get ahold of one of them but could never. On his birthday(still receiving letters), the Dursleys didnt celebrate(which they never did) but a strange thing happened, a stranger who's name turned out to be Hagrid stumbled upon their door. He showed Harry what the letter had said, it said he was invited to the wizarding school of Hogwarts. Hagrid also told him that he was a wizard. This freaked Harry out and he just couldnt believe what Hagrid told him, but he said it was the truth. So Hagrid brought Harry to Gringotts, the wizard bank. Harry discovered he had secretly had a fortune of not money but gold, silver, and bronze, being called galleons, sickles, and knuts. They took some handfuls of the wizard money and set off to get some suplies for Harry's first year at Hogwarts. After getting the suplies, Hagrid took Harry to get a train ticket that would take him to Hogwarts (on a train that muggles,the wizard name for non-wizards, could not get on and cannot find). Harry told his uncle (when he returned)that he needed a lift to the station. Once he was there, he couldnt find platform nine and three quarters which was where the train was supposed to be. But with the help of a nearby family (who also turned out to be wizards), he was able to find it: behind a wall which he was supposed to walk through. Once he was on the train he met a wizard boy named Ron, Ron Weasley and became his first friend at Hogwarts. Ron told him good facts about being a wizard,what they usually did at Hogwarts, and many more good and helpful things. He also met a girl named Hermione, Hermione Granger. She as well became a friend with the two boys. They once again met someoneon the train. His name was Draco, Draco Malfoy and he wasnt really nice to them after Ron laughed at his name.Once they arrived at Hogwarts, they had to put on the sorting hat. Hogwarts is divided into four different houses or in easier words, groups:one is Gryffindor (which Harry, Ron, and Hermione were selected to by the sorting hat),then theres Hufflepuff, next is Ravenclaw, and finally Slytherin(which Malfoy was selected to join).The Slytherin's kids werent really nice to the other kids in the other houses. After a few days they learned their Professor's names:Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape(who wasnt really nice to Harry since he was the leader of the Slytherin's), and Professor Quirrel(who is only in Hogwarts this year), and some other ones(sorry, I cant really remember them all).At their first feast at Hogwarts they met their headmaster of the school, Professor Dumbledore. I dont want to share too much of this fantastic story so if you want to find out what happens, you should read this book and I hope you find it very intriguing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a great tale. Rowling has taken the tried and true formula of special children raised by ordinary families who go on a journey of discovery (employed in stories from Cinderella to Superman), and infused it with wit, imagination, danger and fun. The lively aspects of the book are well represented by the game of Quidditch, a cross between basketball and Australian Rules football - played on broomsticks. Rowling handles the scenes of danger well, everything from ugly trolls and deadly chess games to a unicorn eating two headed villain. The use of names is also imaginative. Take, for example, Professor Vindictus Viridian, author of &quot;Curses and Counter-Curses(Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more)&quot;; or a book on dragons titled &quot;From Egg to Inferno&quot;. The book also has its tender moments. Rowling shows that she knows a child's heart when she describes Harry seeing his parents for the first time. But she also tempers the sentiment with Dumbledore telling Harry, &quot;It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that&quot;. In the end this is a tale of bravery and loyalty, qualities which today's children need more exposure to. And if Harry gets more kids to read, then more power to him."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I did find some interesting parallels. Harry grows up not knowing of his heritage and his powers as does Luke Skywalker. Harry is taken to a school of wizardry to learn his craft and fulfill his destiny, just as Luke is taken to be schooled as a master Jedi. They are both sons of the famous and most powerful of their kind. They both form close bonds with their instructor-Obi Wan Kenobi and Professor Dumbledor. Hagrid reminds me of Chubakka. Ron is Harry's sidekick, over shadowed by his family name. Ron and Han (Solo) have similar names and similar feelings of inferiority. Both Harry and Luke find a female character that at first they do not like (Princess Leah/Hermione). And lastly, both are fighting against evil characters who were once great, but have turned to the &quot;Dark Side&quot; (Darth Vador/Voldemort). It's really the same story in a different setting. Instead of being set in outer space and dealing with aliens, Harry's world of wizardry is in some other parallel dimension and he must deal with odd mythical creatures. I wonder if anyone else saw the similarity."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you read the book Harry Potter you will love it. (I sure did!) Once you start you can't finish! (Trust me) When I started to read Harry Potter I thought that it was just a nomal, sometimes boring book intill I started to read it. when I started I could never put it down. When I tried to I picked it up again and started to read it again. The book is compelling and I think it was the best best best book ever made and if anyone started to read it they would agree with me and think it is good. All day long I would read and read the book intill I finshed it, then I would start the second one then the third one intill I finished them and then I would read them over again. Now the story line is great and the overall of the book is I think should make a 10 out of 10 stars!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My husband &amp; I both loved these books. At first, he was a little self-conscious about reading them on the train until he realized he wasn't alone. The creativity &amp; excitement of the stories keep us riveted. Let's hope we get to see Harry all the way through school!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a wonderful magical amazing novel which makes me sit and read for hours over and over again. I have read the other two and am about to pre-order the fourth. I have read each of them at least 3 times and think they are wonderful in how they were written and that the characters go well with each other. Thank you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I invite all you middle-aged Muggles reading this review to take a chance and read this book. I'm a grown-up (about twice over) and I loved this story, particularly the descriptions of the sport of Quidditch: Imagine Soccer, but with the rules rewritten by the likes of Jim Carey and Adam Sandler and you'll have some idea of how amusing this sport is.In Harry Potter's world, paintings become doors with the right password, men live in wooden houses and raise fire breathing Dragons, chessmen advise you as to their optimal deployment and eating a chocolate frog is a good thing!Listen, Rowling is right about the world being full of fearful Muggles who have lost their sense of magic. Fortunately, after reading this book, you won't be one of them. And, should your children, after reading this book, turn a mouse into a snuffbox, I suggest, in true Hogwarts Tradition, that you award points for originality, but gravely deduct for any whiskers left upon it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is one of the best I,ve ever read!It has an extremley incredable amount of detail. It also is a good book because it has that wonderful element of magic. You know, stuff like wands, spells, cauldrons, etc. It also is full of action because not everyone in the story is his friend. He gets into a different adventure every time with his friends and enimies. I have also recentley read the 2nd and 3rd book of this series and can't wait for the 4th to come out! Did you know J.K. Rowling is under contract to write 7 books? I plan on reading and buying them all, too! I hope this review helped you to decide to read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter thought he had a fairly normal life (aside from living with his aunt and uncle who hated him), but he was very wrong. On his 11th birthday he learned that he was a wizard and had been invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Suddenly, Harry is plunged into an entirely new world of magic. At Hogwarts Harry has friends for the first time in his life. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are his best friends at the school and they are the ones who help Harry through all of his troubles. From the very beginning though, Harry is slightly aware of something strange going on at Hogwarts. Harry pieces together the mystery slowly throughout the school year in while he isn't busy working on schoolwork or Quidditch (a magical game played on broomsticks).My favorite part about this book was the world that J.K. Rowling created. While it would have been easy for her to just set the story in a school where the kids learn magic, she didn't. Things like Diagon Alley, which is where all of the students go to get school supplies, allow her to add so much more to the magic world just through descriptions of things Harry sees. Quidditch also makes the world seem much more real.I originally read this book because I needed a young adult book for class, but I ended up enjoying it far more than I thought I would. I can't remember the last time I actually read much outside of school, but after reading this book I read the other three and am now anxiously awaiting the fifth book. I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone. It's obvious that it was aimed at younger readers, but I found I enjoyed it as much at 17 as my sister did at 11."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The plot of the story is about a boy, Harry Potter, has to live with his aunt, uncle, and his cousin Dudly because his parents were murdered by Lord Voldemort. Harry makes new friends and enemies at Hogwarts School of Magic... I have read many books before, this book was a little bit juvenile for me but it was still very good to keep me reading through to the fourth book. The author did a good job using descriptive words and phrases in her book, it gave me a good mental picture of what was going on. To give an example \`Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.' Harry Potter is a famous boy, ever since the night when his parents were killed Voldemort was about to kill him put his mothers love was too strong so he ended up with a lighting scar on his forehead. Here is a quote as an example, \\"Bless my soul,\\" whispered the bartender, \\"Harry Potter... what an honor.\\" \\"Always wanted to shake your hand - I'm all a flutter.\\" I thought this book kept me interested with the action. I recommend this to book to kids between the ages of 8-12. Any adult can read it but they might not like it. I believe that this is not a book for everyone unless you like fictional, action, adventure books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard about the &quot;Harry Potter Craze,&quot; and I figured just another kid's book. I fealt that there was no way that it could measure up to some of the classics that I grew up with. From the Chronicles of Narnia to the BFG to the Hardy Boys, I was then and still am now a very avid reader. I read on a wide variety of subjects, but I never returned to the young adult genres that I grew up with.My fiance bought this book for our 3 year old to read when he gets older, and I sat down and read it in one evening. I couldn't put it down. The language used by Ms Rowling just flowed and drew me in to where I was watching the story play out in my mind and really was hoping that Harry would succeed in all that he does.The story is pretty original, by how it is brought to life by Ms Rowling is extraordinary. The concrete world evoked by her worlds reminds me a lot of the world created by Piers Anthony in his Xanth series of novels. The Sorceror's Stone is an excellent book, I've already bought book 2, and plan on going back and buying every one of the books in hardcover.I highly recommend this book to all people, both the young and the young at heart. Also, when you start to read this book allow yourself a few hours where you don't have to do anything as you will not want to put this book down"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I havent ever read much, couple of books.

I am a teenager who could not understand the craze over Harry Potter, so naturally I checked it out of the library. The book collected dust for a few days until I was in bed on Christmas Day, with a miserable cold. I planned to glance through the book before falling asleep. Didn't happen.I was swept up into the world of Harry Potter. I played Quidditch, avoided nasty professors, dined in the Great Hall, and screamed aloud when Voldemort appeared. I don't want to give too much away, but this is basically the story of Harry Potter, a boy who finds out on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard. He goes on to have plenty of adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, escaping his evil Muggle foster family. What I love about this book is that even though we're dealing with wizards, broomsticks, and magic, we can still relate to the story. The characters are really no different from us.Full of plot twists, memorable characters, and plenty of magic, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will be loved for many years. I finished the entire book the same day I started. Sleep was forgotten until the book was finished at 11 pm. Just five more minutes, mom, I swear I'm not tired, I just have to finish these last few pages. Needless to say, I will be reading the other Harry Potter books shortly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's a good book, really it is.

I think anyone can read this book. It's really fun and you will enjoy it from start to finish. I have never read a book similiar to it. The only draw back is it is a little bit long. But I will recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've recently read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. The story begins with Harry Potter's life with the Dursley's (Harry's uncle, aunt, and their son Dudley). Harry is treated horribly by the Dursley's as an outcast of their family and is forced to sleep in a cupboard in the basement. He is constantly being bullied by the spoiled Dudley and made fun of at school. It's interesting that Harry never questions their deprecatory actions towards him because their actions towards Harry suggests that Harry has a history behind him. That he actually has magical powers! Then all things change for Harry on his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter via owl. Being the first and unavoidable letter, it is obviously very important and reaches him even through the actions of his uncle to block them at all cause. It is an invitation to attend the Hogwart's school of magic where he is introduced into a world that provides him with instant fame, friends, and adventures he never dreamed of. He is greeted by the gamekeeper of Hogwart's who goes by the name of Hagrid, and in time gains the friendships of Ron Weasley who is poor and has to live in the shadows of his brothers accomplishments, and Hermione Granger who is a know it all and does know it all that helps Harry and Ron tremendously throughout the book. They are Harry's best friends and together encounter adventures that are exciting and dangerous. At school he constantly is in trouble but also the star seeker for his Quidditch team. He also gains a few enemies in Malfoy another student from the Slytherin house, and Professor Snape, who we learn hates Harry because of his past relationship with Harry's father. Harry's worst enemy who we meet in the end is Voldemort. He is the one responsible for the death of Harry's parents and the one who attempts to steal the sorcerer's stone. He also meets Albus Dumbledore, the head of the school who teaches Harry a lot about himself and helps him out in sticky situations. This book is not only intended for children but anyone who enjoys reading a book filled with fantasy and adventure. You will enjoy the comical descriptive writing style of Rowling and the fun characters. This book includes everything one could wish for in a fantasy: interesting characters, the battle between good and evil, plenty of mystery, dramatic twists-and-turns, and magic. I consider this book to be a must read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 30 and I loved this book. I would encourage people of all ages to read all of the Harry Potter books. For kids it is an adventure. For adults it is a great get-away."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I heard that Harry Potter had cross-generational appeal. Was it possible for a piece of children's literature, while highly revered, to be just as delightful to an older audience? The answer is an overwhelming YES! While the story is simple and the plot is easy to follow, Rowling weaves a tale that grips the reader, no matter how old or young, and does not let go. In several parts I found myself laughing out loud or gingerly turning to the next page for fear of what fate might befall Harry. In short, this is a fun book and well worth reading. Let's face it, any book that gets droves of children to enjoy reading and long for the next part of the story needs to be seriously looked at; And applauded."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I never thought that I would enjoy the Harry Potter series myself. However, after hearing just how good the books were repeatedly, I decided to give the books a try. As soon as I started reading, I found myself thrown into the world of witchcraft and wizards. The book was simple, not like others that are full of symbolism and figurative language. Despite it's simplicity, I found the book to be an enjoyable story of a boy's struggle to find out who he really is.Harry Potter is a young boy who lives with his Aunt and Uncle, the Dursleys. They treat him cruelly by basically making him a servant and forcing him to live in a small room under the stairs. Not to mention lying to him about his parents' death, who were actually killed by a dark wizard named Voldemort. He then learns that Voldemort, though killing his parents, spared Harry's life. After arriving at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft & Wizardry, Harry learns of his popularity among the witches and wizards. This event begins his search for the truth about himself and his family.Rowling uses this boy's story to convey a larger message to the audience. Upon boarding the train for Hogwarts, we find that Harry is beginning a new life. Many times we begin new lives by something being revealed to us just like Harry. Personal growth appears to be her message, and is clearly shown through Harry's story. How a timid little boy transforms into a brave, cunning young man who is looked up to by many of his fellow students as well as peers.Though some parts of the novel read more slowly than others, Rowling's ability to create such vivid images made the book hard to put down. Although the book is quite simple to read, it allows the reader to ultimately relate to Harry, no matter whom it may be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter isn't the worst book I have ever found, but it's no 'Wonder book.' I believe J.K Rowling has a good sense of humour and her writing is fairly good. While she has enhanced the wizarding world more then most authors care to, a lot of it is just a mix of old fables. But her characters are one dimesional. Harry Potter- the shy, neglected child who really doesn't want all the attention. Hermione Granger- book worm. Ron Weasley- angry red head. Draco Malfoy- Annoying prat. You get the idea. An O.K. book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was recommended this book by the myriads of devoted fans. I approached this book from the standpoint that it is essentially written for younger folk. I am 34, but so many adults swore that this was a great work of fantasy that I decided to give it a try. I have a rule. If, after the first 100 pages, Im not interested enough to go on, I just stop right then and there. This book sadly falls into that category. I am very surprised that so many adults feel that this is a major work of fantasy. It pales in comparison to most writers. The writing is not all that good. The story is comical to an extent and has moments of imagination, but not nearly enough to recommend. From the youth standpoint, I can somewhat see that an interesting and comical story is developing and I am always for youth reading more and more books. It will lead to reading better and more thought provoking books eventually.

In one sitting. Not that it's short, but that it's . . . WONDERFUL! I nearly laughed out loud at the stupid antics of the Dursleys, and shared Harry's every emotion. This is a thriller, an adventure, a wonder! Every plot twist jerks you in another direction. And I feel that the 9-12 age level is unjust - - I'm 13 and am a loyal fan.

Quiddish matches make him better known than the scar on his head. Harry and the students make words about his trouble with you-know-who and that is what makes it so suspenseful. The best age to read this book is 8-11 in my opinion. Also I would give it 5 stars because I adore it.

My children (6 and 8)and I have been enthralled every night over the past weeks reading about the adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione. I must say that these books are NOT the easiest to read aloud! The author often trips over herself cramming way too much into some sentences. Sometimes she will cram a final thought or description to the end of a sentence just just doesn't fit right and requires me to re-read the sentence aloud or even split it into two sentences to be sure we all understand what she is trying to say. Other times the author gets on a roll, and when she does, she writes smooth exciting sentences and fills our minds with thrilling images. Several parents have expressed to me their frustration with reading these books aloud for the same reason, so I thought I would let you know. REGARDLESS, we love reading these books and discussing the various sub plots and clues that interconnect the three volumes. Its amazing what my boys discover the further we read. If you are looking for a book to inspire kids to read and think (and have a blast doing so) then I have to recommed all three volumes. Just be prepared to glide your Nimbus 2000 broomstick over the turbulent sentences.

He is informed then, about the true cause by which his parent died, thing that he didn't know because the Dursleys always made him believe that his parents had died in an accident, he learns about that they had died when he was only just one year old, murdered by the most frightful wizard of all the times: Lord Voldemort, and that when such person went to kill Harry, his spell repel against himself, vanishing him and therefore the reign of terror he had implanted.On the school, Potter makes relationships with the smart and stubborn Hermione, and Ron, a red-hair boy which becomes his best friend. Together they do the most dangerous and craziest things, as is fighting with a troll or walking on the Forbidden Forest in the middle of the night. But Harry also makes enemies as the evil Draco Malfoy who envies him and will do everything to see Harry spelled of the school. He will too meet the teachers of the different subjects as Transformation, Potions, and Defense against Dark Arts, and he will also met the school's director: Albus Dumbledore, the wisest person in the entire magic world.In addition to this and unexpectedly, Harry will be involved in the Quidditch, the game of the magical world, playing the sport while flying on a broomstick and becoming the youngest player of the game on the world.Every is perfect on the school until Harry learns about something extraordinary, the sorcerer's stone, which can provide immortal life and have been secretly hidden is now, not a secret for him, and before the thought that Lord Voldemort would be searching for it to recover his power again, Harry and his friend, Hermione and Ron will try to reach the stone before Voldemort could do it.

They will be in a extreme danger all the time until, finally, Harry faces his fate again against The Dark Lord.Rowling's first novel is a brilliantly imagined and beautifully written fantasy. In fact Rowling's wonderful ability to put a fantastic spin or sport, student rivalry, and eccentric faculty contributes to the humor, charm, and, well, delight of her utterly captivating story.I'm sure that after reading this fantasy, readers will be convinced that they, too, could take the train to Hogwarts School, if only they could find Platform Nine and Three Quarter at the King's Cross Station."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, I honestly was never in my life interested in Harry Potter books...too be honest I thought it was something a bit like \\" bla\\" to me...but then all of a sudden my aunts whom I must mention are in their 50's anf 60's ( oh God they'll kill me for saying that) were crazy about these books and so was my fiancee...so I decided to see what all the fuss was about and my fiancee bought me the first book...well..NOW IM HOOKED....I love it, you seriously get so caught up in it...im addicted to this now..it's a great series..so definetly buy it..if your skeptical give it a try..hey it made a believer out of me!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A young boy named Harry Potter is living with his aunt and uncle and his cousin, Dudley.

Harry later goes to the end-of-the-year banquet, where his house is awarded the \\"House Cup\\" .I highly enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly for anyone enjoying adventure and suspense."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's difficult to put your finger on exactly what makes this series stand out from the hundreds of other books about children having magical encounters. The idea of having an unhappy boy leave a troubled home to spend time in an enchanted world isn't so incredible that it stands out from its peers. And given the premise of a wizardry school, all of the other charming elements (wizard professors, magical lessons, an evil foe better left unmentioned) seem almost automatic.And yet, these books have captured the hearts of millions, this in a time when a book is hard pressed to make itself known among all of the other types of attention-grabbing entertainment.I suppose the special magic of the Harry Potter series is the result of lots of little things done right. The dialogue is well done, sounding realistically British to my American ears.. The characters are well done, evoking emotion. The plot and pacing are well done, keeping us interested and turning pages even as new wonders are introduced for us to marvel at. Most of all, the little flourishes which flesh out the magical world are well done. Trading cards on which the pictures move. Goblins managing the bank vaults. The excitement of Quidditch, and the presitge associated with owning the most expensive model of broomstick. All of these touches are done in a way that seems very realistic, and there's a consistency within Harry's world which seems very realistic. The world of wizards is exactly like the world of Muggles, except that it has magic in it.The annual cycle of the school year is also perfect for a series, allowing a formula for comforting elements, but enough variety to make each book stand on its own.This first book sets up the series, and gives us a first glimpse at all of the characters that we will eventually come to love and hate. Harry, Hermione, Dumbledore, Hagrid, the Weasleys, Snape, Malfoy, the Dursleys, and you-know-who (among others) all make their first appearance to great effect.This series may not come up to the level of the classic greats, such as the Chronicles of Narnia, but it is immensely entertaining, and very much worth reading, for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a ten year old boy living with his rude Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and his anoying cousin Dudley.

Finally the Dursleys give in let Harry read the letter and go to Hoggwarts and the adventor begins. I loved this book. J.K. Rowling does a great job at the titles.

I would recomend this book who people who love adventerous stories!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book I chose to review is The Sorcerer's Stone from the Harry Potter series. In my opinion this book Should not be banned because of its content. I do not believe the witchcraft in this novel is intended to be real; it is simply a story and a way of entertaining the reader. Because of this, it should not be banned. There are far worse television shows,music videos, movies, and other forms of entertainment that cause people harm. Books should not be censored if these other things are not. Some people enjoy reading about fantasy and that is what Harry Potter books provide. In conclusion, a person's right to choose what they read should not be taken away."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book that started the whole Harry Potter phenomenon and ushed Rowling from rags to mega riches started late in 1998 with the first of seven Harry Potter novels entitled \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone\\". Released in 1998, it generated a lot of publicity and what I would add, controversy as well both of which rage to this very day as I write this review.It begins in the affluent but bland London Suburb of Little Whinging where Harry Potter lives with his relatives, The Dursleys, comprised of Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Cousin Dudley Dursley. His life has been very miserable as his family has been very unkind to him throughout his life and his cousin especially was very bullying in character, not to mention being extremely spoiled such as getting fewer presents on his 11th birthday, even though he still got over 30 presents. Harry Potter however causes several bizarre things to happen in his family's house and receives a letter from a place called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry but the Dursley's, being very averse to magic, try to prevent him from going to Hogwarts but Harry Potter's life changes for both the better and the worse on his 11th Birthday when he is rescued by a half-giant being named Rubeus Hagrid and goes to Hogwarts for his first year as a magic student there. Once over there, Harry Potter meets another first year student named Ronald Weasley, who comes from a very poor (not wealthy) family background and the two meet a muggle-born named Hermione Granger.Harry Potter, learns of what really happened to his parents when although his aunt and uncle said that they died in a car accident, Harry learns that they were really in fact murdered by an evil wizard named Voldemort. A series of unusual activities occur around Hogwarts during his first year which Harry along with his new friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger try to discover what is causing the series of unusual events around the school and discover that the evil Voldemort is after an ancient artifact called The Sorcerer's Stone in order to gain a hold of the Sorcerer's Stone, which holds the Elixir of Life which would grant him eternal life and Harry and his friends must stop Voldemort before he gains a hold of the Sorcerer's Stone. Can they make it in time before it's too late?This first entry is a really excellent and fun children's book but it also succeeds at having enough plot, and complexities to make it a great read for adults. Some of the really interesting things about this series are that some of the characters are not what they seem to be. Take the malevolent Professor Severus Snape. Many newbies will think of him as a character that is of pure malevolence based on his appearance. Having a hooked nose, sallow skin, greasy black hair, and very foreboding in appearance, he isn't as one would expect but at the same time Snape is an amazingly complex character whose past has still not been delved far into even with the \\"Order of The Phoenix\\". Another character, who I will not mention on this review, isn't as the nice guy that he really is based on his appearance and clumsiness.There are some things that may have been a bit iffy in my opinion but it's mostly on the Houses of Hogwarts. I'm not sure if Rowling has something to surprise us with the sixth or seventh books but I feel somewhat thrown off by the whole notion that all of the students who are sorted into Slytherin House are such bad apples and all of the students sorted into Gryffindor are the \`heroes' of the books. While it gives the story a bit of an edge but the series so far has made all of the SLytherins the \`bad guys' and hate ALL of the other houses that it sounds like things are being viewed in a black and white perspective. Draco Malfoy for instance, is sorted into SLytherin and becomes Harry and his friends' Hogwarts arch nemesis. I just feel that there needs to be a \`good' Slytherin and/or an evil Gryffindor. This is just my opinion though. I can also agree but on a limted basis on how the book sometimes may portray rule-breaking as what heroes do but then again, by breaking rules they have been able to expose the truth about impending danger.Some may have lost interest in reading the book after it was adapted to the big screen in 2001 but I still highly recommend buying this book because even if you've already seen the movie, the book can evoke images in your imagination that are far different from what the big screen offers and several elements in the book are overlooked on the big screen. Even the characters in the book look much different than how they look in the movie particularly Professor Snape. Believe me, I felt a whole new imagination of Ray Bradbury's \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" even after seeing the movie rendition countless times over my lifetime. That's what's so good about books, they tell the story in a very different light from the movie version. This book is definitely a childrens book but I don't know if I could say the same especially with the OOTP book released in 2003 but we can't stay children forever and it's amazing to see how the books have gotten darker and more mature as the seventh book finale approaches. Even if the passing years and four books following have eclipsed it, there's no denying that \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" was the breakthrough in the classic Harry Potter book series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a excellent book and frankly in my humble opinion one of the BEST fantasy books to come since J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings series. After seeing the movies which frail in comparison to the book any day, I borrowed this one first from a friend ( 3 days ago) and read it immeadiately when I returned home, it was pretty much like I was captivated in a trance cast by (prolly bewitched by Snape) the book because on that very day I finished the entire book for I could not put it down (except of course when I got hungry :D ).The characters are very fascinating and human like which helps keep your interest, there are characters that nearly everyone can identify with and love. Please don't make the mistake of calling this just a children's book like most other people, I myself am 20 and trust me this is a book that adults will love also, and will prolly find themselves wanting to crawl into a bed with a flashlight with their own children to read this book with them.Simply put, you should not really be reading my review and instead should be reading this book, for you owe it to yourself to read an excellent piece of literature, and there isn't nothing negative I have to say about it except that I blame this book for making me lose sleep."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone is a wonderful book! When I first picked up the book and read the title, I thought it would be some children's book. I read the first three pages, and I put the book down. Then it was my sister, who kept insisting me to read it. The beginning of the book was boring. However, the second chapter was what finally kept me reading the book. J.K Rowling uses very descriptive writing for all parts. It feels as if it really happened.My favorite character is Ron Weasley, I wish I was funny as him. Even though he may seem nave from time to time, his respect for friends is everlasting. On the other hand, Hermione's smart instincts, help saved Harry and guide him to the sorcerer stone. I feel as if Dumbledore is my father, because he is always watching over his students. These characters all helped Harry against the dangerous, unexpected paths.I really despise Harry's aunt, uncle and cousin. He sure lives a tough life, without his real parent. His aunt and uncle, treated him bitterly, and Harry is always passive towards them. Never complaining, and doing what he's told to do. He is finally sent to the wizard school, Hogwarts, and there he feels more at home then with his aunt and uncle. Sometimes I feel the same way, school is a good place.This book is very mysterious and adventurous all at once. That is what makes it so exciting. I believe everyone would find this book amusing. There is no time to take a bath room break, because all the parts are important. Each chapter missed, will leave you clueless. As you read from the beginning to end, each incident will become clearer and clearer. This is a must read book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's hard not to get swept up in the Harry Potter fad with such a great story, fantastic characters and exciting plot lines. This will probably be the shortest review ever, because anything I have to say about Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone would be an echo of a thousand other reviewers. This book belongs in every reader's collection.I have thought long and hard about my Christian faith and the witchcraft, sorcery and \\"Dark Arts\\" mentioned in the novel. Rowling makes adistinction between good and bad magic. Christian belief does not. As a Christian I approach this book with a confidence in my own faith, realizing that the story is fiction. It has a place in society, and in literature. It may not have a place in the life of every Christian, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't believe in practicing magic, but I don't believe this is a reason to avoid reading the novel.Rowling is fantastic in every way as an author.

In fact, so enthused was J.K. Rowling, she wrote a book that appeased adults as well. People were hungry for a book that would sate them. They wanted it, badly. The Harry Potter series was just what we all needed. It was a feast to feed on, when we were all starving. So here is a series that has inspired many to read other books as well, even when they weren't avid readers. These books prove that books are transportations to just what appeals to us. They are the smart way to loaf.

He said, &quot;This is a good one, Poppet. Do you know why? It has not only topped the childrens best-selling charts, but it has even entered the adults one too.&quot; To be quite honest, I'm not surprised. I had never heard of J.K. Rowling before, but hers is not a name that I will forget in hurry! And this was her first novel! If that is her debut, then if, as the saying goes, 'Things can only get better,' then I think we could be in store for a treat! The book is filled with imaginative ideas, and humour that all can understand. At the beginning, the reader feels sorry for the young Harry Potter, but as the story unfolds, and Hagrid, Ron and Malfoy Draco are introduced, one becomes more and more interested. But I will not spoil the story for those who wish to read it! To get a full five stars, I feel that the book needed to be explained more simply - at the end, it all becomes rather confusing. However, it is an exciting, and surprising ending.My favourite invention of all though, must be the Wizards' game of 'Quidditch.' It looks most fun to me, and I think, like Harry, I would have to be the 'Seeker' flying round on my broomstick, looking for the Snitch.An imaginative and exciting book, that I would recommend for ages 9 - 14.Go on.... it's worth a read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In this enchanting novel, readers will be dying to read on.

Rowling's next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a fabulous book.Every time something bad happend something good always happend after."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have been teaching for sixteen years, and I can honestly say this is the book that not only I, but my students, have enjoyed the most. They begged me to keep reading - that hasn't happened in a long time. When they found out there was a sequel, not only I, but several of my students ordered the book from England, and as soon as it came in, I had to start reading it. We have all become Harry Potter fans. We are all awaiting each subsequent book (and are heartbroken that there are only seven books planned at present!) My students are eagerly trying to find a way to write to J. K. Rowling to express their love for her books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a wonderful example of children's literature you are really sorry to reach the end. The discriptions are marvellous and it is a book for all ages. Each year you can not wait for the next book in the story of Harry's life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I started to read this book I could not put it down for one second. It was the best book ever writen. My favorite part was Harrys first quidissh game. If I could read this book over and over again I would. I am going to read the next book yhat comes out by J.K. Rowling to. This book was the best one in the world, I cant wait till the next one comes out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 16 year old junior at Westbrook High School in Beaumont, Texas. I thoroughly enjoyed this book The writer captivated the reader with, although somewhat childish, vivid language and excellent imagination. Although the language was in a style made for children, any adult would not feel like they are reading a children's book. In an earlier review, someone basically said that the story was stolen from Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach. This is not at all true, sure it may have a connection, but the story, the plot, the characters, and the entire substance of the book was all original. All great authors have inspiration from another author at some point in their life, that is what makes them want to write. Is it not logical then that fragments and similarities would exist between the two authors? It was also stated in that review that J. K. Rowling had no imagination, I beg to differ. Anyone that can capture the hearts and minds of millions of children and adults worldwide has to have some kind of imagination. The fact that some people don't like \\"hyped products\\" does not give them the right to say the author has no imagination.In the book, Harry Potter is the son of a great wizard and witch. When he is just a baby, the evil Voldemort comes and kills his parents and attempts to kill him but can't for some reason. The name of Harry Potter becomes famous for this, but he is condemned to live with his aunt and uncle in the \\"muggle\\" world and knows nothing of his fame and his true purpose in life. On his 11th birthday, a giant from Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry comes and informs him of his past and what will come in his near future. He is taken away to Hogwart's and there learns the ways of his father and mother. Somewhere hidden down in the depths of the school lurks a secret that someone is trying to get to. Harry makes it his job to find out who, but has no idea what he is really getting into.The language used by the writer was not hard to understand, but very effective in it's usage. She uses words like muggles and things like that as a way to get the reader interested in the book and keep them going. There were many times in the book where you felt like you were watching a suspenseful movie, it kept you hanging on and wanting to just keep reading. The author also gave in depth characters. She developed them and you found out more about them throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys the writings of J.R.R Tolkien or C.S. Lewis. She is following in the footsteps of some of the greatest fantasy writers of all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In response to Stephen from Johnston, IA USA, I completely agree with his opinions of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling does a magical job of making this book an enjoyable read. Harry Potter is a young boy secluded from his past and his nature of being, protected from all that had happened in his childhood days by his greedy aunt and uncle. When he received in the mail for the first time a letter addressed to him, he was surprised to see that he had been admitted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was stunned to find out that he himself was a wizard. After a long explanation of the destiny of his parents, he found out that he was famous in the wizard world for defeating a great wizard gone bad. This was excellent news, except for the fact that You-Know-Who was to come back for him in his school of magic. Why and how you ask? You will have to read the book to find out! Rowling's purpose of this book is to engage his readers in words of fun and games. You aren't required to study the plot, you don't ever have to stop and look up the definition of a word, and you don't ever have to go back and re-read to fully understand what is going on. It is a relaxing book that you can just sit back and enjoy, possibly in one sitting. This definitely attracts readers of all kinds. Experienced readers who need a break from seriousness, and young readers who love simple stories. In fact I believe that the only word I had problems with were the terms he made up as part of the story, such as Muggle. Rowling's use of description of characters is just what a reader needs to enjoy a fun book. They are everywhere from magical, to greedy, to annoying to evil. There is the typical girl who protests to her friends mischief. There is the bad guy and there is the good guy. All supported by a variety of other characters. I supposed that the most popular character in the story is Voldemort, for the simple fact that you don't ever meat him until the end of the book. Until that point, you want to keep reading to find out who he is. In a summary sentence, I would give this book two thumbs up and say that it is as refreshing as a cold glass of lemonade on a hot summers day. You go Mrs. Rowling!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the most wonderful book I've ever read in my life. It was filled with excitement, suspense, and magic. This book was meant as a childrens book, but the language J. K. Rowling used can excite an adult to read it as well. J. K. Rowling's wording flowed throughout the book in a smooth manor. I never liked to read, but this book was the light at the end of my tunnel. I liked this book so much that since my reading of the first book I have also read the next three. The characters in this book were vividly described and came alive in my mind. I could picture Harry, Hermoine, and Ron vividly in my mind. The vocabulary in the book was simple, but it wasn't so simple that I felt stupid reading it. I think &quot;a student from SHU&quot; had a great review. It was right on the money. Harry learns many things about his past throughout the book. He meets some lifelong friends, has adventures, and prevails in the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well there were a couple different reasons why i havent read this book till now.

I was so wrong on both counts, and i can't wait to read all of harry potter. It took my mind away from this world and put me into a new one, it was like being a kid all over again and who wouldn't wanna do that? I will truly treasure this book and the rest of them that i am to order in the near future.

I really enjoyed this book because unlike many other books I have read, I actually finished this one. The author J.K. Rowling is brilliant because she creates a 4 or 5 books series that will keep readers waiting to see what happens next. Although I read the 2nd Book first, the first book was good as well. So far, the two books have morals lessons in them that kids, as well as adults can learn. I am not going to discuss those lesoons because you'll have to read the book and find out for yourself. I gave this book five stars because I read it in a day and a half. That is the fastest I have ever read a book, and it's beacause the book is easy reading for someone who is bored out of their mind with nothing else to do.

At first, the first Chapter you might think it doesn't make sense at all, but once you keep reading the first Chapter became clearer and makes sense. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book of the Harry Potter books, and everything started from the first book. On one Halloween, an evil wizard came to a house. He killed the people in the house except a baby, at the same time he lost his power and he hide. No one knows why and how he lost power. Because that the baby becomes famous, before the baby know how to talk, how to walk, in the wizard world everyone knows his name. Yes, this baby is the main character, Harry Potter. Time past fast, ten years later, Harry Potter from a baby becomes a young boy. He runs fast, but he always had been a bit small and skinny for his age. One day, a letter came and it is for Harry. His uncle and aunt take the letter away and keep it from Harry. Because they keep a big secret from Harry, this secret is about Harry's parents and who are they. Harry's uncle drive them from place to place to make sure the letters do not come, but thing didn't go the way Harry's uncle planted. The letter didn't came, but a giant man came. This man tell Harry about who is he and about his parents and everything. And he also led Harry into the wizard world.

Harry is the champion of underdogs who becomes a hero. He is loyal, humble, and honest although his early life was one of cruelty and indifference. His friends plot, scheme, and feast upon Every Flavour Beans while using their wits and magical powers to narrowly escape danger and disaster.Rowling cleverly depicts the boorish father and mother who dote upon their rather unintelligent and spiteful son Dudley but who basically deny the existence of Harry.A magical read for all ages. Although the book is currently banned in some places, at least children are putting down the controllers for their Nintendos or Segas or computers and picking up a real book--nothing virtual about that. Along with Harry children are rediscovering the magic in their everyday lives. A modern masterpiece reminiscent of Roald Dahl. 10 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Is it true that they changed from \\"Philosopher's Stone\\" to Sorcerer's Stone\\" the title for the American audience?A great novel, and a great escape.

It is an excellent book for school aged children. Harry deals with many of the same issues and situations that school-aged children also deal with. This book allows children to work through their daily struggles as they see Harry work through similiar struggles. Harry is a hero I would want my children to look up to. He is an excellent example of a true friend. He respects his teachers. He is caring to others to feelings. He is also a very unselfish boy. Children can relate to Harry and look up to him as a role model. Many of the Harry Potter critics seem to be dead set against these books because of thier mere mention of magic, but we see after a good read through that magic and wizardry have a small role in the book. In the last scene we see that Harry and his friends use their own human talents to track down and stop the evil ones. Ron uses his knowledge and skillfulness in chess to get closer to the sorcerer's stone (281-83). Hermione uses her logic to solve the puzzle of the bottles (285). And Harry is able to get the stone not by doing a magic spell to waving a wand, but by having good intentions (300). I believe that magic and wizardry are only in this book to draw the reader in. It isn't what this book is all about. Harry Potter and the Sorcer's Stone is a book that consist of more elements than mere wizardry. It is a means for children to deal with their &quot;reality&quot; without any fears. It provides excellent role models and deals with issues in a positive realistic way even though it is a fantasy book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's about time we had a new children's fantasy series.

All I can say is that they must not have read them. The kid reading the book doesn't think of the spells as &quot;witchcraft&quot; or &quot;black magic&quot;.

I, too, was reared on the trials and tribulations of Bilbo Baggins from the H.R.R. Tolkien series, and I'm delighted to be able to share this series with my boys. The writing whisks the reader away to a land where magic is common and muggles, (non-magic persons) are an oddity. I can close my eyes and see every twist and turn in wonderful old Hogwarth! Who could read of the rotten treatment Harry receives at the hands of his awful aunt and uncle and not be moved?

Does it live up to the hype? Well, I will just say it is a lot of fun and has made me lose sleep finishing each book. It is worth mentioning that I am 23 years old.At this point, this book is my favorite of the three, because I found it the most tightly plotted and ultimately satisfying. None of these books are particularly original. Why is the series so popular then? A large part of it, I think, is its appeal to both children and adults. It draws its influences from authors like Roald Dahl (a favorite of mine as a kid), but is in many ways more sophisticated, if not quite as creative. The characters are well-drawn, and despite the apparent black-and-white morality, which is a staple of children's literature, things are not always as obvious as they might seem upon first glance. The heroes aren't perfect, and in terms of the story's villains, there is at least a delineation between those who are evil and those who are simply not that nice.My favorite part of this book is when Harry receives the &quot;letters from nowhere,&quot; leading up to the part where Hagrid bursts in and confronts Harry's aunt and uncle. It is a delicious and funny scene, and I think Hagrid is a wonderful character. He is an oafish giant who is not that bright, but nearly impossible not to like. I also am fond of Hermione (how in the world do you pronounce that name?), an uptight, perfectionistic girl who is actually very plausible.Another delightful thing about the series is the way the concepts it introduces stick in one's mind. After reading the series, I can easily explain the rules of the made-up sport Quidditch, and I can also tell you the differences between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. It helps that the names tend to sound like the concepts they represent. I doubt I would care, though, if the story wasn't engaging and gripping.The surprises in the later books seem to mesh perfectly with everything from the first book, and I seriously doubt Rowling is making up the story as she goes. That explains why the world she creates is so consistent. Traditionally, we tend to think of magic and sorcery in connection with primitive societies, but in these books the magical world is the advanced civilization, whereas our &quot;Muggle&quot; world is what is primitive. That is a very interesting take on the genre."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this series of books. I usually hate to read other books but these I love to read.

When this book first came out and everyone started going crazy over Harry Potter, I was a little skeptical, to say the least. But when I picked up the book and began reading, my doubts disappeared. This and the other two books currently in this series are a delightful find for anyone who loves children's literature, fantasy fiction or, indeed, reading itself.Rowling has woven a delightful story of the highest caliber, and it is only a greater credit to her achievements that so many children have discovered the joys of reading through her work. Although her writing is refreshing and simple, easily accessible to readers of any age, the story that she tells is anything but. From page one I found myself unable to resist cheering Harry on as he fought his mean relatives, the bullies at school, and the evil You-Know-Who. Harry's character is one which the reader can easily identify with, and the discovery of his magical talent is just the sort of rags-to-riches story anyone can relate to. The book is extremely well-written, with an unpredictable plot that continually keeps the reader on their toes. I read to find out what would happen to Harry and his friends, but I also read for the sheer enjoyment that Rowlings delivered with each and every word. Less cynical than the style of Roald Dahl and not as heavy-handed as C.S. Lewis, Rowling's writing is not only for children, but to anyone with imagination and the desire to believe, if only for a few hours, that we all have magic hidden inside that is only waiting for a letter from Hogwarts.J.K. Rowling has definitely created a place for herself in history with this series, if only for the unprecedented response of public opinion and the distinction of having coined the term &quot;muggles&quot;. If you have not read this book or you doubt my opinion along with the other 2000-something here, I urge you to buy one of the Harry Potter books and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Read this book if you are an adult who remembers what it was like to be a kid. If you remember your fears, you will love this book as it plays on the worst things a kid can imagine. Like your parents being murdered and then having to move in with your aunt and uncle who hate you and make you live in a closet under the stairwell and where your cousin hates you and everyone in the house treats you terribly. Also, your fantasies, like walking on a train platform and disappearing into a new world, a new dimension that is full of magic. Now, this book is not for little kids. I won't venture to guess what age kids would start to enjoy the book as my son is 3 and obviously, too young for this story. Well, there are 2,700 more reviews for you to read so I don't want to take any more of your time. Highly highly recommended, as are the other volumes."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Everything you need to know about the content of this book is already on the professional reviews. So if you are looking for an additional reason to buy it, I encourage you based on the fact that it allows your mind to wonder in that place where everything is possible and exciting. The power of the images created by the words you read will make you wonder why on earth, we have chosen to go to sleep watching the news on television instead of being glued to a book, which help you to create a wonderful world for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up this book along with book 2 about 2 days ago. I was planning on using them next year as I am a teacher and thought my kids would like to hear the story. Boy was I amazed! Not only was the story completely fun and exciting, it had me up late finishing it. Harry Potter is the perfect kind of hero for a children's story and all will be cheering for him through his many adventures and problems at Hogwarts school and with his Muggle family he is forced to live with. I am now reading book 2 The Chamber of secrets and can't wait to purchase book 3 which is already out, and book 4 due to come out on July 8! If you like interesting stories, filled with adventure, hilarity, and magic you will love the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Our 13 yr-old daughter started to read this book to our 6 yr-old daughter on a trip and we made her start at the begining because we were all mezmerized by the story. Now we read it as a family every night before bed. We like it so much we bought 2 &amp; 3 and are waiting for the 4th one to come out. J.K. Rowling is a outstanding story teller. She cast a spell on our family!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sourcerer's Stone is a masterpiece in different ways. As a 12-year-old Harry Potter fan, I can truthfully say that this book is this best children's book I've read.Ms.Rowling is a brilliant author who really knows kids! It is extraordinary that she can capture what is in an 11-year-old's best intrest. This book has not only what a kid can relate to, but has such a spectacular story line that even adults enjoy it tremendously. This book and the other Harry Potters are the only one of their kind. They are masterpieces."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book almost as much as my children did. Undersized,bullied and generally downtrodden Harry Potter is actually a wizard and a famous one too! His first year at wizard school, especially the breath-taking quidditch matches make for edge-of-the-seat reading. All this said, if you grew up reading Diana Wynne Jones (Charmed Life, Eight Days of Luke, Magicians of Caprona and others),as I did, you'd say a lot of it's been done before and done a bit better. Hence the four stars. But I'm still among the first in line for each sequel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hi all! Are you looking for a book about magic and wizardcraft and witchcraft? You are? Then you just have to read this fantastic Harry Potter book! I would give it 10 stars if I could, I read it in 6 days, but I'm sure you could read it in 1 or 2 days, this book is so good! It starts out with a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his aunt, uncle and cousin for 10 years, the most horrible life, the Dursleys always seem to try to get him in the wrong or in trouble. But then a letter comes for Harry. Hm... but his uncle grabs it and nearly faints, and his aunt does too nearly. They don't believe it. Then stacks of mail for him (harry) come, and his uncle tries to bolt up all the mail slots and cracks, but it doesent work. He goes to a motel, but the man says he has about 100 letters for Harry. He finally goes to live in a cabin near the sea, when a big giant named Hagrid comes, tells Harry he's a wizard, and then Harry is off to a big adventure at a wizard school! Its so fantastic!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow. This is [look at title above =*)]! This is a great book, not just for ages 8-13, how about 5-3525? Anyway, at school, I never had all of my Harry books, because someone or another was borowing it, it was so popular. GET THIS BOOK! And by the way, anyone who thinks Harry Potter promotes whitcraft, where did you think of that? Some people must dislike this book because is has the word &quot;whitches&quot; in it.

It is a good book without the hyberbole, unnessecary descriptions, poetry, or rabbit mating that makes wd so famous.

Thet's right, a sorcerer. His name is Lord Voldermort.Harry's mom was a with and his dad was a wizard. The book is about Harry growing up with his uncle Vernun and aunt Petuna Dursley, who never discuss harrys' mom and dad. The Dursleys didn't even tell Harry how his mom and dad died.(The dursleys are motal, or &quot;muggles&quot; as wizards call them.)When Harry is old enough, He finds out about his past,and learns he is a wizard.From a letter that he got from the famouse wizard and witch school, Hogwarts.The letter that he is enrolled into Hoggwarts and his parents left him a lot of wizard money.The story just begins there.

All told, I think I've read it around four times. Sorcerer's Stone is one of those rare book that changes and gets better every time you read it; Rowling has packed Harry's word so full of wit and imagery that I found it impossible to catch everything on my first read-through.People claim that all of literature is derivative, and that no new stories truly exist. If this is true, I don't think I've ever read a story that encompasses the classic themes of good vs evil, friendship, and bravery as well as this one.

RowlingBook review by Alex BoettcherWelcome to a world where anything is possible. You always need to watch your back. That's right; I'm talking about Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. This amazing book is written by J.K. Rowling and is the first book in a series of seven. This book is about three friends trying to stop the evil wizard Lord Voldemort from getting the Sorcerers Stone.The main characters are Harry, Ron, Hermione, Professor Dumbledore, and Lord Voldemort. Harry is the only wizard to ever survive a murder attempt by Lord Voldemort. The attempt left a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Ron and Hermione are friends that Harry met at Hogwarts; they help Harry try to defeat Voldemort. Dumbledore is the headmaster at Hogwarts and protects the students, especially Harry, from Voldemort because he wants revenge on Harry.The setting is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is the school that Harry and his friends all attend. Everything bad always seems to happen at Hogwarts but it always seems to stay running. Hogwarts is an amazing school. It's a castle surrounded by a huge lake. The stair cases even move!! In this book there is one very secret and forbidden floor but that is all I can say. I don't want to give it away.This book has many themes and they all tie into each other. Friendship, survival, and trust are the main themes. These all tie in because Harry, Ron, and Hermione all work and stick together and trust each others decision to try and defeat Lord Voldemort.If you like fantasy and adventure books this book is definitely for you. As I said before, it is the first book in a series of seven. I recommend anyone who likes this genre too definitely read this book!!!P.S. Take my advice!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 13 years old and haven't ever been hooked on a book like I was on Harry Potter.

Rowlings has revived the printed word for children with her Harry Potter series of books. Based on an eleven year-old orphan, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; hearkens back to the days of Madeleine L'Engle's &quot;Wrinkle in Time&quot; series.Fundamentalists have sporadically criticized the Harry Potter series of books, claiming that details of witchcraft and fantasy will corrupt our children. Such criticisms are nonsense.Harry Potter, and all stories surrounding this character, are as crystal clear in their metaphors of the values of Good vs. the downfall of Evil as any of C.S. Lewis' more &quot;religiously accepted&quot; tales.Religious fundamentalists and non-fundamentalists alike should breathe a sigh of relief when their child shows an interest in reading one of J.K. Rowling's books about young Harry Potter. The alternatives - violent games, destructive movies and cheap television shows - are much less agreeable.And adults who worry that this book may not be appropriate for their child are highly encouraged to read it themselves. Like many great young adult writers before her, Rowling writes with a quality that is also gripping for an older audience."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was recommended to me by my daughter's fiance's 8 year old son.

But when I returned to school two years ago I found myself revisiting the series with less regularity than I had in the past. That changed this summer when I made it my goal to reread the entire series before the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\", the final book in the seven-part series. I am so glad that this time I decided to start at the beginning instead of just rereading the preceding book as I did for the release of \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" because I had almost forgotten how clever and enjoyable the early installments were. While it is true that \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" is the most childish of the series, it possesses an enormous amount of charm and intelligence that, along with Rowling's signature creative energy, introduces a fantastic world that even the hardest-hearted of readers would long to belong to.It is every person's wish to be extraordinary, and that dream becomes reality for Harry Potter on his eleventh birthday, when he meets a friendly half-giant named Hagrid who announces that not only is Harry a wizard, but one of the most famous people in the wizarding world. At the tender age of one Harry somehow managed to defeat Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard so powerful that the mere mention of his name is enough to terrify the magical community. His parents were killed in the attack and Harry was left with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead. But some, including Harry's new headmaster, Professor Dumbledore, believe that Voldemort will return one day - and Harry's first year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry becomes proof positive that the dark lord is trying to return with a vengeance.So begins an epic battle between good and evil that will surely stand the test of time alongside such other juggernauts as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". As the series progresses the subject matter becomes darker and the political commentary more pointed, giving the books the realistic perspective of a boy growing up, learning to see the world for what it is, coming to terms with the weight of his destiny, and embracing goodness and bravery over cowardice and greed.It all begins right here ... so what are you waiting for? Dive in and become enchanted by the most deserving phenomenon in recent history.Grade: A"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter...hmm...what can I say; it brings out the imagination of a child. The book was wonderful. I enjoyed it very much with all the action going on at one time. It seemed to me as if there was so much action going on, but yet still you could understand it. The writing style is wonderful, easy to understand and fun to read. Just think when you read Harry Potter you are entering into a dream world of magic and fun.Harry Potter goes through so much excitement at his stay at Hogwarts. He is always trying to see what is going on at this Wizardy school. The book is about how Harry finds out that is beloved parents were wizards before they died, and he has that same power as they do. He goes to Hogwarts a school for wizards and is forced to learn all the magic and powers. His problem that he has to face is that the man that killed his parents, Voldemont, has come back to regain his power and finished where he left off and kill Harry. Only Harry can stop this evil sorcerer, but I am not going to tell you what happened next. Each character brings out a trait of some kind and allows you to relate to him/her. While reading this book have fun, kick back, and relax. Harry Potter will bring out the imagination in a child and an adult and you will enjoy every moment of it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series is one of the best books I have ever read.

Other kids know him and his name is famous so it is totally different than when he lives with his aunt. He thenhas to fight a troll, fight the dark side and play a giant chess game.

I have to mention that I have not yet seen the movie because I want to save it as a surprising experience. Winning acclaims from all over the world and across all age groups, Harry Potter is an engaging, enjoyable read. The opening of the story already captured my attention. The many letters delivered to Harry in the cupboard under the stairs, revelation of Potter's identity, the only baby survived under You-Know-Who's attack, the Diagon Alley, the sorting hat... Second part of the story builds up with an element of suspense, adventures, and the battle again the Dark Side. Though it was somehow unconvincing that 11-year-old kids like Harry, Ron, and Hermonie could have fought the troll, played the magic chessboard and battle the evil, Harry Potter has proven to be one of the most engaging stories in our lifetime. It has been said that movie was not as well-done as the book. It's reasonable that not all the tiny details from the book can be stuffed into a less-than-3-hour screenplay. I recommend everyone to immerse into the magic experience of Hogwarts. Good read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are planning on listening to this, rather than reading it, I strongly advice buying the UK version read by Stephen Fry."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was a very well written book.It had suspense, and mystery, along with laughs.I liked how Hermione had her own personality, and even though Ron was mean and making fun of her, she still gave him another chance and was friends with him again.I think that she is a very important part of the story, and without her, Harry wouldn't have ever been able to recover the sorcerer's stone. She was the one who knew about Devil's Snare, and was smart enough to remember that it hated sunlight.I also liked Ron, and even though Draco Malfoy made fun of him for being a Weasley, he didn't let it bother him too much. Ron is the type of friend that I think everyone should have because he doesn't waste his time on worrying if he is popular or not.And, we can't forget Hagrid, the trusted but blabber-mouthed grounds keeper for Hogwarts. He was true-blue to Harry until the end, and in the next books, he is also.Lastly, you couldn't help but feel bad for Harry. He had to live with the awful Dursley's under a flight of stairs. Thanks to Hagrid, he got to leave for a time while he was at Hogwarts.I give this book 5 stars, because it is so descriptive, let it tends to leave you guessing what will happen next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In this book Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard and his parents died because of a dark wizard.

After openining the lid would not stay in. I kept poping out...making it easy for the 2 cases to fall out if it lay flat. The CD were great, however; they were not damaged."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am currently rereading the Harry Potter books for the first time since J. K. Rowling concluded her series. What most impressed me about the series the first time through was how much better it got as it went along. The first two novels in the series -- THE SORCERER'S STONE and THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS -- were fun and interesting, but not great. THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, however, I did think qualified as great, and the subsequent books were even better. I tremendously admired Rowling in all this. I'm sure that she had absolutely no idea that the books would become the phenomenon that they did. She could have coasted and produced several more novels on the same level as the first two, but instead she worked extremely hard, improved her craft, and kept faith with her readers. The quality of the first novels compared with the later novels is immense. Whether or not the series deserved the degree of hype it received early on can be debated, but by the time Rowling completed her saga it definitely warranted all the praise that it had received.Nonetheless, even though THE SORCERER'S STONE is nowhere as good as the later books would be, this is a better book than I remembered. Rowling does a tremendous job of setting up the overall situation, imbuing her story with primal elements that perfectly appeal not merely to child readers, but any reader. Many of these elements are similar to what one finds in classic fairy tales: a child with a hidden destiny and unacknowledged worth is abused and debased by uncaring foster parents. This is as basic a set up as they come. And the details that Rowling develops as she chronicles Harry's life with the Dursleys are exquisite. There are times when she almost goes over the top and the neglect of the Dursleys become absurd, but all in all the effect is delightful. The contrast between Harry's nightmarish life with the Dursleys and his exciting, if sometimes dangerous, life at Hogwarts is immense.The closest thing I have to a complaint to the first novel is that the overall story is simply not very strong. What makes up for this is the frequently delicious description of Hogwarts. The places, traditions, people, and entities she describes are consistently marvelous. Diagon Alley, Haggrid, the Hogwarts Express departing from Platform Nine and Three Quarters, the Sorting Hat, the four houses of Hogwarts, Nearly Headless Nick, and numerous other details are simply superb. And Rowling creates a wonderful cast of characters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are a truly great trio, as is Dumbledore and Snape and all the denizens of Hogwarts. As I said, I think the dramatic arc of this novel is the weakest part of the book, but the world she creates is nearly perfect. The subsequent novels would exploit this wonderful world to create a great overall story.Now I'm going to say something controversial and will probably make some people mad, but I want to write an honest review. For me the one really false note that runs through all of the Harry Potter books is quidditch, which is improbably described as the greatest game in the world. I find almost nothing interesting and appealing about this game, even if people could ride on brooms. One could point to a host of minor problems with the game, but the biggest would be the absurd number of points assigned to the catching of the Golden Snitch. Catching the Snitch garners so many points as to render the rest of the game as nearly irrelevant. Apart from the fact that the game is played by people who are flying, I found almost nothing interesting about the game. And as much as I came to love the series in the later novels, I never came to like anything about quidditch.All in all this is a fine start to a great series. The main achievement in this first book is the wonderful, literally magical world that Rowling creates. While the stories would get better, the initial set up could not have been more perfect. I look anxiously forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Book is in excellent shape and well worth the money spent. Very enjoyable reading. Thank you"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series has to be the best all time collection. The journey starts with the sorcerers stone. We are introduced to Harry at the young age of 11. He is vunerable and we are drawn in by this tragic life. Then his luck changes when he gets a visit by Hagrid. An incredible life is shown to Harry and we begin to follow him in the Magic realm. He meets his life long friends, goes to Hogwarts and he untangles a devious plot to steal the sorcerers stone. Harry and his friends delight and entertain you. You won't fail to enjoy this first book of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I imagine most of us have seen the movies if we have not read the books. I was disappointed in the Half-Blood Prince movie so I turned to the book to make up for it (yes, I started at book 6, then went to 7, and now I've started at the beginning). The books are just as enjoyable as the movies (and hopefully the Half-Blood Prince movie will grow on me). Of course there are more details given in this book than the movie and there are differences, but I honestly believe neither is better than the other. It was great to read and see how Ron and Harry trully did not care for the \\"know-it-all\\" Hermoine before a certain event basically prevented them all from NOT being friends. The personalities and actions are very much in lock-step with the age of the characters and is very well done. I couldn't help but get wrapped up in the fantasy world and loved every single minute I spent reading this book. For me it's hard to find a story that will actually keep me interested enough to read the book and not just \\"wait for it to come to movie\\" and so on. I've become a bit lazy I suppose; but this story has gotten me strongly back into books. Hopefully my daughter will take my lead and get into reading more herself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"For a first novel, I have to say that J K Rowling really knows how to glue her readers to her story. The characters are believable, the story is just excellent, especially the miror of erised chapter which is probably one of the best in the whole series.Not only is it a great book, but we get to see how Jo Rowling started plotting her whole series and we get to see all the little clues and details that eventually not only influence the future books, but also important elements coming back in the last chapters of the series.A great beginning for a great author."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book that starts it all. The weakest in the series, but the seeds of the greatest fantasy series are certainly there in this stage-setting book. Orphaned, abused eleven-year-old Harry Potter discovers not only his identity as a wizard, but his destiny as hero against the darkest wizard of all time as he seeks to protect his school against evil. Innocent, light, full of wonder and magic, this book reminds one upon rereading of Eden before the fall. Rowling's comedic and dramatic voice, her beautifully detailed and clever magical world, her mysterious, intelligent, and emotionally resonant plots, and--absolutely best of all--her fascinating, realistic, deep, and loveable (even when hating some of them) characters; this is where it all begins, where they first step onto the page. There are elements here (particularly in Snape--one of the greatest characters of all literature--and his enigmatic performance, but also Harry's heart-wrenching scene in front of the Mirror of Erised) that not only resonate and enter the realm of extraordinary literature, but that foreshadow the greatness to come. I am not ashamed to write that this is the eighth time I've read this book. Each time, it gets better and better, folks. Grade: A"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A lot of the accusations made in the one-star reviews are true... There is a lot about this book series that is derivative of Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, and many other well known books, fairy tales, and fables. It is also a pure fantasy adventure with lots of stock or archetypal characters (but let's be honest, what fantasy isn't?), and there really isn't a whole lot going on under the surface.However, since I don't think ANYONE in the right mind could mistake \\"Harry Potter & the Sorceror's Stone\\" for the title of work by Dostoyevsky, those arguments don't really hold up as an accurate assessment of whether the book is successful (let's also not forget that Tolkien and Lewis purloined mythology to build their exciting worlds).What this book IS is a quick and easy to read fantasy romp with lots of heart that has been massively successful in persuading digital-age kids to sit down and read complete English sentences (with each book upping the reading level, no less), plus some good life-lessons and unpretentious morals to boot. I don't have children yet; but if I ever do, I will definitely give them copies of these books. It's also quite a good way for adults to relax and blow off steam without having to contemplate the harsh realities of wage slavery and the military-industrial complex. You might even crack a smile.The audio book version that is narrated by Stephen Fry is also terrifically fun and light-hearted; it makes my work day pass relatively painlessly.My final word: There's better lit out ther, better fantasy, better kids' books, even better kids' fantasy, but that still doesn't detract from the fact that this is a highly enjoyable read.If your kid like's these books, also try Coraline by Neil Gaiman, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland & Through The Looking Glass by Lewis Carol, Hobbit & LOTR by J.R.R. Tolkien, Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, A Wrinkle In Time by Madeleine L'Engle, and the Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I tried reading this book some years ago, it didn't catch my interest right away and after only a couple of chapters I put it away thinking that the target audience was definitely kids and that it clearly was overrated. Besides, I was pretty bored of the tired old theme of the young boy who learns he has magical/super/special powers. Gee, never read that one before.Fast forward a few years and I found myself about to head out on a long plane trip and didn't have time to go to a bookstore and pick something I really wanted, so in desperation I picked up this book again.The book still has a slow start, but once Harry gets to the magic school a sense of wonder kicks in that really turns the book around and makes it a fun read. And that is really what makes it work - the author does a good job of conveying a sort of childlike wonder without overly dumbing it down and making the book seem too much like a kids book. There are also some interesting minor characters to spice things up, and although Harry himself is to me the least interesting of the three main characters, his two companions make up for his shortcomings.Is it overrated? Sure it is. But what we have here is an example of good story-telling. The story itself isn't really new, and there are plenty of tried-and-true (and perhaps worn-out) fantasy themes and props throughout, but what makes this book work is the balance of humor, wonder, mystery, and darkness. Those things, together with good pacing - make for a very tight and overall satisfying read. I'm glad I gave it another shot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Deep within the hidden recesses of our world, in dark corners and down dark alleyways is a strange and subtly different world. Inhabited by strange mythical creatures, full of magic and alchemy and imbued with strange and wondrous characters, this land is not dissimilar to our own, but at the same time is very different.Harry Potter's world has much in common with ours; the schools are similar, yet the subjects taught are profoundly different. Whereas we are taught English and Math, Harry attends classes on potion making and herbology. While we play cricket and rugby, or baseball and football, they play Quiddich. As we got to a red bricked building, he goes to a castle.The people and animals are different too; we may encounter different races, colors and nationalities, Harry may encounter dwarves, goblins and trolls. While we may be scared of wolves, foxes and alligators, Harry may run from ghouls, dragons and giant spiders.Harry Potter's world is a world full of danger, intrigue and adventure; a world where magic is used for good and evil, and the fate of the world is decided by the swish of a wand. Harry Potter's world takes you beyond the mundane into the fantastic.In the first book in the series (of seven) we find that Harry has been living in the cupboard under the stairs for as long as he can remember. The Dursleys (his uncle and aunt) have tried to suppress his past, but cannot hide the truth when Hagrid, a half-giant from Hogwarts school, arrives on Harry's birthday and announces that Harry has been accepted into Hogwarts school, the school for wizards and witches.Harry enters a new world when he arrives at the school, and immediately is embroiled in intrigue, danger and adventure. Not only is Harry a wizard, be he is also the most famous wizard in the world; as a baby, he survived an attack by Voldemort, the most evil and dangerous wizard in the world, and Voldermort isn't happy about it!This book tells the tale of how Harry enters Hogwarts school, begins to meet some great friends (and enemies) and embarks on a quest to find a magical stone that he believes Severus Snape (a sinister professor at the school) is trying to steal to give to Voldermort.As an introduction into Harry's world, this book is excellent. It introduces all the main characters, delves into the magical world and fills our eyes with high adventure and intrigue - it is a must read for all kids, and most adults will be surprised how quickly they become hooked."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book rules!

I would tell anyone to read this book including adults because this book is amazing. My favorite writer was Dahl but changed to J.K.Rowling ever since I read her book.

I'm alittle prejudiced about books about boys, and I didn't think anyone could outwrite [my favorite author]. This proves that someone could. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best books I've read since I discovered the Tamora Pierce books a year ago. The thickness of the book can set some kids off, as can the beginning (it takes a while to &quot;slosh through&quot;) but NEVER put the book down until Harry gets to Hogwarts- and then you'll find that you can't. I wish that I could go to Hogwarts! A MUST READ for everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A wonderful, rich, humorous, adventure. The Greatest book I read. I went to see the movie before I read the book. After the movie, me and my mom had to stop at the store. I asked if I could have the book. The Movie was excellent; 31/2 Stars. But the book changed my life. I thought after seeing the movie nothing could be better, then I read the book. I was amazed at how J.K Rowling could tie so many different elements into a book. The great novel had me racing through the pages wanting more and getting it. Easily, the most incredible fantsy novel ever. The book that started it all. Congrats to JK Rowling for being an exellent author, and keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was so fasinating.

But this time I was quite disappointed: I found people who think HP to be a disorientating book for children, in their opinion it forges breaking-rule mind...I can't accept it, I'm sure they've got their own reason to think the way they think, but...You can't judge a fiction book as a learning-life book, you can't think that a book must be full of perfection cause children read it...You must understand the metaphores: this is good against evil, this is good guy against bad guy... I read about Christ!?!?!?Are you joking? You can't expect an eleven years old boy to act like Christ, if you want perfection you can of course read the Bible! HP is a boy and his schoolmates are children like him...And so they act like children (fantastic ones of course!).Listen to me: this is pure magic, it may have weak spots, but it's absolutely fascinating.And it's just the beginning, go and read the 3rd and the 4th one (and now the fifth too!!!!) and dream of a world that has so much to give..........."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is so much better than I thought; while everyone was reading these books, I thought they were stupid!

The contents are simply brilliant, and the poor, stuttering Proffessor Quirrell is more than you think...... he begins the chain of accursed Defense Against the Dark Arts Teachers. One of the best books in the world!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"even if you haven't read any of j.k.rowling's books, it is impossible not to have noticed the harry potter phenomenon that is sweeping across the globe. children and adults alike are experiencing what has grown to be known as \`potter mania', and few books have ever achieved the legendary status that these books have reached. the question playing on all our minds is this: why are the books so popular? read on to find out!the first book in the series, \`harry potter and the philosopher's stone', introduces ten-year-old harry; an orphan who is forced to live with his aunt and uncle dursley. he is continually mistreated, causing readers to feel immediate sympathy and liking for him.when harry is rescued from his ghastly relatives by a giant man called hagrid, he learns that he is no ordinary boy but a wizard, and that his parents were not killed in a car crash as harry had previously been told, but were murdered by an evil wizard called lord voldemort. harry was just a baby at the time, but when voldemort tried to kill harry, somehow his attack was resisted and voldemort was stripped of all his powers and vanished. because of that, harry is famous in the wizard world, and easily recognisable by the lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead.harry is then taken by hagrid to kings cross station, platform nine-and-three-quarters, where he catches the hogwarts express to \`hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry'. upon arrival at the school the \`sorting hat' - a magical wizard's hat that possesses the ability to read into your mind, sorts all the pupils into different houses. harry is sorted into gryffindor - the red house for the brave and daring.along with his two best friends hermione granger and ron weasley, harry begins his adventures. he soon adjusts to the ways of the wizard world, which are so very different to the ways of \`muggles', muggle being the term used to describe non-magical people. Harry is provided with a flying broomstick and a magic wand, which he has to learn to use. He meets strange people and creatures, including ghosts, trolls, dragons, and a terrifying three-headed dog called \`Fluffy'.Although Harry is not a particularly brilliant student, he is talented at Quidditch, a wizard sport. Between classes, games, and quarrels with teachers and classmates, Harry becomes involved in a mystery concerning the magical Philosopher's Stone. And as for Lord Voldemort ... perhaps he hasn't vanished completely after all ...So let's return to wondering why the books are so popular. Although the books are aimed at children, many of the themes and plotlines seem to be intended for adult readers. The books can be read on so many different levels - readers can enjoy the books as a simple story or they can look deeper. The Harry Potter books have attracted a vast audience, and the books appeal to both male and female readers in different age groups, cultures and countries.The ideas behind the books are relatively simple, and they are not entirely original. However, the books are written in such an original and creative way that they are unique. The books are absolutely crammed with detail, and this is what makes the books so believable and complex. Even seemingly insignificant details often prove to be relevant at later stages in the story.Harry himself is an extremely loveable character. People can identify with his initial sense of hopelessness at the start of the first book, and then relief when he is rescued by Hagrid and learns that he is a wizard. Children fall in love with Harry because he reminds them of themselves. Harry is not perfect, has both friends and enemies, and experiences unfair treatment, but he has qualities that readers admire, especially his determination and his bravery.However, not everyone has reacted positively to the Harry Potter books. In several schools, churches and even some American states, the books have been banned. Many claim that the books promote witchcraft and are generally \`evil'. To me this seems ridiculous! The Harry Potter books certainly don't condone evil behaviour; in fact it is quite the opposite, as there is a strong Good versus Evil theme running throughout the books.I would definitely recommend the Potter series to anyone over the age of about eight, as some of the scenes may frighten younger readers. Adults, don't let yourself be put off just because it has been labelled as just a kid's book, because this really isn't the case. I've spoken to several critics of the books, but not one of them had actually read the Potter books. So for you sceptics out there, don't pass judgement on the books unless you've at least given \`Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' a try. I guarantee that after the first page you'll be as caught up by Potter Mania as the rest of us are!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter books are about the best books I have ever read!They came out in 1998,when I was 7,and,being to young to read them,I hated them.But now I am rereading them and love them!I highly recomend these for anyone age 10 to adult,particularly people who likes adventure and suspence.You'll LOVE them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When anyone mentions the name Harry Potter, 2 words immediately come into the minds of those over 18: children books. But then again, that's what most said about the Hobbit. People in grade school would read that book and we hold it in much praise but with the Harry Potter books, you feel people are laughing at you when they see you at the counter with one. Well not to fret people, even though it does with a lot of things kids will love, adults can get hooked into this too.The story begins as the main character Harry Potter is living with his horrible relatives, the Dudleys. They absolutely hate him and just when things can't get any worse, he receives a letter \\"you've been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\\". He's also famous. When he was young, an evil wizard named Voldemort(or \\"He Who Must Not Be Named\\" or \\"You Know Who\\" killed Harry's parents but Harry survived, walked away with only a lightning shaped scar on his forehead. The book follows his first year(one of 7) at Hogwarts dealing with danger along the way.Despite a huge children fanbase, it's actually quite a good read and isn't a bit distant and seemingly academically written like Tolkien. One reviewer for Lord of the Rings said the books divided people in the English language as those who read the books and those who will. Harry Potter would be a stepping stone to Lord of the Rings then."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Having seen the movie prior to reading the book, I was happy to see the book meet my high expectations. The book is well written and the character's initial development so well done. I enjoy English writers because of their attenion to detail, especially mysteries. This book, and indeed the series, really have many mysteries in them that are revealed as you read on. The three main characters, although there are really many, Harry, Ron and Hermoine, are developed just as you would expect 10 year old English children to act. This book and the series are a boom to children's reading and that can only be good. J.K Rowling has written an outstanding book with something for most readers, whether it be the battle between good and bad, or right and wrong, the adventures that the young people have in book, as well as the following books, the making of friends for Harry, and the introduction of some of the most memorable characters you're likely to read about in a book. This book and the series of Harry Potter books will be entertain children and adults alike for many years to come. Buy it, read it, and enjoy the story of Harry Potter"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"read this in college. good book. easy to read (i guess it's for kids) and fun. cheap entertainment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you liked Harry Potter you will adore these audio tapes/ cds.

I am a 34 year old government worker from Western Canada and I picked up this book after seeing it sit for so long on Amazon's bestseller list. I couldnt have been more thrilled. I haven't been so excited about a book since I was kid. I've got Harry wallpaper on my computer, a Harry screensaver (from Scholastic.com), and am anxious for any type of marketing items that come along ..dolls, posters, etc.(now that IS strange). I just wish I had a child to read it to! If I was 10 years old, I would likely quiver and shake at the sight of a new Harry Potter book. Wait, I already do that!!

An hour later the store closed and I had to buy the book to keep going. A week later I finished Book 4. They're great books for anyone who enjoys a classical adventure. They have all the right elements: the underdog hero with a dramatic past; the villains; magic. They're saved from being cutesy kids' books, as so many are anymore, by the dark undercurrent that runs through all of the books. Harry Potter and his friends and enemies become real (admittedly Voldemort is a bit cartoonish, but that's part of the fun) and when they're in peril, as they frequently are, you genuinely worry about them, and breathe a sigh of relief when they're saved in time for another adventure. I didn't believe all the hype at first; now I can't wait for #5 to come out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to read Harry Potter. Like many adults (and especially those who don't have children), I had assumed that this was simply a children's book which would not be of particular interest to me. Boy, was I wrong. Once I started I simply couldn't bare to stop reading. I regretted any time that I was not deep into its pages. This is a beautifully crafted, magical journey to another world that whips up the imagination and leaves you begging for more. The spectrum of characters is broad and the plot is strong and well-developed. I will be moving onto the second book just as soon as I can get hold of it. Don't waste any more time wondering if this book is for you - if you are a real reader (and especially one who has been so since childhood), get this book now and fly to Hogwarts - you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is an excelent start to the Harry Potter series. It brings out the dreams and wishes of kids into a magical adventure. Harry Potter is an average kid, only he has an unknown past, having no parents he is forced to live with his Aunt and Uncle, who are quite entertaining due to what they say and do to Harry and what Harry does to them in response. Then on his eleventh birthday it all changes, opening his eyes to another world. Over all I think this is a great novel but is more fore a younger audience."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"really helped me in an important way. I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was eight years old. My parents weren't sure I would ever read. Now I'm sixteen and when I was thirteen I read my first Harry Potter book, all the way through, without any trouble. As you can see I can spell, read and write just like everyone else now. It's true I went to special dyslexia schools. But I never had fun reading until Harry Potter. So the people who say mean things about these books should remember that many people, kids and adults, don't read for pleasure easily. These books are great for anyone who thinks that big books are too hard or that reading isn't a great adventure. Thank you, J.K. Rowling!!!So Much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J K Rowling just keeps getting better and better, although I think Prisoner was more focused than Goblet. The strength of the books is their plotting, although Philosopher and Chamber are fairly straight forward the intensity and originality of the plot in books 3 and 4 is astounding. Rowling skilfully draws all the threads together at end of each book and on each occasion never ceased to surprise me in some fashion. I have to admit to be eagerly awaiting the next book and the film due at the end of the year. Furthermore adults can enjoy these books as much as children - I am 26. There are also special \`adult' editions available with discrete covers in case anyone is embarrassed to be seen reading Harry Potter in public."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a wonderful story about a young boy who finally finds a place to fit in!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...Insult those who are insulted by Harry Potter! I'm 10 years old here, and even I can see what they were doing! I can see that they changed the U.K. version, so it could appeal to all ages! If they had kept the same version, then a lot of younger kids who were able to read this wouldn't to concentrate on the plot! They'd be to busy trying to figure the words mean! Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a better educated generation. And come on, all people, not just kids, need a place where fantasy exists. Some adults need a place where they can remember they're childhood. They just need something to remind of what they used to believe in. This book does NOT lead little kids astray, as SOME people seem to think. It gives them something to believe in. A place to escape the world around them. J.K. Rowling deserves every bit of credit she gets as a Best-Seller Author. And as for those people who think these books are bad for kids, well, all I can say to them is, LOOK AROUND YOU!!!! With all the high-school shootings, guns, and violence, kids need somewhere they can get away from that, and that is what these books can give them. Something good, something magical, for them to believe in."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was the best book i ever read.

Young Harry Potter is an 11-year old with a serious problem: after ten years being the stomping block for his deplorable aunt, uncle, and cousin, he finds out that he's a wizard! Not just any wizard, he's known throughout the wizard world as the one person to survive a direct encounter with the supremely evil bad guy wizard, Voldemort (pardon, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named). Everyone seems to know this but him. I checked this book out from the library before I even knew about all the fuss it had created. I have always had a yen for fantasy and I loved it! I have read it three times now and am trying desperately to get my little brother into it.

What would you do if you found out that you were a wizard? I would probably freak out or something because that would be, in some cases, awesome (in my opinion).The Harry Potter series I thought are pretty good. This book I am going to talk to you about is the first out of the four. I think this is the best one because it has a lot of secrets and twists. Some weird things are that Harry's dad and mom where both killed by a wizard by the name of Voldamort! In the book, the people don't say his name because he is so cruel. But because of Voldamort, Harry Potter is famous because he is the only one who lived after Voldamort came through. Later in the series you learn more about how his parents died. I think it is cool how the author writes her books. She gets you in the book so you read the next one and the next one and so on. Every book though it seems she tells you more about how the parents died and how Harry's school days go on.Later in the book Harry has to go through a lot of challenges to stay alive. In the end, Harry finds himself face to face with Voldamort, which has taken over one of Harry's teacher's body. This is how the book ends, but I left a lot of stuff out for you to find out for yourself. So to my conclusion, this is a great book and a great series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is the most imaginative book I have ever read.

The only thing that Voldemort did to Harry was gave Harry a scar on his forehead. Harry is adopted by his uncle and aunt who treats Harry like dirt. Harry then goes to Hogwarts with Hagrid (a very big man). Learning at Hogwarts was not easy with Malfoy (a bully) pushing Harry around. In the end, Harry goes face-to-face with proffesor Quirrel with voldemart in him. Harry kills Quirrel and Voldemort escaped.What I like about this book was that this book hooks you in in the first couple of pages. This book is an great adventure books with new, exciting adventures. There are many new items and new wizards things never seen in our world. I also like how J.K Rowling describes everything in details. This is a great book.What i dislike about this book is that in the beginning, thew story is a little bit boring. The story is not interesting in the beginning. I think the story could get better if there were a lot more action in the story. Then the story would get more interesting. The story would be a lot more fun for people, like me to read.The part that I like the most in Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is the part where Harry, Ron, and Hermione go to Voldemort. Theres so much action in it and there are alot of sacrifices like ron giving his people for Harry to go to Voldemort and Hermione to figure out the riddle and letting Harry go through.

My teacher highly recommended the book. He did this special little game thing with us. We would have to buy the book from him for about five dollars. After we read the book, he would give everyone who had truly finished the book a quiz that came in three parts. It was simple. If we passed the quiz, we would get our money back we paid to him for the book AND keep the whole story. However, if you didn't pass the test, you could keep the book, but you didn't get your money back. After I took the test, I recieved my money back. I was hooked on this book so I read the other two books that were out, then when the fourth came out I read that too. I would highly recommend the book for a kid ."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book that started it all.When my mom gave me this book, I wasn't interested at all. But when I picked it up and finally started reading it, I couldn't put it down! The story of a boy hated by his relatives who finally discovers he has magical powers and must learn to control them is very appealing to me. I know many a time I have wished for magical powers! But Harry learns how to use his brains as well as his magical brawn to figure out riddles, solve puzzles, and outwit bullies. Excellent from start to end! I even got my husband to read these books!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love fantasy stories, and this one is just amazing. Harry, a ten year old orphan living with his aunt, uncle, and cousin, discovers a hidden part of his childhood and learns he is a wizard. The adventures and relationships built in this, the first volume of the Harry Potter series, bring the story and its characters to life in a way rarely seen in books today. This series will delight and entertain even the yougest of readers, of adults of all ages. I love Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. This is a pleasure to read. As a &quot;grownup&quot; you'll read it quickly. I recommend an afternoon on the couch, hot tea and this book. Read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After having read all four Harry Potter books three times each I am going through withdrawal. I wish I didn't have to wait a year or more for the next book so I bought the two schoolbooks. Of all the books I have read as an adult I have found some of the greatest reading joy in Harry Potter. Those of us who grew up as nerds, unathletic, and/or non-cliquey people will feel at home at Hogwarts. Those readers who haven't will still love reading these books. As each book unfolded I saw parallels between the Hogwarts world and the Star Wars films. Both promote a sense of a loner learning to thrive in a world where you are just a little bit (or maybe more than a little) different from everyone else. Harry is creative, intelligent, and interesting You will find yourself rooting him on as each book finds him confronting evil and I'm not going to spoil anything by saying any details! Don't skip these books because you consider yourself a &quot;grown-up&quot; and too adult to read them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book!! I don't see how people can't like it. It is cool how you can like escape from the real world to a fantasy world. Usually when i read books i can't stand reading them more than once. But all the Harry Potter books make me want to keep reading them. I read them so fast i can't wait for the next one to come out. Some of my friends make fun of me for reading long books, but it's like how can you not like these books?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is my first book on CD/tape ever.

The author knows exactly how to attract a readers attention and hold it with the most lyrical,yet down to earth prose that I've read since L.M.Montgomery(Anne Of Green Gables and the magical &quot;Emily&quot; books)I'd defy any but the dullest of children NOT to be totally captivated by this wonderful tale.I&quot;ll definitely try to borrow book 2 from the neighbours brood!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I waited until a week ago to read the first Harry Potter book, and I must say that I did so on a whim. The first book has been around for a couple of years, but I picked it up out of the blue, and I am so glad I did! Not since The Chronicles of Narnia have I been so engrossed in reading! (And I may sound pathetic, being an 18 year old, but start on Book 1...you'll see!) In fact, the Narnia series is the prelude to Harry Potter, a wonderful series involving the stark contrasts between mundane everyday life and the enchanted universe of magic. The mystery quality of this series is also a heavy presence. The ending totally got me on this one! Oh yeah...and another thing...the whole thing about Harry Potter being satanic...What?!? If you'll simply read how badly he is treated by his only living family (the Dursleys), then you'll want to cry! The story is nothing more than a boy using his vivid imagination to escape, even temporarily, the plight of his condition. Ever heard of The Wizard of Oz or Pippy Longstocking?!? When these stories surfaced, no aspersions were cast on them about religious innuendos! Well, there you have it...if you have never read the Harry Potter books, you're missing out! The only feasible reason for not reading these books is the wait for paperback prices on the third and subsequent books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling's beginning to a fantastic series is easily the greatest example of her ability to write simple plotlines that steamroll into brilliant pieces of literature. As we continue, the book changes from an everyday fantasy into an intricate web of wonderful writing and story that will go down in history as some of the greatest writing ever."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a college student who has been entranced by Ms. Rowlings books. The Harry Potter books has let me again dream of extravegant settings with memorable characters. All of us deserve to dream again and her books do just that. With the stresses of life it is good to sit down and read a fun story with a great plot. You will not regret reading Harry Potter, and better yet with someone young.

And thankyou Ms. Rowling for letting all of us have fun again when we read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Joanne rowling has finally managed to do what most authors always want.

I enjoyed this very much. It reminded me of the first Mystical Fantasy book ever read (A Wrinkle In Time) which got me hooked on the Sci-Fi/Fantasy Genre. My oldest son is reading it now, and I enjoy talking with him about the book. We get involved with the characters and their adventures. I am looking forward to reading the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought this book was excellent. It always kept me interested every time I picked it up. Some of the characters in it I didn't care for, because of their attitudes, like Draco Malfoy, who was always being mean to Harry. Also, Snape, a teacher that doesn't like Harry. Mr. Quirrel who was secretly hiding something that was a danger to Harry. There was a lot of make believe in this story, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I think everyone would enjoy this book from a young reader to an adult."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"just like the rest of the world i fell in love with Harry Potter as soon as i opened the first book. well written and surprising twists. a book that one can not put down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was a awesome and exciting book.I would recommend this book to kids of all ages.It is a action packed thriller that will leave you hanging off your seats.You will not want to stop reading this book you will be amazed at the surprises that are right around the corner.So jump into your car and head for the bookstore for this amazing book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm a 75-yr. old grandmother who's interested in children's books. I just read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and was captivated by it. What a wonderfully imaginative story! I think it will be a classic down through the years, on a par with Alice in Wonderland and on a more juvenile level with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The greatist fictional series to date. That is my opinion. But I think most will agree with me. This book introduces to the the \\"house-hold name\\" Harry Potter.

I highly suggest reading the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I've just recently started reading this series, and I have to admit that I have been very entertained. This book was a bit \\"young\\" I noticed in the writing, but understandably so, since the main character is only 11.

I have the complete set now, and have to read them at least once a year or so. IT is a great start to the Harry Potter series. Thank you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It feels so long ago that I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time. I can't remember exactly how I felt upon completion, but I must have loved it because I devoured the rest of the books--there were only three of them back then--in a matter of days.What I can remember is how agonizingly long the wait for the other books was, how I reread the first book when I was scared of being the new kid in school, and how I became friends with other fans of the series. I remember feeling stronger after reading about Harry's strength, and, most importantly, I remember how much I grew to love reading.This all probably sounds terribly sappy, but to the people who call this book unimaginative, contrived, and even claim Harry and his friends are bad role models, I would just like to say that kids don't see any of that. This kid saw the importance of friendship and courage, even in the face of evil, and a place to escape to when she need to be reminded of these things. Adults need to remember that this is a children's book, and no one should read it expecting an existential masterpiece. The books grow as Harry grows, and as JK Rowling grows as an author.Is this book perfect? No, but for a kid reading it for the first time, it's close enough."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wore my paperback out so back it was falling apart so I bought the Hard copy to go w/ the rest of my series. Like I had stated in the other Reviews you will feel like your actually a character in the book I really hated seeing it end so soon. I know alot of people were like soon. But to me it was way to soon. I highly recommend this and all Harry Potter Books and Movies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"People have been telling me to read Harry Potter since I was in high school ten years ago. I finally started reading the series this weekend after my running buddy convinced me to, and I have already finished the first three. JK Rowling is really clever and witty. I know her intended audience is kids, but I think they are appropriate for all ages. As I read these books I oscillate between wondering if children can grasp everything she writes about, or whether I need to give children more credit for what they can understand.As I ponder why I enjoy these books so much, I have come to several conclusions. First, I really enjoy Quidditch. Secondly, Rowling has an amazing ability to write child characters. I remember people from my own life who I identify with characters in Rowlings book. These stories are great not only because the story is interesting, but because they bring back memories from my own childhood. So, for any of you who were like me and did not want to read the series everyone has been talking about, start reading the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm an 11 year old girl, and I began reading the Harry Potter series when I was about nine.

It gets the reader hooked from the very beginning and keeps us turning the pages as fast as we can. This is a book not only for young adults but for us oldsters too. This is a story of a young boy being raised by hateful relatives, who's very life is about to change in ways he never imagined. We meet an array of characters from his aunt and uncle who are Muggles, to Hagrid, to Professor Dumbledore, to.... well, most people already know the story. BUT if you don't then pick up the first book and get reading. You're in for the treat of your life."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is my favorite book, even better than Animorphs!* I've only read the first book, but I hope I can order the other two.

The writing is creative and imaginary. I could almost feel how mean and rotten his Aunt,Uncle and Cousin were to him and I felt like I just wanted to grab Harry and give him a big hug. I'm not a kid between 9 and 12 years old. I'm a 35 year old mother of a 7 month old daughter, but I'd say this book is for people of all ages to simply read and relax and enjoy! I can't wait to read it to my daughter as she gets older. I just started the second book and already bought the 3rd!! Keep them coming!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I love this book so much.

So, I got it from our classroom library, and I loved it! A friend's aunt lives in the UK, and she sent him the Chamber of Secrets and I begged him to let me read it. All of those people who say this book is bad for children because it talks about witchcraft and wizardry are overre-acting.

It has lots of adventures and mainly, magic. I rated it 4 because I think maybe it should have a bit more adventures in it, but it's still a very good book. It's very interesting.The book's setting is in Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a castle in which Harry Potter goes to. I think that Hogwarts is a very good setting to put the story in.When Harry Potter finds out his family secret, it was very surprising for him and me. After reading, I got very interested that I couldn't stop reading. Sometimes when Harry goes through hard times, I sometimes put myself in his place and started thinking about what I should do if I were him.The most interesting part for me is when Harry is trying to find out about his past. Another part is when he is trying to get revenge on Voldemort, the villian. Through out his adventure in this different magical world, he finds differents things that interest him. Just like flying on brooms, playing Quidditch, and casting spells."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although I am only 10 I'm a great reader for my age.

I even found myself playing *hooky* from work to stand in a line to see the movie with all the children who in fact had skipped school to see the film.The moral of this story is any book that will make a kid enjoy to read is a great book. Ms. Rowling is definately the most creative author I have come across. The vivid way she tells the story and how she makes the characters comes to life made me actually wish that they actually existed in reality. I couldn't put the books down. At this day and age, where kids aren't reading for entertainment, Harry Potter is definately a great alternative to television and Nintendo!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (a.k.a. Philosopher's Stone) is a great book. I've had countless times when I would try to compare myself with Harry. It never worked out. The book full of mystery, magic, and thrills. My brother and I keep maing up our own spells. One of them is &#34;Accio Fire!&#34; wich makes fireballs come out of your wand. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is truly a great book and I had a fantastic time reading it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is one of my favourite Harry Potter's.

There are also many inspiring lines and points. Just plain good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was so heart-warming! It feels as if you know the characters as soon as they are introduced. I love the easy-going and true friendship that Harry, Ron, and Hermione develop as the story continues. The magical events that go on at Hogwarts are thrilling and more than enough to pull me from my own reality into an adventurous, touching, and creative world. I was pulled in immediately, and felt that way until the Very Last page."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next in the series.

Second time reading and still leaves me to wanting to read more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars. This book was fabulous (and the sequels are fabulous too)! Great for ages four to one hundred and four! A MUST READ FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 37 year old female, that reads mainly hardcore who-done-it books. I happen to pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for curiosity sake. Not only, was this a no blinker , it made me smile with genuine folly. I just finished Harry Potter and the Secret Chamber and can hardly wait to dive head first into Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . The only problem is, what will I read until then next enchanting tango with Harry Potter?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"And I mean that. I'm a sophomore in college, and my Mom and brother had me read it over holiday break recently. I finnished it in a little less than a week, and I was completely caught up in it. And if there are any &quot;concerned parents&quot; out there, wondering if it contains evil and witchcraft, you're tragically undereducated. It's just a fun, imaginitive story, with morals and plot and all kinds of fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was an amazing book, in my opinion. I have read other fantasy stories (such as &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;) and this is one of the best ones I've seen. It is not a story for little kids, as many people think. What I like about this story is how it tells about a totally fictional place in such a realistic, believable way that anyone can relate to. (I don't want to spoil the story for anyone who hasn't read it, so I'm not going to give any details about it just in case!)The characters have their own unique personalities that are shaped gradually throughout the chapters, which makes the story even more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this book and its sequels to any type of fantasy or science fiction reader, and pretty much everyone else too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the best book i've ever read! I could NOT put it down. When I first heard about the book I thought it was like a little kid book because I had read reviews that said ages 9-12. This proves to be untrue. Harry Potter is definitely a book for all ages. There are many twists and turns to the plot and a great unexpected ending. I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":".This is a great book.But I'm too old to be reading it for the first time. If I had read it when I was younger I would've read it many, many times. But now, alas! I am too old to be reading it for the first time.When I finished reading it, I though, &quot;You know, if I had read this when I was a kid, then rereading it now would've been the greatest pleasure!&quot;But oh well. I digged it anyway. And as they come out in paperback I'll buy and read them all. And then MY kids will have them, so they can give them the full five stars they arguably deserve.Oh--and all that Satanic stuff is ridiculous. Don't believe any noselin who says this book is Satanic. There's far more about Satan in Acts than there is in Harry Potter, book 1.That's enough on that."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What an incredible book! However, I am a senior citizen and found the book totally interesting &amp; engrossing. As a matter of fact, I read it in one day (and night, I should say) since I couldn't put it down. All the local bookstores were out of all of these books, so I ordered from Amazon.com - and saved quite a small bundle as well. This series is superb - for all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 13, and I loved the book, I read all 3 in a week, I couldn't put it down, the first one took a few days but I read the second one all day and finished , I wouldn't eat dinner, I just sat there. This book is a page turner, And I looked at some reveiws, and all those people who hate the book because it has witch craft, you shouldn't reveiw it, this is supposed to be what you thought about the book, not your points on witch craft and christianity. I could care less, if it had to do with the devil, if you read it and hated it, fine. But don't just put a book down by its plot, and your releigion. It's not fair."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The Harry Potter series is the best series ever thought up in one persons mind.I couldnt stop readind it once I picked it up.I really didn\`t like reading until this series came along.So far I have only read the first book but I hear &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;is sapose to be the best book J.K.

It's about a boy named Harry Potter and he finds out he's a wizard. He goes to a school called Hogwarts and he learns magic. He doesn't know it but he's on a daring adventure. You should read this book and find out what happens."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is a good book. It has really cool stuff in it like a fully-grown mountain troll and the sorcerer's stone. Hermione used a lot of magic. Malfoy was very selfish and mean and one of the reasons Harry didn't want to be in Slytherin."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"HP year 1 is a fantastic story appropriate for young children. It highlights the values of friendship, bravery, honesty, and loyalty in a classic \\"good versus evil\\" plot. The wonders of a magical world keep readers enthralled with this book for hours.Since this is book one in a series, I will note that these books are written to grow up with. No matter how \\"advanced\\" your child is at reading, I suggest you stagger these books so that there is at least a few years between starting the series and finishing the series. Personally, I would not let anyone under age 13 read books 4-7 since these books start to contain murders. I grew up reading these stories, and happened to be Harry's age for most of the books - which was not only enjoyable but added a new element of understanding to my reading. The movie ratings more or less reflect the age appropriateness of the story - PG 13 for the fourth book and beyond imo."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When the first Harry Potter book was published, it seemed like everyone in the world was raving about it. This mysterious sudden craze enticed me to read it for myself and receive the experience that everyone couldn't get enough of. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone exceeds all of the expectations and marks the turn of the new millenium. Fantasy was a cherished genre that felt absent during the 90's. J.K. Rowling wiped the dust from the fantasy bookshelf and brought us something new that compares to C.S. Lewis's Narnia and Tolkein's Lord of the Rings.When I first read this, somewhere close to ten years ago, it was an extrodinary read. Very few books can be this entertaining, while set in the wizard/witch world. Rowling defined the mythology in her own words, and made it impressively entertaining for all ages. Reading it at 20 years old today, I still have that connection I made as a pre-teenager. Harry Potter is one of the greatest fantasy epics with no age range. I reccomend it to anyone with a spark of imagination. The movies are great too, but this is where it all began, and so this is where you should start or continue.I'm not going to reveal any unknowns, but I will say a few things in order to help those who are curious. 1) It lives up to all the Hype. 2) It's original and thouroughly entertaining. 3) They get better as you read throughout the series of books. 4) It's important to read this in respect to the new millenium. It is being read in schools now, and I consider it a historical document the progression of our literature. Lastly, it is not childish or timid. Harry Potter is intense and applicable to any age. Skeptics are missing out while the brave adults are relishing in page-turning joy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm guessing you don't know what that means. Well, if you discover the Harry Potter series you'll fall into a world of magic. All kinds, good and evil! I enjoyed this book tremendously. An interesting part of this story is when he figures out two things: one, he's a wizard...and two, he finally figures out the truth about his parents' deaths.This story takes place in Hogwarts, a magical wizard and witches school. Harry Potter gets cursed by an evil wizard by the name of Lord Voldemort. The wizard folks dare not speak his name. He's got a lightning shaped scar and all of his life up until a certain point he thought his parents died in a car crash. A giant half-troll, by the name of Hagrid, comes to take him to Hogwarts. I would recommend this book/series to anyone who likes action, adventure, and surprises... -- Rita"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was one of my absolute favorites to read to children who are not quite ready to read chapter books on their own. I love for my little ones to keep with picture books as long as possible, but the characters practically jump off the page. Does anyone else have great chapter books that they like to read aloud?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am stationed in South Korea with my husband and we don't have the luxuries of a book store close to us so we have to resort to online purchases.

I would think if you have not read it (oh! Banish the thought!) or have not seen the movie (horrors at the level of a bad Ear Wax flavored Bertie Bott's Jelly Bean!) then you have at least heard about Harry Potter.Yes, my name is Sheila. I am 42 years old and I am a Harry Potter fan.This book... is book one. The begining. And even reading it now, like I did all those years ago it truly was like hanging out with an old friend. I had forgotten how richly detailed, and dare I say brilliant J K Rowling was from the very first! It was interesting to read those first pages and know now where these seeds that were innocently planted in the first book... would come to fruit books later - into a story that became way more amazing then even she could have realized.I chuckled knowingly through moments like the first mail trying to get through to Harry while he was living ay the Dursley's. Remember the address?\\"To Harry Potter, In the cupboard under the stairs\\" and soon after.... \\"To Harry Potter, in the smallest bedroom\\"The Hogwart's characters all come to life and spring off the pages.... you can feel Dumbledore's power through the pages... and sense that Snape is someone not to be forgotten.... even now.... so early on...I marvel at how lucky we as readers are - those of us who were there as the books came out, as we waited in lines atHogwarts Schoolmidnight to get our copies, or anxiously at doors to have them delivered.... some of us (no names mentioned) planning our day around the books release.... think about it. How lucky we were to be there to experience first hand as the story came to life. The next generations will read as the classics they will become... and as that generation reads these books - those of us - in the know - will have a distant twinkle in our eye.... a memory, of our first steps into the world created by J K Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!I have read it twice and every time I read it I find something I didn't notice before.

We have been reading Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets. Every chapter kept us hooked, we always want to know what was going to happen next. We still didn't finish the book, but every time the teacher reads one more line at least one person raises their hand to guess who the Heir of Slytherin is or who opened the Chamber Of Secrets. We like Harry Potter because he will take the chance of being expelled to find out who opened the Chamber Of Secrets. J. K. Rowling is an excellent author. We look forward to reading the rest of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are many reasons why every child ages 9 and up should have a chance to read this story. Harry Potter reminds the reader of James, from James and the Giant Peach, because of his living conditions and lifestyle. I found that the adventure and suspense... and just the thought of waht Harry was going to do next, just captivated and held me throughout the story. In the short time after I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was craving to read more and more of Harry's adventures. Harry Potter is certainly the most cool aaannnddd the most captivating character I have ever read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are many books of this type that are still among my favorites--The Hobbit, The Dark is Rising, A Wrinkle in Time, books by Rosemary Sutcliffe, etc. So I looked forward to adding a new favorite after reading some of the published reviews. I was disappointed. The book started well but became formulaic fairly early. There was little fresh or engaging about the characters; the whole thing felt &quot;forced cute.&quot; Nowhere did I feel any chord of real emotional response--fear, awe, wonder--which characterises the other books I mentioned. I skimmed the last 75 pages or so just to reach closure on &quot;what happened.&quot; If I had a child of the right age I would read this book to him/her, as it's better than average, but my guess is that very few young readers will find it is a book they come back to in later years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My younger brother's (9) class read this, and he was raving about it.

You just can't put it down, it took me only two days to finish it, and just as I closed it, grabbed the second one to keep on with Harry's adventures.You'll just love the way Harry, Hermione, and Ron develop their friendship, how they solve their problems, their worries within the school, their teachers and homework, how they help Neville to become a more confident wizard, and their everlasting enemity with Draco Malfoy, that without including the marevelous situations that happen around Proffesors Snape, Dumbledore, and Gungodall, the story is just richly developed.If you have kids, this is a most read for them, if you're a teenager, this is a most read for you, if you're an adult, this is a most read for you, ok this is a most read for everyone. Please don't miss it.---------------------------------------------------------- I'm only going to include a note for the Amazon Customer Service department: even though I got a truly excellent service from them; guys you were wrong, you do have a Hardcover edition of this book, and that was exactly what I got, please verify the information you have availabe."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Like most teenagers, when you recieve two childerns books for Christmas you snub them without a single care and that was one of the worst mistakes that I have ever done! You see I was given the first two books that lead to the mysterious and entertaining path of Harry Potter, a young wizard that accomplishes many difficult tasks at a wizarding school in Europe, and politely said thank you as I hurridly hid them underneath the wrapping paper praying that no one would notice that they were there. Of coarse my father noticed that my brand new award winning books had vanished and soon discovered them hiding beneath torn up paper. He then gave me a short lecture of how I needed to read them as I slightly nodded that I would &quot;read&quot; these two CHILDREN books!!!! Then one night I told myself that I might as well try the first book and see how it is. As I expected, it was dull and boring, but....I had only read the the first couple of sentences in these mystical books. Then a week later I told myself again to give them another chance and read more then a dozen words and from that moment on I was hooked to these delightfully written stories that contains beautifully written imagery so that you can picture the settings in your imagination. The delectable story had now sprung to life as if I was there in Hogwarts with Harry, Ron and Hermionie tasting the mouth watering butterbeer and fighting the evil Lord Voldemort. I had soon discovered that this book was not just written for children, it has been written for people of all ages and people from all ages should read this masterfully written series because if you don't you do not know hat you are missing out on!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was thoroughly convinced that the Harry Potter books were for kids only. How wrong I was! It's simply gorgeous storytelling that keeps the reader entranced from beginning to end. It reminded me a bit of Clive Barker's &quot;The Thief of Always&quot; in its energy and intensity, and also of anything by Neil Gaiman. I am certainly hooked now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book, and all the other fantasy books in Rowling's series are the best children's books I have ever read. Although, adults have been able to enjoy them too. They are the most entertaining and imagination gathering books for children and adults. This book, in particular, is about a boy named Harry and his first adventures at Hogwarts School of Magic. At school, Harry learns all about how to use his wand, play a game where he flies on a broomstick, and make the first friends he's ever had.The author does a great job on making the book one you can never put down. Each chapter ends with some quetion that Harry is trying to answer or task that he is trying to accomplish. Harry, coming from a house where he is ignored because his magical powers are detested, is a character that children want to see win. Children can also relate with his two best friends, Ron and Heriomone. Ron coming from a poor family and Heriomone being a bookworm, whom Harry and Ron don't even like at first. This book is believable one because the characters' relationships are like those of kids in school. However,the setting of Hogwarts and the magical happenings there, the ghosts that live at the school, the magical creatures and plants they have to learn to take care of, and the trials that Harry is put through, are what makes the book so fun for children to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"... i started reading it and by the first paragraph, BOOM!, i was all hooked up, Miss Rowling's way of narrating a story, it's really very good, great characters, great and strong story deveolpment, well everything it's great, except that the books are a bit childish, but WHO CARES?!, they are for children, or for EVERYONE!..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you like mystery and fiction you will like this book.

This is the book that started the craze.If you haven't started reading yet, buy this one. [The paperback is ridiculously cheap, but so is the hardcover and *TRUST ME* you'll want the hardcover when your done.] If you started on any other book, go back and read the first. By the way, the only complaint I had is the one I off-handedly mentioned earlier... it was WAY too short.

This book is the yaba son!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'll admit that when I first heard of Harry Potter's success a few years ago, I was slightly interested but didn't want to lower myself to read a children's book. I was, after all, in 8th grade. I love fantasy and all kinds of stories about magic and destinies, but I didn't think Harry Potter would be good because it was meant for kids and therefor wouldn't have anything exciting in it. Boy was I wrong.My friend Katie finally convinced me to read the Sorcerer's Stone because she is so in love with the series and that's all she talks about during our English class. So I went out and bought the book, found a comfy chair, and then didn't get up for about five hours because I couldn't put the book down. It was funny, and exciting, and it had danger, and it was just good. The book just makes you want to be a kid again and it makes you want to belive in magic just so you could go to Hogwarts and play Quidditch.Even if this book was meant for kids, it is still one of the best stories I have read in an extremely long time. I reccomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is a wonderful book. Its a book about a boy who receives the privledge of going the best wizard and witches school in the country, Hogworts. In this book you meet interesting caractors. They're extremely unrealistic, but that's part of the storyline. You end up meeting giants, three headed dogs, two faced men and much more. My favorite part of the book is when Harry Potter goes shopping with Hagrid, the gatekeeper of Hogworts. You see all these little wizards and witches with their noses pressed against the store window, looking at flying broomsticks. I recommend it to everyone, not just children. The author uses great suspence and imagery in the book. She also really appeals to the readers' sences. If you like the types of books that take you off into mysterious lands then this book is perfect for you. This fiction tale really lets your imagination soar. If you really injoyed this book then you are in luck, because there is a whole series of these books. So go out and get this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone is definetily a top class book . It has everything a book needs and more , it has a very involving storyline ,the characters are brilliantly described,it has a very large amount of tension and keeps you thrilled right to the end . One of the great things about it is that you cannot put it down , it is as if your hands are glued on to it which caused me many sleepless nights reading chapter after chapter .What you need is a parent or a school teacher who has a little more self control as to when they stop reading ( I bet that they will still want to read on though) This was most definetily No.1 on my best book list , No.2 is Harry potter and the chamber of secrets , the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was a wonderful book.

Rowling is a spell-binding story of magical wonders that a new world has to offer. As you read this novel the events that happen always lead to questions that amke you want to know what will happen next. From the begining, the novel is a mistery in wich you never know who is the bad guy. The novel is not only for children for I feel that adults can also relate to the expiriences that Harry has to go through. Being able to read the book so fast made me realize how good it realy is. In my opinion Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone is a must read book because it has a lot of adventures that many non-fiction readers would enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K, Rowing, is one of the best novels I have read in a really long time. This great book is mostly about wizards, how Harry Potter an eleven year old wizard had a lot of intresting adventures with his friends, making the reader not want to stop reading the book. In overall this is an excellent book to read and have in your personal library. I would like to recommend this magical book to everyone from a kid to an adult."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Is an awesome book! It is worth your time to read and is very exciting. It is one of those books that you can't put down. When JK Rowling wrote this book she knew exactly what she was doing! This book is about a young boy who lives with his &quot;Muggle&quot; Aunt and Uncle and his piggy cousin Dudley. He finds out that he is a wizard and goes to a Wizard school Called Hogwarts. He learns magic and potions. and has two best friends. And this book has a very exciting ending and once you are finished with it you will want to read more. This book is funny and exciting. It is very creative and well thought out. This book is one of the best books to come out in years!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter series. Harry lives with his horrible aunt and uncle the Dursleys until he discovers that he is a wizard. Then he goes to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione must get past all the enchantment to reach the Sorcerer's Stone in time to stop the evil wizard Voldemort from taking the stone which would give him eternal life. In order to try to get the stone, Voldemort took over the body of one of the teachers, because he hadn't got one of his own. I won't tell whether the children stop him, because you should find out for yourself! I especially liked the episode of the flying keys because I thought catching flying keys would be fun. This book is so wonderful that I have read it 4 times."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling does write well. The Socerer's Stone was a good book. But it certainly wasn't the best. This book is over-rated by most for some strange reason. Don't expect it to be the best you've ever read. It won't be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a very good book.The book is about a boy whose parents are dead and he is sent to live with his aunt. Harry has a bad life,living with his aunt,uncle and cousin. On Harry's 11th birthday he gets a letter from someone. Harry never gets to read the letter, but finally a huge man comes to tell Harry that he is being invited to wizarding school. Harry makes two friends at wizard school. Their names are Ron and Hermoine. As the story goes on, Harry learns more about magic and is selected to play on the house's Quidditch team(the students are divided up into houses. They sleep and eat in that house.) Quidditch is a sport that involves 3 flying balls and people flying on broomsticks. Towards the end of the story Harry has to battle a mean and powerful wirzard. You will have to read the book to find out if he wins. This book is a very good book for people to read because it is very interesting. One of the reasons why I didn't like this book is because some of the parts were boring."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd been avoiding the Harry Potter series, both because of the unending hype and tripe about the books, but also because, for heaven's sake, it's for children. Why would this appeal to me?I was even skeptical when my sister pressed her copies of the first and second books on me to borrow. My thought at the time was, &quot;Well, as long as they're here in my hands, I might as well see if they're any good.&quot;Any good? Hello? They're FANTASTIC. I was hooked immediately. The spells and charms are things that every kid (and most adults) wouid love to be able to do (A spell that binds someone's feet together, so they have to hop around? An Anti-Cheating Charm on a pen, so the writer has to be honest? How cool).I devoured the first book in less than a day. It was funny, intense and realistic (to a degree - they do talk about a lot of magic). Now I have to wait for my sister to get done with her volume 3, or I have to go buy it myself.I can see why there was so much hype. I know there has also been some negative publicity about these books (from the extreme right-wing types) but really, any books that can get kids this excited about reading are A-OK in my opinion.Go Gryffindor!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a combination of &quot;Malory Towers&quot; by Enid Blyton, &quot;Famous Five&quot; and &quot;Secret Seven&quot; which makes it all enchanting to read.I think this book gives us an opportunity to explore our fantasies and to dream of things we used to dream when we were young. It's relaxing, fun, exciting and at times scary. I won't bother explaining the sequence of events in the book as there are many reviews here that paints a good picture.I would definitely recommend this book anytime, anywhere for anyone. This is more than just a &quot;Childrens&quot; book as I think it's appealing to everyone... and once you start reading it, you will find that it's hard to put it down."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling provides the rich words that are brought phenomenally to life by the performance of Jim Dale in the audiocassette version of the Harry Potter series. Jim's 1999 Grammy nomination was well deserved for his portrayal of all the characters in the Potter books. The story leaps to life, grabs your senses and takes you flying through all of Harry's adventures through the vocal talents of Mr. Dale. After a short while, you feel as though you are listening to an ensemble cast of performers presenting the story, rather than one very talented actor. Listening to these tapes is a great shared treat for those who drive their kids to school."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I got this book on friday,september 8.

Then I thought I didn't like it much. And I read the book again to remember the story and read the sequals. This time, I got to like it so much becuase I abandoned the previous time's critical attitude and enjoy the book. There are many things to learn about even for the adults. Sacrifice, friendship, courage and love....Many people even reading this series tells the others &quot;this is just a children's book with fun..That's all&quot;.

Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times.

At LAST I read it and thought it was the best book I have ever read. The movie matches the book by 80% which for a movie is pretty awesome! The book is about a dirty, unhappy, depressed kid called harry living in a storage place under a creepy, crawling, and ugly staircase.

The writting and the story is superb and it has that rare ability to make me feel like I am 10 years old again. There are not many books I re-read again &amp; again, this will be one of them. Needless to say, I am on my way to buy the sequels...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up this &quot;kid's book&quot; just to see what all the fuss was about. Since I haven't enjoyed fantasy-type books in the past, I wasn't expecting much, but at least I would be able to relate to all the media hype.To my surprise, I actually enjoyed reading this book and couldn't wait to finish it. Parts of the plot were predictible, but the ending was a surprise to me-- maybe because I hadn't put much thought into it.I found this book to be a fast, enjoyable read and a great way to wind down the day. I look forward to reading the rest of the series and to seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes, it sounds cliche, but did I enjoy the book much more than the film it recently inspired. The film had a great deal going for it -- it contained talented actors and artful and elaborate settings -- but, in the interest of time, the filmmakers cut out many of Rowling's beautifully crafted subplots and characters, and they didn't sufficiently develop what remained. I left the theatre feeling rushed, feeling as though these were not quite the same people and experiences I grew to care about while reading the novel. I think you'd be well-served to save the price of theatre admission and buy yourself (or someone else) the book, instead."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was going to call in sick the next day just because I felt I needed the day off, but then I received my Sorcer's Stone CDs in the mail. I decided going to work wouldn't be so bad if I could listen to someone read Harry Potter to me while I drove my 1 hour commute.WOW! I was so caught up in the story that I didn't realize I was traveling well below the speed limit. Warning, listening to these CDs could make you late for work or cause you to get off at the wrong exit.Jim Dale does a fabulous job of changing his voice to sound like the characters he's imitating. I was able to really get lost in the story. The hardest part was turning the car off because I wanted to hear what happened next.A brilliant work of art, Harry Potter.

I have all of the other books in hardcover, and was thrilled to fill out my collection without having to purchase a complete set. I'll be re-reading these Potter books many times over the years, as it's always fun to re-read a series of books you love. Maybe I'll even read them to my grandchildren some day!

I was wrong!Before Book 7 was published, a friend recommended listening to the recordings to catch up on the story arc. I purchased this audio book on CD, and had the very great and surprising pleasure of feeling like I was experiencing the story again for the very first time.Jim Dale does a fantastic job of making the story come alive. Well worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well if you're looking at this product you're probably like me, busy and not the biggest fan of sitting down to read. I've always been a big fan of stories but I could just never find the time to read because of work and when I did I am admittedly an abysmally slow reader. After years of hearing how amazing these books, the Harry Potter series, were and loving every movie immensely it finally dawned on me to see if there was an audio book and there obviously is.When I first started listening to the series I must admit I was a little turned off because Stephen Fray came across as a little dry and I was beginning to think the audio books weren't going to be much more tolerable than simply reading the books. As new characters are introduced though I was pleased to find that he managed to give most of them a unique personality and even more so that he maintains these personas not just through this single book but all the way to where I am now, The Half Blood Prince. Aside from just their vocal definition Fry also manages to display a diverse range of emotion for each individual character as if there is a separate actor for each character, it's really quite an amazing performance in my opinion. At certain times various audio filters are added for dramatic effect like echo and things of the sort and I guess that's really the only place this audio book comes up short for me is that there really isn't a whole lot to it other than Stephen Fry reading the books. This being my first audio book I can't really compare it to anything but I guess I was expecting at least some music between chapters or maybe some ambient sound effects but I still find the overall experience enjoyable without them.There are probably hundreds of reviews for the books themselves so I'll keep my opinions on the series short and sweet. I believe the thing that I like most about the Harry Potter series is the overall charm of everything and the connection Rawling maintains to both the real world and real life. She really seems to nail human archetypes and the teenage inner dialogue and I can't help but think there are many pieces of her own children in this book. It showcases such an amazing insight as to the way people think and feel that I really can't help but be awe inspired. Like I said though, I'm not a big reader/listener so I imagine there are better books out there but that really doesn't take away from this series' ability to crack a smile on my face at work. I guess my only gripe is that it sometimes appears as if she has some favorite words or a limited vocabulary or perhaps people in England just find these words more common but there is an obtuse overuse of the words incredulous, glower, and one other that I will add in a couple of hours when I remember it. This obviously isn't a big deal but it can make me cringe a little.Anyways, I work in science and listen to these all day when I don't have to read for work and I'm actually doing lab work and they have improved my enjoyment at work immensely so they come highly recommended by me. Each book is probably about 18-24 hours long off the top of my head so the whole series should take you a while to get through. I hope you enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I jumped onto the Harry Potter bandwagon just before the last book came out and I don't regret it one bit! Although this one is slightly more kiddish than the later books, it is a great start to the series and is superior in every way to the movie (in my opinion).If you haven't read this book yet, pick it up and read it! But, be warned, once you read this one, you will have to read the rest of them. So, plan your time accordingly!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My older sister was reading Harry Potter and I was making fun of her for doing so. She is 30 and has been reading them since they came out. I had seen the first 4 movies before decided to take the plunge into reading the actual books.Well, I have now been called obsessed. I have read them all now, including the 7th and I am so glad I did. For those skeptical of the novels or think that they really are just for kids, well, you are quite wrong. I thought that too until I got hooked after the first 2 pages. I am almost 24 years old and have already re-read books 4-6. I hope to read this to my children whenever I have them. The writing is very simple, but engaging. Anybody can read this, it is ridiculously easy to follow( at least the first 2 books), however the actual story is what draws you in. J.K. has a wonderful imagination, and I would love to know where she got half her ideas from.Once again this is not strickly a children's book. ANYBODY can and should read this. Perhaps you too will be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There are plenty of reviews about the Harry Potter books so mine will be just on the audiobook version.A significant portion of an audiobook experience depends on the quality of the narration and the skill of the narrator. Jim Dale is an amazingly talented narrator. He uses distinct voices for the characters, which not only makes it easier to follow but adds to the enjoyment of the book.I had read the print version twice before listening to it, but think it would have been fine to listen to this version the first time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"So I refused to read Harry Potter for years. I saw the first two movies, and lost my interest. I could never understand the hype surrounding this children's book. Then the book Seven came out, and all my seemingly mature, professional friends stormed the bookstores, locking themselves in their apartments for four days, emerging with a glow unparalleled to any I have seen.A sheep that I am, I decided to not stand out and bought the first Harry Potter book. A day later I emerged from my dwelling, smile on my face and a need to read more about Harry. Whoever said that Harry was for kids only? For shame!J.K. Rowling is one of those rare novelists who write flawlessly, capturing imagination, hopes and dreams, addressing children and adults alike. Great story line, clear messages and a whole new world to explore are just some of the attributes of the first Harry Potter. Harry, a wizard by birth and unaware of it, is 11 and living with his mother's sister and her family. An orphan, Harry is treated as such in a very Dickensonian way by his adopted family, who detests Harry for being different. That all changes when Harry starts attending Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, where a whole new world unfolds before him. The new school is not without dangers, and Harry learns the truth about his parents' deaths, as well as about the lightning shaped scar on his own forehead that made Harry a celebrity in the world of witchcraft.A fantastic novel that kept me yearning for more. And thankfully, there IS more. Highly recommeded."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had heard all of the hype about this book, and decided to ask for it ... From the very beginning, Harry Potter tugs on your heart strings and you feel nothing but sympathy for him. He's like a classic Charlie Brown character--picked on by everyone and treated injustly. Nevertheless, Harry overcomes this when his past is uprooted by a strange magical being, and the reader's feelings toward him quickly turn from pity to admiration. &quot;Harry Potter&quot; is a pefect mix of three worlds--Narnia, Legend of Zelda, and Lord of the Rings. I stayed up til 2 in the morning reading this book...I just couldn't put it down! I recommend it to anyone who is fascinated by the magical and whimsical ways of the world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's a great book full of suspense and magic.

I couldn't put it down. The story line is very devoloped and the author goes into great detail to explain things.

I thought it would be really hard to find someone who wouldn't lose some of the magic of reading Harry Potter and imagining each of the characters in my head--BOY, was I wrong!Every kid who enters my car wants to come and live at our house so they can keep listening! When my daughter's birthday celebration with a friend was supposed to move from MacDonald's to the nail salon for manicures and pedicures, they asked if they could just sit in the car with their hamburgers and listen to the tape! Then, they wanted to go home and read the books again--it's addictive, I find myself listening to the tapes even when the kids aren't in the car and trying to remember where they left off so I can rewind back to that spot for when I pick them up--otherwise, the kids rumble revolution! This could bring back radio if we're not careful...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What an outstanding book! It's the best I've read in years. I find it difficult to put down after I started reading it. The book is very interesting because of the many funny characters and how Harry Potter likes to carelessly &quot;lose points&quot; for his house in the dormitory. The book is so good that I even re-read it again, something that I've not done before."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Reminds me of Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis which I love. Pure magic. Everyone should read this series. Just finished off Chamber of Secrets and I'm on to the next one - The Prisoner of Azkaban - off to another adventure with Harry.

I will always remember these books and the amazing characters and lessons that are taught throughout this series. A touching read of true friendship."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book s great! Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone has everything you need in a great book: action, adventure, a bad guy, and a hero. I like the way J.K. Rowling adds detail to every page in this book, it makes it more interesting. My teacher started to read this book to the class and soon didn't have enough time. I began reading this book where she left off, on chapter twelve. On the tenth of March I started reading it and I was done with it on the twentieth. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter series are the best books ever. I have read all three and they are amazing. You have got to read these books. J.K. Rowlings is a great writer and I hope she writes more Harry Potter books in the future. So my point is YOU HAVE TO READ THESE BOOKS!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have read all three Harry Potter books and I do intend to keep reading the series but I'm not sure what all the hype is about. While these books are entertaining (and, as a teacher, of course I'm thrilled kids want to read these books or any others) J.K. Rowling is no C.S. Lewis, Susan Cooper, Lloyd Alexander, e. Nesbitt, Edgar Eager or Jane Langton -- all talented writers who have written fabulous books which take their readers to different worlds (all of them far more magical than Harry Potter's). The Harry Potter books are a good hook to get kids reading and interested but I would recommend any of the above-mentioned authors over Rowling. If you like the Harry Potter books, please don't just sit waiting for the Rowling publication. Instead, try these writers -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It seems even magic is not powerful enough to scour the stain of bigotry from the world.(And no, I'm not talking about Draco Malfoy referring to Hermione as a \\"mudblood.\\" He's a nasty character - of COURSE he'd be a racist jerk. From his twisted perspective, EVERYone would be beneath his stature.)I'm talking about the term \\"muggle.\\"\\"Muggles\\" (please pardon my use of the expression) are defined as \\"nonmagic folk.\\"Essentially, the word is used as an epithet to marginalize anyone who, through accident of birth, isn't able wield magic. To put it another way, \\"muggle\\" is a term of derision calling attention to one's disability. This is the same as referring to someone with Down's Syndrome as a \\"t*rd,\\" or someone born with limited mobility as a \\"cr*pple.\\"The term is bandied about quite casually - even as likable and noble a character as Hagrid uses it. Indeed, he uses it derisively, mocking Harry's Uncle Vernon when the man protests Harry's enrollment at Hogwarts.It was said as an insult, no different than if Uncle Vernon was of Asian descent, and Hagrid called him a \\"ch*nk.\\" In short, it's reprehensible.(This could also bring up the issue of Hogwarts as an exclusionary institution.)Of course, it's likely that wizards and witches were persecuted in times past - our history is replete with instances of supposed witches and gypsies being oppressed, or even slain (Salem, anyone?), so it's perhaps unsurprising that the persecuted become the persecutors...one of the more unpleasant aspects of Human Nature.Still, magic implies a deep connection with the underlying structure and systems of the world - the ability to alter energy and matter to suit one's purpose would necessitate the perception of how reality is put together - so the fact that the wizards and witches of \\"Harry Potter\\" cannot rise above such pettiness is disheartening. Nay - it may in fact be chilling PROOF that such segregation between people is the natural order of things!To be clear: I'm not accusing J.K. Rowling of being a racist. If anything, she's simply clever enough to sneak a little sad reality into her fanciful world, to give it a little sting of believability.Perhaps \\"magically challenged\\" would be more acceptable, hmmm?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Soon, everyone in the world will abandon god! All I can say is: &quot;it's about time!&quot; The truth, as our prophet Rowling will show you, lies on the path of witchcraft.Schools just like Hogwart's are popping up in castles on mountaintops everywhere. Churches are empty! All the proof you need is all the kids turning up in hospitals to have their pig's tails (put on them by a wizard like us) surgically removed.We only now need to purge the Potterverse of these silly, pesky references to &quot;Christmas.&quot; That holiday of the foolishly religious. Celebrate the solstice!oh wait - that's right - we have a &quot;born again&quot; for a President, and 95% of the country still believes in god. I guess the christian-right wacko's are just freaking out over nothing again.If only the magic were real... Now that would be cool. I'd be the first to get a magic wand and give people like the Dursley's curses.Seriously - these books are full of funny, healthy fantasy, especially for those who yearn for a sense of belonging away from the normal (muggle) toil of daily life, those who have ever felt bullied, left out, etc. In other words - all of us. There's a reason these stories have touched such a collective nerve.Over and over, I've loaned my copy of &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; to adult friends who for one reason or another, never read the books, and without fail they've contacted me again within a couple of days asking for the second book! If you can read the first four chapters of this book and not want to read all four books, you're a true muggle to the core."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was about ten years old, I picked up a copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone reluctantly: everyone had told me to read it. I hated reading. Never could stand it. No matter what anyone said there was no such thing as a good book. It was always going to be that way too. I opened up the book and read the first page with very little motivation. In order to keep myself reading, I forced myself to read it aloud. As little as I wished to keep reading it, I couldn't put it down, and by the last line of the first paragraph, I needed to continue. The first paragraph itself was so amazing that I reread it two, three, four times. I flipped the page, finally onto the next chapter, and got more and more drawn in. Before long, I was on a magic journey, I was at a London zoo where a boaconstrictor had gotten free from its aquarium, I was purchasing books like Beginner's Transfiguration and One Thousand and One Magical Herbs and Fungi at Flourish and Blotts, I was soaring after the Golden Snitch on a Cleansweep 4, I was staring into the Mirror of Erised, and I was sneaking past a gigantic three headed dog named Fluffy to get through a trap door beneath its feet. Less than a year had gone by and before I knew it, I had read this book 40 times. For my eleventh birthday, I was given the second book and became even more obssessed. My friends began to call me Harriet Potter, and I had been given awards for being able to recite the first 200 pages of the first book (I was able to recite the entire book, but I tripped up on a sentence on page 203 and lost the ability to continue).While not all of you might be as obsessively enthusiastic about this book as I have been, I guarentee that each and every one of you would adore it and all of the books that followed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"the book was in good shape for a used book.

He seems to be an ordinary boy who has been through more than he should. But as you go along you relize hes not an ordinary boy, hes special, but hes still the same Harry that he was in the begginning. Thats what i love about this book. Its fasinating but realistic at the same time. This is a book you can relate to in so many ways, and escape reality into a magical world full of adventure for the time being."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It was a little while ago when I read this book. Although there is a time gap, I remember quite well that I loved the book. I am surprised I liked it so much considering that it is a fantasy story. It was near impossible for me to put down the book. I always wanted to know what sort of trouble the three of them would get into and how they would get themselves out of it. Many people may think that the Harry Potter series is for children, but I know a lot of adults and teenagers who enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Awesome book that I have read on more than one occasion. Would definitely recommend this to all young adults and kids alike!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Excellent book. I Loved it. I Couldn't put it down.

It was difficult to put down once I started listening."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My son LOVES Harry Potter books & movies. The books have so much more detail than the movies, that for such a great price I couldn't pass this deal up. My son is now wanting ALL of the Harry Potter books.This is a great book to get those kids who aren't that interested in reading, REALLY interested. The son who I purchased this book for almost NEVER likes to read, but this is one book he LOVES to read.As an aside, reading Harrp Potter, or Fantasy books will not give your son or daughter \\"demon issues\\". If books with Wizards and magicians did that I and all of my friends who read \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" would have \\"demon issues\\" as well. LOL!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Foolishly, I wrote the review for the second book, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\", before this one! (Please see if interested) But, my praise for \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" can be no less glowing. The children and I agree.....this book is well-worth reading! JK Rowling is now one of our favorite authors, along with CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien. Her books, like theirs, are, at their foundation, full of the \\"greatest story ever told\\". As a Chritian, I sometimes feel as though we, like the wizarding world, have our own culture, and language, and ways of dealing with our circumstances. We, like the characters in the book, face many dangers, toils and snares. We are often misunderstood, or kept in obscurity. My children and I received a great deal of instruction in our faith by watching Harry handle the adversity in his life......and Dumbledore is a paragon of wisdom! Hagrid is simple and loving, and Hermione and Ron are loyal and true. Even the misteps the characters take are instructive. Not to mention the story-line is powerful. I love a mystery and this book, as well as the others, kept me guessing. They never wrap up the way you think they will.....And each one gives food for thought about what will happen in the next book. All in all, we loved this book and highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow! I LOVE the Harry Potter books, and I love the audiobooks even more. Jim Dale does a FANTASTIC job of narrating. He does great voices and adds lots of excitement to the story. And amazingly the voices he uses are very similar to the voices used in the movies. I was afraid that after reading the books and seeing the movies that listning to Harry Potter on tape would just be too much and I would start to get sick of it, but I was so wrong. I plan to listen to these books on tape over and over again. I reccomend this for children and adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This could have been cut in half if Rowling removed the unnesesary parts.

He makes it exciting and emotional."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I really liked Harry potter!

But seriously, these books are ntohing to go crazy over. They're your basic, Not origanal fantasy.The people, which I suppose JK Rowling tried to make realistic, are completely unbelievable. The Dursleys, Dumbledore, Snape, Harry Potter himself, the list goes on and on. The first book, like the fifth, is a big disappointment, and I don't see what the big deal is about these books in the first place. If you want good books, go to the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. Now those are books worth getting excited over."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When i read this book i didnt really like it but i liked the movie.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a boy who trys to find the stone and vodemort tries to take it. Harry potter has two friends, Ron and Herminy and they try to help him find the stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book really struck a chord with me. I expected to like it, but as I'm 17 and this has been termed a &quot;children's book,&quot; I didn't expect to become so engrossed in it that I couldn't stop thinking about Harry and Ron and Hermione what would happen next.There's more to it than that, though. I recognized in Harry a part of myself--and maybe in Harry there is a part of everyone, the part of you that feels you don't really fit in, and then you find a place that you do fit in.J.K. Rowling's writing follows in the footsteps of Roald Dahl, from the crazy names (Albus Dumbledore is my personal favorite) to the very real people that they identify, and the concrete and coherent world that they inhabit.The kids will love this one. The adults may like it even more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book, as well as the other two in the series, make great reading for a large age range.

Any age can read it! I read it and recommended it to my Grandmother, who is hardly stopping her reading! I started it one day, and left off somewhat near the beginning.

I claim &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; as my new favorite book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is a book to remember.

I can't wait to read the sequels"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Ms. Rowling has invented a world full of the most amazing characters you'll find in contemporary children's literature! The story itself is addictive, but when you add the author's amazing realism, this series is positively priceless. By the time you finish 'The Journey to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters', you feel ready to argue that you CAN walk into walls and end up in whole other places. I was reccomended this book by my junior high school English teacher, being a high school student myself. I read them aloud to my younger sister and have raved about them to my closer friends. Everyone who has come across this story has loved it. It's wonderful to find a book that can turn so many children (and adults--you can always sneak them off the shelf once your kids are asleep)on to reading. I highly reccomend Ms. Rowling's imaginative tale of believable characters and vivid descriptions."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"J.K. Rowling's 1st book is without a surprise a success. Harry Potter, an orphan is staying with his mean aunt and uncle who treat him very badly.

Harry Potter is a very famous wizard because his parents were murdered and he survived. He was forced to live with his mean aunt and uncle and his cousin Dudley. My favorite part in the book is you can sing the Hogwarts School Song in any tune. I do the tune to the Scooby Doo theme song. My mom does Gilligan's Island. (page 128)I read all three books. I'm reading them again. These are very great books I hope you read them! P.S.

This story is not only for young people, but anyone who is young at heart and has an imagination to match will enjoy this magical tale. The story begins with Harry, whose parents were killed, living at his aunt and uncle's house. Harry is treated very unfairly by his relations, especially his cousin who constantly picks on Harry. The reason for the bad feelings between Harry and his relatives has to do with Harry's parents mysterious past. Harry's destiny is to become a great wizard, so he is taken away from his cruel relatives and brought to Hogwarts School of Wizardry. The world that Harry lives in is one where some people know from birth that they are to become wizards, and are raised by sorcerer parents to attend Hogwarts. Others like Harry, are raised in human families called, \\"Muggles\\" and they don't find out about their powers until they receive their acceptance letters to Hogwarts. Before the story is done Harry will encounter a dragon, make friends with a constantly depressed centaur and do battle with a three-headed dog. He also learns how to fly on a broom and to use a cloak to make himself invisible. Any person who feels they would like to live a life of enchantment and fantasy will be riveted by this tale of a young boy and his trials and tribulations of finding himself in a strange majestic world. I think Harry Potter is a fun, well-written story to be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is a fantastic book!

I rate this book excellent, because it opens the mind to a vast imagination. The most amazing concept, in my opinion, is that the setting of this novel can take place and be just like the way a reader wishes it to be. I truly admire J.K. Rowling's imagination.This book is about a young orphan boy (harry) who lives with his horrid relatives, soon finds out that he is a very famous wizard.

Never have I had them so excited for me to read... a terrible sin if I do not read! One reluctant reader 6th grade boy, came up to me and said, &quot;I had to stay up reading under my covers with a flashlight (remember doing that?) last night to Finish Harry Potter!!! He was so excited! He bought the second book at our book sale, with his own money, hardback and all, and could not wait to start it! I would say 75% of my class went out and bought it after I started reading, and they still want to hear me read it again! Never in all my 23 years of teaching have I seen this love for a book and character. There is a little of each of us in this book I think! SO how can people out there be fighting to take it off the shelves of schools???"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It is a great book and it is great for grown ups and also kids. it gives a lot of interesting things about a magic world. Everything seems like the real world here. It's awesome!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When Harry Potter first gets to Hogwarts he doesn't have a clue of the mission that rests before him. Love, friendship, and bravery are the three key words to this book.Ron and Harry are first enimies with Hermoine but then they learn the true meaning of friendship.They work together to solve problems while Snape just takes more ponits from Gryiffindor.Many surpries await them.They think Snape is behind it all.Is it Snape or someone else? Snape does have a favorite student,Malfoy. Poor Harry can't keep up with all the ponits lost from Snape. Harry is doing okay but he's just watching Hermoine get all the A's but Harry has a natural talent of flying. Malfoy is just tryingto get Gryiffindor in detention. Knowing that they could get into HUGE troble Harry takes a risk.Can Harry save the sorcer's stone?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Even I, as a 52-year-old 5th-grade school teacher, am absolutely absorbed in Harry's world. I know, too, how much my students love this fantasy world J.K.Rowling has created for us (yes, my students are actually smart enough to realize this is fantasy, though some adults are obviously confused about this fact). We can hardly wait for our next adventure with Harry. I promote Harry to my students, colleagues, friends and family because I do not want anyone to miss knowing him; I know he will be my friend forever. Thank you, J.K., for permitting us to know Harry: we are better people for the experience."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I finally grabbed a copy of this book. I was pleasantly surprised. Rowling seems to have the knack for making believable characters young readers will care about. Although Harry probably should be a bit more dysfunctional considering his upbringing, (Don't they have child welfare in his world?) he is a welcome hero, one filled with flaws but also possessing the courage that makes a hero. Any book that promotes reading in today's world has value but it's nice to see Rowling is a true story teller. Not with the epic reach of Lewis' Narnia tales or Tolkien's Ring saga but maybe a better style for today's children, focussing on the power of friendship and the importance of the little things. She has made me curious to see how this all turns out in the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is great! It has plenty of action, a detailed world that covers every category a proper fantasy world should have, going from a magic banking system to a magic school to magic candy... even to magical items for practical jokes! The basic plot is as follows: Harry Potter is orphaned around his first birthday. Little does he dream that he was the major cause of downfall for the most evil wizard who lived! After spending years with the fiendish Dursleys (his aunt, uncle, and cousin), Harry receives a letter telling him that he is a wizard and has been accepted for schooling at Hogwarts, the best magical school in Britain. Soon, he is off to buy the most interesting school supplies he's ever seen (potion ingredients and dragon hide gloves, to name a few), followed by a long, eventful train ride to Hogwarts, a huge, castle-like school with dormitories for the students. He is thankfully sorted into Gryffindor, the best of the four school houses (the others are Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin). An amazing year begins, in which Harry becomes a member of the Gryffindor Quidditch team (a sport of broomstick fliers), makes enemies in Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape, and makes friends in Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. The year finishes with a climax so amazing and interesting, you'll have to read it to fully satisfy your imagination. I DEFINITELY recommend this book to anyone, and I hope that all its readers, now and in future, will enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I was a little girl, I embraced the books of R. Dahl, M. L'engle, C.S. Lewis, E. Eager. My greatest fear was to be &quot;stuck&quot; somewhere without a book to read. And then, begrudgingly, I grew up. I've constantly thought about the pleasure I derived from the stories I read...I missed books like that...stories that were so breathtaking, so &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; that you couldn't wait for the next installment. Until I found Harry...Hermione...Ron...Dumbledore...and more. My husband and I plowed through each book together, laughing, crying, wringing our hands together. And now we wait...eagerly...for number five."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I add to the more than 3000 reviews that have already been written. I'm a male in my mid 30's and I bought this book to read to my sons. Instead we ended up getting the book on tape and listened to it while we where travelling, however I was so into the story I picked the book up and read it in an afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and highly recommend it for adults as well as teens."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While some reviewers seem disheartened by aspects of Harry Potter, I would highly recommend this book and the entire series for all kids over age 10. Harry Potter is a typical kid - not very exciting, not a very good nor a very bad boy - so I think many kids would relate. Even once Harry learns that he is a celebrity in some parts of the world, he doesn't think it's a big deal. The Sorcerer's Stone introduces the reader to Harry's world and we all get introduced to the world of magic along with Harry.I found the friendships Harry develops to be the best part of the book. His friends like him for who he is, not what he is. His friends also stick by him - a lesson ALL people should learn.While the evil beings may not seem too bad to some, I do believe these characters will resonate strongly with kids. The evil is sometimes something as simple as one person not liking another - hate may be too strong of a word here. But there are some characters who do hate others - for no apparent reason. Much like real life.Harry learns to deal with all these characters - those who like him and those who don't. Although he still has a long way to go, Harry does learn valuable lessons in book 1.I would hope that anyone reading the book would be reminded of childhood and the way the world felt. That's the charm of this book - and the entire series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is an original. J.K. Rowling uses fitional magic and common school dillemas for a book that's great for almost everyone. The story is about an eleven year-old boy who lives with his &quot;muggle&quot; Aunt and Uncle and his piggy cousin Dudley. He doesn't know he is a wizard until mysterious letters come to his house. When he finally gets his letter to go to Hogwarts, the school for Witchcraft and Magic, he worries about the common question, &quot;Will anyone like me?&quot; He discovers that he is famous in the wizarding world, which makes things stranger still. I thought that it was a great book and could not put it down. I have read the book five times and I am working on the sixth time. I would recommend it highly for a birthday or christmas present. This book is great for anyone and everyone on your list!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am not going to review the story, but the book itself. By now everyone knows about the tale of the boy who lived and went on to wizard school. It is a fabulous series and everyone that I know loves it. This book, this leatherbound edition is truly beautiful in that it has gilt (or is it gilded) edges with an original drawing by JK Rowling of Harry in front of a fireplace. If you are a book collector, you will want this book.Thanks for reading!**Pandora"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hi, Harry Potter fans. I am a 16-year-old Hungarian boy.

Thanks J.K. for writting a book that I loved to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"A very well written book by J K Rowling. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the tale of a young boy that grews up as a Human with his terrible aunt, uncle, and cousin. Soon, he is flying off to a school for witches and warlocks to start his schooling as a magical wizard. He faces great dangers to protect a stone that gives the owner everlasting life plus the power to turn metal into gold. He must fight the most wickedest of them all- the wizard who killed his parents."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is famous before he can walk or talk so the people of 'his world' think he should live with a muggle (non - magical) family intill he is of a certian age. He has never played Quidditch flying high above the trees, he has never done spells or potions, he has never even seen pictures that move, common things for a boy of his age to have experienced in 'his world'. Instead he lives with his Aunt Petuinia, Uncle Vernon, and big stupid cousin Dudley who make him wear old misfitting clothes, never have birthdays, live in a cupboard, and allow him to beat up and pushed around. All this and more changes when a letter arrives for him and a giant man kocks on the door. You will love Harry and all his magical friends."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a 47 year old professional and a very avid reader.

While not the best book I've ever read, it was superb. My one complaint is that it was somewhat juvenille. As for people who object to the content material, they are off there rocker.

This is an off to school story that sheds a whole new light on required curriculum. I think that the dust bunnies under the sofa were even listening. I am pretty sure that the vacuum cleaner and the dishes won't pack their bags and try to escape anytime soon.

I have read all 4 Harry Potter books twice over and just can't get enough of Harry. This is where it all begins and is a fantastic read.

This is a truly beautiful edition - leather bound with gold lettering. Anyone who really respects books, covets them and treats them with great care will truly appeciate this wonderful book. It is also a real find for someone from overseas like me - the deluxe British edition (cloth bound) was quite nice but nowhere near as luxurious as this leather bound one. It is fantastic to find a book company that will release books in magnificent editions like this one. Harry (and JK Rowling) certainly deserve this sort of treatment!If you love Harry Potter and have a true love and repect for books, then this an edition you will treasure for the rest of your life.

The book has a simple yet interesting writing style and it is a great read. The simple writing can be understood by children as young as 7 or 8, maybe even younger but it also features some words that can improve the vocabulary of yor children. I have read this book around 15 times and it is still intereting. I am a teen and if I found it interesting, then children and adults of all ages should too. I would like to stress again that this is a great book and it is a great read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow! I picked up a copy of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone after seeing my 11 year old nephew reading it. (I was one of those paranoid Muggles who thought this book would be too influential on a young, vulnerable 11 year old brain.) Instead, I was quite pleased at the wonderous world Ms. Rowling has created. Now I can say, I'm totally hooked. I'm buying the entire set just because I REALLY want to follow Harry on his new (not to mention dangerous) adventures. :-) I'm 30ish and have had the opportunity to read many fantasy books over the years but I can't recall ever enjoying one as much as I have this series. Thanks to Ms. Rowling for such an enjoyable read. Looking forward to seeing what happens to Harry next! :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The movie Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not your everyday fairy-tale. It is about a boy named, Harry Potter who survived the deadly spell of an evil wizard, Voldemort. Now he's eleven years old and has recieved a letter from Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry. If you were to compare this movie to the book which it originated from, you'd find out that the book has more informational background.The author of this book is, J.K. Rowling. She was a poor, single mother before the Scottish Arts Council enabled her to continue writing the book. She has also written three other books of the Harry Potter series. (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.)The interesting parts of this movie is when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were playing wizard's chess, fighting the troll in the girls' restroom, and when Harry was playing Quidditch were probably my favorite scenes in the movie because they were full of action and there were surprises around every corner.This movie best fits preteens at the age of twelve and younger to about age six or just anyone who likes fantasy stories because this movie is full of things that kids like. Such as the castle, dragon, ghosts, magic, and the sport Quidditch."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will forgo the usual plot outline in deference to the wealth of information from other reviewers. Yes the book is popular with younger readers - but this is not just a kid's book. As an adult reader, I was surprised and pleased to be as drawn into the J.K. Rowling's world. What an imagination! And what a marverlous cast of characters. Little wonder so many are so taken with the story and that they are so wildly popular. A wonderful mental vacation - I highly recommend it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I will admit I went into reading this book as thinking it was going to be a waste of my time. I was wrong. I was hooked after the first chapter. I highly reccomend this book to adults, teenagers and kids. It is very well written and the detail the author goes into is amazing.

But I can honestly say that I've never skipped any sleep for any other book before I started reading these books. I could not put them down, not just a first one - all four of them. I finished reading them (all four) in less then a week. Each one seems to be better then the one before.For anyone with a slight imagination these books are the most enjoyable reading. They have everything the reader can look for in a story. And most importantly, pages are not felled with unnecessary details like most adult books I've read. Non-stop adventure.Only disappointment I felt was when I finished the fourth book and realized that next one was not published yet.Two very enthusiastic thumbs up to Ms. Rowling for writing the most creative book I've ever read in my life.And as for those criticizing these books: GET A LIFE. There is enough garbage published as Christian fiction/literature to complain about.

This is exactly what happens when I read a Harry Potter book. The way everything is described, the emotions the words provoke, are strikingly realistic. So much so, that when I saw the movie, it was exactly like I had pictured it. The Sorcerer's Stone provides mystery and wonder that makes you flip through the pages as quickly as possible. I strongly recommend being alone while reading this as well. I actually laughed out loud at many points. I'd also like to comment on all the people who are trying to ban this book. These people are the type who like to twist and pervert everything they read. They obviously have nothing better to do with their time. Instead of trying to ban this book, why not go and read Alice in Wonderland. Have you ever picked that apart? Looked at the pictures? That is far more offensive than this. I apologize to C.S. Lewis, he was a good writer, but had a few moral problems. I also don't see what the problem is with the Pagan ties, the people who I know that are pagan in religion, are very moral good people. Paganism is not an \\"evil\\" or devil worshipping religion. So I think everyone should get of Rowling's back, and continue reading her excellent and highly entertaining works. While you're waiting for book five, you might want to read Tolkiens \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The lord of the Rings\\" series, they use a similar story telling style and are as entertaining."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Despite the hype when the Harry Potter series was first released, I refrained from reading them. I've never been one to get caught up in the hype. But when the movie was released, I went to see it, and I was quite impressed. I recently bought books 1-3, and absolutely loved Year 1. I'm almost finished with Year 2 and can't wait to start Year 3.I'm not sure I'm going to have the patience to wait for the release of the rest of the series. I'm sure I'll be buying Year 4 very soon.

He duels against Malfoy and at the end of the year he takes his tests and then he goes back to the Dursleys. Good luck next year."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is an excellent book. I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy stuff, but all of it is pretty serious. Not that it's bad thing. But anyway, back to the book. It's well thought out, with a great plot. It's got some humor in it, and sometimes that's better than the whole magic thing. Fred and George Weasley are my favorite characters, they don't get enough time in the book. There's a certain amount of scary in the book, with Lord Voldemort and whatnot. There are so many new ideas I've never read about before, and it's a book I've read and re-read. So, let's sum this up. It's a cute, funny, kinda scary (but not too scary, it's scary enough), well thought out fantasy book. And it's so obviously english. I think that's so cool."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I can't believe that I was a skeptic, at first. I thought the Harry Potter books were just a silly trend and the books were filled with mumble jumble. I was so wrong! As a 15 year old, I thought the book was going to be a little too childish. I'm so glad I read this book! It is one of the funniest, most satisfying books that I have read in a while. A true page turner...The story revolves around a boy named Harry Potter who has grown up in the cold home of his aunt and uncle, the Dursleys, along with their bratty son Dudley. He receives a mystery letter that leads him to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovers his true calling....as a wizard. At the school, Harry catches on pretty quickly and makes some close friends. His classes consist of Herbology, History of Magic, Charms, Transfiguration, and other magical classes. Harry and his friends are somewhat mischievious, but this turns out to be a good thing, in the end. The ultimate *Good vs. Evil* battle.Rowling has thrown in many pleasant plot &quot;warmers&quot; including the &quot;living&quot; chess pieces and Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans (which truly come in every flavor...beware)! These delights make the story even more enchanting. A must read for all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was very skeptical about all this Harry Potter stuff at the start. Actually I really thought it was the biggest load of crap i'd ever heard. But I went along with my parents to see the movie, just so i could tell my friends how bad it was. It turned out to be really good, one of the most entertaining things i've ever seen. So I borrowed the Sorcerer's Stone off my friends little brother (which made me feel sorta foolish). But in the end, I finished the book in 2 days, and it was so entertaining I didn't even want to stop to sleep. Now I'm going to buy the rest of the books.

The author makes him so real that you wish you were there so you could slug him one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I finally read this book, and what I found out was this book was one of the most overrated books I've ever read. The story was mediocre, I have no idea why most of the reviewers love this book. Furthermore, the main characters were dull. You find no one who is attractive, as you do when you're reading \\"Gone with the wind\\" by Margaret Michell. So I figured out this book must be for children. If I were 9, I might like this book. But I am 23, and I prefer books which are more profound. Try \\"The Satanic Mill\\" by Otfried Preussler. This masterpiece has got a ridiculous English title (the original title is 'Krabat'), but \\"The Satanic Mill\\" is the best fantasy I've ever read so far."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter is totally for kids. Yes, the plot is encouragingly positive, but overly simplified and cliched. It lacks an in-depth characters developement. One can't resist but to compare \\"Harry Potter\\" to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". \\"Rings\\" has an intricately interwoven plot; it's complex but not confusing. \\"Rings\\" has a complete history in its background and that's what's missing in \\"Harry Potter\\". \\"Harry Potter\\" is a great starter of fantasy books, but it's strictly for kids."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is boring. It has no point. It's only about magic and wands and secret passages. Also the characters are all stupid. I think some of the characters are put in just to make it longer. The book is also very long. Everything is described very well, but the description isn't needed. You might like Harry Potter if you believe in ghosts, goblins, magic, and bag guys that kill people with magic.

Many people like it but I did not to me I think that this book is a bit juvinial in the sense that it is made for little kids. If you can not tell by the huge lettering and gaps on the pages. At time the charecters even accentuate things like in the beging of how Mr.Ollivander spends a couple of paragraphs on how voldemorts wand gave him the that scar on his forhead and the brother wand is the one that Harry now uses as his own. Even if I read the first four of the series I will never have any appreciation for the book, the serise, or the auther. This book is based on this kid that is paranoid and dose not belive that dumbldore's enchantment along with the others are not strong enough to withstand voldemort. then in the end all he finds out is that it was profeser Quirrell that had been trying to help voldemort get the sorcerer's stone and not snape. then also it did not realy appeal to me even though I read fantasy and intrested in the medevil days."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There is nothing good about Harry Potter. The story is lacking in creativity in every way, there is no suspense, it is not controversial, and everything always works out.The characters are obviously derived from racism. I do not have a problem with this. After all we are all racists, and anyone that says racism is wrong, is the one that's wrong. That said, J. K. Rowling does not use this in any way. She could have used it to create some controversy, create conflict among the characters, explain why some people are friends and some aren't or easiest of all, humor. But she doesn't, why not? The only racism she uses is Hermione being a half breed. It would have been so much better if, instead of one parent being non-magical, that parent were French.To keep this review short, I head straight to the end with the \\"obstacles\\" which are not obstacles at all. The three headed dog (cause three heads are just so cool and scary) gets put to sleep by a flute. Oh my God she did not use a flute to do that, how many times have I seen this? Why is it always a flute when it comes to putting things to sleep, or waking things that always sleep. Where did she get this from... poke'mon? Then there's the part with the door that needs a key. Wow, a locked door, I've never thought of that before. And the key is right there in the room, they just have to pick the right one, and nothing goes wrong if they pick the wrong one. Why didn't she just put the key in the door so as not to waste paper, and turn the key too for that matter. Next comes the Chess Board. It would have been so much better for them to lose the game and then walk across the board any way just to show all the readers that love the book just how foolish they are. And all the rest of the obstacles are just as bad, but I must stop writing because thinking about this book gives me a migraine."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I came to the Harry Potter series somewhat late, upon the publication of the fourth novel, Goblet of Fire, and thus read volumes one through four in fairly quick succession.Rowling has a gift for story-telling if not for story (more on this later). She delivers an enormous amount of interesting, compelling characters, creates sympathy for the heroes and antipathy for the villains with deft precision, and provides everyone, not just children, with a sense of wonder in a time when that sense is very welcome indeed. Who wouldn't wish to have a giant knock down their door one stormy night to reveal to them, in full terror of their oppressive kin, their true nature as a wizard?However, and while this does improve over the course of the series, many of the elements are derivative (a three-headed dog guards a gateway in but one example), and the ending does not require very much of the titular Harry Potter beyond his attendance (a problem that very much plagues the series as a whole). Likewise, consequence is given short-shift, as the heroes break any number of school rules and instead of allowing this be a poignant lesson, that they can do the right thing even if it costs them in other ways, they are instead lavishly awarded in spite of their missteps, stripping away a large amount of potential drama.Still, a very easy, enjoyable read overall, and characters that demand the reader to come back for more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"With all the hype about Harry Potter, I thought I'd give it a whirl.

I can hardly stand to get out of my car when I arrive at work or home. Jim Dale's audio performance is spectacular; how he has managed through three wonderful books to maintain the distinct voices and personalities of a host of characters of all ages, genders, and mythic species is amazing. His audio performances are so engaging I look forward to long flights and drives for an uninterrupted listen; the stories themselves so wonderfully engaging I bought, read, and thoroughly enjoyed the books after having listened to the books on tape. I've cautiously loaned my H Potter audios to several adult friends from whom I could be assured of their return. All well-educated professionals, all enthralled and anxious to borrow the next tape or edition, and who have subsequently purchased one or all. These are just too good to relegate to children only. Try one of these spectactular Harry Potter audiobooks for your next long flight or drive. You won't want to stop at your destination. Perhaps a great pacifier for the kids on a long drive as well.

The Dark is Rising series, the Narnia Chronicles, the Pullman books, the Tales of Earthsea, all the Redwall books, and countless other individual books, and I must say that this book (and series) is one of my favorites.What makes the Potter books so enjoyable is their humor. Other reviewers who have commented that Harry &quot;is not the caliber off&quot; (insert book/author/series here) have been caught up in the difference in tone. Ms. Rowling didn't create Potter in a serious context, but in a humorous one. In some minds this degrades the product, but I find no reason why it can't but enhance the atmosphere of the book itself.This book is a prime example of good writing. The characters are developed through plot events, and the story moves quickly. The best teacher to young writers is reading, and mimickry of good style is important to form a unique writing voice.

K. Rowling's ingeniously imaginative world quickly convinces otherwise. From the first chapter to the final page, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone spurs an almost childlike delight and fascination within the reader's mind. Harry Potter too, despite previous apprehensions, turns out to be a delightful character. Orphaned at an early age by the murdering, black magician known as Voldemort, Harry is reluctantly raised by his non-magical relatives who take obvious pleasure from tormenting him incessantly. Hiding his magical past, the Durseley's manage to criticize, nag, and be just generally mean to him. While, seemingly trapped in this hateful relationship forever, Harry surprisingly receives a letter from Hogwart's, a prestigious school for wizards. Reluctantly coerced into sending him off, the Durseley's finally agree to let Harry leave and suddenly his future brightens at the dawning of this new wizardly career. As the Hogwart's school year progresses, Harry quickly develops new friends, makes a few enemies, and discovers some hidden talents. At the same time, though thoroughly immersed in magic, Harry still manages to caricature the typical boy as he stumbles over tricky wizardly words and clumsily brews potions and poultices. Meanwhile, each time Harry finally succeeds, the prior hard work and dedication teach a poignant moral lesson. Those lessons, sprinkled throughout the novel, combine with Ms. Rowling's rich subplots and thoughtful character development to turn her text into reality (or at least the next best thing). Her writing seems to, &quot;Foll[ow] in the footsteps of the great,&quot; according to &quot;Matchgirl&quot; in her review from St. Augustine, Fl, and indeed the author's script, though imaginative, owes much of it's success to the classical formula created by the likes of Asimov, Tolkkien, and Lewis. A variation on the timeless tale of Good vs. Evil, Ms. Rowling's plot cast both the hero(Harry) and villain (Voldemort) in their typically &quot;crystal clear&quot; roles. However, unlike the amazingly successful Star Wars type universe, (where the villain's henchmen remain identifiable throughout the story) her book contains a shocking character role twist reminiscent of the suspense and surprise tactic of early mystery writers like Edgar Allen Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle. That combination of styles provides a great read; satisfying the readers sense of the genre even while surrounded them with a cast of twelve year olds. The usage of twelve year old characters and their England home setting within her novel adds another clever dimension to Ms. Rowling's writing: that of language. Regardless of age one can't help but chuckle at the invention of a term like quidditch (a sport resembling a mixture of basketball, soccer, and dodge-ball combined,) or Muggles (non-magical people). Furthermore, the clever insertion of colloquialisms like knickerbockers not only highlight the author's English background but often create levity or lighten the otherwise serious mood in some areas of the plot. Through careful manipulation of other author's successful models and the addition of her own unique touch (such as language, characterization, and vocabulary) Ms. Rowling creates a plot whose immense popularity alone testifies to its effectiveness. Eagerly awaiting the publication of her next book I join the millions of other readers who &quot;dare to dream dreams no mortal ever dared to dream.&quot; ...for perhaps I too, like Harry, might one day fly off into that night sky... but until then, I read.Steven Palmer, Age 15, created at request of English teacher (Mrs. Bray), 12-12-2000, Beaumont, Texas"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. RowlingAm I missing something? I don't get why this book is so popular, and why it appeals to anyone over the age of 14 (or to parents of someone in that age range). I get why kid's like it - the characters are at a sorcery school and have the same daily responsibilities of homework and such. The main character doesn't fit in with his family, is abused and unappreciated, and one day finds out that he's special and world renowned.Yes, it is fantasy: there are dragons, unicorns, and trolls in the story. Vampires and werewolves are even mentioned in passing. Yet, for a book about wizards and witches, there is surprisingly little magic. I expected guys shooting fireballs and lightning, or teleporting. Instead, they float feathers and cast a spell called \\"leg locker curse.\\" I've seen more impressive magic tricks at a David Copperfield show. I guess I was thinking something along the lines of the superpowers in X-Men or the video game Diablo.The first part establishes that Harry's foster family treats him horribly. Then he goes off to sorcery school with the good guys (Ron, Hermione) and the bad guys (Malfoy and Snape). They even separate the two sides into different \\"houses\\": Gryffindor and Sytherin, respectively. The characters are all flat - look at Dudley for a good example.The main characters sneak around playing detective, always arriving at just the right time to overhear an incriminating conversation. But, these children are maddeningly careless. That is, they're so careless to the point of making the story unbelievable. Ron inexplicably gives his sworn enemy Malfoy a book with a top-secret letter inside it, not realizing his folly until much later. The letter, mind you, was easy to remember; if he had an ounce of common sense, he would've destroyed it after reading it. Further, Harry has a magical invisibility cloak that he miraculously decides to leave at the top of a tower after he is sneaking around at night, and he gets caught because of it.The book is well written, and doesn't drag. However, it's just not all that entertaining. I really liked the mini-story about the Mirror of Erised (Desire), that would show you whatever you wanted, which reminds me of the Sirens from Homer's Odyssey. I will admit that the ending was good, especially with the enchanted booby-trapped rooms.

Judy Blume books are my favorite because the books take you through life as a teenager and it is easier to rlate to a self-concious teenager than a genius wizard who likes to ride a broom and defeat evil wizards for fun.

Neither do i have any desire to be killed by a Harry Potter fan for writing a bad review, BUT, i wouldn't mind some unhelpful votes, those are fun.Harry Potter was not an awful book. But i find absoultly no suspense or drama in the books whatsoever. Maybe because the main chacter cannot die because the author has to write 7 books about him? I wonder.And i just don't like Harry Potter's character. He's a bit uppity. And J.K. Rowling just trys to hard to make him likeable. He's nice, but only to other nice people. Obviously Slytherin is unincluded. how can an entire group of children be evil anyhow?But he goes and does dangerous, breaking school rules things, to make him more attractive to our little subconsious selves. And he isn't deathly afraid of Voldemort, he says his name after all, and fights the poor, half dead guy. Charming.But maybe there's a problem with me, because Snape, Malfoy, Voldemort and various others who Harry thinks are mean are the ones i'm rooting for.

Harry Potter is nowhere near good enough to be the platform to judge other books on.\\"We as a human race, are wierd.\\"-Qoute taken from my friend."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the type of book I find difficult to review. When I read a &quot;children's&quot; book, I'm not sure how I should approach it. Do I go in with the mind-set of a child, or do I look at it from an adult view to examine how effective it is for a child? I usually try to do a little of both, sometimes succeeding, sometimes not.In the case of Harry Potter, I wanted to see what effect this story would have on a child, probably someone in the 10 - 15 year-old range. First off, let me say that having children of my own, I've read my share of children's books - from the early stories of Clifford to the later adventures in baby-sitting. So I've been exposed to all levels of children's books. What I found with HP was disappointing for the most part. The story starts very slow, a younger child (say around 8 - 10) will probably have a difficult time getting started. I even found it not easy to get involved with the story. The only reason I stayed with it was because I was determined to see what all the hype was about. Any child less determined will probably put it down and (hopefully) choose another story. And part of the storytelling is definitely geared towards an older reader. Thus leaving the younger reader confused - another reason to abandon this book. It isn't until you're about one-third into the story that it becomes interesting. But what child is going to stick with it until then?So here we have a problem, the story is written in a manner to appeal to younger children. It doesn't get involved with character development aside from the basic stereotypical characters that you can find on TV shows. So its simplistic plot and syntax make it relatively easy for a younger reader. But the pace that the story starts in, with vague plot discussions, is enough to discourage many readers. The beginning of the book seems to have been written with an older reader in mind, and then given up for a much younger audience. If this book is trying to appeal to readers of both a younger an older age group, it fails on both ends. It is difficult to tell a story in only one manner that both a younger and an older person would find as enjoyable.So what about the story itself? I'll admit there were a few surprises in it for me, but for the most part it's very simple. Once Harry gets to wizard's school you could substitute his adventures for any child's starting a new school. What happens to Harry, magic aside, happens to anybody. His friends, teachers and enemies are all taken from anyone's childhood days. His story is not any different than yours or mine.So, could I recommend this book? Probably not. I would say that if you're interested in what all the Harry Potter hype is about then read it. One advantage to it being directed towards children is it's a fairly quick read for an adult. So you don't feel too bad taking a couple of days to read it. But if you're looking for a good story that's well written, regardless of who the target audience is, then I would say skip it. It didn't interest me enough to want to keep reading the series and it probably won't interest you either."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Why are you americans so reluctant to use PHILOSOPHER, its the WORD, its the right word, JK is a brit gal, and she used the word, so WHY CANT YOU what is your problem?

On his eleventh birthday a giant of a man tells him he is a wizard I like this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Would you ever want to fight a troll? Well that's what Harry Potter did. In Harry Potter, Harry is trying to get the sorcerers stone. I loved reading Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone by J.K. Rowling because it is interesting and funny. And I also think there are really good pictures and characters. J.K. Rowling's moral was don't give up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"After seeing the movie I could not wait to read the book. I've always found that books are by far more detailed and wonderful then the movies. In the case of The Sorcerer's Stone I'm not so sure that this was the case. Maybe because they did such an excellent job in relaying the story and keeping it real in the movie.I enjoyed the book a great deal, however, Rowling seemed to move through details awefully quickly. A few examples are the chess game and the Troll getting into Hogwarts. The movie helped to create suspense and I just did not get that from her book.The sorcerer's stone is a quick read and while it is meant for children, adults will enjoy it as well. It's Alice in Wonderland meets Annie meets...well I don't know what else to compare it to. Rowling has an excellent imagination and it's no wonder that her books have reached historical sales!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was immediately drawn in to the life of this little boy who like Cinderella just wanted to be part of a loving family, but wasn't. Harry is clearly the underdog but through a series of events gains loyal friends, self confidence, and independence. I love the characters....the humor, sarcasm, and devotion. But you can't have a hero without the nasty villans, and they are so bad, which is good, because there is nothing worse than a wimpy bad guy. J.K.Rowling sure knows how to tell a story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I had already read all four of the available Harry Potter books before I listened to the audio versions of the same books. (I borrowed the tapes from a friend). The books impressed me as some of the best writing and storytelling I have ever read, and the audio versions do justice to the writing. The reader, Jim Dale, is an award-winning actor who makes the writing come alive. (Although he does pronounce Hagrid differently from the way I do. Is it \\"Hay-grid\\" or \\"Hag-rid\\"?) The CD's and tapes are unabridged, so the listener doesn't miss a word of Rowling's great writing.I often drive solo, and really enjoy listening to talk rather than music. The Harry Potter audio series is perfect for an interesting diversion from miles of straight freeway. If you are traveling by car with children, these audio versions of the books could make your trip much more enjoyable.These CD's are expensive, which is why I bought only one at first. I intend to get a new one with each Amazon order until I own the entire set."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My wife read the 4 books that had been released at the time and she loved them. She finally convinced me to read them before the movie came out. I was reluctant but finally gave in. Actually, I've still only read the first one, but don't tell her that.Anyway, I read a lot of fantasy. I've read Tolkein, Lewis, Martin, Jordan, Brooks, Kay, and many more. I know what I like, I know what I don't like. I liked Harry Potter.It is simple enough for an older child to understand but I couldn't put it down. I knew it wasn't for younger children when death happens in the first chapter. This actually perked me up a little and I read on. I don't want to ramble because there are 3,000 other reviews here and it is pretty unlikely anyone will read mine. But, just the same, I found the book to be one of the most entertaining I've ever read.Don't expect it to be the greatest book you've ever read. Put away the \\"I'm gonna hate it\\" attitude before ever reading it. This is the main reason for bad reviews of this book in my opinion. Start it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it as much as so many have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The novel Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone, by J.K. Rowling creates a new world for anyone who wants to believe. J.K. Rowling introduces fantasy early in the novel, capturing the reader's interest and creating a magical world in the reader's mind that seems very real. Rowling's style captivates the reader through action, humor, and fun. The story lets the reader take a magical trip through a magical land of witches and magic, good and evil. The story is filled with imaginative details, but Rowling's vivid descriptions make this magical new world a real place in the mind of the reader. It is a magical world where every fantasy and dream is possible. The characters are described so well that the reader can actually see them in his/her head. Even though much of the story deals with the supernatural, Rowling keeps he character's feelings and personalities on a human level. The novel is extremely well written with great detailed descriptions of characters and settings. This fantasy is most enjoyable for both kids and adults. This story allows the reader to escape into a fantasyland, and the story allows both children and adults to engage their imaginations. The fantasy is a page-turner because J.K. Rowling does a wonderful job of creating suspense. Overall, Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone is a charming fantasy that everyone should experience at least once."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling, was one of the better books written that I have read this year. To begin, I appreciated the fact that the author kept the book at a fast pace, leading you to read on what happens in the next page. Wondering if Harry would make it to the train on time, if he will be able to defeat Professor Quirrell and Voldemort in time, or if the House Gryffindor will have enough points to win the house cup, were just a few examples on how Rowling kept you glued to the book for hours. Secondly, I enjoyed how the author wrote the book with many twists and turns, and descriptions of muggle land and so a variety of ages and readers could enjoy the book. Additionally, I took pleasure in the fictional world of wizards and witches. Just even thinking if we did live in a world filled with magic is mind boggling. Finally, what I relished the most, is how Rowling deceived the readers to think who the antagonist of the story is. Many readers and myself thought that Professor Snape was after the stone, but in factuality, it was professor Quirrell who was after the stone. There was many turns and twists but in other words, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was worth my time to read the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, J.K. Rowling uses symbolism to show parallels between her fictional fantasyland, and the realities of today's society. The different forms of magic shows the conflicts between morality and greed. Setting demonstrates how riotousness can be ridiculed and ostracized in society. Characters exhibit the judgments that are made based on unjustified biases. Overall, Rowling utilizes symbolism to accurately merrier the dynamics of society.First off, pure magic and black magic are symbols of virtue and avarice. Pure magic is never used to obtain authority in a way that would harm others. Black magic destroys people to acquire power, which intern is only used to obtain riches and trivial positions. Next, the \\"muggle\\" town represents judgment, verses the world of magic that represents freedom. The town is full of arbitrary people who ridicule those who practice magic. The world of magic embraces all kinds, allowing the pure and responsible to practice magic freely. Third of all, Harry Potter and his friends accuse Professor Snape of striving to obtain the sorcerers stone. They do this based on flimsy evidence, and snap judgments. This shows that Harry and his friends represent partiality, and Snape symbolizes the misdeemed. Hence symbolism is used to strengthen Rowling's themes within the novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"There really aren't words to describe the joy this whole series has brought me through the years it's simply magical."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Sensational, a book mandatory for all fans of the world's most famous boy wizard.It has some decoys that make all the difference.

Which lots of action I simply love it!!! Cannot wait for the next books keep writing J.k Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Okay, everyone has to agree that the entire Harry Potter series is a horrible cliche that is targeted towards children, and it just so happens that adults enjoy it as well. In the books, they talk about Magic and the use of it. What is failed to be described is exactly what Magic actually is. The author portrays it as something that floats in the air that for no reason at all, comes to your beckon call to do anything you want, as long as you chant a ... phrase. Now, I am not a looney that believes there definitely is Magic in the real world that we could possibly harness, no. What I am demanding from novels that muck around with Magic is that they explain what it is, how it is harnessed, and what regulations there are to it. If you want a good Magic explanation, try Mercedes Lackey, if you don't, stick with Harry.Another major flaw is lack of character growth. How does Harry change throughout the book? He becomes more courageous, maybe? He gets some friends...becomes a hero...has another student that hates him, but obviously envies him...and? What book doesn't have that? How does he become stronger with himself? How does he grow to accept new possibilities? What are his deep feelings about what is going on? None of that is ever answered, and the series is already over half way through. Come on....Another point that bothers me is that the point of view never, ever shifts. It is all about Harry...Harry walked down the hall...Harry saw the troll...Harry this, and Harry that. What about that Draco kid? Why doesn't the author ever put anything in his perspective? Why can't the readers opt to know how he is feeling? Why does everything need to be about Harry? And if the author is going to center the whole entire series on one person, at least they would add what he is actually thinking to the literature! It's called italics. Please....Another large cliche that is found in the reading is how the plot is formatted. The storyline goes as follows: Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. It never changes. This is telling the life of someone, and I do not think that in someone's life there will be the direct sequence of events that was listed above, and seven times at that! I understand that in fantasy it is hard to be realistic, but most of the good authors make it seem as if the characters are actually three-dimensional, not paper-thin wizards and witches.I feel that if you are a strong reader, then normally this would not be one of your choice selections. The only time I ever read this was a) when I was in second grade, and b) when I need a good, strong punch in the face and realize how bad literature can be, and really be grateful that I read other things in my spare time. The reason why I let the whole series slip by with one star is because this is good literature for children. They are nice books to start on, and give a younger kid a good chance of reading more in their lives, and yes, dropping Harry Potter finally. The main reason why adults may read this is simply inexperience in different genre of writing, but when you are older, you cannot lounge all day and read nearly as much as when you were a child.I recommend Mercedes Lackey, Tad Williams, Kate Elliott, Larry Niven, Tanith Lee, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Jean M. Auel, Orson Scott Card, and if you are looking for a good book for young adults that is well written for that age group, then Garth Nix."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am 14, I love reading, and this is probably the most boring, unoriginal and derivative story I have ever read. It is not interesting and was a waste of my time. Can someone please respond to my review and tell me why people like these books?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Call me crazy, but I just didn't like this book. I thought itmoved rather slowly. The book just plays on that hackneyed boy-wizardmagical theme that's been done time and time again. Childrens' books that have some kind of underlying portent are the best kinds of childrens' books, and Harry Potter just doesn't fit that mold."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Though Harry Potter is one of the most sucessful series in the world, if you take a closer look at this book, you would realizes that it's not really that great. J. K. Rowling writes as if she was an angst-ridden junior high student; the sentences are descriptive, but in a childish way, (she basically throws a bunch of adjectives on a noun about a million times in a row) she is horribly repetitive, (I think I read \\"Harry jumped\\" about twenty times) the characters are just so... so flat, and worst of all is the horribly predictable ending.I'm not sayying this is a bad book, but it's just not a good one...Trust me, and don't believe the hype. If you really want to read it, get from your library, it's not good or original enough to waste any money on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the most boring books I have ever read! Maybe the last 2 chapters have a little, key word \\"little\\" action in them. I hardly wanted to pick up the book. I think a long stuided story. The Series dosen't get good till the Goblet of Fire. The new on comeing out is going to be so long its just dumb to read. Even the moves were having a hard time making the story exiting. I am not even going to borther with the new one. Just by hearing the title \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" sounds boring. How his there going to be 7 of them!? Harry Potter fans are in for it now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Co-workers and even my own kids pestered me to read this book. I tried and tried but I just couldn't get past the first 50 pages. I love the movies but just don't care for her style of writing at all. I am told she gets better with each book but this one was a real snoozer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Let me tell you about why I DON'T like Harry Potter. I'll start off by saying that the books themselves are actually OK. I'm glad to see that it gets kids reading and I have tremendous respect for JK Rowling, who used as much of her God given talent that she had, to write herself out of poverty to being the riches author in the history of literature. Good for her. But I think coporate america has had a lot to do with why I don't like this series.1. First of all I'm just plain sick of hearing about Harry Potter. I am sick of all the TV commercials, the merchandise, the fact that no matter where I go or what I do, I can't stop hearing about him. I'm sick of seeing Harry Potter spin offs, rip offs and knock offs. In short, I'm sick of the medias neverending attempt to promote him and am sick of seeing his face on mugs, T shirts and so forth whereever I go. I wish they would just lay off a bit so that the fans who like him could get what they want and those who aren't quite as interested wouldn't feel overwhelmed by the need to join the mayhem.2. Secondly ,and my most strongest point, is that I'm not too proud of the fact that so many kids look up to him as a 'role model'. Now don't misunderstand, I can see WHY kids like him. They like him because he was an orphan child who overcame a bad childhood, awful step parents and so forth and ended up becoming a hero in the very end. Plus they like the adventure too. What's so sad about that is that they are hailing a fictional character as their hero and role model and not somebody in real life, like their parents, relatives or anybody else who could not only inspire them to be something in this world but help them to. Alas, it's sad that most people in this world don't fit the definition of a hero. So instead of believing in themselves they have a fictional boy wizard to do it for them, instead of growing up to be somebody special in life we have millions of people who want to grow up to become 'wizards' and go around casting 'spells' in hopes that their problems will 'magically' go away. I'm sick of seeing kids fight over Harry Potter toys and dressing up in glasses and a dark robe and making fake scars on their faces or standing out in the freezing cold to get the latest book, when you know they'll never run out.You see, Harry Potter to me is nothing more than a Cinderella story. We forget that the moral of Cinderella is that people can love us just the way we are. So please corporate america, give it a rest will ya!."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I guess I am the odd one out. I read this book to see if it was safe to give my young daughter to read, and I found it to be very boring. So many pages, for not much information. It reminded me of a preteen's writing style. Safe to give my daughter? yes,but it's not her style either."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have never read anything so astonishingly unoriginal in my life. It is a SHAME that this has received the popularity that it so vehemently does not deserve. J.K. Rowling \\"borrows\\" many of her plots and characters from other children's writers of the past and defiles them into convoluted obscurity. She rarely creates, such is the talent of a true artist, and in those rare moments when her individual expression shines, it seems as strange and random as a nine year olds day dreams. If you indeed do decide to read Harry Potter, I recommend you read the first few chapters and the conclusion. The content in the middle of the book can be disregarded. In my opinion there are three options. Stay away from the Potter series. Buy the book and burn it. Or lastly read it and ponder suicide. Its that bad!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Hype is like a Tsunami, it's a massive relentless wave that swallows everyone whole. I tried reading the first book and couldn't get through it; the writing is so bad, so unoriginal. I didn't care about any of the charecters. How is it that these books are so popular? Even the movies are slow and were it not for the special effects there would be nothing to look at. And the house names: Slitheren? I'm glad J.K. Rowling is out of poverty, good for her. Now she should try, I mean REALLY TRY to write something exciting. Something that leaves the reader breathless, something that doesn't make me want to wave a magic wand and make the whole series vanish."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the best book in this whole series the thing I don't like about it is the two faced person"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The fast paced fun and folly of Harry and his friends as they battle the odds to desecrate the evil wizard violently."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Well written and the funnest series to read.

However, even as a Christian parent, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and didn't see any evil intent here. It's just a fun book for kids to read, that will help them to see their own value and &quot;empowerment&quot; even in an adult world.I especially liked that the book portrayed, in broad strokes, a wide array of stereotypical adults and kids that my child will likely run into throughout childhood. An example of this is Professor Snape, who (spoiler alert) opposes and apparently hates Harry throughout the book, but ultimately is revealed as his protector. What child doesn't have a particular teacher or adult in their life, who they are convinced hates them, when in fact that adult, in their own way is simply looking out for the child's best interests?The story also provides subtle lessons in sticking up for yourself without sinking to the level of those tormenting you, - and also about perseverence and doing the right thing. This is a valuable lesson for kids having to deal with bullies at school, or for the kid who is not part of the &quot;in&quot; crowd. What I liked most was that Harry Potter himself was essentially an &quot;everykid&quot;, who perseveres and overcomes, but does not compromise what he believes in to attain acceptence.For those Christian parents with concerns about the supernatural trappings which provide the backdrop against which the action unfolds, - it should be noted that there is a clear distinction between those who are on the good side and those on the &quot;dark side&quot;. So, at least symbolically, it can be argued that that Harry Potter is a crusader against evil and his magical gifts (again symbollically) can be likened to spiritual gifts that God provides us with to help us resist and fight against the evil in this world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am a teacher of German in an elementary school. At the beginning of this school year I began seeing Harry Potters books in my student's hands. As the year progressed, I was noticing how reluctant they were to put their books down when I was starting class. They would stand up from the reading center in their classroom and read all the way to their desks. I finally decided two weeks ago to find out what these books were all about.I read the first book in 5 days, the second book in 4 days and I've just started the third book. I also just finished reading several hundred reader reviews here at Amazon.com. I simply do not see the harm in these books! My joy is that children are READING, children who before these books didn't have any interest in reading. And when they finish the Harry Potter books they are continuing to pick up other books and read them.I teach in a school full of Southern Baptists, Catholics, Protestants, and other religiously-raised children. They are reading for the pure joy of reading, not because they are being drawn into a world of satanic rites and occultic rituals. None of my students have aspirations of becoming witches and wizards. These books are works of FICTION and they realize that!If we must, let's look at the original versions of the Grimm Fairy Tales. Those stories were violent and blood-filled, often leaving the 'bad guy' killed in some gruesome fashion. Yet those are some of the timeless classics we now encourage our children to read.Let's look past some of the 'hidden meanings' people are seeing in these books and rejoice in the fact that our children are READING!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm 24 years old, I never wished to read Harry Potter at all, and on top of all that (if one life can thus be reduced)I am a literature student, and have been for over 5 years now. So while I don't claim to write a learned review, I'm supposed to know what is good literature.How did I get this book? A friend offered it to me for my birthday. I was surprised because I had never been very interested in all the hype around that little Potter person, and I had never even seen any of the movies. I'm generally not a biased person but I admit I expected this novel to be \\"children literature\\" as they say. But things turned out quite unexpectedly...For one, no matter how many people have called this \\"children literature\\", it isn't. That label is way too belittling for a work of that kind. I'm not a kid, being 24, but I loved the book all the same. It has all the elements of a really great novel; rich characters, a plot that does catch your attention, a whole universe that is just awesome, magic, wonderful - and I could add more adjectives. Also, and this is important for those of you who think this is just a kid's book, there is a lot of dark things in the novel. Take the fact that Harry's parents are murdered. Well that alone is quite something. I mean, you definitely WILL feel sad about that sooner or later in the book.As to the writing per se, Rowling is very witty, funny, and seriously intelligent. I did laugh often and I smiled even more. This is a very touching story and it is incredibly rich on all aspects. I am really glad to find out that Harry Potter is a quality work and not the cheap novel I expected. I think this is really good and when I think of the millions of kids (and others) around the world who get into this, well I am glad, because this is good stuff, to say it in not very academic words.I would say that if you usually enjoy Gothic novels, fairy tales, or simply great books, then you should give a chance to Harry Potter. You will not regret it. Or better, offer it to a friend of yours, so you won't have to read it yourself, and your friend will read it because it was a gift. Then your friend will convince you that you must read it too. And then after all this, you will thank me for this review!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"When I first picked up this book it was the christmas of 1998. My mom had given it to me, and actually, i didn't want to read it.How wrong I was.Can I even start to explain the world and even life style that Harry has led me into. Its entertaining, funny, and there are many references to mythology that Rowling cleverly weaves in. It really just hooks you into a new world.The story, which i'm sure you've heard already, is Harry Potter is the boy who survived the attack of the Dark Wizard Voldemort when he was a baby. Growing up with his muggle (non-magical) aunt, uncle, and cousin, it is a shock for him when he learns he's a wizard.This lovely, engaging world Rowling has created leads us in bit by bit. And, its actually a quick read for u lazy people :( who don't wanna read a lot.The whole series is wonderful. I love how Rowling is able to make the reader feel that Harry is growing up as he gets older in the books. Like, the first book, the plot and vocabulary and psycology of it is fairly simple. It gets more complex further in the books.And then theres me, with my problem with obsessing over every last detail. Ask me trivia, and i know it. I've read those books way too many times!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a writer, I'm not ashamed to admit I have a great liking for Harry Potter novels. The books are magical and enchanting. They have a charm and appeal to them like no other series I've seen in a long while. Each of the novels (particularly this one)are superbly written by a talented author. Therefore, I fail to see the need for the negative criticism and bans placed upon these wonderful novels. However, I suppose each person is entitled to their own view. For the majority of people, the view is HARRY POTTER IS THE BEST! So young and old alike pick up this wonderful novel today"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I heard so much about Book 4 in the series through the media, especially the Today Show's Katie Couric, I had to go online and see what the hype was all about. After reading several reviews I decided that I would order all four books and read them in the correct sequence. I am a mother of five-year-old twins and a 12-year-old stepson, and felt that if the books were as good as everyone says, the books could be passed to all of the children in time.Book 2 arrived first and after reading a few chapters I knew right away that I had made a good decision in ordering the set. The other three books arrived a few days later and (though it was hard) I put book 2 down and picked up Book 1. I have just finished Book 1 and I can't wait to get to Book 2 in the series. Any book that gets children out from in front of the television and the computer has to have some merit. I found the book very interesting, hard to put down, and nothing offensive or immoral in the book, keeping in the mind that it is to be read as fiction and not fact. The series, according to reviews, becomes darker in the later books, but this particular book was not dark at all. The names of the people and places are very whimsical and entertaining. J K Rowling's ability for description is amazing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling is an excellent book for all ages and I would definitely urge everyone to read it. The author has put together a sensational plot with extraordinarily fascinating characters that hook a reader on the story. I started reading the book and could not stop. The wizards, the magic, and the Quidditch (the favorite sport of all wizards in which the players fly on broomsticks trying to score goals with five balls) just kept me reading. Harry, the main character of the story, is forced to live with his controlling aunt and uncle after his parents died. When Harry is eleven he finds out that he is a wizard and is sent to the Hogwarts School of Magic, for witches and wizards. He undergoes many adventures throughout his time at school, which earn him honor and respectability. At first I was embarrassed to be reading Harry Potter, which my mom said I would enjoy, as it is a book recommended for ages five to twelve - I'm sixteen. My younger brother, who isn't a big reader, read this book in a couple of days, straight. We couldn't get him away from it. I thought if he liked it so much then I guess I would enjoy it too. Was I in for a big surprise! It is the best book I have ever read and I can't wait to read the next two!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"If you are reading this review you might as well just stop now and buy Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, you won't regret it. If you still need more encouragement, please proceed. You must be warned, though, this book tends to be addictive. So much so that one might have to continue and read the rest of the books in the series. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a story about a young orphan wizard, Harry Potter, and his trials and experiences through the first year of his new school. It is masterfully written and portrays well the thoughts and emotions of a young adolescence. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, by J. K. Rowling, is a fabulous tale of friendship and loyalty, courage, and love that people ages five to one hundred can enjoy.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful example of the power of friendship and loyalty. In the beginning of the book Harry starts off as a sort of a social outcast. He has almost no friends mainly because his cousin, Dudley, does not allow it. Yet with the revelation that he has been accepted to Hogwarts Harry has a chance to start again in finding friends. Almost immediately after Harry heads to Hogwarts he meets Ron Weasly, a tall, skinny first year with flaming red hair. They hit it off right from the beginning and throughout the course of the book their friendship grows. This duo becomes a trio when they become friends with Hermione Granger, a bookish know it all also in her first year of school. These three have many adventures together. Through these adventures they become very close. Hermione and Ron stick with Harry throughout all his troubles. Once when Harry was playing Quidditch, the wizard sport of choice, someone jinxed his broom making it try to buck him off while he was at least one hundred feet in the air. Hermione and Ron see this and go to Harry's rescue. They find the perpetrator and set fire to his robes. This was just enough for Harry to break free. Another example of loyalty and friendship is when Hagrid, the gamekeeper and one of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's friends, gets himself in a pickle. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are there to help him out. They put their reputation on the line to save his. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone contains many great examples of friendship and loyalty.Courage is present throughout the whole of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, says of courage, \\"There are two kinds of courage. It it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\\" These two kinds of courage are found multiple times. Harry definitely does not lack courage. He faces many challenges in his first year of school. He puts his life on line when he goes to save the school from the Dark Lord Voldemort. Since his name is strikes fear in the wizarding world he will now be referred to as You-Know-Who. You-Know-Who is the most feared wizard of his time. He was the one who killed Harry's parents. Harry, when younger, was able, through help from his mother, to strip You-Know-Who of his powers. You-Know-Who wants to rise to power again and needs something from the school to do so. Harry, Hermione, and Ron go to stop You-Know-Who knowing full well that three first year wizards have little chance of stopping one of the most powerful wizards of all time. Eventually it ends up Harry facing You-Know-Who alone. Harry does not shrink from this responsibility and fights nobly and ends up defeating him. Neville Longbottom, a round faced first year, is an example of the courage of standing up to friends. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sneaking out after hours, Neville catches wind that they are doing this and, knowing that it is wrong, tries to stop them. This took a great deal of courage on Neville's part because he had always been timid. He knew what the others were doing was wrong, though, so he stood up to them. Both physical and moral courage are found many times in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.Love is the main theme of the Harry Potter series including Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is through love that Harry is able to stand up to You-Know-Who. Through love Harry is able to make friends. Love is the reason his friends stick with him through thick and thin. Harry's mother sacrificed herself to save Harry. The love that she showed protected Harry from You-Know-Who's first attack and it protects him throughout his life. This is because one marked with hatred, greed, and unrighteous ambition can not harm \\"a person marked by something so good.\\" This something is love. Love, according to Dumbledore, is the most powerful magic of all.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful book. It teaches great lessons of love, courage, friendship, and loyalty. It is fun to read and can be enjoyed by those off almost all ages. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the start of a wonderful adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Some annoying Muggles claim that this book is a first year primer in the School of Satan. That's as silly as claiming that Walt Disney's production of Beauty and the Beast promotes unnatural connections between large animals and adolescent females. Children do not become blood drinkers after reading about Harry Potter. They will, however, nag you as to exactly where train station 19 and three quarters is located and they will crave Bertie Botts Every Flavor beans, those most unpredictable of sweets.If you can imagine the game of Soccer, but with the rules rewritten by Jim Carey and Adam Sandler, then you're ready for the sport of Quidditch where five balls are in play simultaneously, the players fly around on broomsticks and the match can last months.In Harry Potter's world, paintings become doors with the right password, men live in wooden houses and raise fire breathing Dragons, chessmen advise you as to their optimal deployment and eating a chocolate frog is a good thing! And, should your children turn a mouse into a snuffbox, I suggest, in true Hogwarts Tradition, that you award points for originality, but gravely deduct for any whiskers left upon it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was very pleased with the prompt shipment and the quality of the book.

In theory, it's for my kids, but I too have read the books, watched the movies many times. The imagination/creativity that went into these books is astounding. Would recommend to every family"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first in the series of Harry Potters, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a \\"wonderful, funny, moving and impressive\\" by JK Rowling, according to The New York Times Book Review. She uses a fantasy setting that is a parallel dimension to the \\"muggles\\", non-magical, world. The author introduces the main character that has all good qualities, strength and kindness, but is not all that interesting on his own. Rowling pays close attention to the vividness of each other character that surrounds Harry on his adventures. All throughout the book Harry is surrounded by the extremely vivid and interesting characters, some that are very good while others are very bad and then those who are just in between - a magical mixture.Imagery is the most important tool in the development of Harry Potter, used to set the characters, setting and theme. The author uses such strong imagery such so that the reader can imagine themselves inside the story and actually feel like they can relate. The story shows the growth of a young boy named Harry in very difficult circumstances. He is an orphan who is abused by his very selfish aunt and uncle, the Dursleys. They spoil their own child, while being nasty and ignore Harry. This brings the readers to not like the Dursleys, actually love to hate. The reader realizes through the use of owls delivering letters, that Harry is somehow special. Already the reader is involved in the story and feels that Harry deserves more out of life. Soon Harry leaves this unhappy home and begins his time at the school of Hogwarts, which is a rich and friendly world for him, and a place where he finally belongs. It is here that the fantasy begins in another dimension parallel to this world.I feel that if the book started at the school, the reader could not have the warm feeling of Harry finally belonging. Through character development, the author portrays the opposing forces of good and evil. Building suspenseful situations creates reader anxiety, which allow you to feel you are inside the pages. The school setting provides a stable and predictable place for the students to live in, while at the same time you have the magical element that exerts a constant distraction of the stability of the school. These two elements are constantly working against each other.Rowling brings the readers on an adventure where they can relate to some of these characters. They explore friendships, growth, love and the opposite forces, and create memories along the way. Heriome, Ron and Harry bond from the day they meet on the train ride to Hogwarts. The setting and circumstance allow the three to seal their growing friendships. Meeting the Weasley family allowed him to belong to a family who loved him and did not mistreat him. While at school, Dumbledore, a teacher and mentor, develops Harry, molding him, teaching him and guiding him along the way. This is where Harry finds out about his scar and why he is called \\"the boy who lived\\". He learns of the evil forces that have been following him since shortly after his birth. Until these revelations, the reader also wonders. At last the ultimate villain is revealed, Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents leaving him to be orphaned at an early age. Even they share a bond because he was unable to kill Harry. Rowling's does a wonderful job in portraying every detail along the way and allowing the reader to feel like they are part of this novel."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read the books in high school and I had just borrowed them from my neighbor. When Deathly Hallows Part 1 came to theathers I had wanted to reread all the books plus have them for my collection! So I began to buy them. :]"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"this was the best harry potter book in the series. i felt like this revealed way more information and insight into key characters such as dumbledore and hermine and luna. this was a fun book and light hearted unlike the later ones."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Rowling's prose really comes alive when you read this book aloud.

The book has something to offer everyone, and I'd recommend it with enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Stanek's Kingdoms books are my faves, this is a close seocnd. Back years ago when I started reading Harry Potter, I thought meh not bad, not good. Then I read the second book and said okay blek blek blek, but still not so bad. It was the third book what got me hooked and now I've read all 7 books and watched all 8 movies. Now Reading The books again, it's the first one I remember the most. Wonder how my retread of the others will go?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"One word, \\"Wow!\\"I never wanted to read this series, but now I know why it was so very popular!Read. It's a must.You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Yes, indeed. It was a good run while it lasted. Seven books and eight movies that had children and adults alike breathless in anticipation, waiting for the next installment. There were, to be sure, screams of outrage: \\"They are about _witches_!\\" But we all knew that they came from Muggles, blind to imagination, irony, and creativity. People like Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Harry Potter was _fun_. That was the secret. It is why my eight year old niece loves the stories. It is why my wife loves the stories. It is why I love the stories.And here is where it all started-- with J.K. Rowling's _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ (1997). Yes, rereading the book brings it all back-- the endless letters, the entrance of Rubeus Hagrid, the wonders of Diagon Alley, platform nine-and-three-quarters and the Hogwarts Express, the sorting hat, the Halloween battle, the Quidditch match, and more.We see the gradual alliance between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. (They are _not_ all fast friends at first.) There is the introduction of the bumbling Neville Longbranch (who later on proves to be more important than you might think). We see (briefly) Ginny Weasly, who becomes increasingly important in the later books. We are introduced to the odious Draco Malfoy and his toadies, Crabbe and Goyle. There is the longstanding antagonism between Harry and Professor Snape. And there is the kindly advice from Professor Dumbledor (who nevertheless doesn't tell everything that he knows).There is Hogwarts Academy itself, with its delicious food, floating candles, moving portraits, ghosts and poltergeists, secret passages, magic mirrors, magical pets, threshhold guardians, and forbidden woods. And the classes! Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and Charms. Even the most boring class, History of Magic, is taught by a ghost. Hogwarts is the school that we wish that we had attended in our youth. If we are boys, we wish that we were as brave as Harry or as normal as Ron. If we are girls, we wish that we were as smart as Hermione.Yes, the series made a good run while it lasted. How long will it last? Will it join fantasy classics like C.S. Lewis' Narnia books, Lucy M. Boston's Green Knowe books, or L. Frank Baum's Oz books? I don't know. I'm betting that it will. But I'll bet that there will also be plenty of would-be censors who will oppose the books along the way. They will have reasons for doing so. Censors _always_ have reasons."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This may be billed as a childrens book but it is as well written &amp; as entertaining as some of the best fanasty books We have read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book was so much fun for me to read.

A family friend gave it to me, and I wasn't sure if I would really like it- I was like, &quot;Well, this looks like a little kid's book... it sounded boring.&quot; So I didn't read it right away. Then on the first day of school, all my friends were talking about the &quot;amazing Harry Potter series&quot;. So I said, what the heck, and I got out that book I got as a gift and read it. I couldn't put it down, it was so good! It is so adventurous and it tells about a totally normal boy who has an interesting experience with magic. I then went to the bookstore to buy the second book and the third book, and I've probably never read a book faster than I did then... and I read books pretty quickly.

I can't wait for #4 to come out this July!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I found this first Harry Potter book to be completely charming, with plenty of wit scattered throughout.

Red herrings do abound, so beware when deciding who the &quot;bad&quot; guy really is!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'd heard about the furor over whether the Harry Potter books were suitable for children, and so I welcomed the opportunity to read it when the lady sitting next to me on an airplane let me borrow it for the flight. (Fortunately it's light reading and I'm a fast reader.) Our conclusions were the same: it certainly *is* suitable for children, and adults as well. It's fun, light, and describes the activities of a schoolboy trying to be good (probably harder than most real schoolboys). Personally, I saw no hint of any of the darker aspects I've heard ascribed to it; I rather suspect the ascribers hadn't read it, but were jerking their knees over 'hot-button' words like 'magic' and 'sorcery.' I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to *anyone*, of any age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book has an amazing story line that will get you hooked.I read this book in my school book-club.

I absolutely could not put it down, from the first page to the last. My son started re-reading it as soon as I finished it. In many ways it's a classic coming-of-age story in the tradition of the Dark Is Rising series, but there is a whimsy and irreverence to the characters and storyline that is not present there, or even in Tolkein's books.

J.K. Rawling is witty, imaginative and above all crafty in her writing of this series. She has built a superb story from the ground up, including seemingly inconsequential characters in the early novels that prove to be of great importance in future novels.(You will find yourself saying&quot; why didn't I see that?&quot; time and again.) No other author has managed her feat - getting 10-year-old boys to turn off their nintendos and playstations and actually open a book! And with good reason, too! She is following in the footsteps of the greats...C.S. Lewis, Roald Dhal, J.R.R. Tolkien, to name a few. And even though the series is fantasy-based, the hero faces, again and again, real-life issues that give the reader a sense of intimacy.....you really feel for Harry when his hateful relatives are being mean to him(especially those of us who grew up in similar situations), and when he finally discovers a world of his own that he can excel in. But Harry also learns in the first book, along with readers, that magic is not a cure for anything wrong in one's life and that there are bullies just as mean as his relatives in the magickal world. All in all, a book you will want to read again and again!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I am going to assume that you've either: already read this book, have seen the movie, or aren't interested in HP at all, so I won't bore you with a plot summary. I will, however, tell you why it was so enjoyable and worthwhile to read again.A lot has happened since we first met Harry \\"seven\\" Hogwarts years ago. Each year, or book, since then has gotten progressively darker, more intricate, and mature. The most recent book, Half-Blood Prince, left us saddened, anxious, a little hungry for revenge, and definitely curious of the final outcome. Book 1 is so light-hearted and fun in direct contrast to Book 6, that it is almost a completely different experience. By the end of Philosopher's Stone, we know there is evil at work in the world and there's more to Harry's past than we know about, we don't yet know how deep into that tunnel we are about to go.It was quite amusing to revisit the characters we now know so well (Hagrid, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, Ron and Hermione), but who were new to us in Book 1. Everyone seemed that much more carefree \\"seven\\" years ago. Dumbledore especially really shows his wacky, humorous, there's-a-fine-line-between-genius-and-crazy side. Which, considering the events of Book 6, was extra nice to remember.It may not be my favorite book in the series (I actually prefer the darker stuff, and especially love Sirius Black), but it's fun to look back on the book that started something of a literary revolution."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone by J.K Rowling is a richly detailed book.

But most certainly, ladies and gentlemen, this is where it all started. Perhaps the frenzied worldwide attention the series has gotten has begun a band of backlash, and that's always inevitible to some degree, but let's forget all that and look at the book. I am a single adult with no children. My sister told me she had been reading it to my niece and became more interested in the series than her child. I laughed. My friend, a 34 male musician in NYC told me during a phone conversation that the 'fad' had stirred his curiosity, so he picked up a copy, began reading it on the subway, and simply could not stop. So, I relented, went to the libraray and grabbed the only copy left. I was absolutely fascinated. In the first 16 pages of this beautifully written, lavishly imaginitive tale of a young boy, whose parents are murdered, and his true, magical destiny begins to unfold, I was hooked. The concepts, so masterfully drawn on the page with refreshing characters, paced dialog, and rich atmospheres, this is the spark which will set your imagination on fire. I love the fact that we have come into an era where childrens books don't have to be 13 pages long and about a duck looking for a mommy, but can deal with real emotion, diverse ideas, and new, fresh realizations. For children under 10, it may be a bit above their level of comprehension, but for anyone who loves to read, loves to partake of otherworldly journey's and simply set their imagination free, this is for you. I think one of the most valuable lessons here, coming back to this book series, is teaching children, (And even some adults.) That it's okay to have fun while reading, and most certainly to charge up the magic of the mind."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I was very unsure about what I might think before reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because of the great reviews and popularity this book has received. I wondered if I would feel the same. I can say that it lives up to the hype!Many books spark the imagination, but this Harry Potter book completely created another world. I kept wanting to read to find out what was going to happen and what other things J.K. Rowling was able to create through her words. It is an amazing escape from everyday life, and a wonderful book in which to immerse yourself. I highly recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I would say I'm a muggle and the the story is very mugglish, in the sense that is pretty ordinary escapism. Exactly what one needs after an abysmal day at work. The prose is crystal clear and the story is devoid of complicated plot intricacies. The rare twists are rather twist-friendly and I understand the need for linearity (kids and all). I loved the book. I recommend Jonathan Carroll if you can find it and you'll know what I mean."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I'm not going to bother with a synopsis for this one since by this point most people have either read the book, seen the movie, or both. This was not my first time reading it, or even second time, but it was my first time listening to it. To avoid fights in the car we always have a book going even for short trips. This was the first time my children had heard this book. After listening we watched the movie again and it was great to see the differences they saw and what they noticed being left out. It really helped reinforce the idea that often times the book is more detailed and interesting than the movie since it doesn't have to fit into a certain amount of time.There were details I had forgotten since my last reading of this novel and things I looked at differently based on the ultimate outcomes through the series. One of the things I really noticed were details in how Professor Snape treated Harry and acted towards him due to revelations about his feelings for Lily Potter. Seeing that he loved her and hated James I would have thought that his love for Lily would have won out and made him more protective of Harry than he was. That said, while writing this as the first book in the series Rowling may not have made the decision for that love to exist in the future. She never contradicted herself, but it was something I wondered about when reading one of the later books.My children all really enjoyed this one. At some point I would like to read it with them again from our copy of the book, but I have to say that I am now loving audio books. I haven't listened to one for adults in years, but even the ones for children's chapter books are fun to listen to. i recommend them to anyone going on long trips with their kids or with kids who tend to fight when forced to sit next to each other for prolonged periods of time. Check out you library. Often they have great selections."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"As a 12 year old 7th grader, I had never touched this series until the beginning of the school year. One day I decided to read about a chapter of it but I couldn't stop reading it because the book was so good!When you read the book, you become so interested in it that you are always wondering what's going to happen next. The book is very well written which makes it a great storyThe plot of the book, I think, is very cool. Amazing events happen that you never dreamed could even be brought into a fantasy book. For Example: Diagon Alley. You've heard of wizards but you've never heard of a wizard shoppingcenter(mall). You can only get into Diagon Alley by tapping your wand on a brick wall and in Diagon Alley, wizards and witches can buy flying broomsticks, magic pets, a real wand, cauldrons, and much much more. How cool is that!The characters in the book are also very cool and described very well. Harry Potter, a small, 11 year old oprphaned boy with black hair and a scar shaped like a lightning bolt,Ron Weasley, Harry Potter's tall, red-haired friend with a pet rat named Scabbers, Hermione Granger, another friend of Harry Potter who is a know-it-all with bushy brown hair, Hagrid the giant, the gamekeeper at Hogwarts and Harry's friend, Dumbledore, the headmaster at Hogwarts, and many more characters that are mentioned and described in the book so well.I also think the setting and places are cool. Harry spends most of the book at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wisardry, a school where young witches(not bad ones) and wizards go to learn about about magic(how to use it, certain charms, history of magic, etc.) as well as the school containing magic around every corner.In the book, Harry gets accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wisardry after his aunt, uncle and cousin, the Dursleys, treated him like dirt. He not only discovers plenty of magic but new friends and sports and animals he never dreamed existed. As well as the good, there is also some bad. There is Proffesor Snape, a grouchy and mean proffesor who hates Harry very much and the worst villian of them all(I can't tell who he/she is otherwise I might spoil the story for you).All of the amazing characters, settings, events, etc. make up an amazing start to the Harry Potter series (I am currently reading the 4th book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). Because of this book, I have turned into a Harry Potter fanatic! I would rate this book at least 6 stars if I could. If you want to be enjoyed by a fantastic fantasy that allows you to never stop reading or if you don't, you have got to buy this book, evn if it is very expensive or not. I hope you enjoy this book!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I have to admit that I came upon the whole Harry Potter phenomenon pretty late, even though I've been aware of the franchise for about 10 years. I had always observed and respected Rowling's incredible success but I couldn't finish watching the first movie and always put off reading the books. But then last Christmas, magic happened. Well, sorta. My brother bought me the movie version of Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix. The problem was that I had never watched any of the four movies that came before it! And only in the last 2 months or so did I go back and watch the movies in order, and I found I really enjoyed them once I gave them a chance. So when summer vacation started I sat down to read the first book and really liked it.Harry Potter has led a hard life all of his short 10 years and is on the brink of starting an equally dismal eleventh. His parents died in a car wreck when he was an infant and he was reluctantly taken in by his aunt and uncle Dursley. They treat him like dirt, relegating him to a small crawlspace underneath the stairs in lieu of a real room, that just gives him space enough to lay down and sleep. The Dursley's son, Dudley, is equally vicious to Harry. While Dudley gets every toy and luxury the Dursleys can afford, Harry never gets anything nice. His aunt and uncle think Harry is weird and has strange abilities that they cannot explain. Things change on Harry's eleventh birthday when he recieves a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Even though the Dursleys want Harry to be a normal kid and quit being so strange, Harry soon learns the truth about his parents. Namely, that they were powerful wizards that were murdered by an even more powerful sorcerer named Valdemort. This same Valdemort is the entity that left a scar on Harry's forehead the night he killed his parents. Harry is famous among magic users for being the only person to survive a face to face encounter with Valdemort, a man whose very name inspires fear. Now, Harry must set out on his own journey to become a great wizard, and along the way, make new friends and be accepted as a human being worthy of respect and kindness.Who doesn't want to escape the crazy existence that is life on Earth in the 21st century, to get away from war and and the paranoia of religion and terrorism? To live in a world where magic allows incredible miracles...but also incredible evils. That's the cool thing about Rowling's story. Things are not all hunky dory in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. There aren't a lot of kid heroes whose parents were murdered in cold blood and then have a scar burned into their flesh. And let's not get into the cruelty that Harry has to endure for almost eleven long years by relatives who should have been turned over to the cops for child cruelty. Some of the things in this book are very dark. This isn't a world of magic where everything is covered in fairy dust and everybody smiles all the time and gets along with each other. It has a strong vein of realism, at least in the spiritual trials the characters face and their relationships with each other. Friendship and the importance of it is one of recurring themes, as illustrated by the bonds that form between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I was also impressed by Rowling's ability to take a formula, (a magic school) and make it seem fresh and original. This book could have easily turned into a hack job. But the author's imagination sweeps aside any such notions and whisks you away for a couple hours of your life. A great read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book and read it in two days and began the next immediately. One thing that troubles me -- about many amazon reviews -- is that they are NOT reviews. Person after person summarizes the story (which is, basically, summarized in the official editorial paragraph. WHY OH WHY does everyone do this! WHy not just say what you liked/disliked and why?Rowling uses EXQUISITE VOCABULARY (hurrah! KIDS WILL LEARN NEW AND INTERESTING WORDS), STRONG PLOT AND SUSPENSE, AND ENGAGING CHARACTERS. I also very much appreciate that some of her positive characters are not all goody-two shoes and have imperfections and character flaws (Hagrid's drinking and keeping beasties, students who \\"swore\\" when angry or shocked).I saw the films first and felt they were well cast.

If I were to rate this book on a scale from one to ten I would have to give it a nine point five. Why you ask? Well, besides the fact that I don't like giving a perfect ten it was great. The characters were lively and the consistent suspense was enormously good. \\"Petrificus Totalus!\\" she cried, pointing it at Neville... he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.\\"(Rowling 273). Now don't you wish you could just make that happen to some people in particular in your life, but its just too good to be true right? Well, J.K.

Harry and his friends go on some amazing adventures filled with laughter and danger. Harry Potter is a great source to study diversity in the classroom. Harry and his two friends, Ron and Harmonie, come from such different backgrounds, but that does not matter to these three students. Their friendships is what is is most important to these friends.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has. Clearly a gifted storyteller, J.K. Rowling is a craftsperson who can invent a large family of believable characters from all walks of life in my view. Parts of Harry Potter are about the ideas of good and evil vs the idea that there are only shades of gray in the struggle for false power, greed, and ambition. To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure and life is, well: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! and Love! The book mirrors global society in 1999 it seems to me by presenting a post-Christian point-of-view to several major and formerly religious holidays such as Christmas and Easter presenting them more in terms of secular outings/festivities vs traditional days of high Christian spiritual holydays celebrating events in the life of Jesus Christ. Harry Potter mixes the world of witches and wizards with a post-Christian world invented through Rowling's vivid imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I thought Harry Potter is so good, I started reading andcouldn't stop!

It has led me back to reading for fun...happy reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The first Harry Potter book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, is a classic example of fiction writing at it's best: we care for the characters, laugh and cry and gasp in all the right places...but most importantly, for this writer, the book has something happening on nearly every page, ends chapters with a cliffhanger, and builds a sensible and reasonable climax (even with an unexpected surprise that totally sets us up throughout the book) that make it the classic example of fine writing that it is -- no matter what your age."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"You know the British hold Americans in contempt--either that, or the American publisher, Scholastic, does--when they feel we're too unwashed and unlearned to handle the REAL title of a book (in this case, HP and the Philosopher's Stone). I guess I'll just have to bite down on my own personal sense of indignation at this, because I, like hundreds of millions of others, have fallen completely under the Harry Potter spell. And it all started, magnificently, with this modestly-sized introductory tome.Most of you know the story by now, so there'd be little point in another gratuitous rehash. The story is, of course, a modern classic: Cinderfella for the modern age. Other reviewers will already have written of the underdog appeal of its protagonist, the simulataneously imaginative and derivative illustration of a magical subworld within the bland and cruel universe of the real--but what won me over, as an adult reader, with the wit, charm, and discipline of Rowling's prose. Unlike some later Potter books, there isn't a wasted or extraneous scene, sentence, phrase, or word.Moviegoers who haven't immersed themselves in the literary Potter world (and you know who you are, all twenty-six of you) miss out on the cleverness, humor, and subtlety of a story well-told (as opposed to passively viewed).With the final book yet to come, for me, this book ranks above Chamber of Secrets, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix, placing a well-merited third place in the Harry Hierarchy.Side note: I do hope that my usage of the words \\"extraneous\\", \\"hierarchy\\", and \\"gratuitous\\" qualifies me to understand \\"philosopher\\", and that no further dumbing down of Rowling's text should occur in future American editions.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire fantasy \\"Teeth.\\")"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I know that everyone has probably read the book, watched the movie, heard the music...but I just love the audio book. It gives the story a whole new depth. Jim Dale does a great job (although some of his pronunciations differ some what from what we're used to). It really brings the book to life. Since the movie couldn't cover the whole content of the book, the audio book does a great job. You can still use your own imagination while listening to the book. I love you J. K. I just can't wait for the next movie to come out...and of course, the final book!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a great book, however if you are looking for a complete set of the HP books in hardcover this is not the version to buy. This version has a very poorly made hard cover with no sleve and is much smaller then the hardcover version of the later books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Before writing this review, I took some time to look at what others had written, especially the reviews with low ratings. All who wrote those seemed to have one thing in common: they didn't see any sophistication in style, a lot of figurative language, blah...blah...blah....Well, for one, if you need to feel \\"sophisticated\\" when reading a book, and that is why Harry Potter doesn't suffice to such an extraordinary appetite for \\"real\\" literature, maybe you should step back and think...This book is writen in Rowling's genious style which is meant to draw the reader in and does so like no other book EVER.This unique style which, if you notice, works fairly well, goes beyond all the boring crap and sometimes awfully long pointless passages. Dickens, for example, though great, we can all admit bores us sometimes. You're reading the book and thinking- \\"Oh, come on... just get to the point.\\" As THE greatest author of all time, Mark Twain, put it in a letter to D.W. Bowser: \\"I notice that you use plain, simple language, short words and brief sentences. That is the way to write English - it is the modern way and the best way. Stick to it; don't let fluff and flowers and verbosity creep in. When you catch an adjective, kill it. No, I don't mean utterly, but kill most of them - then the rest will be valuable. They weaken when they are close together. They give strength when they are wide apart. An adjective habit, or a wordy, diffuse, flowery habit, once fastened upon a person, is as hard to get rid of as any other vice.\\"This applies very well to Rowling's style. Her descriptions DO contain a fair amount of adjectives and wordplay, but she doesn't overdo them, and she spaces them out. This style keeps her readers hooked while allowing them to notice the passages of description wothout feeling overloaded. It is a brilliant way to write and I love how easy it makes these books to read.So, for those of you who see these books as childish, stop trying to be SO sophisticated for once, and just let them take you away to a different place like every great book should. Again, I refer to Twain: \\"I conceive that the right way to write a story for boys is to write so that it will not only interest boys but strongly interest any man who has ever been a boy. That immensely enlarges the audience.\\"Rowling has absolutely succeeded here.To another point that I noticed- how there is no elaborate background as with most fantasies- that actually makes this book BETTER. Tolkein's Lord Of The Rings is truly classic and epic, but with all of the history and \\"flowery stuff\\" I tend to get lost in the shrubbery. Rowling, however, sets you off on the same footing as Harry, which really connects you to him, and then gradually introduces her world of magic. This is truly relatable due to its setting in our modern time, not Middle Earth. Her world of magic is much more human and less fantastic which makes you really connect to every witch and wizard. I don't even see these books as that much fantasy but much more of mystery. Rowling keeps the reader's attention that way, too.Overall, if you've never read a Harry Potter book, start on this one, The Most Magical Book of All Time, and don't look back. Let yourself go from \\"sophistication\\" and the shrubbery and enjoy yourself. The ride is the best I, for one, have ever had. As Rowling herself puts it- \\"The best of us must sometimes eat our words.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My review to this book, wonderful written so well and I think that I will remember how Harry Potter arrived from that flying motorcycle that hagrid was on.

Then I feel I must pay a special tribute to Jim Dale, the narrator of the audio books. I've read (well, listened) hundreds of audio books and the Harry Potter books are definitely the best. There is no doubt that has a lot to do with the books themselves but Jim Dale's reading adds rich colors to so many characters that they become alive and &quot;jump out of the paper&quot;, as a Chinese saying goes. Out of all the media (paper, audio and movie) of Harry Potter books I personally enjoy the audio the most. I never read any Harry Potter until I started listening to book 3(!) by chance.

You know that he is a young wizard who attends a magic school called Hogwarts. You also know that Harry wears black horned rimmed glasses and has a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. In the five years since it was published, the book has become a phenomenon as wide spread as Star Wars or Star Trek. But with any series that is popular, there is a chance that the book is mediocre and is popular due to a huge advertising campaign. However, after having read it, I have concluded that the series is popular for one very good reason: it is good.Harry Potter is able to live the dreams of people everywhere. He is able to escape the dullness and the pain of the real world and journey to a world where witches, wizards, dragons, and magic exist. Who hasn't wished that he or she could use magic or fly? Reading about magic and dragons causes the reader to have a sense of wonder that never disappears throughout the book.The characters are good as well. Harry is a believeable character, as are his friends Ron and Hermonie. They are likeable people and you actually root for them. The descriptions of magic are good as well and never lose the sense of wonder.All in all, this is a very good book and I definitely recommend you read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's now been some years since the \\"Harry Potter\\" books first came out. Unless I am mistaken, book # 5 is due on shelves soon. In addition, two major motion pictures have now been produced.During this time, I have been repeatedly asked, as a parent, as a clergyman, and as a student of fantasy literature, what my \\"opinion\\" of the series is. After having read all four books, and having seen the first movie, I am now prepared to comment.Some people, especially those in the conservative Christian camp, decry the books as inherently Satanic, dealing, as they do, with \\"witchcraft\\", etc. As a conservative Christian father and clergyman, I must admit that I do NOT agree with this assessment -- an assessment made, all to often, by persons who have not actually read the books in question. Do I understand \\"why\\" some would suggest this? Of course I do. The difference, however, lies in the nature of fantasy literature. As can be seen in other fantasy series, (Katherine Kurtz' \\"Saint Camber\\" stories come to mind) the characters in the \\"Harry Potter\\" stories are endowed at birth with certain gifts, powers, etc., not typically applicable to ordinary persons. Much like \\"The Force\\" in the \\"Star Wars\\" stories, this power can be used for good or for evil and is, in and of itself, neither. It is this point which firmly seperates \\"Harry Potter\\" from those who actually believe in and seek to practice the Dark Arts -- activities which conservative Christians -- rightly -- condemn as anti-Scriptural.Thus, it is within this deliberate \\"suspension of belief\\" that these stories must be judged. Are they good fairy tales???\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is light reading. Don't go expecting \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" here -- or even \\"Saint Camber\\". You just won't find it. This being said, it was reasonably enjoyable light reading. I'll grade it as follows:Plot: B -- a bit predictable and using many stereotypic conventions. Nonetheless, there is a bit of creativity shown, most especially in the \\"Quiddich\\" concept.Character Development: C -- lots of stereotypes here, some of which work better than others. Dumbledore, for example, is quite good (though little is actually learned about him). Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle are the typical school bullies found in any story of this sort -- regardless of magic. The animosity of Professor Snape toward Harry, while emphasized, is never satisfactorially explained. Nor are the reasons behind the disgrace and expulsion of Hagrid -- an evidently important character. The Dursleys are hideous to the point of caricature -- which is, I believe, the point. The whys and wherefores of Harry himself: who he is, from where did he come, etc. are touched on -- barely enough.Setting: B+ -- here the author does use a bit of imaginative creativity. Platform 9 3/4 is great. So are the various types of candy available. (An Every-Flavored Bean, anyone?). The various descriptions of Hogwarts fascinate (and are obviously caricatures of the English school system). Yet, for all of the author's creativity, still much emphasis is placed on traditional mythological conventions: unicorns, centaurs, dragons, even pointy hats and brooms. The originality only went so far.Overall, I'll give the book 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4 -- while recognizing the book for what it is, rather than trying to force the book into something it is not -- neither Satanic delusion -- nor great fairy-story literature. Much of the book (and a great deal of the humor) seems very tongue-in-cheek -- and I strongly suspect that this gentle satire goes way over the head of the typical pre-teen/young teen reader of the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. RowlingI have finally jumped on the bandwagon and decided to read the first installment of the adventures of young Harry Potter. In HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE by J.K. Rowling, we are introduced to Harry Potter and his miserable life with his relatives, the Dursley's. Harry is orphaned as an infant, and is sent to live with the Dursley's, who are his only known relatives. For reasons unknown to Harry, he is treated less than a second class citizen is. He sleeps in a closet and is treated like dirt, while his cousin Dudley is spoiled rotten.Harry's life was never normal. Strange, magical things would happen around him. His Aunt and Uncle seem to have a strange fear of Harry, almost to the point of obsession, and it seems that these abnormal happenings are somehow tied to Harry. His Aunt and Uncle are never sure what is really happening, but to be on the safe side they are constantly punishing Harry for anything that happens that seems out of the ordinary.Then one day, Harry's life changes for the better. After a series of strange events regarding the postal service and a bunch of letters addressed to him, on his 11th birthday Harry finds himself being taken to a new home, a school for wizards: \\"HOGWARTS SCHOOL FOR WIZARDS\\". A whole new world is opened up to him, and Harry finds himself finally happy and surrounded by many friends and admirers as he learns the way of the wizard's life.His best friends at school, Ron and Hermione, along with Harry, learn how to become wizards. Ron's abilities as a wizard are somewhat questionable, but Hermione's quite the expert even in her first year. Between the three of them, they have a series of adventures that is out of this world.I am going to give a biased thumbs up for HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, only because I had seen the movies first and read this book with the movie in mind. I can't say for a fact that if i hadn't seen the movies in the first place, whether or not I would have enjoyed these books as much as I did. I do have to say that J.K. Rowling is a very gifted writer and I would find it interesting if she decided to put out a series of books for adults. I currently have the entire collection of Harry Potter books at home, ready to be read, so I am hoping the rest of the series is as good as this first book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"No matter what age you are or where you are from, this is a book that you can enjoy.

The main characters in the book were Harry Potter, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley's and their son Dudly. The setting of the book mostly took place in the Dursley's house. In the begining of the book Harry Potter get's sent to his reletive's the Dursley's,and he really doesn't like it that much because they didn't treat him right so that's why he didn't like them that much. Harry finds out that he is a wizard. At his school he wanders around and gets in trouble. There was a lot of action and suspense through out this book. The ending was a very surprising and made me want to read the next book to see what happens next. I recommend this book for any age group. You will find this book interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"What can I say? I love these books. If you haven't read the HP series yet, then get out of your cave and start with this one! It chronicles Harry's introduction to the world of magic, and encapsulates the personae of 11 year olds everywhere. Meet the bossy Hermione, the obnoxious Percy (who is one of my favourite characters) and the rest. I could not recommend a better book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"why do we have to compare harry potter books with others. I mean other books have five stars but none are as good. I personaly think that the harry potter's are the best books ever. I don't know about you but when I read the Harry potter books i could not put them down. It is amazing to me how many people have not read or even heard of the harry potters. oh one last thing i wanted to say and that is that i am very disapointed in people who give things away about the book you may have read it but some people like to look at the reviews before they buy the book and they don't want to know the ending."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Bristish author JK Rowling is probably one of the most famous people in the world.

I was a little hesitant when I started not knowing wheter I would like it or not. But as soon as I started it I was finshed and one to the second, then the third. It took me an average of four days to finsh the books, beside the size. To anyone who really isn't sure about fantasy books please go into this book open minded.Oh and to those witches and wizards out there if you meet Draco Malfoy please just slap him for me. Thank you"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"The book was very detailed and interesting because it was about an imaginary world that J.K. Rowling created. This would be very appealing to an 11 year old girl like me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I loved this book. I would reccomend it to anyone because it is a topic that sounds corney, but everyone that I have talked to male or female that has read it has loved it and went to the store to but the second one I would reccomened this book highly!

I am going to get the second one today!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I went to England last Christmas Vacation, and my mom an dad bought me the book that was in our newspaper before it was even releast (?) here.

I have read the book through because I couldn't wait to see what happens myself. It is a fun, heartwarming book that is so imaginative I smile when I think of it. We can't wait to read the sequels. What a pleasant way to put my daughter to bed each night. Thank you Ms. Rowling! Imagination and Creativity and Excitement begin to describe this great book. I'd say the age levels should be 7 on up!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I picked up this book because it was 1-2-3 on the bestseller list. I thought it was probably a fad. I was terribly wrong! It had enormous depth and you were really pulling for the charecters. The ending was like the rest of the book, Superb! I would reccomend this book to a child who wants to start reading or an adult who wants a free reading book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. It's exciting, mysterious, and enchanting. I love how Harry sneaks around the school at night with his cloak of invisibility. I wish I had one of those! :-) Anyway, I want to give a lot of credit to J.K. Rowling for this book. I love the extraordinary writing. The book just draws you into its magical world more and more as you read. For anyone who is thinking about purchasing this book here is some advice: BUY IT! YOU WILL LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"First, I'm not a child nor do I have children; I'm a grown woman. I can vouch for the fact that this book is for people of all ages. I listened to this audiobook and was completely spellbound--and so was my older sister.The story never drags! Even at the beginning, when more and more letters are coming for Harry, the repetition is not monotonous and overdone. It builds, getting funnier and stranger, and by the time we find out what could have been so important and so magical, it's just perfect. A lesser story would have had the first letter get through to Harry, lessening the impact.I can't rave enough about reader Jim Dale's performance. Hearing the distinctive voices of characters like Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, and especially the ghosts, read flawlessly with emotion and vigor, really brought the story alive.I've listened to a lot of audiobooks, but this is easily in the top two or three of all of them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is a very good read.Intelligent ,well written,engaging not only children but also adults.I recommend this book esspecialy to young readers who will fall in love with the wizard and his friends."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My parents, both middle school teachers in Oklahoma, introduced me to the Harry Potter Series during a long car drive. All I have to say is wow! They brought the second book on tape and left me when there were 5 chapters left in the story to hear. The next day, I went and purchased books 1, 2 and 3. I read them completely over a weekend (much to the dismay of housework needing to be done). They are imaginative and very well thought out. The books interweave details, not just build on them as most series seem to do. A minute detail mentioned in passing in book one shows to be the main plot in book three (a rat with a toe missing....). An added bonus for anyone with a little sense of mythology can be gained by tracing patterns in the book (names [Hermonine = Hermos], creatures [trolls, unicorns, goblins]).I have since introduced this series to my work place (programmers & management) and have had half my section finish past book 3 and others vying for my copy of the books.A good child's book but I doubt they will get all the subtle hints, overtones, or some vague puns of the book ( much like details/jokes of Shrek or Toy Story 2 ). Really a great read for anyone... read it to kids! You will enjoy it as much as them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I kept hearing all the news stories about this book and its hero, Harry Potter. My sister, who has kids, asked if I had read it or knew anything about it but I didn't have a clue. Thankfully, I went out and picked up a copy of this wonderful book that is appealing to both children and adults. Harry is a thoughtful kid that has been stuck, through some unfortunate events, with his hateful aunt and uncle as well as his incredibly spoiled cousin. When mysterious letters begin to arrive addressed to Harry, a new life begins to unfold for the young man that he had no idea existed. With characters that are immediately likeable, such as the bookish Hermione Granger and the towering but gentle Hagrid, J. K. Rowling takes you into the world of wizardry and witchcraft at the intriguing school known as Hogwarts. I was unable to stop reading this book, turning page after page as Rowling's delightful imagination lead me through this trip of a young man's journey into who he really is. For anyone who has ever felt like the misfit or an oddball, Harry is a character that can be easily related to. And for those of us who just simply enjoy really good entertainment, this is the book. This story is a perfect book to interest kids in reading. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Chalk up another fan in her fourties! Not until a bunch of my friends invited me out to see the Harry Potter movie did I consider reading the Potter books. But as so many before me have written, once I picked up the book I found it hard to put down. When I finished it, I started counting the minutes until it was time to head for the movie theater!Rowling's strongest credit is her imagination, of course, which is closely seconded by her writing style and character development. The physical descriptions and character summaries are so vivid that it's no wonder the movie so closely follows the book - she made that happen with her writing style. Even the snake in the zoo has a unique Rowling-given personality.I fell in love instantly with Harry, and my mother instincts took over on Page One. The treatment he got on Privet Drive broke my heart, but the feelings warmed over when Hagrid arrives and continues until Harry first enters Hogwarts. Then when Harry finally \\"sees\\" his parents ... well let's just say I've seen the movie more than once, and read the book as many times.I wish I could give Rowling herself twenty stars for this book, and for the others to come. For a first-time author, she's amazing and richly deserves all the good things her writings will bring her. She gave me back my own imagination. I want to be young again and grow up as a Hogwarts Witch!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I'm not a child, but a 27 year old mother with a college degree in literature. Not once did I feel like it insulted my intelligence. It was creative and kept me wanting more. Will I read this to my 5 year old? Absolutely. Will I worry that he will convert to witchcraft or the occult? Of course not, because he's raised in a good, Christian home. This book, nor any other book, will change good up bringing.If you're worried, as a parent read it first and then you will see the amazing fantasy that will allow you're imagination to go wild.I'm starting the next one tonight."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It starts like a modern day fairy tale. The reader is immediately sympathetic towards the orphaned Harry. Harry is a worthy, courageous, and thoroughly likeable character. The author does an excellent job of drawing the reader into adventure after adventure without tiring you out. Instead, the book proves impossible to put down. I brought the book three years ago for my nephew. What was meant to be a brief peek at the first page quickly evolved into my earnestly reading the entire book. I would recommend it to anyone. There is mystery, action, and fantasy all in this one book. There are no dull moments--and, oh, yes, it's very funny, too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This the first book of the 7 books. In the book there is some hints whats going to happen in the future. The book starts out when Harry Potter surived Who-Know-You(Voldermort). In his first year he was picked for Griffinder though the hat wanted him in Slytherin(professor snapes house)where it's history is containd with dark wizards(Voldermort)and wicthes. In diagon alley he met Professor Qurril but then his scar starts to hurt and that means danger is coming so read the book and you would see why I gave it 5 stars"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book is imaginitive,intriguing, and delightfully mysterious for people of all ages. Congratulations to J.K. Rowling for her creativity and her ability to draw the reader in and keep them on their toes until the surprising ending. I'd recommend this book to anybody, old or young"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I fell in love with this book almost from the beginning. I felt as though I was taken back to a time when my imagination was set on auto-pilot and my magical powers, although not fully revealed to me, were much greater then the abilities of my closest friends. J.K. Rowling wrote the greatest bedtime story that I have ever heard and created a world that is almost as well defined as Star Wars.In each page I lived the moments with Harry, Ron, and Hermione (whose exact name pronunciation I did not learn until Book 4 - Its Her-mee-oh-nee, for those who haven't gotten that far yet). Although the adventure has the ability to get old quickly, Ms. Rowling has injected enough reality to keep the story interesting. The characters remain close to life so that young and old can still identify with their triumphs and pitfalls.If Rowling keeps putting them out, I will keep buying them. 5 stars just isn't enough ******!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"... This book is amazing! I never read anything like it in the world! It's amazing in many ways like the thrill lurking around the corners at mid-night when Harry and his friends go spy on Professor Snape.. This book makes you want to start reading it and never stop. You also meat a lot of new characters with funny names and unique styles like Hagrid(the giant) and Hermione(the nerd). Theirs this famous wizard called Harry Potter that doesn't know that's he's a wizard or that he's famous because his parents were killed and he went to live with his uncle and aunt that are human and don't like him. His uncle and aunt know that he's a wizard, but doesn't tell Harry that. He lives with them all his life until on his 12th birthday he discovers that he is a wizard and goes to Hogwart witchcraft and wizardry. .... The book fascinated me in the way that you start reading it and you don't want to stop. I got more and more interested in the book at the time Harry was going to go to buy his new school materials. I was so interested in the book that when the book ended I felt sad. I didn't want it to end because it was so interesting, so I said to my self that I would defiantly start reading the sequels. It also seems like you're in the book with the actual characters. When Harry needs to serve his dentition in the forbidden forest to the time he sat down at the table to eat the mouth-watering dinner. The author described very well all the characters and each of their unique talents, names and styles. For example: Ronald is a good friend, strong but skinny and helps many people with there problems. The names are also very funny, like Hogwart. I recommend this book for this for every one even for adults and especially for the people who hate to read because it will make them like to read more than any thing in the this world. It's an outstanding book. If I were to give it a one through 10 I'd give it a ten plus a ten-point bonus."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"...the book...for everyone, not just children. It teaches meaningful lessons and uses metaphors and characters to describe life, in a way. For example the school that Harry goes to, every time he messes up, or does something wrong he gets points deducted from his group. Even though this is a school of witchcraft and wizardry the author still uses examples like that to describe the average life in high school. Also Harry has to deal with different types of people, and figure out how to get along with them so they wont hurt him. Narrow minded people ( his aunt and uncle) are another example of the type of characters we deal with in real life. They are against religion, and anything they don&iexcl;t understand, like magic. They punish Harry for even saying the &iexcl;M&iexcl; word. The author uses magic as a metaphor for religion in our world.The young boy (Harry) stepping into life and facing all the tricky games is set in the story in an underground place where Harry with the help of his friends goes through tricky games to get to what he wants. There is a table where there are chemicals set up on it and if Harry drinks the wrong one he will die, but if he drinks the right one it will get him to the second step of the game. There is also a part where he and his friends have to go through a game of actual life size chess. If they play smart they&iexcl;ll get to the other side, if not they will get their heads cut off by the queen. These games symbolize the logic we use to get through some problems we face. And the help of our friends and loved ones. There is another object used in the story to help Harry understand life, my favorite The Mirror! Harry finds a mirror in which he sees his family and dead parents, and they are waving at him. He thinks this is the place where his family lives, but when he calls his friends to look into it, they see different things. One of his friends sees himself much older with a trophy in his hand, so he thinks that it is the mirror of the future. The mirror shows everyone who they really want to be deep inside. Harry has never had parents and has always longed for a family, that is why he sees a happy family in the mirror.After his final test and finding who he truly is, Harry meets the oracle. In other words the professor of the school who is a wizard. He is the one that tells Harry what the mirror meant, and why all the things that happened to him happened. This book is a very clever way of showimg a boy stepping into life and growing up...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is my favorite series of all time! I am a 32 year old woman who normally reads Dean Koontz type books. JKR is the most imaginitive writer I've encountered.

He gets to challenge evil and confront his fears with the help of his great friends Ron and Hermione. Some people think this book is a bad influence and goes against the Bible because of spells and witchcraft. Harry Potter makes the right decisions and stands for what he believes in. Harry is a celebrity in the wizard world but not in the muggle world. The Dursley's, the only family he has left is ashamed of him. They treat Harry very badly, one example is he lives under the stairs most of his life and gets all the left overs of Dudley's. Just like any ordinary child, Harry also struggles in his classes on spells and potions. He also come's across great friends, one quote from the book that displays this is &quot;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends&quot;.

The characters are very well-developed and realistic. The reader is drawn in by the magical people, places, and things, and the mystery of the sorcerer's stone. The writing is incredibly well-done, with enough detail to make you feel like you're entering Harry Potter's whimsical wizarding world, but it's action-packed enough to satisfy even the most impatient readers.I highly recommend this series, and this book in particular, to all readers!-------------During this read-through I also worked my way through the book information on Pottermore, an online adventure which takes the reader through the world of Harry Potter as they read the book. I enjoyed the bonus information which Rowling provides there, and liked immersing myself in the story even more through the activities and games found there"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone introduces the amazing wizarding world of Harry Potter.

Rowling is highly prolific and creative in her writing. She puts her feelings in the character's roles and it all gets really exciting. Rowling introduces her characters in a highly imagined fantasy, and makes them behave like real life people... Harry is a wizard whose parents were killed by an evil dark lord, Voldemort. Harry had a heavyhearted past left behind. He has a way of dealing with issues while trying to cope with his insatiable curiosity. Harry gets treated in a harsh way living with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and his spoiled cousin, Dudley. But one day his life would change when a special letter arrives. This letter would bring him to a new kind of world he never thought he could ever be in... Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone startes a new outlook of life. It hooks the reader wondering what is going to happen next in every catchy chapter. One will be fortunate to discover this novel and experience reading it, going through a thrilling and action packed three dimentional adventure with Harry and all the other characters... Have fun! Also try Rowling's other two books that are sequel to the 1st book adventure: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban I personally rate both 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is a fantastic story for literally any age! Be sure to read this before the rest of the series, as the author truly uses detail to enhance the magic of the tale. Magic, valiant heroes and evil villains, staunch friendships, and wonderful mischief scamper through the halls of Hogwarts - Harry's wizarding school - as a Rowling shows you life through the eyes of a courageous young boy. At the age of 11, Harry Potter must now step up to his place of honor and danger in a world he never knew existed. While he learns to be a wizard, he also learns many other lessons that are much more important than simply how to cast a spell. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a thought out story as well as a good time. Yes, it is a book targeted for children, but as an adult I can even say that I sat, after reading it, just thinking. My mind couldn't seem to pull itself out of the captivating world of Rowling's, and I had that warm feeling that you get when the good guys win over the bad ones, and you know the world is safe until the next adventure. I can't help it. I like Star Wars and other wide epics that tell a good myth. Although I didn't start reading fantasy until after I went to college, I have become a huge fan over the years. Rowling creates a tight, quick paced story that keeps you reading 'till the end, much like Tolkien and Lewis (2 great authors)! She has really added a worthwhile series to a sometimes forgotten genera. I find myself caught up in the characters and story. My only dislike for the Harry Potter series is that it is slated to last only 7 books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I read about 1 chapter and I couldn't stop.

I have read it three times and now my dad is reading it too!

Comparable to Lewis' Narnia chronicles and L'Engle's Wrinkle series, this is an introduction to Harry Potter's world, one which you'll never want to leave! Humor and wisdom abound in this volume which will touch the souls of many readers. Already topping the best-seller list (for adults!!) in the U.K., there appears to be no age limit for &quot;Harry Potter&quot; lovers. I find it disappointing that they've changed &quot;Philosopher's stone&quot;(UK) to &quot;Sorcerer's stone&quot;(US). The former is the ultimate goal of alchemy, as explained in the book, and changing it will detract from what this stone signifies. Although the general tone is comic, the book possesses depth, perhaps because the author is a single mother who has suffered many hardships in her life. Much of the book was written in a cafe with her baby asleep beside her, because their apartment was too cold to write in."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This was the bestbook I have ever read in my life.

Orphaned as a baby, he was taken in by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon, who dote on his cousin Dudley and toss him scraps and treat him like the hired help. He is an intelligent and sensitive boy and does his best to please, but nothing is ever good enough. One day, strange and wonderful things begin to happen when a letter arrives addressed to him. Before he can read it, his uncle snatches it from his hand and burns it. The next day, owls begin to arrive with letters for Harry. More and more arrive and Vernon is driven to distraction keeping the letters from Harry. Finally, Vernon bundles them all up for a vacation. Taking them all to a small island well away from all civilization and boarding them up into a shack is not, however, enough to escape. In the middle of a howling storm, on the cusp of Harry's birthday, there is a pounding on the door until the door bursts off its hinges and a huge figure is outlined in the door. Thus we are introduced to one of our favorite Hogwarts' characters, who arrived to give Harry a special birthday message and invitation to Hogwarts - Hagrid.We are then treated to the sort of escape that so many youngsters trapped by circumstances dream of; Harry is, in fact, very special. He is a wizard - but not just any wizard. He is, in fact, the only wizard to escape a death curse by the evil Voldemort, who killed his parents. And now he has been invited to come to Hogwarts and learn magic. Thus begins one of the most beloved of the modern fiction series. I am writing this review on the eve after buying the final chapter in this series - I have not read that one yet (I'm letting my husband at it first, aren't I nice?) and it has been quite a ride getting there - but it all started here, with this young boy getting on a train and meeting a young red-headed boy named Ron Weasley and a know-it-all girl named Hermoine Granger.

The scepticism was ensconsed in my belief that anything so popular has its popularity driven by mob-mentality. Over the years I have been proven wrong as often as I have been proven right in being sceptical about things. Harry Potter, I am happy to say, was what made me start giving the popular works a fair try.What makes Harry Potter special? Are J. K. Rowling's ideas new? A search on Google, if not your own knowledge will tell you that they aren't. But it is her art of storytelling that is truly spellbinding. The statement that there is a wizarding world that co-exists with ours, the statement that very few in our world are aware of this parallel world, the statement that all our childhood beliefs about witches flying on their brooms are not entirely misplaced, the statement that magic is a science that is not obscure or arcane but is taught in certain schools - all these make very compelling reading. Throw in a growing teenage hero - someone who shows an arc of development and is far from perfect, a menacing villain and a story that gets progressively darker as our hero grows older and you have a sure winner."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"It's a really good book for both children and grown-ups.

The book finishes on a high note that has you wanting more information on the characters, the school of Hogwarts, and really leaves you wanting more from the next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed this literary work, I must point out that the characters involved bear a ~very~ close resemblance to the principle characters in the 1986 Made for TV movie entitled, \\"The Worst Witch.\\" The similarities are startling. However...I must say that I was hooked on the first few paragraphs. This work, while not necessarily well-written, is quite well conceived, with enough of an expanded vocabulary usage to warrant reading with a dictionary at your side. This is great for children who are learning, and adults who wish to increase their reading skills.The characters are developed well enough to keep us interested, but not so well as to delineate their full potential; a culpable ploy which leaves the reader wanting more.I love the magical world created by Ms. Rowling, I find the plot to be treacherously sinister, and the twists and clues are darkly intriguing. I highly recommend this entire series to anyone with an imagination.

I contains many mini adventures with Harry Potter and his Friends. This book opened my eyes up to a world unknown, i could feel the rush of greatness and intrigue pulse through my veins. I could sense the suspense build-up as i was about to trun a page. I used to hate Harry Potter, \\"It's stupid beyond belief!\\" I would tell my family and friends. Then one day i was invited to go see the first Harry pOtter movie in theaters. I decided to read the last chapter or so of of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" so I would be able to \\"show off\\" to my friends. \\"Oh he doesn't die here\\" I would say. But I then bacame touched by the christmas spirit of the stories and I became overwhelmed with the events of the story. After the movie i went to my grandma's house, not before stopping back home to grap my HP1, and sat in her living room and read the book all the way through in 7 hours non stop reading. I then tossed that book aside and got HP2 from my car and got half way thorugh it in 4 1/2 hours. I was so excited to read a good fantasy novel. I bacame a Harry Potter freak. Pencils, books, movies, calendars, soundtracks from the HP movies. I decorated my room with all the latter. I've read all the Harry Potter books at least 5 times a piece and im still going. if you love the excitement of \\"not knowing what's around the corner\\" or \\"Harry turned and was horrified at the site that lay before him\\" and any other good antured love and suspense, then these are the books for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"My opinion about Harry Potter is that a lot of imagination is included inthese chronicles.

The author made up a lot of names that were never heard before, as well as many different animals and people and put all of these fictional characters together and made a story out of it. Although I was not too fond of the book I do not think it is right to criticize it, because it's just your opinion. A lot of people may like it, and a lot of people may not , but that doesn't mean we should say bad things about it just because we don't like it. I didn't hate the book but, I'm not going to lie to you it wasn't the best book I have ever read, but I don't think that this book should be banned because kids need to use their imaginations. Like Voltaire said, \\"Think for yourself and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too.\\" It's just a book! You tell the kids to use their imaginations well, in this book they can. They can put themselves in a place that they feel comfortable in, and a place that they may like. Reading this book helps you to put yourself into the story and it's like you're really one of the characters. So... Next time you go to the library look for The Harry Potter series books!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter, a fatherless and motherless boy, has never seen a unicorn, has never heard of wizards or witches, and has not a clue what Quidditch means. The only thing that Harry has ever experience is the miserable life that the Dursley's have given him for the first ten years of his life. But everything changes when letters from no one start arriving at the Dursleys addressed to him. Also on the same day that Harry turns eleven years old, a giant of a man arrives at the place where Harry and the Dursleys are staying and tells Harry that he is a wizard and that him, Harry, has been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.At Hogwarts, Harry does not only meet new friends like Ron Weasly or Hermoine Granger, or enemies like Draco Malfoy, or learns about magic and how to fly on a broom. He also come face to face with Lord Voldemort, his life-time enemy and the person that killed his parents and tried to killed him but only managed to give him a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lighting bolt. But is Harry ready to survive this new life that has been hidden for him for a long time, and is he ready to take hold of the destiny that awaits for him...from now on?And once \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" is picked up, can it be put down? Well, I know I could not do it. The world created by JKR is the most amazing and fantastical trance. I loved every single word found in this amazing tale of modern fantasy. Harry Potter is a true hero because is he not only a wizard but a teenager with human characteristics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Book: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's StoneAuthor: J.K.

The wholloping adventures at Hogwarts and the ghastly humor of the Dursleys is enough to make this book a favorite, but who'd imagine a first year wizard playing Quidditch or for Harry to become friends with the genius snob, Hermione Granger. I prayed that Harry would leave his Muggle, or human, family and was cheering on Harry at his little meeting with the evil, dark wizard, Voldemort. The writing was ingenius and had the quality of Dahl or Tolkien. This gem should be read by everyone.

A wonderful tale of friendship and fun and mystery, it unfolds before your eyes like a, well, magic carpet. Good for boys and girls. I bet Robin Williams will be cast as Hagrid, the school groundskeeper, in the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is one of the best books I have ever read.

I've read other books that were excellent.&quot; Well, boy was I surprised when I got into it. If you haven't read Harry Potter you should, no matter what your age. I'm 14 and I loved it but I know people from age 7 to 70 that love it just as much. Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone reminds me a lot like Ronald Dahl's books, which makes it a high priority on my reading lists. They are serious, yet funny, and exciting in a suspenseful way. I have one thing to say to J.K. Rowling- &quot;You are a great writer&quot; I would never of even dreamed of coming up with a character as good a Harry.

I had recently bought the Silmarillion and I was wondering which book to read first. It was late at night and I decided to take the one which looked easiest to read: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I started reading... &quot;Looks like a good book&quot; I thought. After the first 50 pages, I wasn't Pablo any more, my imagination had taken me to Hogwarts, this new world full of magic I had discovered. I stayed up all night just because I couldn't stop reading. On the next day, I slept through one of my lessons! But it was worth it, Harry Potter books are, without any doubt, the best ones I have ever read.

From that moment on I was hooked, the time I usually spent watching television was now being spent reading this book. I was so into it only took me 2 days to finsih it. This is a great book and a superior series. Any one of any age who loves to read should get this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I own the whole Harry potter series although I have only read 2 of the books so far. I am halfway through the third as I write this. I think miss Rowling is amazing and funny with an imagination I truly admire. I would defintely recommend her Harry Potter books to anyone with children as they are nothing short of incredible. Christmas is just around the corner and I think these books would make an excellent gift for any child, of any age. I read a review on here by a miss Donna Chance who believes there is many refernces to alcohol in miss Rowling's novels. I must say I couldn't disagree more. The references she speaks of are few and far between. Don't begrudge your children this amazing series because of a few sentences which include the word *gasp* BURBON! If you are considering reading these books to your children but agree with miss Chance about the reference to alcohol simply change the word into something you like better. The alcohol really has nothing to do with the story and im sure your child will not notice. Simply tell them the dragon had to drink orange juice instead of burbon. These Harry Potter books are amazing and I'm sure your children will love them as much as I do. Thanks for your time and happy reading! Paula"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I would recomend this book to someone else if they like magical fairy tales and like interesting stories. This book was very descriptive of Harry's surroundings and the people around him.

I sure hope you'll get a chance to read this amasing book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"In all honesty, like most over-hyped things I was a skeptic about the Harry Potter novels. After a friend of mine read the first installment and loved it, I decided to read it for myself - and I am glad I did. The character's are brilliantly written and it's so action packed that you don't want to put it down. I am now well on my way to the second book. Great fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I dare say that the &quot;HARRY POTTER&quot; series will be forever embraced by children and teens and adults alike.

I have now read 3 of the 4 books and am now starting on the GOBLET OF FIRE. These series of books is the kind you want to hand down from one generation to the next. Kudos J.K. Rowling! Best books I have ever read!Eat your heart out Steven King :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Much has been made of the Harry Potter series. Here in the UK the hype has been almost at fever-pitch with the publication of the latest in the series. With all the fuss, and my nephew an enthusiastic reader of these books I thought I'd find out for myself whether the accolade was appropriate.Adults, friends of mine amongst them, have read the book for themsleves (as opposed to reading it aloud to their offspring) and while I decided I wouldn't be seen reading it on a train, I would do so in the evenings.It's very readable. Rowling manages the difficult balance between readability pitched at a young age and a fairly complex plot. My own love of literature was nurtured on Enid Blyton's Famous Five books, the style and grammatical content of which are execrable. I found this to my cost when trying to read them aloud to my children many years ago and began to realize why many libraries in the UK had banned her from their lists. Rowling's construction, on the other hand, is excellent and reads well aloud. I understand that her later novels in the series are even better, interweaving more complexity for 'older' appeal into the work. This may well encourage me to borrow the next novel from my long-suffering nephew.Rowling also doesn't fall into the trap of dishing up cheesy humour for the youngsters but opts rather more for a nascent dry humour which is more stylish and may well prepare youngsters for a more advanced appreciation of humorous literature.The characters are reasonably three-dimensional for a children's novel, and the story-line holds up well for the most part. Her inventiveness in the paraphernalia of the magic world, and in particular the game of Quidditch is particularly to be commended. There is even a moral message in this novel, one of not judging too hastily who is one's friend and who is one's enemy, an excellent topic for human cubs developing interpersonal skills without guidance.The content is, however, very British (I almost said English but she's Welsh) and I can see where some references might need explanation to American readers, but this will not detract from the novel's enjoyability.In summary, then, an excellent read for 9 to 13 year-olds, an amusing read for adults and pleasantly engaging to read aloud to young family members.A hit."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"No words!

The Philosopher's Stone makes more sense in overall mythology than the Sorcerer's Stone, but I suppose that the American publishers were afraid that Americans would not understand. How patronizing -- the book has legs like a centipede and wouldn't have any difficulty under the other name. I read a recent review in the Washington Post which called the book formulaic and fantastic. It is formulaic, definitely, but that does not diminish its excellence. The story is wonderful and the formula works like a charm. Part of the charm is in the details -- like the list of stuff that Harry has to take to school. Among other things, he needs a cauldron, pewter, size 2. A reader may then imagine a whole line of cauldrons, sizes 1 - 10, made from diverse materials such as cast iron, bronze, pewter, brass, and stone. The mystery gripped all of us, our 9-year-old daughter and her parents (almost 40 years old). This book was so much fun that we phoned relatives in England to ask them to purchase it for us before they come to visit -- we specified the two volume boxed set (only alternative is hardback of second volume) so that we could have volume one to give away as a gift. We can't wait to read Harry Potter and the Secret Chambers.

The language is great, the vocabulary amazing, and the story so real you look at people passing by on the streets and wonder, &quot;Is that one a wizard?&quot; In my sixth grade classroom, during silent reading, you look around and more than half the class - including the teacher - are reading one of the Harry Potter books.But there is a point that needs to be made. All you people who think that these books are going to make kids go out and worship the devil, get a life. We are all so biased against witchcraft: we all saw the Snow White and Wizard of Oz movies and now we assume anything with the word &quot;witch&quot; in it is bad. Rowling is simply putting a new outlook on witches. Maybe they aren't old women with green skin and crooked noses and warts everywhere. Who knows ...And you people - stop with the violence thing, okay? We know that this is a FICTIONAL story, there is no evil wizard named Voldemort, and no wizards at all. We aren't idiots! Also, Voldemort, Tom Riddle, and Peter Pettigrew are all made out to be villians, not heros or idols. They are the BAD GUYS, and we know it! If you want violence, watch the local news. Read the bible. Turn the television to MTV or WWF. There's violence.Face it! Kids aren't stupid. We know the differnce between the villian and the hero. We can tell for ourselves and we don't need theses books banned. For all you TV-nuts out there who never even read the books but critisize them anyway: Do you remember the days when you used a little thing we call IMAGINATION?All things said, this book is wonderfully written with an elaborate story plot.

I haven't had so much fun reading a book (normally I read histories and biographies) for years. Anybody, young and old, who doesn't enjoy Harry Potter and his adventures doesn't have a heart, has no imagination and never had a dream. I hope there are more Harry Potter books and they are as good as the ones so far.I have no time at all for any nonsense that Harry Potter books promote witchcraft, satanic rites, black magic, murder, mayhem, truancy, nose picking and the use of alchohol free beer. Harry Potter is a well writen, funny, entertaining story about the adventures of a kid at school. Only the terminally paranoid could turn it into an Evil Conspiracy to Destroy the World As We Know It."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Wow! This book truly inspires the heart of a young or old reader! To keep most children willingly reading, you have to have a miracle but this book does it in a snap. I couldn't put the book down for hours. J.K. Rowling has an interesting style of writing much like Roald Dahl's! Harry is a young boy whose parents died fighting Lord Voldemort (At first, he is told it was a car crash. Lord Voldemort couldn't kill him which resulted in the scar on his forehead.) He was left to live with his aunt and uncle the Dursleys and their brat of a son, Dudley. Harry finds himself unhappy longing to get away from this life. One day, a letter arives which invites him to Hogwarts School of Wizardy. He doesn't even know he's a wizard at first, but later he finds out his parents were some of the most succesful ones in the buisness. When he finally arrives at school, he is one of the most popular kids because everyone has heard of him and his mysterious lightning scar. Thoughout the story, their are strange occurences all leading up to him discovering one of his teachers is working on the dark side! He must rescue himself fighting the evil of this teacher who is really working with Lord Voldemort. What will happen to young Harry? Read the book and find out for yourself! The sequels are just as good as the first!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This book on CD came very fast in the mail. It was in perfect shape.

It is engrossing the whole way through. I found that I did not want to put this book down. J.K. Rowling has the imagination of a 4 year old, meaning as a compliment. Her creation of characters from other worlds, items from other worlds, is astonishing. I can't wait to read the next one. Thank you for such a wonderful contribution to the literary world, J.K."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"This is the British version of the story; it's a bit different and seems to be a version closer related to the film version. I very much enjoyed it, but it is not Jim Dale. I like both versions equally."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Rowling's portrayal of the setting and characters was detailed. It's a great story for younger kids or beginning readers, to get them interested in reading.
