A Novel.","review":"Dogeaters offers its postmodern readers a grand perspective on identity, its fragmentation, and importance to the individual. In a brillant fashion its interrupted narrative and wild plot (I hestitate to say plot-line)remind readers of the dangers we all face as we strive to become individuals, and that complete self-actualization might come at the cost of community. Though ostensibly about the Philippines, this is a novel of every-person living in a consumer society, dreaming the sweet dreams that come from the collective nervous center (hollywood)."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS. A Novel.","review":"I was introduced to &quot;Dogeaters&quot; through my Filipino-American Literature class at the community college that I attend. Though it was &quot;required reading&quot;, that did not put a dent in my enthusiasm to read this novel. Because I'm at a loss for words, I hope Ms Hagedorn does not think it offensive to compare &quot;Dogeaters&quot; with a pop culture movie, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Please (?!), this is a good thing! =) I thought the artistry of weaving characters and events (in my opinion, real people and places under fictional names; you're a sly one, Ms. Hagedorn!) was masterful. No one could have done the same justice at telling some parts of Filipino history. I had a difficult time trying to follow the events chronologically, but I am glad I was confused at times, so then I could go back and re-read parts. I was surprised at the detail Ms Hagedorn paid to certain events and certain (fictional?!) people, and re-reading &quot;Dogeaters&quot; made me think more about the Philippine government, specifically under the Marcos regime. History (both proud and sad) is brought to life, and it is done intelligently. Thank you, Jessica Tarahata Hagedorn. -from a reader more enlightened of Philippine history and culture after reading your book."},{"Title":"DOGEATERS.

It jumps around a lot and did nothing to shed some \\"good\\" light on the country of the Phillipines. If anything it fed the typical stereotypes about the people and culture and trying to get a good sense of the time periods it dealt with was really difficult.

Although I had never worked with pmc before, I have a few years of formal training in ceramics. I bought this book with more of an interest in technical information specifically in regards to pmc. Because I am already familiar with using clay as a medium, I was less interested in using the projects (although, I thought that the thimble was a nice idea). This book does seem to have the most techinal information compared to the other books that I have seen, but it was a pretty steep price for the amount of pages that I was most interested in.I am aggravated. I fired my first piece today in my brand new kiln. Because my piece wasn't flat, I decided to place it in a terra cotta saucer filled with vermiculite as per the author's reccomendation. When I opened the kiln after it had cooled the saucer had basically exploded at some point during firing. Nowhere is there any mention that something like this could happen, nor are there reccomended precautions to prevent this sort of thing from happening. Luckily, it looks as though that it didn't harm the kiln so it isn't the end of the world. But did it make me nervous and annoyed, and it was rather tedious to clean up the dusty mess of vermiculite.This is a good book, but like all things, has some drawbacks."},{"Title":"Working with Precious Metal Clay (Jewelry Crafts)","review":"I am slightly disappointed with this book. There are wonderful suggestions and tips given throughout the entire book, however, there are multiple projects where steps are skipped or it is assumed the reader already knows how to perform a certain task.

Save your money."},{"Title":"Working with Precious Metal Clay (Jewelry Crafts)","review":"This book has some very good techical info, including how to make rings that actually fit, but it also some major drawbacks:1) The directions on some projects have omitted steps and steps out of order, making it difficult for beginners to follow.2) The projects are not artistic, even downright amateurish, so you won't find new creative ideas here.3) There is a tendancy toward reliance on metalsmithing skills to correct problems that could have (should have!) been resolved in the clay stage before firing. This is understandable, since the author is a skilled metalsmith, but it isn't practical for many newcomers to PMC. And it isn't necessary, since most problems can easily be corrected at either the wet clay stage, or the leather-hard stage.Even with all its faults, it's still the best book out there on PMC at this time."},{"Title":"Working with Precious Metal Clay (Jewelry Crafts)","review":"There are a lot ideas on how to use PMC in this book. Some innovative some down right goofy (tea strainer). I took a PMC class and bought this book to get more ideas. It is better than the other PMC book for beginners. The pages devoted to making rings are excellent. (My instructor did not want to touch on that subject in my class) I think the best part of this book is Part Two &quot;Technical Tips.&quot; There are pages devoted to work surfaces, rehydration, using slip, extruding, carving, making holes, smoothing edges, ring sizing, mold making, shrinkage, gem setting, firing, filing and sanding, blackening the silver, and polishing. Part Three on &quot;Tools You Can Make&quot; is also helpful but basic.It's great that this book is spiral bound. However, the biggest disappointment in this book is the font size. It is annoyingly small. I would venture to say it is a size 8 or 9 at best. Why make the font so small? Surely for the price of this book the publisher could have went a little larger on the font. For that reason I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Working with Precious Metal Clay (Jewelry Crafts)","review":"I confess straight up to being a McCreight fan so maybe I am biased.

With 50 projects, there is ample opportunity for the beginner to find something that appeals and to gain confidence with this medium. Part Two is fabulous, excellent technical tips on a host of items, rehydrating, extruding, carving, ring sizing, making bails, use of patinas, and loads more. Part Three gives you the added bonus of How to make your own tools - and therefore save a few dollars. Being spiral bound is a bonus, always stays open.

The class I'd signed up for didn't start for another month, so I purchased this book. I was able to start working with the clay successfully based on what I read here, and I still refer to it.

For good or bad, Tim's books are either hated or loved. That is just the way it is. This book was published in what could be called the dark ages of the metal clay movement. It is truly a beginners book. In the sense it is for beginners and it was at the beginning of metal clay. It covers one brand of the two major players in the production of precious metal powders in a clay binder/carrier. The projects are simple, small and easy. As they should be for new people and a new medium. I can not judge the projects merit, because as with most things. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When you open it up it will lay flat on a table. The project pictures should be larger. As the PMC title is not only a descriptive generic nomenclature along with a trademark. It does cover the basics of working with the clay of both types. The tips are as always good to know. the tools are of the type that can be constructed by anybody with little handy work skills or tools. It touches the surface of a new material and what the possibilities it holds. I own it."},{"Title":"Working with Precious Metal Clay (Jewelry Crafts)","review":"I have to admit, I skipped all the projects and headed straight to the back for tips and tools.

However, about half way through the book the author felt the need to force a romance into the situation, described in formulaic bodice-ripper, romance-novel style, which was superfluous and began the descent of my star rating.

But she has no idea why her father forced his family to move every two years. Tired of hiding, she returned to the town where she grew up, Boston. One morning, she hears on the news that the body of a dead little girl has been found, and that her name was Anabelle Granger.Seargent DD Warren is the lead detective on a case where six bodies are buried in an underground pit. The pit bears a striking resemblence to the pit that Catherine Gagnon was buried in (her story was featured in Gardner's ALONE, a prequel of sorts), so Warren asks state detective Bobby Dodge to help on the case. The question is, why and who was Anabelle and her family running from, and how does it relate to the six dead girls buried in a pit.You don't really have to read ALONE to enjoy this book, but I found HIDE to be much better than its predecessor. Gardner excels at creating a mystery that occurred in the early 1980s then exploring several possible explanations and suspects. She follows the formula for this kind of novel and does it very well. The theme of abused and endangered children is once again present. Gardner must really have a passion for this subject, and it shows. Gardner is an author worth checking out. I've added her to my must read list. Males and females both should enjoy her suspense thrillers."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"\\"This is the type of thriller that has you guessing to virtually the end and has a heart-pounding conclusion! This book sucked me in from the beginning with the story of Anabelle, whose father makes her constantly move and change identities like they are in the witness protection program. This finally finishes when Anabelle becomes an adult and both her parents are dead.In the meantime a grave is unearthed that contains the remains of murdered children. Somehow, Anabelle going into hiding has some connection to this grave.The author uses interesting story telling, having Anabelle's story appear in first person and using third person when describing the two detectives investigating the case. What really gets confusing is that the case is similar to another case inolving a woman who was a girlfriend of one of the detectives investigating the case and also bears a strong resemblence to Anabelle.Gardner's confusing plotline clues only adds to the reader's difficulty in putting the book down. Don't miss this one!\\""},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Gardner is a truly talented writer. There are two requirements for a good book - great idea/plot - good writing. Gardner has both. Her use of first person is excellent, not an easy style to do well. The story itself is original and she built the plot well. It was hard to put the book down. I was sorry when it was over. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This is a definite page-turner by prolific author Lisa Gardner. In this book, she brings back two characters from a previous book, (Alone, 2005), Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren.In this story, D. D., now a Sgt. With the Boston PD is handed a multiple children's underground grave, uncovered at the sight of an old mental hospital. Trying to find who killed 6 little girls over 20 years ago is a huge task. D. D. brings in newly appointed State Detective Bobby Dodge.Along with the narrative of the investigation is the parraell story of Annabelle Granger. Her name is on one of the necklaces found in the mass grave. She comes forward with her incredible story of always being on the run, but she doesn't know who she is supposed to be afraid of. Her family led a bizarre life always moving from place to place. But she knows the threat came from Boston when she was 7.How these two stories intersect, tracking the mass killer, trying to determine who was and still is stalking Annabelle weaves a thriller that keeps one reading into the wee hours of the morning.The final chapters answer all the questions, clear up the details of Annabelle's past, and take care of the killer of little girls. But not without some scary moments for D.D. and Annabelle both. And right in the middle is Bobby Dodge, dealing with his own demons and emotions that tie him to D. D., Annabelle, and the elusive Catherine Gagnon, who also has a minor repeat role from Alone."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This was a suspenseful story that did a good job of holding my interest...the conclusion however was not particularly believable and took away from the overall quality.

I have read a number of Lisa Gardner novels and I believe that \\"Hide\\" is the best. There were plenty of twists and turns but still the author kept the main character, Annabelle, at the center of this wonderful mystery. I won't go into detail about the book as there are many already, except to add that the plot is exciting and the story will keep you turning pages. I think one of the most accurate aspects of the book was that the characters are well developed and the conclusion didn't leave any loose ends.

Lately I have been sorely disappointed by the recent efforts of Patricia Cornwell, Sue Grafton and even Elizabeth George (my former #1).Happily Lisa Gardner has written a wonderful \\"whodunit\\" that will not only keep you guessing until the end but allows you to be interested enough to want to find out the next development. She even has one of those rare books where you're sorry it couldn't go on longer.I recommmend this one highly."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Even though I'm not done with this book yet, I decided to write a review.

I read at least one other book by this author (GONE) but this one is much better. The story has kept me reading and anxious to know what will happen next. It's well written and a real page turner. Don't miss this one!!!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Detective Bobby Dodge and Detective D.D. Warren are at it again. Despite the sexual tention between them they work well together. Lisa Gardner has a way of making these two characters so real that they jump off the page. \\"Hide\\" is the second of a series and I can't wait to bite into the next one. There were so many twists and turns I didn't want to put it down.Annabelle had such a life of running and running and always wondering why. She loved her father and trusted him no matter what. The ending left me with my mouth open. When that happens then I know I just finished a darn good book."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"\\"Hide\\" is the second book in the author's D.D. Warren set. It is virtually a continuation of book one, in which state police sniper Bobby Dodge is really the main protagonist, with Warren mustering just a bit part near the end. Now, Warren has been promoted to Sergeant and is in charge of a case featuring the discovery of six corpses of young girls missing for nearly 20 years; and Bobby is now a regular state police detective assigned to work with her and the Boston PD. When newspapers report that one of the girls is probably Annabelle Granger, that young woman, very much alive, gets involved to say the least - and much of the book is about her early childhood in which her family mysteriously ran and established new identities every time her father thought they had been discovered. Suspense builds throughout the novel as both the cold case and Annabelle's circumstances slowly come to light and indeed are solved.Warren is portrayed as kind of a miserable cuss, and so far has shown no endearing qualities nor any particular talents and skills for that matter. Dodge meanwhile gets much of the attention is this story; the author seems to want him to \\"fall\\" for just about every woman he meets, which seems a little juvenile. Moreover, about a third of the tale is narrated first person by Annabelle, which at times gets a little confusing. We do feel Gardner's craft is improving and will probably give the next entry a try to see if she changes characters, maybe softens D.D. a little, and continues to spin a good yarn. As you can tell, our jury is basically still out."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Not only does Gardner write thrillers full of suspense that are perfect for listening, but her books are read by an amazing voice actor -- Kirsten Potter. Voice on an audiobook is almost more important than the book itself. A great voice actor can turn a so-so book into something special. Likewise, a boring voice can turn a wonderful book into a ho-hum, excruciating-to-listen-to DNF (did not finish). (For example, the audio version of The Hunger Games is terrible! No inflection or change in tone. I bought it on Audible without listening to a preview -- mistake -- and my students refused to listen to what they described as a \\"robot\\" reading it.)Hide is the second novel in Gardner's D. D. Warren series. This series is interesting in that D. D. is a recurring character throughout the series, but never truly a \\"main\\" character. Gardner writes her novels from various perspectives, and the audio versions always reflect that. Potter is joined by different people on each of the Gardner books I've heard, and they read varying chapters depending on the narrator. Gardner, interestingly enough, writes much of her books in third person -- the sections with Warren, anyway. First-person perspective is usually saved for a character unique to one particular book, rather than a character who appears in the whole series.In that way, Gardner's series novels almost read as standalone books. Almost but not quite, because there is some progression in plot and in character development, both of Warren and of state police officer Bobby Dodge. Dodge factored hugely into the first novel in the series, Alone. He appears again as a large part of the action in Hide.Decades ago, Catherine Gagnon was kidnapped and held hostage in an underground room dug from the earth. Her kidnapper was caught and brought to justice. Alone dealt with Catherine's present-day life and Dodge's involvement in her husband's death. In Hide Catherine is long gone to Arizona, and Dodge has returned to the police force. He and D. D. catch a case that seems hauntingly familiar to Catherine's childhood kidnapping. Several bodies are found in an underground holding cell on the grounds of an old state mental hospital. All signs point to Catherine's abductor as the culprit, but there's one small problem: he was imprisoned long before these girls disappeared.Although the bodies found is the main case for D. D. and Dodge, Gardner also includes a fabulous side story -- which, in my opinion, is actually the star of this novel. Annabelle Granger has returned to the Boston area after a lifetime on the run. Her father took their family away from Boston decades ago, and their family assumed one name after another in one town after another. After her father's death, Annabelle craves normalcy. She returns to Boston, unaware of her father's reasons for leading his family around the country. When it is discovered that a necklace on one of the girls found has Annabelle's name on it, she is pulled into a family history more bizarre than she had ever dreamed.Hide was a highly entertaining audiobook. I look forward to listening to Gardner's two latest D. D. Warren series novels this spring and summer. One thing is certain -- Gardner definitely has the ability to pull her readers into her novels and not let them go until the last word is read (or spoken). Hide kept me up nights, and probably contributed to some crazy dreams, but it was all worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I had never read anything by Lisa Andersen but had seen a review in a local newspaper, describing a new title.

When you turn over stones you don't know what you might find, and people come forward with information that has been hidden for various reasons. Not everyone is who they seem to be, and there are some surprises.This is a well written story that holds your attention, but perhaps is not for the faint of heart.

Although the author tends to repeat some of the same themes in each of her books, she puts enough twists and turns to keep you in suspense throughout the book. This one, like the others, kept me turning pages. And every time I think I have an idea of &#34;who done it,&#34; another twist comes along. If you're into suspense novels, I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm still cranking along through the series, having devoured four of the books in the past month so far."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I found this book to be an easy, enjoyable read. It pulled me in right from the beginning. It alternates between first and third person narratives which I normally find somewhat annoying but I think really added to the character development in this story.Annabelle is at the center of the mystery. Her family has been on the run as long as she can remember but from what? When her father, obsessed with keeping his family safe, dies, Annabelle is left with only questions about her past and the unknown threat from which she has spent her life running.Bobby Dodge is the detective brought into consult on gruesome discovery on the grounds of the long-defunct state mental hospital. A piece of evidence at the scene ties Annabelle to what remains of a horrible crime. Discovering Annabelle's identity and how she is related to this crime is what drew me in.The plot, while somewhat complicated, never gets terribly convoluted and things are tied up neatly in the end. I felt like the conclusion, though satisfactory, was a little rushed and a little too neat. However, the characters were enjoyable and it was a light, quick read. I'd recommend it as a great vacation/beach read. It was never slow and there is some light handed romantic interest that never goes over the top. Just enough of everything, I'd say to be an all-around good read."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"You can run, but you can't hide - at least not forever. That's what decorator Annabelle Granger learns when, after 25 years of changing homes and changing names, she returns to Massachusetts where all the madness began. It's obvious to Annabelle that her parents were protecting their family from something or someone, but never once did they reveal the reason why, and now both have died. Shortly after establishing herself in Boston, Annabelle reluctantly becomes involved in helping the police with a 20 year old serial killer case. The deeper they delve, the more danger she's in.Author Gardner manages to spring a few surprises in this thriller. Ultimately, the resolution owes more to luck (bad luck) than to solid evidence, but the ending is fairly satisfactory. Read this and you'll never view an abandoned mental institution in the same light again!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Lisa Gardner's work is most easily classified within the thriller genre. But in her new novel, she infuses a solid, complex mystery into the plotline, nicely balancing excitement --- make that terror --- with whodunit elements to create a work easily accessible to fans of any genre. HIDE is much more than a nominal sequel to ALONE; it is a deliciously creepy tale that begins with a crime scene so startling and horrific that it resonates throughout the book.HIDE marks the return of Massachusetts State Police Detective Bobby Dodge and his former partner, Boston Police Detective D.D. Warren. Despite Dodge's newly minted position, Warren brings him into a Boston investigation. The crime scene --- a vision of nightmares that will shut you down --- is reminiscent of the Richard Umbrio case that figured so prominently in ALONE. As the result of evidence found at the current scene, one of the victims is tentatively identified as Annabelle Granger.Thus, Dodge and Warren are baffled when a woman shows up in their office and identifies herself as Granger. She relates the story of a life lived on the run, with her family changing residences and identities on an annual basis, crisscrossing the country as if being pursued by an omnipresent, unknown tracker.Dodge and Warren's investigation is further complicated by the fact that Granger bears an uncanny, startling resemblance to Catherine Gagnon, who as a child was one of Umbrio's kidnapping victims. Gagnon grew up into an exotic, enigmatic lady who may have manipulated Dodge into shooting her husband.Another issue is the slowly blossoming, if reluctant, attraction between Dodge and Granger. Dodge struggles with the impropriety of a relationship with a subject he is charged with protecting, and possibly investigating. Granger finds that she is experiencing emotions long gone cold, if ever felt at all.Gardner keeps the plot wheels slowly but steadily moving toward a cataclysmic conclusion that ties up the apparently irresolvable plotlines with a plausible and unpredictable explanation.While built upon the foundation of ALONE, HIDE stands firmly on its own. Primarily character driven --- the crime scene at the beginning is over two decades old, and most of the violence in the book is confined to one scene --- HIDE is part puzzle, part romance and all good. Don't miss this one.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Bobby Doyle is a Mass. State Police Detective. He's called out to the scene of a gruesome mass murder that took place in the grounds of the old State Mental Hospital. Six bodies of children are found in an underground chamber. It is estimated that the crime took place over twenty five years ago.One of the bodies is identified by a chain around her neck wih the name Annabelle Granger. However, a woman who read about the crime told police that she was Annabelle and that she had given the locket to her friend, Dori Petracelli, when she was seven years old.Annabelle also bears a striking resemlblance to Catherine Gagnon who Bobby met at a hostage scene. When she was younger, she had been captive in an underground chamber but was rescued by hunters who heard her cries. Later, in the hostage scene, events occurred that saved Catherine but Bobby questioned if the entire scene had been staged and that he may have been set up.The reader learns the background of why Annibelle had been targeted by a preditor and what happened next.Bobby Doyle is a well described character. He is brave but has a conscience and worries if his actions are always the most appropriate. He is easy to sympathize with and enjoy.Lisa Gardner creates suspense as if she were a chef, putting the ingredients together for a feast. The momentum increases as we near the conclusion of this well crafted plot. In addition, the author gives her readers a surprise toward the end which pulls everything together in a professional manner.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This was my first Lisa Gardner book, and I read it quickly. It was fast paced, interesting--a real page turner. However, the ending made absolutely no sense. Another reviewer termed it perfectly: \\"contrived.\\" It was as if the author had run out of steam and needed to finish the book, so she threw something out there. *SPOILER ALERT*--What frustrated me the most was how Annabelle's highly \\"intelligent\\" father, was unable to track down his brother after he shot him in the head. Also, it would seem that someone shot in the head would probably suffer brain damage, so why would \\"Russell\\" think that his brother was still a threat, and instead of running from \\"Tommy,\\" why not search for him?! But the most illogical \\"surprise,\\" was how \\"Ben\\" coincidentally found Annabelle and \\"knew\\" it was her. Non-sensical, I say! Other than the disappointing ending, this was a good read."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Here's a suspense novel that lives up to the word. Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren, the two main cops in Gardner's series, are called to the grounds of a mental hospital where a grim discovery has been made--the secret underground lair of a long-ago serial killer of little girls. The hospital was closed years ago, and the killer was never caught. The gruesome evidence in the bunker includes an old locket on the remains of one victim. The name on the locket is Annabelle Mary Granger. Imagine their surprise when a grown woman arrives at their police station, claiming to be the owner of the locket! That's just the beginning of this gripping mystery, and believe me, things are going to get even more exciting. (Did I mention that the killer was never caught?)This is the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner, and she has a new fan. If you love thrills and chills as much as I do, lock the door and bolt the windows and settle in for a fascinating read. But remember--there's nowhere to HIDE."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I enjoyed the book but found it implausible that instead of unfolding the truth with all the facts in place, new information was added when convenient to make the action plausible. That was the biggest let down. The new info wasn't added in a creative way that added to the storyline. New info was just thrown in toward the end - like an unstable uncle that we never heard of before."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"The author maintains her high level of twists and turns in her latest novel.

Once her mother dies, Annabelle chooses their next place, Boston. Her father is dead within 18 months. 10 years later, still in Boston, Annabelle is single, lives with her dog; too paranoid to have other friends besides the UPS man. State Detective Bobby Dodge gets called on a gruesome case, the discovery of six dead girls on the grounds of what used to be the Boston Mental hospital. Many story threads tie into one as the task force tries to locate the killer. Overall this novel has all the right elements for a terrific novel to recommend. The one minor fault was the ending, which felt weaker than the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"The opening chapter of Lisa Gardner's \\"Hide\\" grabs the reader's attention immediately. A first person narrator named Annabelle Granger recalls the horrifying day when her father, a professor of mathematics, tells her to pack her two favorite possessions, since she and her parents must leave town. They flee to Florida, and subsequently the Grangers keep relocating, always assuming new identities and making new acquaintances. The little girl grows up in fear; her increasingly paranoid father insists that Annabelle learn self-defense, and he teaches her to constantly look over her shoulder. After the death of both her parents, Annabelle decides to settle in Boston, where she lives a reclusive life with her dog, Bella. However, Annabelle is not destined to enjoy a peaceful existence for very long.Someone makes a grisly discovery on the grounds of a former mental hospital in Mattapan: the mummified and bound remains of six little girls, who have been underground for decades. Former police sniper turned Massachusetts state detective Bobby Dodge and tough Boston Detective D. D. Warren are members of the task force investigating the crimes. The murder scene is reminiscent of an old case that Bobby remembers all too well--that of Catherine Gagnon, who at the age of twelve was abducted and abused for a month before she was miraculously rescued.Gardner frequently switches back and forth between Annabelle's voice and the third person; the change in perspective is often jarring. By far the most effective chapters are the ones that Annabelle narrates. She is a fiercely independent and courageous woman who remains loyal to her father, although she admits that she bitterly resented him for uprooting the family so often. Annabelle is soon involved with the Mattapan case, since there seems to be a connection between her, the dead girls, and Catherine Gagnon. In the midst of all this angst, a bit of romance may be in store for Bobby Dodge. The hunky detective, who was once involved with Catherine and D. D., now finds himself attracted to the lovely Annabelle.\\"Hide\\" has an intriguing premise and Annabelle is a sympathetic character who has suffered more than her share of anguish. Gardner builds suspense by raising a number of questions that are not answered until the very end: Why did Annabelle's father uproot his family so often? Was he right to be frightened or did he have a hidden and more sinister agenda? What is the link between the victims found in the pit at the mental hospital and Catherine Gagnon? Unfortunately, the answers to these and other questions turn out to be extremely far-fetched, and as the book draws to its disappointing conclusion, the plot becomes more and more contrived. Gardner tried to do too much in this book and the various elements of her overheated plot ultimately fail to converge in a satisfying and cohesive way."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This author follows a very standard template for a mediocre thriller. The story starts off with holes and they don't get filled in when you get to the end.The plot: Thin and as a reader, you are almost certain that there is no way there can be a complete resolution as you get to the end, and sure enough- there isn't. A girl is living on the run with her family. As an adult, she wonders if she has any connection to a murder scene in which her childhood best friend lost her life. Obviously, during this exploration, she has an affair with the lead detective on the case (as I said... very standard template... *yawn*).The whole book, the reader is being set up: who is stalking this woman, why, what is her her connection to these prior murders. Unfortunately, the resolution is slapped onto the page as simply as, \\"__________ is the stalker because he's crazy.\\" The \\"how\\" is never answered. This is infuriating considering that as the reader, you put faith in the author that things will make sense at the end. Trust me, it doesn't.The short story:If you're looking for a story with a resolution, you're better off watching reruns of The Cosby Show."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Lisa Gardner's book Hide was a real page-turner.

But, she can't let them think it's her body that has been in that vault all those years. And that is how she meets new homicide detective Bobby Long. After being called in by former partner and lover, D.D. Warren, Bobby is up to his ears in details and speculation. The last thing he needs is a woman claiming to be Annabelle Granger coming into the office. Especially when she looks almost exactly like the woman that almost got him killed not so long ago, Mrs. Catherine Gagnon. But she's telling the truth, and he knows it. And when she tells the story of her life on the run, he knows that she needs his help. The most important thing he knows, however, is that he needs her help to figure out what happened to not only her family, but the six girls found in that vault.This was one of the best Lisa Gardner books I've ever read.

I like her writing style. Hide was a good book for me to start with. I found the writer did a great job at detailing the characters. Some of the story was narrative while, at other times, it was not. I didn't think it was hard to tell the difference but I have read some reviews that thought it was. The stroy line was suspensful and kept you guessing right up until the end.

Her since cautious life, including assuming an alternate identity, Tanya Nelson, and learning martial arts, starts to unravel as she is drawn into this crime scenario that has similarities to one where twelve year old Catherine Gagnon was held underground and brutalized for thirty days before being miraculously discovered some twenty-seven years prior.Annabelle has the good fortune to have Bobby Dodge, former police sniper and now state police detective, assigned to the case and take a very personal interest. The fast-moving plot revolves around the crime scene on the large grounds of a long-closed hospital for the mentally disturbed and former patients and employees of the facility. Intriguing to Dodge is the uncanny resemblance that Annabelle has to the older Catherine. Is that mere coincidence?The book is both interesting and plausible, with just enough misdirection, though the ending constructed by the author is not overly ambitious, perhaps predictable. The obvious attraction of mild-mannered hunk detective Bobby Dodge to D.D, Catherine, and Annabelle could have been more vigorously pursued. The book is another very good offering by the author, maybe not her best, but the nonetheless very good."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Have read a few of Gardner's books and this is easily the best of them. One of those books was Alone which also had a few of the characters from this novel. Although this novel could easily be read as a standalone novel I would recommend reading Alone first as paragraphs in Hide do give away key plot points of that novel. You'll also have a greater understanding of the characters who are back again if you read Alone first. They are both great reads.I actually don't know why Gardner didn't just use fresh characters as the plot from Alone paid no real part for Hide's plot but as I said by using that novel's characters she does give away parts of that storyline and ultimately some of the reader's enjoyment if they chose to read that after.In Hide ex sniper but still Massachusetts state cop Bobby Dodge is contacted by his ex, who is homicide detective for the city. She takes him on a tour of a new crime scene where six mummified little girls are found in an underground chamber on an ex mental hospital's grounds. Annabelle Granger's father has had her changing identities for most of her life and upon learning one of the victims was wearing a necklace with her original name on it she decides to tell the police the bizarre tale of her life. Soon it becomes apparent the necklace used to be hers, she gave it to her childhood friend who disappeared not long after her family did. Was she meant to be the victim?

I picked up Lisa Gardner's Hide before I left on a trip, and it was an enjoyable diversion. It started a bit slow, but the longer I read the less I put it down...Annabelle Granger is a young woman who has spent all of her life on the run. From what, she doesn't know. Her father was convinced that someone was after them, and as such Granger lived in many different places under a variety of names. Even now, after her family is all gone, she's still secretive and cautious about everything. She finally decides that she has to figure out what happened in her childhood when a murder case mistakenly identifies her as one of the victims. The real victim was her best friend growing up, and the only clue to her identity was a locket with Granger's name on it. Granger turns to the police and Bobby Dodge to start sorting through the meager clues as to who might have killed her friend, and whether that is somehow related to one of her many relocations. As the investigation continues, Granger starts getting anonymous contacts from a stalker. That means that her past (which she still doesn't understand) is catching up with her, and she's not sure who can be trusted. It's a race to see whether the killer(s?) can be found before they carry out their final obsession with Annabelle...The book started off (for me, at least) a little on the slow side. You're immediately thrown into one of her childhood relocations where she has to leave nearly everything behind. Then when you jump to the present, you're somewhat unsure as to how all that relates. Even once you figure out the basic reasons why they moved so often, it's still unclear as to why the father was so obsessed with the secrecy. But once the police accept her story as one of the few leads they have, things start picking up nicely. There's a lot of interplay between Granger, Dodge, and a couple of other characters from a prior novel (Alone). Hide stands alone fairly well, but knowing the history of the players makes for a deeper level of understanding. And if you like plot twists and red herrings, then you'll love this story. You pretty much have to get to the end to figure out everything...A nice summertime read when you just want to disengage from anything requiring effort or work..."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I have read all of Gardner's books, and I honestly believe that HIDE is her best.HIDE brings back Bobby Dodge from ALONE and tells a great story that while complex and intricate, is not so confusing that the reader loses interest. I was thoroughly engrossed in the story and felt that Gardner did a great job defining her characters and created a great, suspenseful mystery. Just when you think she's tossed in a few red herrings to throw you off track, it all comes together. She had me completely surprised at the end.Gardner does a good job encapsulating the story from ALONE into HIDE, although I would recommend reading ALONE first if you have not done so."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Six mummified corpses are discovered in a makeshift tomb beneath the ruins of a former mental institution more than twenty years after their disappearance.

When Boston P.D. uncover an underground pit containing the bodies of six young girls, the similarities to the case in book one are too familiar not to notice. Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren are partnered up to investigate. Not only will this take them back to the persons concerned with the first case but also introduce them to a young woman who has spent her entire life on the run and she doesn't even know why.This was a thrilling, exciting read and introduces D.D. Warrren as a main character for the first time. More time is spent on fleshing out her character and introducing us to this smart, tough, acerbic detective whom we only briefly met in book one. The case is full of twists and turns and only slowly reveals information as it unravels making it virtually impossible to completely solve on your own until near the end. One can guess who the \\"bad guy\\" may be, but the full motive and reasoning is only slowly unwound. With the setting taking place on the grounds of an old abandoned mental hospital the atmosphere is perfect for the cast of suspects who include former patients and staff, to name a few. Since I started with book 3, this one is much more what I'm used to and better than book one *but* the plot is closely tied to Alone and they should be read in order, as Hide is full of spoilers for Alone. Good creepy story!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I love to pick up a Lisa Gardner book and start reading. I know she's going to ask questions, and never let up on the suspense until the very end. Hide is no exception.The story starts out with a woman, Annabel, wondering if she'd taken the right things with her when she's asked to move as a child of seven. Her father, an MIT math professor tells his daughter that she can only take 2 things. From Boston, the family moves to Florida, where the father gives everyone a new name, and he gets a job driving a taxi. Little by little, Gardner lets the clues out, leading her readers down a path of suspense, without ever letting them guess 'who-done-it'. At least I can never figured it out.In this story, we have Bobby Dodge, and might I say this is one of Gardner's most intriguing characters. The kind of guy you wished would come to your door asking you to be a potential witness. I'd be making things up just to keep him around.Then you have D.D. Warren, a woman all of us wish were could be. She smart, tough, capable, and great looking, and of course, she and Bobby had a thing years back. D.D. is called onto the case where an underground den with the bodies of six young girls mummified in plastic bags, are laid out on two shelves. One of the girls wears a silver locket that has the name Annabel on it. Imagine Annabel's surprise when she recognizes the locket as one she gave to her best friend just before the move to Florida?Because this story involves the characters from Alone, Katherine Argon is involved. How Gardner meshes her two stories is amazing and totally unpredictable. It's like Gardner likes to paint herself in corners just so she can use her considerable gift as a writer, to pull the story back out.I read this story in 2 days which is no record for me. If I pick up a Lisa Gardner novel, I'm doomed to a few sleepless nights until I can know what's happening to characters I love. And that's what makes Gardner so good at her job, that, and the way she gets all the police lingo and procedures down.

Even though I saw this was part of a series, I decided to give it a try. Once I started reading, I was instantly pulled into the story. For the most part, I liked all the characters and I thought the way the author used the police department meetings to catch the reader up on what was going on in the case was clever. It saved the reader from having to read a lot of background story. My only semi-complaint was that I didn't think the budding romance between two of the characters was necessary. I also didn't think the story line about the character Catherine Gagnon added much, but decided this may have been a plot thread left over from a previous book.

Because the bodies have been preserved by a process called wet mummification, identification of the victims is delayed, so Dodge and Warren are surprised when a young woman shows up at the police station and claims to be one of the people who has been tentatively identified as one of the victims.Annabelle Mary Granger has been raised on the run. Her father, a former MIT mathematics professor, moved Annabelle and her mother from town to town, adopting new identities with each move. Annabelle never understood why, but she knows somehow that the gruesome discovery on the hospital grounds has something to do with it. With both her parents long dead, Annabelle wants to find out why she spent her childhood on the run. Plus, she wants to clear her father's name because Warren and Dodge find her father's actions to be highly suspicious.Annabelle is a good, strong character who is determined not to be pushed around. The interplay between Warren and Dodge gets a little annoying at times-- Warren thinks that Dodge is becoming too personally involved with Annabelle in a pattern consistent with an earlier case when he let a woman involved in a case manipulate him into shooting her husband. Since she pretty much ignores his input throughout the entire book, I'm not sure why she bothered bringing him into the investigation in the first place.I really enjoyed this book until the ending, which was just too contrived to be believable.WARNING!!! SPOILER ALERT!!!Okay, absolutely the only reason I can think of for the unveiling of the volunteer preacher as serial killer Christopher Aiello (excuse spelling- I listened to the audio version of the book)is so Bobby Dodge and DD Warren would have a reason to turn around and drive in a madcap dash to Annabelle's apartment to rescue her from Ben, the UPS driver who was actually her evil uncle Tommy. They certainly would never have tumbled to Ben/Tommy if Jackson had not laid it out on the silver platter for them.Okay, so here's another major problem: The killer shows up outside Annabelle's apartment and leaves a \\"gift\\" for her in the middle of the night. Bobby is so concerned about Annabelle's safety that he makes plans to move her to a hotel room, but then he leaves her alone while she packs her bags because he and DD have to go and investigate something. Well duh! Of course, the killer comes by, just as Annabelle conveniently goes down into the basement of her apartment building to get her 5 suitcases out of storage and leaves her stun gun in the storage closet while she pulls the luggage upstairs. At that point the completely competent Annabelle, who has been practically brainwashed in self defense techniques by her father, forgets everything she ever learned about how to protect herself. Let the killer maneuver her back upstairs into her apartment? Sure, why not? Let the killer get between her and the door? Absolutely! Refuse to leave the apartment when she has the chance because the killer will surely stay behind to finish killing her dog instead of chasing after her? Oh yes, absolutely!In the meantime, DD and Bobby have figured out that the street preacher is actually the serial killer and are frantically driving back to Annabelle's apartment to warn her. Bobby tries to call Annabelle to warn her but she doesn't answer the phone (gee, I wonder why?) So Bobby stomps his feet, swears in frustration, rants and raves and finally jumps out of the car to run the rest of the way to Annabelle's apartment. Um, I have to wonder why it never occurs to Mr. Hotshot Detective or the equally Hot Shot Sergeant Warren that they can use their phones to call for back up and send someone to Annabelle's apartment to assist her.I actually groaned out loud when this series of events started because I'd been enjoying the book so much until it devolved into this contrived little piece of stupidity. Come on folks, I understand that as a writer it is frustrating to write yourself into a corner because you've made your characters so competent that they don't need to be rescued, but can you at least make your \\"rescue scenarios\\" more plausible and consistent with your characterization? Or, better yet, quit relying so much on the rescue scenario to begin with! Would it have hurt anything if Annabelle had competently fought against her evil Uncle Tommy for control of the stun gun and finally subdued him? It certainly would have been more fair to Annabelle and to the reader."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I had not read any of Lisa Gardner before that I recall, She does a nice job of weaving sub plots into the main theme, and the summary of who-done-it was feasible and surprising - not the obvious."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"It took a chapter or two, but this book hooked me.

I also recently read \\"Shadow of Death\\" by Patricia Gussin, a great mystery novel that also has a medical angle to it. I recommend both of these books!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Everything is a \\"system\\" according to young Annabelle, her current name, who lived a family life but never knowing where or how that \\"system\\" might turn out. Her father tells Annabelle, that she has very little time to gather up any two of her possessions immediately and leave in their automobile for parts unknown. She was devastated as she had so many possessions that meant so much to her, making it almost impossible to select only two items!They took off for Tampa and changed their names as they adjusted to another way of living and new friends, but don't ever make too many friends since we \\"might have to leave again.\\" Annabelle, or whatever name she would use next, did not understand why they had to move so often and so quickly. Every time she was just told to gather her choice of two things and then get in the car and off they would go. No way to make friends long enough to call them good friends. But unknown to her father Annabelle did make one real good friend before the moving all started. Her name was Dori Petracelli.The mother picked the names they would go by in the next town and the father would get identification containing that name for the entire family. One day she came home to find her mother face down on the couch, dead, with many prescription bottles spread around her. Once the mother was cremated, Annabelle and her father had small lockets containing some of the ashes, with the rest of the ashes thrown in the wind. Then it was time to leave again and the daughter was allowed to choose the city they would move to once again. She chose Boston, their original city that she loved so much. The locket would eventually become a part of her future life.At age 22, her father was killed when hit by a car and she realized she was on her own finally and could make her own decisions where to live, work, and what to do with her life. One day she picked up the newspaper and discovered that she was dead. At the age of 25, she was dead but she knew she was very much alive.Enter into the scene Boston Detective D.D. Warren and an old friend of hers, Massachusetts newest state police detective, Bobby Dodge, as they are thrown together to investigate an incident that Bobby had been associated with years before. They worked together reluctantly at first as they tracked down killers leading all the way back to a mental hospital that was now closed. Annabelle Mary Granger took herself to the Boston Police Department to prove she was alive. Thus a connection with DD and Bobby that lasted for some time as they worked together to solve Annabelle's family's strange living all those years and why she was reported \\"dead!\\".The well-flowing story goes on to follow Annabelle through the rest of her life as she learns of her past and how and why the many life changes occurred. She and DD and Bobby work together and Bobby gets to know Annabelle a bit more than he possibly should. You will not be correct if you try to guess the results of each and every turn that she endured and how it ended.\\"Hide\\" is a real page-turner that I enjoyed thoroughly. I have enjoyed books written by Lisa Gardner and this one, in my opinion, is one of the best. The interaction between the Boston Police Department and Bobbie coming in to assist becomes strange at times but very enjoyable.

She also strikes me as insecure - not \\"hard ass.\\" I prefer Dodge. I like how he bucks the system and performs his job in the gray area. I like how he takes calculated risks. Risks that are not devoid of plausibility. I only recently stumbled upon Lisa Gardner as an author, and I have to say, while Warren irks me, Dodge provides a balance and maintains my interest.I think Hide trumped Alone (although don't get me wrong I like Alone too), I couldn't read Hide fast enough, it was all I could do NOT to turn to the end. Hide did not just draw me in, it yanked me in. I couldn't put it down. Every spare minute I was on my Kindle, even while cooking dinner, waiting in line at Target. The amount of detail provided is SPOT ON. Enough to give you a perfect visual, but doesn't drown you in unnecessary/irrelevant details.The best part - this novel is NOT predictable. Just when I thought I had it figured out, I was wrong, then when I thought I had it figured out again...again I was wrong. I like that. There were plenty of unexpected twists, that I personally found genuinely jaw-dropping. The end never disappoints, other than the fact that its over. I look forward to reading others.

Keep 'em coming, Lisa."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Former police sniper Bobby Dodge decided after the traumatic events of ALONE that his career needed to take a new direction. He decided to finally take the detective exam and leave the split second decisions that his previous assignment had required to some one else. On his first assignment as a detective he was called in to assist on a case headed by none other than D. D. Warren, a friend and former lover. An underground chamber had been found on the site of a closed mental health facility, a chamber filled with the bagged remains of six young women, a chamber with disturbing similarities to the one used by the psychopath that had figured in ALONE. Was this some of his work? Too bad he could not be questioned about the crimes. The best clue they had was a locket engraved with the name on one of the victims. Too bad the owner of the locket appeared in police headquarters to announce that she was very much still alive. She told Bobby and D. D. a story though that added confusion to the case. When she was a young girl mysterious packages arrived for her, left by an unknown stalked. Her parents decided that in order to protect her they needed to run away, and so from the time she had been seven every few months she had a new identity in a new town, always hiding from some unknown danger. Finally as an adult she had gone home to Boston, thinking that after all these years there could not possibly be any more danger. Bobby and D. D. did not know what danger the parents had feared, or if it had passed. What they did know was that the young woman bore a striking resemblance to Catherine, the woman who had nearly destroyed Bobby's career.This is an intriguing story, an exciting thriller that will keep the reader turning pages far into the night to see what will happen next. There is a strong tie in to the previous book, ALONE, as so while it is possible to read and enjoy this novel with out reading the earlier story in order to fully appreciate this novel read the two books in order."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Don't even think about reading the last chapter to see \\"who did it\\"!

So, if you try like I did to cheat and find out the culprit, even after I found out the name of the character -- I didn't know who he was -- I had to read the book in order to find out what part he played in the plot.This book kept me reading well past bedtime and then I wished I hadn't because I saw shadows that kept me awake.

Told in two perspectives: First person by Annabelle Granger, a young lady who spent a decade running with her mother and father from an unknown threat and third person from Bobby Dodge, a Boston detective with a troubled past.Though this is my first Gardner book, I had no problem following the characters most of whom I'm assuming were in the previous book. The author did a great job filling in the backstory of the various players. If anything, she may have gone a little overboard one example being a minor character's dying mother and another's newborn baby. Still, the pacing was good and kept me reading through to the end.The ending satisfying if not a little tidy."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This is the second in this series, I am really enjoying reading these books.

I love murder/thriller/suspense novels, and this one takes the cake. I have not read any other books by this author, Lisa Gardner, but I plan to now.The character development in this book was great. The author's ability to twist and turn the novel's plot was fantastic. I never knew who the killer was going to be, and was completely surprised by the ending. \\"Hide\\" is exciting! The excitement comes from the characters, their personal struggles, and the plot's ending.Like other reviewers here, I am unsure why it is called a \\"D.D.

Her life comes full circle when she returns to where it all began in Massachusettes.The story is written in first and third person, it keeps you guessing and I was on the edge of me seat waiting and trying to figure out who was trying to get her throughout the book....Don't hide out, go and get this one."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"... I don't usually like suspense written by women (sexist, I know, especially since I write suspense and thrillers myself), but the premise had promise, so I picked it up. I didn't think I would like the first person/third person flip-flopping either, but I did. The first paragraph hooked me. The first chapter compounded that hook, and I found myself immersed in a book I thoroughly enjoyed. The first third-person chapter was a little slow. It took me a while to get the feel of Bobby, but once I did, I really found myself fond of him. D.D. and I never did get to know each other well while reading this book, but I understand she's been in other novels by this author, so I might get to know her better in other ways. Annabelle, though, was real to me. She was a solid character, and though some are saying that her past is not very believable, I tend to be able to suspend my disbelief as that of a child who can't remember everything and a police investigation and witnesses that only know part of the story. As Annabelle herself said, she may never fully know or understand everything her father did or had to do, so the best they can do is fill in the blanks.If I have to get to a weak point, it would be the Charlie character and the agreement with others about 'Ben', and how that was just an accidental happening. I suppose... suppose that could happen, and it's definitely not completely impossible in the probability spectrum, but the likelihood... the odds... are astronomical.Even so, I'm usually pretty good at figuring out the endings of suspense novels, and authors usually give too much away anyway, and though I had mostly figured this one out, the author did keep me wondering if I was right until close to the end. While I was right, I did find myself wondering if I was wrong. I like when an author can do that, and recently, not many authors have succeeded. Lisa Gardner succeeded.Another thing I liked about it was the speed. It was a fast-paced novel. I didn't find a lot of places where it dragged, where I wished it would hurry and get somewhere. She had good word economy, just enough description to let me set a scene in my head but not so much I found I wanted to skip over things to get back to the story. I could have used fewer ellipses, though I realize this helped to punctuate the character's thoughts, but it came across as author intrusion to me.I was debating between a four star or a five star, and the truth is, it's worthy of more than four, but not quite as good as a full five stars, but close, so I went with five. For a fast read thriller, with just enough suspense and a little romance thrown in, this is a great read for those who like this genre. I'm looking forward to reading Ms. Gardner's other books now."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I was intrigued by the plot but disappointed in the writing style. The change of main characters from first to third person could have been done better. Like most mysteries nowadays, the emphasis is on ending twists which fail in too many books I'm reading these days. Two viable suspects was not enough to work through this ridiculous finish. The last chapters spoiled the whole book with an improbable conclusion. The police procedural was fine, the story was interesting but it should have been a better book."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Gardner had me wrapped up in the story until the big revelation. At the revelation, I laughed. I don't think that was the intended reader response, so I would say that blew it for me. I must say, though, it was fast paced and kept me reading to figure out the mystery(s). This was my third Gardner book. I read The Perfect Husband, which I loved. Then, I read Alone. Personally, I prefer romance with my suspense books, and Alone had none, but it was a good story and I really liked the character of Bobby Dodge. So, I was excited to read his follow-up story where he would get a romance. Well, the romance was not really enough to talk about, just kind of a teaser. The character of Bobby was rather a bore in this one. The ending was just too over the top and then the whole Catherine Gagnon returning was a let down. I really expected more out of that subplot.Having just finished Count to Ten by Karen Rose and Speak No Evil by Allison Brennan, which were excellent romantic suspense books, Hide was a disappointment. I will stick with Rose, Brennan, Sala, and Barton for great romantic suspense."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Lisa Gardner sold her first novel when she was just 20 years old.

Showed promise for a really strong heroine. That fizzled toward the middle.Found the ending extremely frustrating. Why wouldn't a woman so highly trained in martial arts use those skills instead of just throwing things? Why throw her wounded dog at the villain instead of delivering a good kick to the groin followed by, say, a heel to the nose? (Nothing like bone splinters in the brain to stop an opponent in his tracks.) Why *throw* her dog at the villain when protecting said pooch seemed paramount to her?Passive heroine. Can't say she did much to help herself throughout the book. She showed a serious lack of guile when she needed it most.This calls for a Carol O'Connell novel just to get a \\"strong heroine\\" fix, if not for the pure joy of reading her. (Now that's an author who writes strong female characters!)But this is only my second Lisa Gardner novel. Modern day assembly-line demands on authors can wreak havoc with creativity and quality, so I'm keeping Lisa on my TBA list."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"A singer and actress both off and on Broadway, Maggi-Meg Reed has also appeared in experimental theatre. Her voice, arresting and dynamic, is also heard on numerous TV and radio commercials. She has lent her talents to many audiobooks including The Time Traveler's Wife (an Audie finalist), and The Last Nazi.Suspense and drama are heightened in both the Abridged and Unabridged versions of Hide due to the uncommonly good readings by Maggi-Meg Reed who leaves listeners a bit breathless with excitement as the story ricochets to its startling conclusion.Lisa Gardner (Alone and Gone) has fashioned a chilling, complex thriller that interweaves several mysteries. A cache of mummified bodies, six to be exact, is discovered on the grounds of an abandoned mental hospital. Police detective Bobby Dodge is called to the scene to find one clue in this underground burial site - a silver locket bearing the name Annabelle Granger. This is a woman who has spent her life to date running and hiding, but why and from whom?In order to delve into the past and solve these crimes Bobby is thrown with his former lover, D. D. Warren.

Why would the Boston PD work a case 24/7 to exhaustion when it was 20 years old?? Why would the BPD forensics team give NO information on the bodies to the investigators for weeks?? Why would a good cop who had been in trouble for getting romantically involved with a previous victim jump right in and get romantically involved with another victim? How does a woman who had been paranoid and watchful her entire life suddenly trust an old man who coincidentally meets her on the street? Why would the police swarm the woman's apartment when the killer leaves a gift at her door, then beg and plead for her to move because she's not safe there, then leave her completely alone so that the bad guy can visit her? Why can't a woman who has trained for years in martial arts and survival not take down a wheezing 60 year old man with a switch blade in a ridiculously staged fight scene? I just shook my head in disbelief as the novel continued. I can't stand lazy writers who just force situations because they can't come up with plausible schemes to carry the storyline. I was very disappointed. I listened to this as a book on CD and also didn't like the reader who for the first half of the book read the material with a bored tone in her voice! I hope her other novels are better crafted than this one."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This is a good to very good psychological suspense novel. I would give it 3-1/2 starts if I could, but 4 is fairer to my overall impression than 3 would be. Before commenting on the writing, let me first praise the audio book performance by Maggi-Meg Reed, who speaks with clarity and differentiates her voices well but not enough to distract attention from the words.The premise of the book is good, and the writing is very effective. A young girl, known to us primarily as Annabelle, is dragged by her parents from city to city, identity to identity, on the run from something ill-defined. A stalker? A serial killer? Something that terrified her father enough to have him give up his career and his life to make them all \\"disappear\\"? Something her father himself had done? Suspense builds well, and the plot moves forward slowly, but not too slowly.My main critique is that certain details of the police investigation are so far-fetched -- indeed, so unbelievably amateurish -- that one is unable to suspend disbelief. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be careful here to reveal no surprises in the book while giving a couple of examples of what I'm talking about. We know, from the beginning of the book, that Annabelle's father was a math professor at MIT before he took his family and ran. Why doesn't someone contact anyone from MIT until the very end of the book? Why, indeed, wouldn't Annabelle herself have done so? Another example: When the police are desperately trying to get to Annabelle's apartment near the climax of the book, they're stuck in traffic. Stuck in traffic? Why do they tolerate that? The explanation that motorists in Boston do not move aside for police sirens is, to say the least, unconvincing. Then, why do the cops give up and end up abandoning their car and running well over a mile to reach the apartment when they could drive on the sidewalks if need be? Most important: Why doesn't one of them have enough brains or common sense to get on the radio and call backup officers to Annabelle's address? It's all too moronic for words. Also, there's entirely too much attention given to by-play between the male lead, Dodge, and Dee-Dee, his female colleague with whom he once had a relationship. Really, who cares? A little of that goes a long way, and the author overdoes it. Is Dee-Dee in a perpetual state of PMS? It seems so. Is she in a perpetual state of conduct verging on incompetence and unprofessionalism? It seems so. Finally, let me just mention my dissatisfaction with the heroine's multiple departures from her character and training at the end of the book. The character of Annabelle, as developed throughout, would never behave that irrationally. (I could go on about Bella, the dog, but I think the point is amply made).So, the \\"Keystone Cops\\" aspect of the book is a major irritant. A comparative quibble, but one that might be important for a potential reader who is a mystery fan, is that bad-guy identification is all too easy. There is, as a result, no surprise at the end when the final confrontation occurs, except perhaps for readers with little experience of mysteries and thrillers.Lest this review come across as too negative, let me repeat: Lisa Gardner writes very well. Her plot is interesting and involving. Most of the characters are well-drawn. The book will keep you interested and keep you reading (or listening, as the case may be). Recommended, with the reservations mentioned above."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Has all the components of a good read!

Would love to see this made into a movie."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Really enjoyed the story ... it keeps you guessing who's behind it all!!My only wish is that there wouldn't have been so much cursing. I understand you have to accurately display a character's personality, but I'm hoping one day they'll sell a \\"PG\\" version of these kinds of books. Oh well, just a thought. Aside from that, it was great!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Lisa Gardner is of my favorite writer .I have read all of her books and can't wait till her next one comes out. If you like to read James Patteson Books Lisa Garner is a must. This book is one of my favorite . Some of the story is from one of her other book but she explaines enough so you dont have to read the other book.( Alone)I would recomend that people do read it first so you get an understanding of Bobby and D.D. Great strory i was guessing the whole time while i was reading. Nice surprise on the end."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Having just read yet another \\"wanna-be Patricia Cornwell,\\" I was hesitant to pick this one up - but I'm glad I did. It's definitely no wanna-be!A great storyline with good character development and tight plotting, the book kept me guessing. I usually figure out the bad guy two-thirds of the way through, but this one had me until the last few chapters. I appreciated the depth of the characters and their relationships, too.The performance on the audiobook by Maggi-Meg Reed was outstanding, too. She captured the characters well with vocal changes and accents. The only thing I didn't like about the audiobook was the lack of disc-prompting (\\"this ends Disc 1,\\" etc. - very useful for those of us who listen on MP3 players).I've never read a Lisa Gardner book, and I got the feeling from some of the references in \\"Hide\\" that there was a preceding novel with the same characters. This usually bothers me, because many series writers rely almost too heavily on the preceding books to flesh out the characters. Like many readers, I like reading a stand-alone book and discovering, to my delight, that there are more books with the same story. The book stood well enough on its own and generated my interest in the prequel.While a fairly quick read, \\"Hide\\" is absorbing and tense, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This is one of the best books I've read this year. A book I could relate to, and could not put down. What Russell did for his daughter, I know many of us would do the same for ours. At one point there were tears rolling down my face. A must read for 2007."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Annabelle Granger has spent her whole life on the run and she doesn't even know what she has been running from. While she was growing up her father uprooted the family every 12-18 months to keep her safe from a threat but he never told her what exactly that threat was. And now, with her parents both dead, there is little chance of her ever finding all the answers. After all the family name changes, she doesn't even know what her real name is. Is it really Annabelle Granger?A grave is found on the site of an old abandoned mental hospital containing 6 murdered girls, one of whom has a bracelet with 'Annabelle Granger' on, one that Annabelle remembers finding gift wrapped on her doorstep when she was a child, before all the family moves. She goes to the police to let them know that she is alive and well. They have as many questions about her life as she does and it's a rush to find the answers - who killed the girls, was this person the threat that her father tried to save Annabelle from, and is Annabelle still at risk?This is a truly fantastic thriller. Annabelle is so unsure of her identity it is almost like she is trying to deal with amnesia. In finding out who she is she has to find out who she can trust and that entails letting down her guard, something her father has trained her never to do. I kept thinking that I had worked out who Annabelle was and who the threat was and then there was another twist and I was back at square one again. I like an author who can keep it fresh and keep me guessing and Lisa Gardner certainly did that for me in \\"Hide\\". I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"As a follow up to Alone, this book does not disappoint. It picks up with now Detective Bobby Dodge, two years after the last book. In Alone, Bobby was a sniper and forced to use deadly force. This book continues with his feelings in the aftermath of that shooting in the background of his new job as a detective. His first case involves the discovery of 6 mummified bodies underground on the grounds of a former state mental hospital. This book has you guessing from the beginning and has many twists and turns. The whodunit and the ending to me seemed a bit contrived, but it was still good. Gardner doesn't miss when it comes to mystery and suspense!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I always enjoy a good sequel. Bobby Dodge and others were well worth a re-visit. Hide is well done, but a few too many events came together at the ending."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Not the best Lisa Gardner, \\"Alone\\" was much better, but still worth the time and effort. Entertaining, a well plotted and written story, but the characters are stereotypes, or just dull, and the dialogue is strained at times. Still, better than 90% of the mysteries I've read in the last year.Try it, you might like it even more than I did, and if you do give it another star."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Yes, I enjoyed this book. It seemed to start a little slow but it did pick up and had many interesting characters. I saw the review from BOOKLIST that said something like: Head and shoulders above anything else she has written and this is Lisa Gardner at the height of her powers. That is not word for word, but pretty close. That also is not right. Lisa Gardner has written a lot of very good thrillers and I count her as one of my favorite authors. I look forward to her next book whenever it is coming out. Part of this book was written in third person and some in first person from the point of view of Annabelle, the main heroine. As a child she is moved with her family repeatedly and during the course of the story we get the idea why and then that turns out to be not what it seems to be. Was it all her father's imagination? sigh... Anyway, D.D. and Bobby are the two main detectives on the case after an undergorund chamber is discovered containing six bodies is found. D.D. is the lead detective on the case and she calls in Bobby from the State Police to help out. I guess she calls him in just because they once had a thing for each other. Yes, the Catherine connection is there, but that seemed a little weak to me. The whole Catherine Cagnon thing just seemed like a way to make the story longer. When we got to the final resolution it seemed like half of Boston was populated by nuts who should have still been locked up in the mental ward. I don't see the necessity to comment on that statement. The climax to the story gives us multiple psychopaths who have assumed new identities. D.D. is correct when she calls something that was overlooked a 'rookie' mistake. Shoot, even I wouldn't have made that mistake. Anyway, this is a good read that keeps the reader interested. Lisa Gardner keeps the action moving and never lets the plot slow down while the main characters get too bogged down in their personal demons (something that really bugs me in a lot of novels.) Yes, all of the main characters have issues from the past to deal with, but they don't spend half the book crying about them. 'HIDE' is an easy book to recommend but to say that this is Gardner's best work ever is setting the bar a little high. I say, go ahead and buy it. One of the better efforts by one of the more dependable authors around."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This is a very good book just like most of Lisa Gardner's books are. It is very well thought out. She leaves you guessing throughout most of the book. You think you know but you aren't sure how she's going to make it happen. Then there's a twist that opens up a whole new possibility. It's very good. Ms. Gardner has really thought out her character, Bobby Dodge from Alone. You don't have to read Alone to read this book. It helps though to understand where he's coming from and why but you don't have to in order to enjoy this book. Her character interactions are excellent. It's a very easy to read book and it makes you want to read it. It would be a good beach book to read and get lost in. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a suspense mystery book. Lisa Gardner's books are ones you can't put down."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This was a fun, interesting read. Very different and enjoyable. The book went very quick and was a good story. The author showed different perspectives and brought me into how they thought. Definitely enjoyed this!!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"\\"This is the type of thriller that has you guessing to virtually the end and has a heart-pounding conclusion! This book sucked me in from the beginning with the story of Anabelle, whose father makes her constantly move and change identities like they are in the witness protection program. This finally finishes when Anabelle becomes an adult and both her parents are dead.In the meantime a grave is unearthed that contains the remains of murdered children. Somehow, Anabelle going into hiding has some connection to this grave.The author uses interesting story telling, having Anabelle's story appear in first person and using third person when describing the two detectives investigating the case. What really gets confusing is that the case is similar to another case inolving a woman who was a girlfriend of one of the detectives investigating the case and also bears a strong resemblence to Anabelle.Gardner's confusing plotline clues only adds to the reader's difficulty in putting the book down. Don't miss this one!\\""},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I thought this book was much better than \\"Alone,\\" the previoius Bobby Dodge book. It was a definite page-turner that was hard to put down.It was fairly easy to figure out who the bad guy was, but much more suspenseful figuring out how all the bad guys fit together. That alone made it worth reading.The whole ending was weak though, and I was bothered by the fact that we had it drummed into us throughout the book what a defense expert Annabelle was, yet she seemed pretty defenseless when confronted.All in all, definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Synopsis (from the blurb at the back of the book)Annabelle Granger has spent her life on the run, her childhood a blur of new places and fresh aliases. Now thirty years old, she is living quietly in Boston - until she opens the morning paper and finds herself declared dead.At an abandoned mental institute, the bodies of six girls have been discovered. And one of them is wearing Annabelle's locket. Working with Detective Bobby Dodge to unravel a decades-old-riddle, Annabelle embarks on a desperate collision course with her past - where a killer has been waiting years to find her, and there's no place left to hide.~~~~~Both the plot and writing engaged me from the first page. The trauma of having to do a moonlight flit every few years and hide behind a new identity each time is really brought home as Annabelle investigates her past. Some of the characters have apparently appeared in another of Lisa Gardners novels (Alone) but although you realise some of them have 'history' the book stands up well on it's own. However if you do intend to read 'Alone' then I would advise that you read it before 'Hide' as the story of the former is given away in this book."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This was a good story, but---- Here's how I think the plot could have been better: I expected Christopher Eola to be Annabelle's mother's brother. I thought she was the sister that Christopher did something \\"inappropriate\\" to, therefore getting himself consigned to a mental institution. When \\"Tommy\\", Annabelle's father's sociopath brother, showed up, it just seemed contrived, with too many sociopaths in the story to make it realistic."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"After two days on the job as a new State Police Homicide Detective, Bobby Dodge receives a late night call from Sergeant D.D. Warren to come to the scene of a crime. At the former mental hospital in Mattapan an underground chamber was discovered on the grounds by kids. The chamber contains six mummified remains of small, female children. One of the victims is wearing a locket inscribed with the name Annabelle Granger.When she was seven years old, Annabelle Granger returned home after school one day and saw her parents in the living room with five suitcases packed and ready to go. They leave their home, move to Florida and change their names. This is just the first of many moves to come during Annabelle's lifetime. Along the way her mother passes away. When they finally return to Boston, her original home, Annabelle is twenty-two. Shortly thereafter, her father is struck by a car on a street corner and killed.Now living in Boston in a tiny apartment with her dog, Bella, Annabelle has her own small business designing window treatments. Needless to say, she is very security conscious to the extreme, compliments of her father. One day she picks up the newspaper and discovers that she was murdered twenty-five years ago. Forty-eight hours later she takes a trip to the police station.At the station she interviews with Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren. She relates to them her life's story, including the day she gave her locket to her best friend, Dori Petracelli.Annabelle's father had never told her why they were always running or who they were running from. So she still fears someone is stalking her.Bobby's story began in \\"Alone\\", a previous novel by this author. As a sniper for the State Police, he saved the life of Catherine Gagnon and her four year old son by killing Jimmy Gagnon, Catherine's abusive husband. When Catherine was twelve, she was abducted and kept in a hole in the woods. After a month of captivity, she was rescued by hunters as they stumbled over her prison. Catherine testified against her captor, Richard Umbrio, and he was sent to prison. Bobby thinks that somehow this case might be related to the present crime at the old mental hospital.As they sort through all info and clues, Annabelle insists that she might be able to help the detectives and possibly in return they can help her find out why her life was spent on the run.If you like a murder mystery that is not too dark considering the content and all loose ends are neatly tied up, then this book is for you. It is a light and easy read that I truly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I really enjoyed Hide. Although I usually can figure out the ending, on this one I couldn't. The characters were well developed and interesting. I will definitely read more books by this author."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"One of the great things about reduced price Kindle reads is that it gives me the opportunity to read an author I may not have read before. I was so pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this book so much.This book captured my attention from the very first pages and held my interest until the very end. It was an easy read, with a plot that I enjoyed, so I finished the book quickly. Some books seem to require so much effort to get through - not this one.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Twenty-five years ago, seven year old Annabelle Granger came home from school to find five suitcases packed and her parents urging her to grab just two things to take with her as they fled from their home and the life that they knew. For years they shuffled around the country, leaving at a moments notice, keeping their heads down and changing identity with each location. Annabelle...though she didn't go by that name anymore...never new why. First, she lost her mother to a combination of booze and pills, the constant flight too much for her. Then, older and wiser, Annabelle and her father return to the city of Boston, the same city they'd fled from so many years ago. Her father died not long after, a victim of a hit and run. For a decade following that, Annabelle, known as Tanya now, has worked and lived in the city of her childhood. Then one day she read a newspaper and saw the news. Her body had been found. Annabelle Granger was dead, along with five other young girls found in a pit of darkness and horror far deeper and more malignant than the earthen tomb itself. Maybe now, after all these years, Annabelle can find out why. Why had she been forced all her life to hide?Lisa Gardner has penned an incredibly complex, twisted, and gripping suspense novel in Hide, pairing former sniper turned state detective Bobby Dodge together with ex-lover and now Boston PD Seargent D.D. Warren to solve a case with a myriad more questions than answers. A veritable rabbit warren of paths lead to clues and connections that only a true mastermind of suspense could ever dream up, and I was utterly compelled by the intensity and vitality of the story and characters. With impeccable pacing, the plot twists tighter and tighter as Annabelle goes to the police to both get answers and give them, and Bobby finds himself drawn to the reclusive woman with such stark strength in her eyes, but Annabelle's emergence from a lifetime of shadows sparks a sick and twisted mind to focus on her yet again. Apparently not even a lifetime can stop evil when it's intent enough.I loved this book. It was creepy and dark and the threat was carefully controlled and dished out by the author with a sparing intensity that was chilling. I, much like Annabelle, was totally committed to finding out why her father had been so out-of-his-mind paranoid, and the revelations were mind boggling as the truth slowly comes to light. Kudos to Gardner for her wicked, twisted psyche and her deft ability to translate that into imaginative works of macabre entertainment.My only - small - complaints were that I had to kind of sit on my suspension of disbelief and force it to behave when it came to how much access Annabelle was given to the case. I found that a little implausible, but once I beat that suspension of disbelief into submission, I just enjoyed the ride. I also thought the final conflict was a little too convenient and a bit too many of the wild warren paths led to the same den, so to speak. The only thing that I really wish had been different, though, was I wish that the romance between Bobby and Annabelle had been given a bit more room to breathe, because I enjoyed their attraction. It was extremely subtle in developing, and have to admit, Bobby acted very professionally overall, but I read this under the impression that it was a romantic suspense novel, and that's not exactly true. I consider this a suspense thriller with a thread of romance in it. A tiny thread.Overall though, this was an eminently enjoyable read that kept me wildly flipping pages well into the night until I had all the answers. Very well done. It's been quite some time since I've read a Lisa Gardner book, but after Hide I don't think I'll be staying away nearly so long ever again. 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed on One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. Lisa Gardner's best. The characters, storyline, and writing were all amazing. I really connected to the story. I can't really find the words to describe how much I enjoyed it.

I always kinda feel like those should be reserved for War and Peace or Gone With the Wind. But I think I've finally learned that some books are just downright entertaining, and deserve to be rated on their own and not compared to other books. HIDE is one of them. Kept me engrossed from the first page to the last. Good writing, easy to read. Not overblown with description, but the author still made me see every character. I downloaded this one to my Kindle at a very good price (cheap!), but I will certainly be buying more of this author's works at regular price from here out. (Darn your nefarious plan, Amazon or publisher or whomever, you got me again.) I would call this one a mystery - puzzles to solve - rather than straight suspense.

If you can understand the system, you will survive.' \\" And she had survived. She had survived countless moves to new cities, each time with a new name. She had survived her mother's alcoholism and suicide and her father's sudden death when he was hit by car. She had survived never knowing what it was she and her family were running from. And now, it seemed, she had survived her own murder.On the grounds of the abandoned Boston State Mental Hospital six bodies of six young girls are found in six separate clear plastic bags in an underground pit. On one bag is a small silver locket engraved with the name \\"Annabelle M. Granger.\\" This is the only clue State Homicide Detective Bobby Dodge and Boston Police Sergeant D. D. Warren have to start their investigation. Bobby recognizes the underground pit as strikingly similar to the pit where twelve-year-old Catherine Gagnon had been imprisoned for almost a month in 1980 by Richard Umbrio, now two-years deceased, having been shot by Catherine Gagnon when he attacked her after his release from prison. The question is: Who killed Annabelle Granger and the other five girls and how do their deaths relate to Catherine Gagnon--and who is Tanya Nelson?Lisa Garner's \\"Hide\\" is a truly riveting mystery-thriller that will keep you turning the pages until the very end. The plot is fascinating and complex; the characters are worth knowing; and the pieces do all fit together in the end. This is not a book you want to pick up when you have places to go and people to meet because, I guarantee you, you will want to \\"Hide until the very last word."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"This book grabs you from the first page. You'll be in suspense for the whole book as the author takes you on a lot of twists and turns. I hope she does a sequel. My only complaint was the ending was a bit unbelievable...

Then it all fell to implausible pieces at the end. As other reviewers have said, ALL the characters acted contrary to their previously portrayed personalities and routines - things that we had been told about them many times in the course of the story.***** Spoiler Alert *****Good cops like Bobby and D.D. would never have let their rescue of a person in danger depend on their being able to run a mile and a half before other back-up could get to the victim, nor would they have abandoned their car to do so, without even calling for that back-up first. Annabelle, whose safety training had been drummed into her for years, would never have relaxed so much that she let a stranger get the better of her in her own apartment, even if she thought he was a friendly. And once she realized he wasn't, her training should have kicked in to make her much more effective in combat than she was. That said, I guessed half of the ending. (Yes, there were clues leading to one villain.) However, I don't think anyone could have guessed the other half - it came right out of nowhere. Uncle Charlie, indeed!

Hide is no exception.As children we expect our parents to protect us and make us feel safe. Not Annabelle Granger's. She learns from an early age to live out of suitcases, not get too attached to things, and certainly not to homes, or people. As a matter of fact, she doesn't get attached to the names of her parents, her own name, or their family's history, because it sheds and a new one appears with each move.Maybe you took ballet lessons, or were on a little league team when you were young. Not Granger. She was learning how to run from strangers and how to protect herself. Nice childhood, huh?Our heroine finds herself listed in the Obits. one day and reports to the police that, she is very much alive. Which begs the question, if she's alive, who is it with her name who is dead?The police ask questions for which Annabelle has no answers. The questions she had neatly tucked back into the corners of her mind begin to crawl out. Why does she have a memory of her mom calling her dad another name? Why did they have to move suddenly every couple of years? Why did she not know any others in her family? Why weren't there any photo albums? Why did her dad take menial jobs if he had been a professor? Why couldn't she recall her early childhood? And, who were they running from and why should they be afraid?If those are not enough for the reader to be curious, then how about this? There is more than one killer!

The book helped me kill a few hours on a plane trip, which is pretty much all I asked of it.

She and her parents rarely lived anywhere for more than two years, always a new state, and a new name. She never knew why. Twenty-five years later, her parents are both dead and she has come full circle back to living in Boston where she last felt stability and continuity. In Boston she lives in semi-seclusion and anonymity, still feeling the fear of her childhood. Only the astonishing news report that Annabelle Granger is dead, part of a gruesome crime scene involving six children buried in an underground chamber on the grounds of the now-closed state mental hospital, causes Annabelle come forth. Annabelle, now known as Tanya, tells Detectives Bobby Dodge and D.D. Warren her strange story. Not many facts of her past can be substantiated due to the frequent change of names and address. The investigation of the serial deaths unearths more than one suspect. Annabelle insists on being part of the investigation, and ends up reclaiming her name and her life.This was an extremely fast-paced, engrossing, and engaging book. The characters were all terrific. Bobby and D.D. are characters that first appeared in the 2005 ALONE. Catherine Gagnon, the central character from ALONE, is also part of the story in HIDE. This is total stand along novel, but I think it would be really worth it to read ALONE first. There were a few problems with the book. Annebelle narrated her part of the story in first person, while the rest of the book was in third person. It made it really confusing. Also there were so many suspects, and so many clues and they all seemed to be involved in the resolution which made it seem too tidy, and far-fetched. I would have given the first 3/4 of the book 5 stars, but it lost a star for the ending."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"What a lame book!! Even though paid only 77c (81 c Canadian) I regret every penny.I agree with some of the other low ratings that it was well enough written but the ending with its tearful out of nowhere duel confessions was a pitiful attempt to tie a runaway story line together. The only good thing about it was it put us out of our misery!She just fit an ending to a plotline that had no direction."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"First Sentence: My father explained it to me the first time when I was seven years old.Massachusetts state police detective Bobby Dodge is called to a Boston PD crime scene. Sergeant D.D. Warren and her team are on the grounds of the closed and crumbling Boston State Mental Hospital. There has been found an underground room containing the bodies of six young girls. One thing they release to the press is the name of one of the young girl's based on a locket they found. Since she was seven years old, Annabelle's father has moved their family from place to place, always taking new identities but with Annabelle never knowing why. Now, with both her parents dead, Annabelle has come back to Boston, where she started. When she reads the story in the news, she realizes the locket was hers and one of the bodies was the best friend she's given it to.Lisa Gardner is an author who deserves much more notice than she receives. The lady knows how to write suspense with a human touch. Her characters are strong and fully dimensional, down to the members of the team; one of which as a new baby and another whose mother is dying. Her writing is atmospheric; you see the people on the train, and feel the closeness of the underground room. The story flows and builds taking the reader along on the investigation. You think you know where it's going and who the villain is, but you're not certain and then Gardner reveals a new element to keep you off balance. The ending does rather come at you out of no where but it always explains the reason for the family's moves. To introduce it sooner would have completely spoiled the suspense. \\"Hide\\" was a very good, fast read."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"Super creepy! I'm still shivering from this book! Very well written and put together. Amazing storyline. Keeps your attention all the way through! It was incredible. Cannot wait to read the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Hide","review":"After the last Lisa Gardner book I read I noticed that I hadn't read Hide so I decided to pick it up and make sure I was up to date on the D.D. Warren series, the problem is the entire time I was reading the book I had a huge feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and I couldn't decide if I had read the book before or not, and even after I finished the book for the life of me I couldn't tell if I had read the book or not or if he novels follow such a particular pattern that is just had FELT like I had read the book. Or I am going crazy.Before trying to read Hide I highly recommend reading Gardner's novel Alone or this novel will have many confusing plot points.Even though this novel is considered part of the D.D Warren series it follows more closely her partner Bobby Doge, Warren's ex lover. The two of them are now partners in homicide and they get called to a crime scene where six mummified children have been unearthed. One of the children is wearing a locket with the name Annabelle Granger engraved on its surface. However, things get complicated when a woman shows up in the police station claiming not only that she is Annabelle Granger but that her father has moved her around the country for the last two decades and she has been living under a dozen of assumed names for the last twenty years. To make matters more interesting, or more convoluted, \\"Annabella\\" has a striking resemblance to Catherine Gagnon the main character in Gardner's novel Alone."},{"Title":"Hide","review":"I have only read a couple of Lisa Gardner's books, but this is by far one of the best books I have read by her. Just when you think you have this book figured out, it turns and the plot thickens! I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes reding about murder mysteries! However, you must prepare yourself for this page turner and the lack of sleep you'll get because of the need to finish this book!

The author chose to explain most of the story in the last fifty pages or so.

No. Is it fine literature? No. But it's still good beach reading... It's your basic serial killer/stalker thriller and while it's not among the best (Deaver, Child, Sandford, Patterson, etc), it's not the worst either. I'm a fast reader and I think it took me a little over a day (granted, a day when I didn't have anything else to do but read) to get through this one. The \\"surprise\\" ending wasn't overly surprising (in fact, it was a little far-fetched and one of the weakest points of the book), but I liked the characters (for the most part) and enjoyed reading it. There are better thrillers out there, but for 79 cents (the current, promotional Kindle price) you can't go far wrong."},{"Title":"Validated Designs for Object-oriented Systems","review":"This book is one of my favorites on formal methods. While many books on formal methods focus on presenting detailed mathematics and formal proofs, this book provides a tutorial on how to model specifications using a formal specification language.The specification language is the Vienna Development Method Specification Language++ (VDM++). VDM++ is a functional programming language with excellent abilities to express types, data modeling, and algorithms. VDM++ adds object orientation to its predecessor VDM-SL. Unlike some formal specication languages, VDM++ is written using normal characters on a computer keyboard (no Greek letters or special mathematical symbols needed).The book begins with a discussion of why formal modeling is useful in software development. It provides an overview on building a simple model. Part II of the book explains the VDM++ language and how to use those features in building models. Part III provides three case studies. Part IV discusses generating code from the specification.This is a book that programmers without advanced degrees in mathematics can enjoy and profit from. While formal specification is not as widely used as some other requirements approaches, it is particularly effective for use with critical or complex sofware development. If you have never used formal specification, this is the book to start with. If you work with business rules, VDM can be a very useful tool for precise specification of business rules."},{"Title":"Lessons on faith: A selection of articles and sermons","review":"The collected writings of A. T. Jones establish a powerful definition of faith. This stands in stark contrast to the fuzzy, esoteric notions of faith found in many modern Christian writings. If the faith of which Jones speaks were actually accepted today, there would be no silly talk of &quot;the relationship between faith and works&quot; - the &quot;relationship&quot; would be blatantly obvious.

I believe that a careful review and study of this book will change the life of the sincere reader.It moves the reader from a surface understanding of the nebulous topic of faith and leaves them with a firm understanding of what it is and how to cultivate it.

Though Royce is usually identified as an idealist (especially evident in early books such as The Spirit of Modern Philosophy and The World and the Individual), his mature philosophy took a turn toward a more naturalistic approach. In The Philosophy of Loyalty, Royce argued that the natural phenomenon of ordinary loyalty to friends and family would, in the proper environment, blossom into a moral commitment to promote &quot;loyalty to loyalty&quot;, or to the broadest and most comprehensive conception of human community. This suggestion is explored at considerably greater length in The Problem of Christianity, where Royce argues the idea of the Church is the singular philosophical contribution of the Christian tradition, rather than its supernaturally oriented theologies. The Philosophy of Loyalty is an essential read for anyone interested in philosophy circa 1900, and would be of interest to those searching for a way to combine the universalizing elements of Kantian ethics with the appeal of a theory that emphasizes personal loyalty and place bound elements."},{"Title":"The philosophy of loyalty,","review":"If you're reading this book, here are some things you already know: Royce is considered to be America's great idealist. He was a professor at Harvard at the same time as the great William James, and suffered from a profound inferiority complex. He mixed his &quot;teutonic metaphysics&quot; with appropriate doses of Christianity-inspired ethics. You'll get treated to all these things in this book.Royce has fallen completely out of fashion since the 1960s due mostly to the modern academy embracing relativism rather than to Royce's lack of intellectual profundity. But if we dig deep enough, is Royce really that intellectually profound? Idealism always tends towards a &quot;first cause&quot; and &quot;final conclusion&quot; type of structure. It's the nature of that way of thinking, by definition. Royce abandons profound and critical exploration of his theses frequently by building his arguments around what he believes to be immutable concepts which, frankly, leave one wondering how a man of such intelligence can fall for something so simplistic. Basically, what you have here is Royce defending his idealism against the Pragmatists' relativism by suggesting that &quot;loyalty to loyalty&quot; is the be-all-and-end-all of ethics. Men (and women) act the way they do, and SHOULD act the way they do based on their commitment to a beloved &quot;cause.&quot; Men (and women) will rally around good causes and reject bad ones. Most critical readers are going to asks themselves, &quot;Can it really be that simple?&quot; In short, I don't buy it. And you'll know if you buy it from the introduction. From then on out, Royce will either further convince you with his defense, or you'll become bored with the monotony of it."},{"Title":"The Princess Mouse : A Tale of Finland","review":"\\"The Princess Mouse: A Tale of Finland\\" begins with a simple premise, which is that in Mikko's family when young men get to the age when it is time for them to marry they find their future brides by cutting down a tree and following it points. It so happens that in this particular farm family the two sons are old enough to marry so the father instructs them to follow the family tradition, declaring, \\"That's how we've done it, and that's how we always well.\\" The older son knows exactly who he wants to marry and cuts down the true so that it points right to her door, but when the younger son, Mikko, cuts down his tree it points into the deep forest. His brother mocks him, wondering if Mikko's sweetheart will be a wolf or a fox. But Mikko walks off into the forest declaring \\"I'll find who I find.\\"What Mikko finds is a mouse who is more than happy to be his sweetheart. Strangely enough, Mikko agrees and returns home to tell his father he has found a sweetheart. The tale now becomes interesting because Mikko's father has arranged a series of tests for the sweethearts of his two sons to take to prove their worth (do not ask why, you know what the father will say). From the title of the this story being told by Aaron Shepard you can probably guess how it is going to turn out in the end, but that does not distract all that much from the charm of this tale which is illustrated by Leonid Gore. You have many of the traditional elements of such folktales, but there are some nice unexpected twists that will delight readers of all ages.Shepherd based his retelling of this tale mostly on story of \\"The Forest Bride,\\" which I actually prefer as a title, but also on the story of \\"The Mouse Bride.\\" In the back of the book you will find the simple music for \\"The Song of the Princess Mouse,\\" written by Shepard. In fact, if you visit Shepard's homepage you can find not only a recording of the tune for this song but a reader's theater script along with another test of the brothers' sweethearts. So there are some nice resources to go with this folktale for teachers to use. Shepard has authored other folktales, including \\"The Maiden of Northland: A Hero Tale of Finland.\\""},{"Title":"The Princess Mouse : A Tale of Finland","review":"This is a great story.

When Mikko, a farmer's son, cuts down his tree, it points into the forest where the only talking being he comes across is a friendly mouse. The mouse convinces Mikko to let her be his sweetheart, but when the wedding day arrives, the guests are astonished by his choice. His scoffing older brother throws the mouse into the river. Suddenly, the creature turns into a princess and after the wedding ceremony, takes Mikko back to her castle to live.Aaron Shepard's book is an endearing love story that teaches readers not to look solely on a person's outward appearance.

She is one of my favorite authors for relaxing books."},{"Title":"Angels All Over Town","review":"Good book... Focuses on realtionships and the dynamics of sisters."},{"Title":"Angels All Over Town","review":"This is Ms. Rice's first novel written in 1985. Meet Una Caven, by day a successful soap opera actress, by night, 80's woman ordinaire. This story introduces us to the Caven clan, primarily the story of 3 sisters.Una, evidently pronounced Oooh-nah, not You-nah, is the oldest of the 3 sisters, and the single one, who is searching for Mr. Right. Always inseparable, the sisters relationships change when the younger ones take on spouses, much to Una's dismay and frustration. Her quest for the right soul-mate takes the reader through a lot of mundane dialogue.Una's sexual escapades are described rather crudely, which I found surprising, after reading some of Ms. Rice's most recent novels. Obviously, Luanne Rice has much improved since this first novel of hers. Her recent novels have much more substance, and the love/sexual sequences are now written with emotional impact that enrapture and captivate the reader, unlike this first attempt.If you have not read her before, don't start with this one - try \\"Follow the Stars Home,\\" \\"Home Fires\\" or \\"Summer Light\\"... she is a great writer, one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Angels All Over Town","review":"While this is not my favorite Luanne Rice book, I enjoyed the story all the same. And knowing this was her first published effort at writing (1985), I did figure it wouldn't be as polished as her later works that are my favorites, such as Home Fires, The Secret Hour and Cloud Nine.Angels All Over Town is about three sisters, Una, Lily and Margot and their relationships with each other and with the men in their lives. The story was told from Una's point of view, who's the oldest and an actress on a soap opera. I found the sisters very endearing. And I loved the interpersonal things going on between them, their discussions, arguments etc.There are some things that I think could have used improvement, such as the book didn't feature their mother much. We didn't get her point of view at all, or learn why she was the way she was. Also, I would have liked to see more of a resolution with some of the stories, particularly with Lily and her husband Henk. The ending would could have been improved as well, I felt like it was a kind of odd place to chose to end the book.Overall there were some flaws, but I still found myself enjoying this book and it's characters. Like all of her later books, the story of family and of relationships is prominent and it engages the reader. I think if you go in reading this knowing some of these things (especially that this is her first book), you won't be disappointed. However, I would recommend reading her newer books first (Dream Country, Firefly Beach and Follow the Stars Home) and her older books second- but I do think the older books (Blue Moon, Stone Heart) are worth the reading time."},{"Title":"Angels All Over Town","review":"Luanne rice's first novel; this one begins a bit slowly, but by the time you are a third through the book, you don't want to put it down. this is the story of three sisters who grew up on the northeast coast. Each chose a different path to follow, and yet they maintained a very close relationship. If you don't have a sister, it makes you mourn the fact.Ms. Rice's books make me want to travel to the scene of so many of her stories.

In this case the three sisters are all reachign the age when marraige is possible and when the youngest marries a stuffy doctor, it is as if the otehr two are eager to also find their mates.While I genrally rip through a Rice title - I read Firefly Beach and Safe Harbor in a couple of hours, I foudn thsi book tedious boring and it took me several days to finally finish it. I had a hard time believing this was a first book by an author whose books I truly I truly love but I guess it happens.

Each Rogue's story has touched my heart, but this one even more so than the others. Bliss and Lucas are so well matched. I would say that I will miss them, but I know I will be rereading this story again very soon. All three in this series have been placed on my &quot;Keeper&quot; shelf. The author, Connie Mason, has proven that she is a gifted story teller, especially in the Regency era.Word has it that the author's next release will be in November 2004, titled &quot;THE PIRATE PRINCE&quot;. Though it will not be set in London, (Perhaps the author can be persuaded to return to London again in the near future.) I look forward to the next adventure. Highly recommended reading once again! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Last Rogue","review":"In this book, no does not mean no, women cannot resist a man who presses the right buttons, so to speak, men cannot resist their sexual urges, and the idea of marital fidelity is a joke. Wagers are made on if the male character can last a year without sex. He makes it three months. Then he weds the woman he beds (in a rather contrived bit of plotting) and promises her, with reluctance and a bit of foreboding, six months of faithfulness. The messages here are disturbing and would be downright scary if not for the completely laughable dialogue to go along with it. (Paraphrased: \\"What are you doing?\\" \\"I am going to kiss you.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"I don't know. I can't help myself.\\")The plot is loose and has many holes, and every few chapters a new central conflict has to emerge with barely a thread tying them together. At some points, it reads as though the author didn't read her own paragraph preceding the one she's written. A man asks to see a woman he knows is not where she's supposed to be, and then the next paragraph, he's hoping nobody notices she's missing - the people who should not notice this, of course, being the very ones he just asked to take him to her.There are what appear to be references to linked books, but not in a way that makes you at all intrigued to read them. If they're not references, then they're very poorly and loosely developed side characters with incredibly bizarre back stories that are only hinted at."},{"Title":"The Last Rogue","review":"The main focus of this book is male arousal and quite frankly it is overdone and not believable.

He blames himself for her death and has decided to remain celibate in the remote corner of Cornwall for one year.In St Ives he sees a mysterious beauty on the edge of a cliff. He believes that she will jump into sea so grabs to save her. He discovers that she is in fact Bliss Hartley, the daughter of squire of St Ives.

However, Luc cannot promise Bliss that he will change his ways and remain faithful to her. In London Luc finds that he is a target of someone who wishes him dead. But who is this mysterious enemy who tries time and time again to end his life?This was a run of the mill regency romance of reformed rake who falls for a beautiful innocent. There are some action and suspense scenes in the form of the smuggling operations. It was a good read but nothing exceptional. Although the love scenes between Luc and Bliss were hot and numerous.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"The Last Rogue","review":"In 1820 Viscount Lucas Westmore is about to pull out of Lady Sybil Roxbury, but she tightens and holds him in place. He is unable to remove himself and releases his seed inside her. Afterward Luke realizes that Sybil is already pregnant and trying to pass the unborn off as his. He tells her he will not marry her, but promises to find her a spouse. Two days later, the London Times announces that Sybil is dead an apparent suicide. Filled with remorse, the rake vows to give up sex. He leaves London for exile in St. Ives on the Cornish coast.During his nocturnal wanderings to escape from the guilt that erodes his soul, he observes a smuggling operation headed by the Shadow. Finding a reason to live, he makes inquiries, but the villagers say nothing. Still he concludes that the squire's daughter Bliss Hartley is the Shadow. He saves her life by informing the excise men that she is his fianc&eacute;e. They marry mostly out of his failure to help Sybil, but love begins to blossom until an unknown person tries to kill Luc and someone else has taken on her former identity of the Shadow.The latest Rogue regency romance is a delightful charmer starring two fabulous protagonists. Luc is an honorable person trying to do the right thing though his lament over failing Sybil seems an unfair self condemnation. Bliss is typical of many of the sub-genre heroines as she is courageous, independent, and performs an occupation that most men would fear to try. Together they make a fierce team for their enemies to cope with but a fabulous read for fans of Connie Mason.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Last Rogue","review":"I don't recall ever reading anything by Connie Mason before, but I am familiar with her name, so when I saw this novel for free on Kindle--and a Regency to boot--I downloaded it. I read about 20% before giving up on it. Lucas, the \\"hero\\" is worse than a Rogue. He is one-dimensional, and that one dimension is all about sex. Virtually all of the 20% was a description of his sexcapades, his sexual fantasies,and his constant state of arousal. Bliss seemed to have potential as a strong heroine, but she wasn't fully fleshed out in the portion I managed to finish, except as the object of Luc's desires. After he all but rapes her, I gave up completely on the novel.(Doesn't \\"no\\" mean \\"no\\"???

He never guessed the stormy nights of Cornwall would bring unlooked-for danger, the thrill of the chase, and a long-legged beauty who would tempt him like no other.

Luc not having sex seemed impossible. I too would have been wagering in Brooks - Luc really did have a problem with his zipper going down. But still, Luc seems to be a rogue with a deep heart - and he grew on me as the story went on. And this might be the most telling part of Luc Westmore he does seem to have more heart and depth to himself than one might expect. The sex sizzles between Bliss and Luc and since I am such a romantic this was an important ingredient in their wonderful story.

The majority of serious crimes are committed by career criminals who are often identified by \\"lines of information\\". The majority of homicides are not committed by professional criminals. Scientific training is needed to distinguish homicides from suicides. This book was written to improve police investigations by preserving evidence so it is neither contaminated or destroyed, and to tell how to get scientific assistance to prepare a case for court. August Vollmer said it should be required reading for all policemen (p.vii). [Readers of true crime and mysteries could also benefit.] In the \`Preface' LeMoyne Snyder said there were few organizations in the US or Canada like the medicolegal institutes in Europe and Latin America to investigate violent deaths [as of the 1940s]. The purpose of this book is to provide practical plans of procedure to adequately investigate deaths for those without scientific training. Each chapter contains a brief section on the medical aspects to aid a coroner prior to an autopsy and avoid serious errors of omission or commission. The \`Acknowledgments' thank the many who contributed to this book, especially the group from Harvard Medical School. Erle Stanley Gardner also contributed (his novels often used little-known medical facts). Chapter 20 explains why this book was written. A dead body was found in a kitchen. No notes were made, no photographs taken, no search for fingerprints or other evidence. The autopsy was perfunctory. The crime scene was cleaned up. When a suspect was arrested the lack of evidence set him free. If only they knew what to do!Chapter 5 discusses the identification of dead bodies, and tells of one case where Snyder recognized a dead friend after an apartment fire. The next day he found his friend was in fact alive (p.51)! A lip print can identify a person (\\"The Case of the Crimson Kiss\\"). A pelvis identifies the sex of an skeleton (p.62), and can indicate the age (p.63). Chapter 7 discusses gunshot wounds. Typically wounds of entrance are neat round holes. Wounds of exit are larger, ragged, torn, and bloodier (pp.106-107). Pages 113-116 note the effects of \\"tattooing\\". Chapter 13 deals with poisoning. It is very important to have an accurate history of the events preceding death to provide a clue to the type of poisoning. If a poison does not work other means may be used. Chapter 19 tells of the popular fallacies about murder. \\"Murder will out\\"? The number of unsolved homicides is enormous. The murderer rarely returns to the scene of the crime. A gunshot wound through the heart does not always cause instant death. Photographs can lie depending on the lens, the height of the camera, the type of film, or the distance from the object. Can a fortune teller give valuable information? Snyder knows of no such cases. A dead man can tell a tale if there was care and diligence in the investigation and the laboratory tests.[This is from the 1950 edition.]"},{"Title":"Homicide Investigation Practical Information for Coroners, Police Officers, and Other Investigators","review":"very easy to understand for the least experienced investigator. well worth the time."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"In his book, \\"Flaubert: A Biography,\\" Frederick Brown portrays his book by giving the readers a closer look at Paris during a period of radical change. He writes his book to illustrate a wonderful biography Madame Bovary as Gustave Flaubert. Interestingly and what makes this book fascinating is how Frederick Brown keeps his distance away from the audience to make us decide what the apparent contradictions in Flaubert's life really is. The 24 chapters not only offer a vivid, detailed, and accurate account of Flaubert's life, they also provide relevant historical background for Europe, France, and Rouen, Flaubert's birthplace. Flaubert (for those who don't know) was romantic and optimist yet his most famous work required a degree of discipline to keep his emotions out of it. He loathed the bourgeois, but perhaps was one of the greatest symbols of the social class in the middle nineteenth century when he hugged fame. Flaubert's loving relationship with his mistress Louise Colet really summed up the complexity of the subject of this fine work Mr. Brown provides in his biographical masterpiece in literature today. I really love this book a lot...since I am a fan of Gustave Flaubert. I highly recommend for those who are intellect and love to learn more about the life of Falubert and his career. Overall, 9/10!"},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"Julian Barnes in his excellent survey of this book in NY Review of Books states that Brown shows how Flaubert in the few intimate relations of his life preferred the memory of the experience in solitude where he could control it, to the actual experience itself. He cites an instance where Flaubert wrote to the woman closest to him Louise Colet explaining to her that if people truly loved each other they could do so without seeing each other for ten years. Colet appeared to be somewhat skeptical of the matter.Barnes also says that Brown in telling the story of Flaubert's relation to his long- time friend Maxine du Camp shows how the lifelong friends nonetheless aimed differently in life, and had subtle criticisms of their best - friends' enterprises. So Flaubert upon hearing that du Camp had been accepted as member of the 'French Academy' hinted that it was an honor not at all worth receiving. So du Camp criticized Flaubert for being stuck all the years in the same attitude he had early on.Barnes says that Brown's book is truly admirable though it contains no significant great revelation about a writer who has fascinated more than one devoted biographer.Nonetheless he makes it clear that this is by and large a first- rate biography, and one well- worth reading."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"'Madame Bovary,' Flaubert's signature work celebrates 150 years of basically continuous publication. Shocking at the time because of its portrayal of the infidelities of a married woman, its publication caused Flaubert to be tried for lewdness.Flaubert, like many writers was a tortured soul. One page from his original manuscript of 'Madame Bovary,' shows pained writing, much crossing out and re-writing. For him writing was not something he enjoyed, but more along the lines of something that he had to do. The words did not flow easily and fast, instead he struggled over each sentence, each word. But at the end, a book still in print in perhaps a dozen editions in English alone a century and a half later.This new biography gives a look at both the life of Flaubert and also of his times. Here is a picture of the literary world that was Paris in the middle 1800's. Flaubert observed first hand the Revolution of 1848 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. While not a history of these events, Mr. Brown presents a view of them from their impact on Flaubert.This is likely to remain the definitive biography of Flaubert for many years."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"Painfully overwritten, with passages of eye-roll-worthy bombast that make one shudder at the thought of ever having to hold a conversation with Brown. The assiduous research the author clearly carried out is, alas, rather poorly edited, and then rendered into passages of the most torturous purple prose.Flaubert is indeed a fascinating figure; and Brown does not *totally* fail in communicating this. However, for all the technical acumen this biographer is blessed with, he is woefully lacking in grace. Don't come looking for the deft brevity of a skilled historian, but rather for a farrago of murky narrative and hack psychoanalysis reflecting the masturbatory garrulity of a writer blindly infatuated with their own talent.If you buy it, buy it used. I think someone's selling it for $0.88."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"Dense text resulted in my frequent loss of concentration (I got lost). When Flabert is addressed, there are too many assumptions and presumptions. Guessing I can do without. There are passages of literary excellency, but one must weed through too much tedium to find treasures. This is more of a history lesson than a biographical description and analysis."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"Be warned: this piece is more about Flaubert, than it is about Brown. Because before discussing Brown's biography, I am sorry to have to discuss Flaubert, the novelist that is, for whom - I have to admit - I don't care much. For although I have read just about everything the man from Rouen wrote, and did so in French, I never felt the urge to start all over again, just for fun. Of Bouvard and P&eacute;cuchet, which Flaubert wasn't able to finish, he himself said, many times, that it was an abominable book: \\"mon bouquin abominable.\\" The best thing I like about B and P (Flaubert's own short title) is the dictionary of clich&eacute;s, the \`dictionnaire des ide&eacute;s recues', which is very funny. Salammbo is just slightly less tiring than B and P. I don't care much for Flaubert's novellas either, no, not even for A simple heart (\\"Un coeur simple\\"), parrot or no parrot, Barnes or no Barnes. I do have a soft spot for Education Sentimentale, although that too is in many ways a troubled book. But it at least has a directness and a flair which is very un-Flaubertian. I more or less like Mme Bovary, of course, although it doesn't really set you on fire and you tend to admire it first and like it after.Writing for Flaubert always meant starting a project, and \\"piocher\\" (toiling) every time he did. It never meant just writing. Except for Bovary every novel or short story took stacks of literature to produce. Just sitting down and writing a story wasn't his style. Visiting libraries, asking friends, studying, going places just to check: and then afterwards complain: why did I ever start? And if just for once there was no research to be done, he was fond of writing a fine sentence, which took a lot of time as well, while at the same time complaining about his colleagues who didn't care how they wrote, meaning just about everyone else. \\"Industrialists\\", he called some of his colleagues, not excluding Zola, Daudet or the Goncourt brothers. And they were the ones he liked. It was George Sand, his older and wiser lady-friend from Nohant, whom he admired as a person - but without saying so, didn't take serious as a writer - who once wrote to him, and I paraphrase: what a pity that a man with so much personality, with so many convictions and ideas, who writes so well as long as he doesn't try to hard, has decided to write the way he chooses. Sand was a shrewd woman. She was right of course. I find that great style of Flaubert admirable, but also sterile and cold. If he had been a painter, he would have been Gerome or Bonnat, whom he both knew. The name of Manet appears in his letters only once, just to mention \\"that he doesn't understand the first thing of his paintings.\\" He didn't care much for painting, or for music by the way: he was a very literary man, almost exclusively so. Yet, I find the distance he demonstrates toward the figures in his stories very French, and slightly inhuman. I like Stendhal, who always addressed himself in bad English in the margins of his manuscripts, and now and then wrote sloppy French in between, but who could also demonstrate a spontaneous esprit that is a pleasure to read, every time you do. When Flaubert, in 1878, is asking Taine about editions of Stendhal which he can use for his B and P, he calls his colleague an idiot, and I am not sure he is joking.So, isn't there anything I like about Flaubert? Oh yes, there is. And no, it isn't very original to say this, because it has been said many times before: if Flaubert hadn't written his letters, I doubt if he would enjoy the status he enjoys now. He destroyed important parts of his correspondence, so that the five (French language) Pleiade-volumes of about 7500 pages, including some 2000 pages of annotation, contain just a part of what he actually wrote, but it is Flaubert's correspondence which still makes him worth wile. His letters immediately make clear why his friends and acquaintances were so impressed by him. Practically all of it written in the deep of night, or early in the morning, so that they are always dated one day late, produced in a hurry after his normal writing, but in sheer weight and volume many times as large, his correspondence is a work of real genius and shows an artist art work as you seldom see. The letters are eminently readable, are fun, and belong without a doubt to what is best in world-literature. In them Flaubert can be humorous, cynical, sarcastic and sentimental, and is always eloquent. He can be a hypocrite, a buffoon, and a whorechaser who talks very dirty now and then, but who also loves his mother and his (as far as I am concerned very unpleasant) niece. And then there - at last - appears Brown. Two months after Browns biography was published, in France appeared the fifth (and last) volume of Flaubert's letters in the Pl&eacute;iade (Gallimard), finishing an edition that started in 1973. Brown says that he has been able to read the 5th volume before it was published in December 2008, and he obviously did.Browns biography is, well, ... I hesitate... okay, it \`s adequate, but I also find it very aloof. He has a keen eye for human weakness, treats Flaubert in a businesslike way, and does justice to his talents and his faults, sketching the background where necessary, functioning as an accompaniment to the annotation of his letters. It certainly sheds no new light. Brown has just been doing what has already been done by many others. I felt the same way about his book on Zola, which was just as businesslike and fair as his biography of Flaubert. Brown writes well, as someone should who wants to write about Flaubert, but the only parts of the book that really come to life - in both biographies - are the parts about French history, about the background, as if Brown found writing the life stories a duty, and only had fun when he could get away from them, writing about Dreyfus in Zola, and about 19th century French politics (Thiers, Gambetta) in Flaubert for instance. The idea of following up Zola with Flaubert is not without its logic. It makes the biographers life easier, the two knew each other well and even professed to admire each other. But Flaubert made fun of Zola's scientific ideas, and rightly so, and Zola, who was an able producer of novels for the general taste (and who was just as smart in letting others produce plays based on them), must have had his reservations about Flaubert's artistry and literary snobbism. But the boy from Aix and the one from Rouen, outsiders both of them, hankering for success, while denying to do so, also recognized each other's seriousness, and although Flaubert considered himself a conservative, most of his close artist friends tended to the left. I suppose, well, I hope, that Flaubert, had he lived, would have been proud of Zola's J \`Accuse, and would have been a staunch Dreyfusard. Maybe it's time for Brown, while he is at it, just for efficiency's sake, to go on, and start writing a biography of Maupassant now, to whom Flaubert wrote many letters (\\"mon disciple\\"), one of them ending in: \\"I touch myself when I think of you\\", and signed: \\"sister clitoris.\\" Flauberts letters are not for the bourgeois, whom he despised. They beat any biography and deserve to be translated in full, though they probably never will. It takes a real hero to just try."},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"I understand that another author's biography was more psychological and I understand that Frederick Brown wanted to examine Flaubert in a more social, historical context. I just wish Brown had come up with a slightly different title for his biography of my all-time favorite writer. Titling the biography *Flaubert* lent me to think the biography would be more psychological, rather than historical. Perhaps Brown should have considered something like *Flaubert and Normandy* or *Flaubert's Normandy.* The historical passages are well done, but I wonder if they could have been trimmed a bit. Though I have been trained in European history, I gritted my teeth while reading every word. I wonder if Brown thought to himself, \\"Now let me get through this so that we can get back to Flaubert's literary tribulations and relationships.\\" Flaubert's literary struggles and relationships are the most fascinating part of this biography.My gripes aside, this biography is densely (in the best sense of the word) and beautifully written. Flaubert's best and not so great moments are limned gorgeously. The most touching aspect of the man is how good he was to his niece Caroline and how she honored his memory. I wished I had been Willa Cather when she encountered Caroline to talk about \\"les ouevres de mon oncle.\\""},{"Title":"Flaubert: A Biography","review":"Everything as promised; prompt delivery of pristine copy of the book"},{"Title":"GED Math Workbook, 5/e (Arco Master the GED Mathematics)","review":"I found this book to be extremely helpful... after taking my GED 7 years after leaving high school, I was able to use this book and pass the test with flying colors.

It reminded me of a Toy Story beginning (which I consider quite high praise!), where the toys are being played with by Andy.

Turning everyday chores into something exciting becomes a breeze when Traction Man is around!And just when things didn't seem like they could get any funnier, Grandma *knits* Traction Man a green suit! With matching hat! Hm... very nice of her, but I wonder how long Traction Man will have to wear it?This book is a delight in both text and illustrations, and is sure to be enjoyed by young and adults alike!

Great book and lots of laughs with the story line. The pictures are interesting and we seem to find new things in the backgrounds to giggle about every time we read it."},{"Title":"Traction Man Is Here! (Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards (Awards))","review":"It's funny, but I think we can say that the picture-book-superhero-genre is still in its infancy. There's, \\"Kapow\\", of course and \\"The Adventures of Sparrowboy\\", but these are stories of ordinary kids being super. Far more difficult, in a way, is a story about an action figure. Now there is no lack of stories where toys take on a life of their own when their owners aren't around. With, \\"Traction Man Is Here\\", however, author Mini Grey turns this conceit on its head. The hero of this book may be an action figure like Buzz Lightyear (though he's an entirely different type of toy) but any adventures you read about in this book are from the head of the boy moving Traction Man about. You may not see the kids' hands and Traction Man may appear to move on his own accord, but there is little doubt who the real brains behind the operation is. It makes, oddly enough, for thrilling reading.A boy writes a note to Santa requesting another Traction Man since his old one was involved in what is simply referred to as, \\"the Terrible Parachute Accident\\". Santa may not be aware of the boy's request, but his parents are certainly on the ball because Christmas Day brings a brand new bright and shiny Traction Man (complete with Dazzle-Painted Battler Pants). Thus begin our hero's adventures. Each time he appears, his new outfit is lovingly described (as in the sentence, \\"Traction Man is crawling through the overgrown shrubbery near the Pond, wearing Jungle Pants, Camouflage Vest and Sweaty Bandanna\\"). This is all well and good up until the moment the family goes to knit-crazy Granny's. Traction Man receives an all-in-one knitted green romper suit and matches bonnet. It's adorable and completely inappropriate for his line of work. Fortunately, Traction Man's quick thinking sidekick Scrubbing Brush finds a way to solve the romper problem and save some spoons in need.Right from the start I recognized that Grey was doing something that few authors remember from their childhood. When I was a kid, any and every inanimate object was fair game for my imaginings. Likewise in this book, Traction Man battles pillows and sponges and befriends a friendly brush as well. As an author, Grey has a real feel for what it's like to be a kid playing with a favorite toy. The book looks like a comic book at all the right points and really does become quite exciting, almost in spite of its low-rent sets.Grey's attention to detail is also stunning. The night the boy gets the present containing Traction Man on his bed you can see an exciting adult foot who's sock has (oh joy) unraveled at the heel. I OWN socks just like that! This probably explains why Granny's so gung ho about knitting more for the family. Toys that do battle or are saved by Traction Man in the course of the tale are visible on the boy's floor right at the book's start. I also loved that his older sister is continually carrying around her own Christmas present: a copy of Practical Woodworking. You hardly ever see her when her nose isn't pressed to the pages. I like to think that some of the boy's wooden toys came from her hands. Words spoken by real people always appear as italicized printed texts. Plus, the interiors and exteriors of homes aren't only authentic but detailed intricately. It doesn't hurt either that Traction Man's a bit of a hunk. I don't usually go for those muscly guys, but there's something appealing in this fella's face. Just a thought.And though this comment is a bit out of place, I'd just like to point out that when Cupcake is being held prisoner by the evil Dr. Sock (yes, it pretty much consists of an actual sock wrapped around a cupcake) he whispers what I consider to be the funniest line in the book: \\"You will be my wife\\".\\"Traction Man Is Here\\" has already won (as of the writing of this review) the 2005 Boston Globe Book Award and it promises to win many more as the months and years go by.

This books real strength is the coverage of splines and patches however. Very readable w/ little procedural seggestion, i.e. implementation left to the reader."},{"Title":"Mathematical Elements for Computer Graphics","review":"This old book is a very good programming language-independent guide to the mathematics necessary for the implementation of computer graphics. I still consult my copy regularly even now, 14 years after I first purchased it. Chapter one, on computer graphics basics in general, talks about very old hardware technology, and can largely be skipped. Who really needs to know about dot matrix printers and electrostatic plotters these days? Chapter 2 begins the meat of the book, where the 2D matrix transformations of scaling, translation, rotation, and reflection are introduced. Next the author shows how to combine these matrices to perform these operations in series. These ideas are extended to 3D in chapter 3. The latter part of chapter 3 might be of particular interest to students of computer vision, since it does an exceptional job of explaining the mathematics of perspective, vanishing points, projection, and reconstruction of 3D images that so many computer vision books tend to gloss over. Chapters 4 through 6 is where the book is truly excellent, in that it gives the clearest presentation of parametric curves, B-splines, and Bezier curves I have ever seen, and then extends these ideas to full-fledged 3D objects and surfaces. Plenty of diagrams and equations are shown throughout the book, but code implementations are left to the reader. If you are interested in more modern techniques such as quaternions, there is none of that here due to the age of the book. This same author has an entirely separate book that is also excellent, \\"Procedural Elements of Computer Graphics\\", for the less mathematical algorithmic portions of computer graphics.

There's other books with more detail on specific subjects, but this book has chapters on planning, wiring, scenery, buildings, painting & weathering techniques, wiring for DC systems (not much about digital except its existence), and operations.I found the book so useful that I bought it so as not to have to keep renewing it from the library!"},{"Title":"The HO Model Railroading Handbook","review":"This book by Robert Schleicher is timeless.

In most books analyzing a director's different movies, it is relatively easy to draw connections between the stories and characters from film to film to come up with the themes that the director finds important.However, Tavernier's films have such wildly differing stories and characters, that it seems a little tough to discover what drives his story-telling. Stephen Hay, the author, picks out loneliness, doubt, and the importance of home in times of trouble as some of the most important elements of Tavernier's movies.One criticism I have of the book is that decent synopses of the movies aren't given before Hay delves into his analysis in each chapter. I doubt many readers will be familiar with all of Tavernier's films and the descriptions given in this book are pretty sparse.Another nit-pick would be that the movies are always referred to in their official language, which is French for most of them. Got to be annoying having the titles like \\"La Vie et Rien d'Autre,\\" \\"Un Dimanche a la Campagne,\\" and \\"Ca Commence Aujourd'hui\\" pop up in italics all the time. First of all, I had to remember which movie it was, and also I couldn't remember what the plot for that movie was, since the description wasn't that good to begin with.If you are into non-American movie directors, this might be a good book to pick up. But keep in mind that you'll want to be familiar with the plots of Tavernier's movie before reading it."},{"Title":"Alice","review":"Ellie Perkins lives a hard life with a drunken father and her confused brother.

I located the book in Oklahoma at a used book store. Upon reading the book I was struck with Ms. Flanigan's incredible ability to describe life in a rural community in the 1930's. I believe, as other reviewers stated on the dust cover, that Ms. Flanigan was writing from her heart about things that she had indeed experienced. I was carried away! What a incredible story! It was as if I had found a pearl on the beach. The language just added to the magic for me. I will now try to locate her other novel, &quot;Sudie&quot; and hope that Ms. Flanigan finds it within herself to write more. Bravo!!"},{"Title":"Alice","review":"I loved this book.

I like the Southern accent that Ellie and Sammy have and how it is so realistict, triumphant and touching. When I heard it was a cable Lifetime movie I wanted to watch it.

I wrote an on-line 5 star review at amazon.com for &quot;Sudie,&quot; (which was a made-for-cable movie which apparently airs periodically on the Lifetime channel)an excellent book which I enjoyed even MORE than &quot;Alice.&quot; Yet &quot;Sudie&quot; is also out-of-print. I am glad to hear that a film named &quot;Wildflower&quot; exists, as an interpretation of &quot;Alice.&quot; While of course the movie could not possibly better the book, the more exposure for Ms. Flanigan the better, is what I say! What a tragedy for a writer with such an amazing voice, and a gift for honest, not overly-sentimental storytelling to go so unrecognized.

It boils down the major biblical stories, both old and new testament, into one page overviews that are around third to fouth grade comprehension. Also the pictures are lovely. I believe the reading level listed of baby-preschool is incorrect - more like around age 10. Several adults I know (including myself) have also enjoyed it as a way to review the fundamental stories. I teach third grade PSR, and plan to give this as a present to each of my students at the end of the school year."},{"Title":"New Catholic Picture Bible","review":"I purchased this bible for my 7year old son as a Christmas present. We read this frequently as a bedtime story. Each story is only one page and there is a picture to go along with each one. I like the simplicity of the wording and my son enjoys hearing the stories as he learns about our faith. I'm even learning more as I read to him!One of the main reasons I purchased this particular Bible was that another reviewer had mentioned that it was like the one she owned as a child in the 70s. This really hit home for me as I wanted my son to receive the same type of religious experience as I did as a child.The clincher for me is that my son requests me to read to him from this Bible. He frequently looks through at the pictures and stories in the book himself. He even asks questions about the people in the story. This tells me that this Bible is really catching his attention. That we can have a talk about people and events from the Bible is awesome."},{"Title":"New Catholic Picture Bible","review":"Reason for Reading: Every Mon-Fri (mostly) we read a Bible story.We converted to Catholicism two Easter Vigils ago and were already in the middle of another Bible Story book at that time. When we finished it we moved onto this one, our first Catholic Bible story book. I'll review this book in particular and then compare how I found it to the usual Protestant or ecumenical Bible story books we had previously read.This is a nice gift Bible with puffy boards and a Presentation page to fill out. Each story is a two-page spread with the left-hand side usually being an illustration and the text on the right-hand side. There is some variety to this though as there are some longer stories where the picture is shrunk to half or a third of the page to make more room for the text and there are scattered throughout some short stories that take up one page with illustration and text sharing the same page. The illustrations are beautiful old-school paintings, very realistic and religious. Mary, Joseph and Jesus are always shown with a halo. Unfortunately no one is credited with the illustrations. The text is a delight to read, presented chronologically and has a suitable reading level for a wide range of ages.I've read many, many Bible story books through the 21 years I've been a mother. How did we find this specifically Catholic Bible story book different from all the others? The beginning and the end to start. This Bible starts with the fall of Lucifer and his \\"bad angels\\" and ends with the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Earth and the conversion of the first Christians. This Bible also has a definite emphasis on Christ and the Gospels. During the Old Testament, whenever an event or prophesy was made there would be an explanation of how this referred to or was fulfilled in the New Testament. I really appreciated this as it kept us focusing on Christ even during the Old Testament, just like during Mass. The other difference is of course, the Catholic element found in the New Testament where all the Biblical references to the Church are explained and events that are Holy Days are mentioned as such. Also the Eucharist, the Transubstantiation, the Stations of the Cross, the establishment of the Church and the Peter's Primacy are all told from within the Bible stories from whence they came.Thus, I have no problems with reading any Bible story book, Protestant or ecumenical, even as a Catholic, but I do see the advantages of a faith specific Bible story book. Given a choice, though, I would now chose a Catholic Bible story book over another.A lovely Catholic Bible story book, recommended for gift giving."},{"Title":"New Catholic Picture Bible","review":"I recieved the New Catholic Picture Bible for my first communion in 1970. I wanted to purchase something similar for my daughter's first communion. Imagine my surprise when I found the exact same Bible on Amazon! I ordered the book and it arrived in just a few days. Amazon made it possible for me to carry on a family tradition. The Bible is easy to read for an eight year old and each Bible story is contained on one page making it perfect for bedtime reading."},{"Title":"New Catholic Picture Bible","review":"I recently bought this bible for my 2nd grade son. He has been reading several stories a day, and has really enjoyed it.There are 43 short stories from the Old Testament and 74 from the New Testament. Here is a sample of stories:Old Testament: 1. The Story of Creation, 2. Adam and Even in Paradise, 3. Cain and Abel, 4. Noah's Ark, 5. The Promise to Abram, 6. Abraham's Sacrifice, 7. Jacob and Esau, 8. Josehph and His BrothersNew Testament: 1. The Annunciation, 2. The Visitation, 3. The Birth of Jesus, 4. The Shepherds, 5. The Presentation of Jesus in Temple, 6. Wise Men from the East, 7. The Flight into Egypt, 8. Jesus is Found in the Temple, 9. The Hidden Life of Jesus. 10. The Baptism of JesusEach two-page story spread has a full-color illustration to go with it. I would guess this bible is written at about a 3rd grade reading level. An advanced 2nd grade reader should have no problem with it. However, I think it would be great for any elementary age child with its colorful pictures and easily comprehensible stories. I also like the fact that the illustrations are realistic, not cartoon style as some other children's pictures bibles are.I am very glad I purchased this Bible, and I believe it will be one that my son will read again and again over the next few years, thus, helping to inculcate a love of scripture and lay a foundation for future study."},{"Title":"New Catholic Picture Bible","review":"I have a 6 and 3 year old boy and we have read it twice through already A big hit.

It simplifies French grammar...it gives you the rules (did you know there are rules for gender in French?) and makes it very very easy to, with a little work, pick up all the important parts of French grammar. There are exercises, with the English translations...words like \\"conditional\\" and \\"future perfect\\" are really explained (i.e. given the English equivalents) unlike many dictionaries, which just tell you \\"the pluperfect\\" is thus and so, etc. (Which means you need Latin) This is short, enjoyable, and clear....all the rules are here. It will not help with pronunciation...but with good CDs or tapes, this will fill in the grammatical foundation. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This was a great book. Sandra Dallas has once again given us an extremely well written, and totally captivating read. Set in 1933 Natchez Mississippi, this is the story of how Miss Nora Bondurant (from Denver Co.) came to know she had family in the deep south.I'm not going to summerize the book since it's already been done here, but this story is filled with the wonderful, colorful characters that Ms. Dallas always has in her books. I very highly recommend this read. If you're a fan of southern liturature, this is definitely for you. I have read and loved every one of Ms. Dallas's books and I most certainly wasn't disappointed here. Hope you enjoy!!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"New Mercies is the latest novel by Sandra Dallas, author of The Persian Pickle Club. Dallas' latest book tells of people haunted by the past. Nora Bondurant is haunted by the secret behind her divorce and her ex-husband's subsequent death. When she inherits property in Natchez, Mississippi, she is intrigued by the secrets behind her aunt's murder and a neighbor's suicide. And, in 1933, the people of Natchez are still haunted by the ghosts of the War between the States, slavery, and their own losses. Two ex-slaves, Ezra and Aunt Polly, are the key to Nora's search for answers.Dallas brings her characters and 1933 Natchez to life in this atmospheric novel."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This was a slow-going book for me but surely picked up the pace. Sandra Dallas has a talent at writing literature - not to be confused with simple fiction. This story, based in the early 30s in Natchez, MS weaves the past and present of the Bondurant family. Amalia is found murdered in her lush Southern home along with her long-time beau who is thought to have commit suicide after 'he' killed her.Her neice comes to town because she finds out she is heiress and thus begins the mystery of this Amalia and her neighbors. The book is a bit of healing for those intertwined in this plot.If you are a fan of southern reads, you will delight in this one. It will keep you wondering until the last few pages!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"In 1933 Nora Bondurant leaves her hometown of Denver to take over the pre-Civil War Avoca mansion that her recently murdered Aunt Amalia left her. Interestingly Nora did not know of the existence of her aunt as her parents never mentioned that her father had a sister or that she came from Natchez. Nora first learned of Amalia when a lawyer sent her a letter informing her she of her inheritance. In Natchez she learns that Amalia was killed by a courting neighbor in a murder suicide.Nora finds the change of scenery welcoming as she hides from feelings of guilt caused by her divorce from Tate and subsequent death of her ex spouse back in Denver. Simultaneously, she also feels somewhat like an outsider since no one will share much about her aunt, her lover who allegedly killed her, or their relationship. For that matter she knows little about this side of the family and no one is forthcoming with information. Still Natchez begins to feel like home due to Ezra, Aunt Polly, and others including the goats.The story line provides an intense perusal of Depression Era Mississippi especially \\"slaves\\" through the eyes of a Rocky Mountain expatriate. The murder-suicide adds interesting suspense as Nora wants to know more about her previously unknown aunt, but that takes a back seat to the deep scrutiny of 1930s Deep South relationships. Fans will cherish this powerful historical fiction and seek other works by Ms. Dallas (see THE PERSIAN PICKLE CLUB and BUSTER MIDNIGHT'S CAF&Eacute;).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"While I did have some trouble getting into this book, I decided that it was because I was reading it in ten or twenty page segments. It is much better read in several long sittings. That aside, I can honestly say that I was quickly drawn into the mysteries of Avoca.Dallas captures the language, the customs, the dress, everything about the depression era 30's with the understanding of a person who had lived then. So clearly, she has done her homework.I loved Aunt Polly. She is a woman filled with wisdom and many talents. I believe that she had a fondness for Nora that she was not to willing to show too quickly. She probably knew more about Nora, than Nora knew about herself, just by her instincts.The situation between Nora and her husband and how that all ended came as no surprise. Reading between the lines, it was all rather predictable. Still and all it was tragic.By the time Nora has been accepted by the main players as a member of \\"old Natchez\\" and the mystery has been solved, the book ends on a very upbeat note, in a room as bright and white as Avoca was dark and dreary in the beginning."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This book will not leave you disappointed. Has all the intrigue, mystery depth we know and love her for. I won't go into the story too much, but I love these books because she writes about Colorado, and her descriptions just make you feel like you are there. At Avoca, I could see the statue and the goats running around.We find out secrets in this book and our character learns to let go and love again. I wish I could give it more stars!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Sandra Dallas has a unique talent, and her readers are the lucky participants. _New Mercies_ is no exception. The characters are finely drawn, making the reader want to meet every single one. The underlying themes of suspense and mystery - even murder - keep this story interesting from the first page to the last.My only nit to pick is that Nora seems unrealistically enlightened for the time period. She is a divorced career woman in 1933. She has surprisingly modern attitudes about bi-racial relationships, homosexuality, and social equality even though she is an old-money former Junior Leaguer. Not totally realistic for the time period, IMO.That said, I love Southern literature - particularly set during the Great Depression - and Sandra Dallas offers a story that contains these elements and also kept me glued to my chair for the better part of two days.Definitely worth the time and money. You will remember these characters for a long time. I would give it five stars except for my reservations about Nora's enlightenment, and because I don't think this one quite measures up to _The Persion Pickle Club_."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"I read a couple of Sandra Dallas's novels several years ago and really enjoyed them, so I have no idea why it took me so long to pick up another one. I stumbled across this one in the library the other day and, as usual, I just loved it!Dallas often sets her novels in the early 1900's, and she gets the feel of those times so right somehow. This one is set in 1933 and it begins in the small town of Natchez , Mississippi , with a young lady from the North pulling up to a decrepit mansion. Nora Bondurant, normally a big city girl, recently received a telegraph that said her aunt, Miss Amalia Bondurant, has died and left her everything, including her house. This wouldn't raise much interest in Nora, most likely, except for two facts -- first of all, Nora had no idea she HAD an aunt in Mississippi . And secondly, said aunt, locally known as \\"The Goat Lady,\\" has been murdered.Nora arrives in Natchez to find the house falling down and two former slaves still trying to stay on top of the place. She immediately befriends the two, Ezra and his mother Aunt Polly, who, it turns out, were extremely dedicated to Miss Amalia. As she begins to explore the house and ask Ezra and Polly questions about her aunt, she also begins to meet the locals, many of whom can also shed some light on Miss Amalia. Soon she's learned a bit more about her aunt than she bargained for, however, and out of the past comes a truth that ultimately became the motive for her murder.This is a really entertaining novel, with great characters and a wonderful sense of place and time. I will be looking for more by her soon! And this time I mean that! Recommended!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Dallas is at the top of her game with this novel. The suspense she creates is superb, and this book makes for delicious reading. In a break from her previous novels, she's moved this tale out of the 19th century, but the past can't be forgotten in this tale of a Southern family and the remnants of a society still clinging to the values found in the Old South. This one successfully made its way around my circle of reading friends."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"My first experiene with Sandra Dallas was her book, \\"Prayers for Sale\\" which prompted me to search out her other writings. Although her writings are not labeled 'Christian fiction' as such, she has good sound Christian messages, presented in very subtle ways which are welcomed by Christian believers and not overwhelming to those who are not. This book is no exception. Her writing is finely crafted with wonderful turns of phrasing and excellent use of language. Her writing is a real treat to read and will more than satisfy the reader."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This is the sort of book you can easily finish in a day.

In spite of this flaw, I will continue to read Ms. Dallas' books."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"I like all of Sandra Dallas' books. I have read all of them to date. My favorite book by this author is \\"The Diary of Mattie Spenser\\". That is one of the best books I have ever read, and one of the only books I have read more than once. This book is good, but she has not topped the abovementioned book thus far. She is one of my favorite authors. She has a knack for telling a good story which I like. I also like to read about days past which most of her books are about with interesting characters."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Love every thing Ms. Dallas writes.

If you are a Sandra Dallas fan you must read this book."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"New Mercies is the first book by Sandra Dallas I've read. I plan to read others by her. Nora Bondurant is running away from a divorce, the secrets about which we are not privy. She receives a telegram that informs her she has inherited a house named Avoca in Natchez, Mississippi. Intriguing place. The setting is 1933 and Sandra Dallas gets the language and ways of the South down pat. We follow Nora as she travels from Colorado to Natchez and is challenged by the place and people there. Dallas weaves bits of Nora's past into the story but just segments here and there, enough to keep you wondering what is in her head that motivates her to be who she is. She peels away secrets throughout the story as Nora faces monumental decisions about her future and the future of Avoca. Good read, strongly recommend."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Sandra Dallas is a wonderful storyteller, and I hope she writes forever. That said, what captivated me at the beginning of this book were the Depression era details. I can remember my Colorado grandmother doing practical things in so much the same way, decades later, and I'm sure the habits were formed during the Depression. Perhaps you need this connection to the period and place to find the beginning of the book fascinating. I enjoyed reading about the behavior of a smart, capable Depression woman who was not a farm housewife, and not a child of luxury, but in between."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"I loved this book! I think its her best yet."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Sandra Dallas can be counted on to write an entertaining story - one I hate to put down. She does not disappoint. As I live in Colorado, I find that I know alot of the places she uses in her stories."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Sandra Dallas tells good tales. The Diary of Mattie Spenser has intriguing turns. New Mercies has southern charm. Unfortunately, Dallas succumbs to decorating her books with the bric-a-brac of pseudo research--without integrating it into the tale. It glows like Mattie's silver spoons in a sod house. Dallas demonstrates no mastery of letting her characters speak --choosing rather to sprinkle the dialog with newspaper headlines and abrubt colloquialisms. One does not have to include every historical figure, building, or event in a book. Dallas has the talent to write well; it is unfortunate that she chooses formulas which no doubt drive and satisfy publishers but do not create good writing. A warning to readers--positive reviews can indicate that others have abandoned a book because it was not worth reading. Before you waste money on Dallas books, sample her writing from the local library."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Another hit by Sandra Dallas--like all of her books, this one gives you a sense of a time and a place with compelling characters and intriguing plot twists."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Having read all of Ms. Dallas' other books, I was eager to add this one to my collection as well. However, despite enjoying the overall premise and character depictions, I have to confess this just wasn't my favorite.Basically, the plot centers upon Nora Bondurant, a recently divorced young Colorado woman who has just been summoned to Natchez, Mississippi, following the murder of an elderly aunt she never knew existed. As it's 1933, both Nora's divorce and Miss Amalia's murder are essentially considered scandals of equal caliber, which Nora must struggle to understand and move past. Only, as it soon becomes clear, the reclusive Miss Amalia's life was an endless snarrel filled with decades of secrets no one in town seems to want to discuss; and Nora certainly doesn't want to confide to anyone the real reason she ran out on David that night only a few months prior.While in town to settle Miss Amalia's affairs, Nora meets a number of colorful Natchezians, including local attorney Mr. Sam; his smart young niece Pickett, who quickly takes Nora under her wing; and Aunt Polly and Ezra, the mother and son who have lived on Avoca, Miss Amalia's estate, since the days of slavery.Although the overall premise of the novel seems promising, Dallas simply takes way too long to get there -- and then once she does, fails to deliver, as the novel does wrap up a few loose ends but ultimately has the characters wax on in a vague \\"oh well, it all happened so long ago, we can't possibly know and who cares?\\" route. If no one cares, then why write a book about it? Why read it?"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This book is my favorite Dallas book, and I've read almost all of them. I like that there's mystery involved; I was fascinated by her descriptions of Denver in the 1930's, and her small town Mississippi felt reminiscent of Miss Havisham's house. There's that flimy sense of nostalgia and romance here, like one sees in an old movie, but the characters have modern, true-to-life conflicts to resolve."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This book is s-l-o-w to get started.

Who really was her grandfather? I don't approve of leaving that type of issue \\"up in the air\\". I suppose that back in the 1930s (without modern day DNA testing) it would have been impossible to find out which man truly was her father's father, but I would have really liked a resolution of this question. However it did not seem to bother Nora as she accepted the two possibilities. The descriptions of southern living back in that time frame were very interesting and I basically really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"This was our local book club selection and I was sure I would hate it, because I dont' like murder mysteries. ut teh murder was sort of a side story in this very well written book."},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"Once again Ms Dallas has provided us with an insight into the every day lives and the life style of the folks from the era. In the tradition of Persian Pickle Club,The Chili Queen and The Diary of Mattie Spenser we have the weave of characters and history. Ms Dallas is also proof that a story can be well told without being offensive to anyone. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"New Mercies","review":"I have read both this book and ALL the reviews here. I read constantly and I am a connoisseur of Southern fiction and Southern Authors however I never write a review on a book I consider bad. For this one.....I'm making an exception! Ms. Dallas herself admits she based this book on a murder which happened in 1932 in Natchez. This murder is the basis for the wonderful non-fiction book \\"The Goat Castle Murder\\" by Sim Callon and Carolyn Vance Smith. The real life people involved in this case were from \\" old Natchez society families\\".Her fiction portrayal of a story that still causes debates among people in Natchez was very insulting to the memory of these four families. I had to laugh when reading reviews saying; \\"she captured 1930s Natchez. She didn't come close! She made fun of the food, beverages and the people!! This is a perfect example of WHY writers should \\"write what they know\\". I also laughed at the review that said;\\"she did her research\\". NO ! She did not! Had she \\"done\\" her research, she would never have sullied Jennie Merrill,Octavia Dockery, Duncan Minor and Dick Dana's memory the way it was done in this book!If your looking for real southern fiction to read that \\"does indeed capture place\\", pick authors from Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana. Don't pick an author from Colorado who took a weekend trip to Mississippi, picked up a non-fiction book and decided she could spin it into fiction!

Rather than a history of opera or a list of synopses of well known operas, this book attempts to define what opera is, what sets it apart from other art forms, what its component parts are, and what makes it magical. The author neither speaks down to nor over the heads of the novice but manages to simultaneously speak to the uninitiated and the learned amateur. He provides an incredible amount of food for thought without being overwhelming. The book is divided into two parts, Part I is titled &quot;Structure&quot; and contains 8 chapters. This is the most valuable part of the book in my opinion, certainly the most unique. He discusses &quot;The Nature of Opera,&quot; &quot;The Conventions of Opera,&quot; &quot;The Libretto,&quot; &quot;The Music,&quot; &quot;The Components of Music,&quot; &quot;The Singers,&quot; &quot;The Orchestra,&quot; and &quot;Production of Opera.&quot; I have never before seen an introduction to opera that included any discussion, much less an intelligent informative discussion, of the libretto (its importance, how it differs from a stage play, etc.) or production values (sets, the role of opera theatre architecture, stage direction, etc.). In the chapter on &quot;The Singers,&quot; he discusses the various voice types by range as well as the quality of voices, i.e., lyric, dramatic, coloratura. In the chapter &quot;The Components of Music,&quot; he discusses the musical structure of the opera by identifying the differences between recitatives, arias (including the various types of solo arias), ensembles, and choruses. The second half of the book is a brief history of opera. He sets Mozart as the pivotal figure and discusses all pre-Mozart opera in one chapter followed by a chapter on Mozart. Chapters follow on Italian opera, French opera, Nationalism in opera (Bohemia and Russia), German opera, Late Romantic opera, and 20th century opera. Each chapter throughout the book includes a list of suggested further reading for additional information on the topic covered in that chapter. The book concludes with a brief but helpful glossary of operatic/musical terms and a comprehensive index."},{"Title":"Strategic Planning For Success: Aligning People, Performance, and Payoffs","review":"This is a practical guide that dares to take you far beyond the next quarterly results. A challenge to work towards a future that we can all share - and a supportive and detailed framework to help you and your organization thrive as you create it.The book is a real compendium of Mega Planning. It goes well beyond previous texts and shows how many other issues become important when attempting a serious plan for the future. Suddenly we are confronted with a range of stakeholders, internal and external, some of whom we might rather not remember, and many of whom will be resistant to real change and would prefer a strategic plan that sleeps peacefully in the filing cabinet for five years. So this book talks a lot about Creating Change (as opposed to merely Managing Change), the roles required and the kinds of resistance that may be met. In the same vein it covers every aspect of strategic planning, from paradigms and leadership to mental models.To mention just a few of the topics that caught my attention: the contrast and the interplay between systems and system thinking; the importance of feedback between all parties; the extended problem solving method; how to scan to find the payoffs in planning (and so make strategy more attractive); the ongoing balance between process (what you're doing) and the results you are aiming for (which can sometimes be undercut by the process you use).There are some important extensions of models - Albrecht's Four Business Logics become six. There are quotes and classical definitions that are very useful, sometimes humourous.Remembering that half the effort of Mega Planning is to build alliances with key players who are not used to thinking beyond their own success (usually immediate), included is a PowerPoint display and a neat Appendix on the new paradigms of teaching (should be in every place of learning). And, or course, the Code of Conduct is a challenge to all practitioners, just as this whole book is a challenge to all of us who want there to be life beyond the next quarter.Ronald Forbes, PhDLeaderskill Group Pty Ltd"},{"Title":"Strategic Planning For Success: Aligning People, Performance, and Payoffs","review":"I have been using this book as a guide for strategic planning in several business projects and with my PhD and MBA students.It is a complete and practical guide to develop and implement a strategic plan focused on identifying measurable positive social contributions.

He loves trains period, and while he knows most of his colors he still loves listening to their names. He had a blast learning the different names of the cars. I blush to admit that although I grew up around trains, I only ever learned a few of the names for the different cars, namely the engine and the caboose so I never knew them to tell the children. They have poured over this books for days now. What surprised me is that he grasped the speed implied in the blurred lines. I hadn't thought he understood what that meant yet, but obviously he does.

After the Nazis took over Vienna he fled to Chicago, where he spent the rest of his life &amp; is now remembered as the founder of &quot;self psychology.&quot;That said: you have got to have an appetite for exploration into the deep recesses of our psychology &amp; the ways we live our lives.This biography will appeal to those who have lived through the same era as Heinz Kohut &amp; who have encountered the less authoritarian &amp; more compassionate school of psychoanalysis now known as self-psychology which made major changes in reformatting the revered Freudian theory &amp; practice.A deep drink from an unusual well - well-written, if somewhat dense in places. Well worth it, however, if you are at all interested in the signs of intelligent life during America's post WWII years which led up to the human potential movement.I'm amazed that I read it because my mind was boggled by the subject &amp; the author! What did I learn? Zounds - it'll take me years to process a fraction of what has been brought to the surface!"},{"Title":"Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst","review":"For those who knew in vivo many of the characters forming the cast of this epic, reading the book would have an illusory experience of deja vu.Kohut and many of the members of the Institute for Psychoanalysis in Chicago had the courage to launch a new system that shook the freudian orthodoxy in its very foundations --- while in so doing managing to enrich this, until then, fading system.I highly recommend this biography as a fair and just assessment of the man (and of the men and women that formed his inner circle) and of his grasp on narcissim and empathy.Kudos to Strozier!"},{"Title":"Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst","review":"As an analyst, can one espouse a therapeutic modality (self-psychology) if the founder is an individual clearly in conflict and denial, as Kohut was, vis-a-vis his Judaism? My answer is no! Even though he was elected president of the American Psychoanalytic Association, the widespread opinion was that he suffered a narcissitic personality disorder. His narcissistic rage was clearly most evident in his projecting of total hatred onto anything remotely connected with his Jewishness. Two of the most telling incidents in Strozier's book is when Kohut went to lunch in a kosher delicatessen with Paul Ornstein, one of his disciples(with a rabbinic background), whose analyst wife is an Auschwitz survivor. Kohut purposely ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with a glass of milk, which had the effect of humiliating not only the waiter, but both Ornsteins. Is this an individual whose philosophy one wants to follow? It was reported in Martin Bergmann and Milton Jucovy's book \\"Generations of the Holocaust\\" that Kohut's treatment of his patient, Mr. A, who had to flee the Nazis in Germany, only focussed on the patient's structural deficit. Kohut saw no connection between the child being a Holocaust survivor and his psychopathology. Is this characteristic of the empathy so widely touted as being practiced by \\"self-psychology\\"? Otherwise, Strozier's biography is interesting, although it gets bogged down in theoretical dogma, and could have used some tighter editing of chapters."},{"Title":"Dogen's Formative Years in China: An Historical Study and Annotated Translation of the Hokyo-ki","review":"Kodera's engaging book is an annotated translation and study of Dogen's Hokyo-ki, recording Dogen's formative years - both prior to - and during his trip to Sung China, in search of an 'authentic teacher.' It thus relates details of Dogen's meeting with Master Ju-ching (Tendo Nyojo) at the Ching-te monastery on Mount T'ien-tung. Being the most formative influence upon Dogen's early career, such an account will have an obvious appeal among those currently engaged with Dogen's teachings, in the West.In translation, the core text of the Hokyo-ki is short, comprising 27 pages. The bulk of Kodera's text - 258 pages in all, is taken up with annotations and analyses, an extensive bibliography (listing primary Chinese sources, Japanese sources, modern sources in several languages) - plus an edited version of the 'Chinese' (kanbun) Hokyo-ki text.Kodera's translation is flawless, the annotations helpful, the analyses for the most part, well informed. While sympathetic in his treatment of Dogen, Kodera occasionally notes problematic aspects of Dogen's thought. For example, there are certain discrepancies between Dogen account of Ju-ching's teaching in the Hokyo-ki - and what appears - independently of the Hokyo-ki, in Chinese records. Kodera touches on Dogen's criticism of Ta-hui - a leading Lin-chi master of the Sung. However, as with Hee Jin Kim's study (Dogen:Mystical Realist)such issues remain unresolved - shelved as an aporia. Given Dogen's rather polemical turn of mind after 1243, which went hand-in-hand with an endeavour to re-invent or redefine himself -vis-a-vis other schools - such matters deserved better attention. Despite the pluralistic outlook found in the Shobogenzo Zuimonki, the Hokyo-ki finds Dogen claiming that the Soto (Ts'ao-tung) school alone, has preserved the transmission of 'True Dharma-eye' - with certificates of succession, to 'prove' it. This is prob-lematic, and needed further clarification. Hence - the 'four stars' rating."},{"Title":"Dogen's Formative Years in China: An Historical Study and Annotated Translation of the Hokyo-ki","review":"This is the only complete English translation of Dogen's journal.

The fact that all the stories dwell on the same theme of lonliness and searching for connection, it reads more like a novel than a randomly selected set of stories.

Gilbert has a way of creating a very vivid scene and situation, so as to wrap your interest around the characters promptly.

Each story is a microcosm of its own dishing up a multitude of human foibles and plights. I much preferred the audio format over the text version. Since adding it to my car's audiobook playlist, I have listened to the collection almost like a favorite album. I enjoy the stage-like performance of the narrator and, of course, the story crafting of the author. Narrator Coleen Marlo gives each story its due like equally loved children. She does justice to the written word with her mastery of nuance. She builds each character and modulates her narration to suit the widely divergent tales and their psychological geographies. Most of Gilbert's pilgrims have classic American vernacular accents. Marlo bags the usual stereotypical vernacular and gives the characters carefully inflected personalities that up the zing on the dialogue. Though it is easy to assume that Gilbert heard very specific voices as she wrote-- or even lived through-- these tales it's certain that Marlo herself has infused the stories with some American adventures and sensibilities of her own--a direction that had the author applauding I'm sure once she heard the outcome of their collaboration."},{"Title":"Pilgrims","review":"&quot;Pilgrims&quot; is a fascinating work - like a vice slowly tightening, Gilbert clamps on to the reader and never lets go.

When his book came out (the first of what he intended to be two volumes) on the technique of psychoanalysis, all of us read it and found it profound as well as very enjoyable. We all tried to see little pieces of the analyses he did with Marilyn Monroe (who even lived a while with Greenson and his wife), Frank Sinatra, Vivian Leigh, and others in show business. Each of us had our own ideas of which of Greenson's anecdotes related to these and other people. I highly recommend this book and wish it was not so expensive. I long ago sold my only copy for a pittance and now wish I had it back. I took this book to heart and my own most recent book (\\"Autobiography of Lee Harvey Oswald\\")which I edited, contains much that I learned from Greenson and many, many others (including one of his Greenson's analysts--Otto Fenichel). Another of my books \\"Analyzing Leaders, Presidents and Terrorists\\" was likewise inspired by such people. As a matter of curiosity, I came across psychoanalysis when my Hungarian uncle attended some of Freud's university classes in Vienna long ago. How valuable that information was!Dr. Diane Holloway Cheney"},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"William Ouchi has taken his management and organizational expertise and applied it to a detailed and thorough analysis of public and private schools in six North American cities. His research is thorough and extensive and his conclusions on what we need to do to fix our K-12 schools are potentially revolutionary. His writing style is clear and concise. He includes personal anecdotes and timely references along with interesting observations about the central administration, teachers, classrooms and students which he surveyed. With the extensive data and common sense conclusions, parents and school districts should be able to fashion a better educational structure and thus a better learning situation for their students."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"This book contains many common sense suggestions for improving our schools; however, his figures for Catholic school spending are off. The notes show he did just very cursory research on the subject. This makes me leery of the whole book."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"I live in Seattle and have children in the public schools here (also, I'm an education activitist here). Dr. Ouchi has written quite a revisionist history of Seattle education and used some cunning tricks to do so. For example, on page 37 he states that it was reported by a local newspaper that our last superintendent, Joseph Olchefske,was to resign at the end of the school year. Immediately following that sentence he gives a reason why (making it look as though that is what the newspaper, the Seattle Times, reported). The reason, as Dr. Ouchi, states, was that the superintendent \\"had been criticized for moving too slowly to close small schools and reduce central office expenses\\". Nothing is further from the truth and if Dr. Ouchi had bothered to actually read either of our two local newspapers, he would know this. Our superintendent was ousted for mismanaging $34 million dollars (he was an investment banker and possibly could have done more but hey, it's only money). Dr. Ouchi tries to hide this information in another section of the book by calling them accounting errors. If only they had been simple errors!He also tries to make it seem as if Seattle teachers, by voting more than 85% a no-confidence vote, were trying to get back at the superintendent for his work in changing the procedure for teacher removal. Again, untrue. Teachers voted against him because of his lack of ability in running the district. They were joined by the principals executive board and by so many parents that he was forced to resign. The only supporters he had left sat on the school board which promptly saw the majority overturned in the last election.Couple this disinct penchant for fudging the truth to support his theories with the recent revelations in print and on television about the so-called Houston miracle makes this entire book suspect."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"This is a book that I fervently hope will start a revolution in America's schools. It's message, one that calls for leadership by empowered principals rather than a conformist bureaucracy, is based on impeccable research and is delivered with fluid, engaging prose. I recommend it to anyone who cares about our children and their future."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"As a member of the Hawaii State Board of Education I found Dr. Ouchi's book to be insightful and filled with practical solutions to common systemic problems.The many examples of successful schools filled with traditionally under-achieving students really break the stereotype that certain kids can't learn. And the sympathetic explanation of the systemic impediments facing teachers clearly show that we don't have a problem with our educators -- it is the system.I highly recommend this book to all education policy makers, legislators, educators and parents. Making Schools Work is a realistic and optimistic vision of our future."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"This book explains how the organization of a school system can affect student performance. It is filled with stories and data that are interesting, uplifting and compelling. I especially like Professor Ouchi's response to the question, \\"What makes a school great?\\" His Seven Keys to Success are \\"right on,\\" in my opinion. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding why some schools and school systems work while others do not."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"Anyone who complains about public schools should read this book. It is going to be VERY important to the national dialog about how we pull up our socks and get busy making things better.I know you are busy, so I encourage you to do a good old college-style \\"gut the book\\" exercise on this one. It reads well and is only as long as it needs to be (262 uncrowded pages). Speed-devour 100 pages a night and you can get the essence in 2 stints.I've been voraciously consuming education reform literature, and this one is by far the best of the lot. It gives me a considerable sense of hope that Governor Schwartzenegger has read it and reportedly gave it to some people as a Christmas present. I suspect that this will be a book that many, many people read and talk about.Prof. Ouchi worked with a team of researchers to analyze the organizations of hundreds of schools and districts, documenting trends in function and dysfunction and examples of turnarounds. He took the findings and synthesized them into seven \\"keys.\\" He does a great, sensitive job of explaining how none of these alone is the magic answer -- rather, progress is made by working on all seven together. One of the super things about this book: it is very grounded in the reality that education is about people. He speaks to the reader as a potential reformer, and never gets highfalutin or pessimistic. He reminds the reader often that the people involved almost never WANT bad things to happen. Things just seem to work out that way when the organization is busted.The \\"Keys\\" are:1) Every Principal is an Entrepreneur2) Every School Controls its Own Budget3) Everyone is Accountable for Student Performance and for Budgets4) Everyone Delegates Authority to Those Below5) There Is a Burning Focus on Student Achievement6) Every School Is a Community of Learners7) Families Have Real Choices Among a Variety of Unique SchoolsAnother great thing about the book: it prepares you to get involved constructively in making YOUR school or district better.

Ouchi makes a convincing case for the restructuring of our school systems. It disassembles many of the current myths in the problems of school systems to get to the core of the problem: the central control of the power and money. This is an engaging book that makes its points clearly and concisely."},{"Title":"Making Schools Work : A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need","review":"Like many books in this field, things that should be considered obvious are presented like the author has discovered the mystery of the atom. Ouchi appropriately takes potshots at top-heavy school systems. He makes the case for school independence in direction and budgeting. All perfectly reasonable. Ouchi provides examples of schools that work because they went their own way, made their own choices. Unfortunately, the book is altogether too heavy handed. In the model schools, no one ever teaches a bad lesson and every child is smiling, while test scores \\"rocket\\" upwards. It is too much. One of his main case studies is Houston. Too bad it was revealed after publication that there was systematic lying going on in that system about graduation rates and who knows what else.

You learn from this novel, both about what it is like to be a member of an EMT emergency crew, and about how important it is to face up to your responsibility--even for something very serious. I can't recommend this too much."},{"Title":"Radiation Hormesis","review":"Radation Hormesis is a wonderful book that has profound implications regarding the linear no-threshold hypothesis of safe levels of radiation. In short, chronic exposure to radiation is not the same as acute exposure to radiation. Paracelsus said it this way, \\"The dose makes the poison.\\"Consider vitamin C, not enough causes scurvy, but too much can be toxic. This book is filled with technical studies that show that Paracelsus's dictum applies to ionizing radiation; the dose is what counts! This book dispels the irriational fear and hysteria of radiation. That's why I like it!"},{"Title":"Radiation Hormesis","review":"I was very disappointed in this unbalanced view the author presented. It fails to present supporting information that refutes the concept of radiation hormesis. Many of the examples presented as hormesis are actually stress induced changes that may reduce the overall fitness of the organism. For example, the ecologic radon studies of Bernard Cohen which are stated to support hormesis have been shown by Drs. R. William Field and Jay Lubin to be without merit. However, I did find some of the writing heuristic."},{"Title":"Adeptus Major","review":"I read this book in its first edition about 8 months ago. I completely fell into the story and couldn't stop reading it. The characterization is fantastic and I feel like I really got to know the two main characters. The alternate modern world that Alex Mykals has created is very realized and believable. This book has everything I love in a good novel. It has a slight fantasy edge, political intrigue, a new society to learn about, and the love story involved is probably one of my favorites of all time. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good story that will keep the reader engrossed from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Adeptus Major","review":"I found this book a pleasant surprise. I was expecting something written in ancient Greek times but instead I got a novel about modern life on an alternate earth in which Atlantis survived the great flood. There was no 'sinking' of Atlantis as such. It overcame the odds and become one of the most powerful nations on earth today. Atlantis is a powerful monarchy government and runs the country pretty much with no general elections, although people are voted into advisory positions to help advise the nobles on various matters of importance.But modern day Atlantis isn't perfect, trouble brews in the form of terrorists who are trying to overthrow the current government... why or what for wasn't really entirely made clear to me, perhaps in a sequel? Although this novel really does stand alone the ending certainly could promise more. One point to note is that the American govt just wasn't portrayed that nicely, so if you are an American you may find the American links and general suspicion of American policy etc annoys you but I'm Australian so I had no personal feelings about that one way or another.Our two main characters are Evelynee (the Crown Princess) and Alleandre (ordinary, everyday Ally, who by the way has powerful physic powers). Ally literally bowls Ally over on their first meeting, by crashing tackling her thus saving her from an assassins bullet. Evelynne is mostly fine however Ally is not and is admitted to hospital in a serious condition. Evelynne is deeply shocked at meeting fragile looking Ally who saved her life at nearly the cost of her own. When Ally is ok to travel Evelynee persuades her to return with her to Atlantis to recover.Evelynee is everything Ally is not... beautiful, confident and assured of her place in the world. Ally believes that she is ugly and was traumatised at a young age and is afraid that people will laugh and jeer at her. Even though she has strong physic powers her confidence in herself is next to non existent. The emotional ties that begin to bind these two remarkable women is brought to life easily and wonderfully for a first written novel. We travel the journey with them; the way they start off as strangers and quickly become friends then more is woven skillfully throughout the novel. The novel is a mixture of romance and suspense and I felt the two subjects were handled very well together. For a first novel I found it well written with plenty of descriptive language, not overwhelming at all but good enough to describe feelings, thoughts and surroundings, the ending could've perhaps been more but other than that, well done. I am sure that as the Alex (the author) hones her craft we will see more from her in the not too distant future. Try this novel I hope you won't be disappointed, I wasn't."},{"Title":"Adeptus Major","review":"It's no secret to anyone who has read my reviews - I don't generally like science fiction books. However, I could not easily pass up this wonderful story by Alex Mykals. I believe this is her only published novel, but hope she delivers more in the future.Speaking of the future, that's where this one is set, but it almost seems to also be set in the past. Mykals brings us Evelynne de Molay, heir to the throne of Atlantis. Due to the expectations of her position, Evelynne is in the proverbial closet. That is, until she meets and falls in love with the supernaturally talented Ally Tretiak - after Ally saves her from an assassin's bullet. Not only is Ally a foreigner, she is also a woman - both traits that make her an unsuitable partner for Evelynne.As Ally begins to build a new life on Atlantis and continues to earn the attentions of the princess, she becomes a better candidate for the princess' affections - except she's still a woman. The only question is... can this be overcome?This book took a lot of imagination on the author's part. She does such a nice job telling the story, that even the seemingly outrageous parts are believable. As a reader, I felt things fit together really well; she does a nice job bringing together futuristic technology with knights, social classes, and battle. I would certainly recommend this to anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"Adeptus Major","review":"A world that is vivid and as real as my own, characters that I can grow to care about, and a sweet love story..what is not to enjoy about this book?

I particularly enjoy the mix of a modern setting that includes the Kingdom of Atlantis as a major power in the world and the paranormal.The romance doesn't overtake the storyline and is woven carefully through the story along with the suspense of terrorism. The ending leaves you wanting more and the next couple of stories will be very welcome.Alex has done a fine job of writing this novel and creating a new language as well. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and hope you will too."},{"Title":"Adeptus Major","review":"Very few authors are able to portray psychic abilities in a believable way, let alone an entire fictional society.

Carver, is a NT scholar with special expertise in Johannine studies. He also is a mystic who has penetrated to the heart of Jesus' Upper Room discourses in the Fourth Gospel. The reader of this study senses that Carver himself enjoys the experience of the Spirit that Jesus defines there. The volume is the culmination of years of teaching both graduate and undergraduate students. It cites the most authoritative studies of the Fourth Gospel, Catholic as well as Protestant, drawing also from the deep wells of Christian mysticism. The author writes from within the tradition of John Wesley, but often reads Wesley through the lenses of St. John of the Cross, whom he extensively quotes. The book represens a cross-fertilization of the Catholic (both Eastern and Western) and Protestant traditions. which gives the study its uniqueness and richness. Dr. Carver is also a seasoned and effective preacher; this book offers a wealth of practical, edifying sermon material for the minister who would proclaim the Johannine Christ's promise of the Spirit."},{"Title":"The Fish","review":"David Lee has created for himself a solid niche in the literary scene: who else writes narrative poetry set in grimy, failure, male domination .... and makes of it a wise observation of the universal human story?

He does argue, however, that Trailin' - one of Brand's early westerns - warrants reading (and I agree) as it vividly illustrates Brand's almost magical, archetypal western that was so popular in the years before World War II.The setting in Trailin' is vague and uncertain, and apparently this is typical of Max Brand's stories. We only know that it occurs somewhere in Brand's mythical west. (Contrastingly, Louis L'Amour's geography and landmarks were carefully researched.)Brand's characters are nearly as mythical as his geography. The hero in Trailin', Anthony Bard, overcomes all obstacles to track the killer of his father across the open plains and mountains of the wild west. Bard's success is especially remarkable as he had no prior wilderness experience, having been raised in a wealthy setting in New York.His cold, calculating adversary, Steve Nash, is a classic villain, one who even resorts to killing Bard's horse. The action-packed plot had some unexpected twists, but ultimately the ending seem contrived, revealing a secret that could have been disclosed much earlier.Max Brand was one of the many pseudonyms of Frederick Schiller Faust, creator of more than 350 westerns in the 1920s and 1930s.Today, classics like Shane, The Big Sky, The Virginian, Lonesome Dove, The Ox-Bow Incident, and Monte Walsh as well as L'Amour's popular fiction largely overshadow Brand's novels. Nonetheless, despite a notable lack of verisimilitude, Max Brand's action tales offer enjoyable, light reading for fans of westerns."},{"Title":"Trailin' (Dodd, Mead silver star westerns)","review":"A well written story that holds your interest from beginning to end.

Readers should not confuse this shorter book with the two volume set he wrote re his voluminous HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY. MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY is a clearly written introduction to Medieval/Scholastic philosophy and theology. The \\"unintiated\\" will be impressed with both the topic and Father Copleston's written expression.Father Copleston started this book with a brief history of early Catholic Christianity. The earliest Christians were not philosophers, but they had to write apologia to defend themselves from whom they considered \\"pagans\\" and the Roman authorities if only to survive as a religious community and for physical survival. Hence early Christian apologia had to rely on the Greek and Latin languages and intellectual disciplines to \\"make their case.\\" Some of the early Christian apologists wrote defenses of their views against other Christians and pagan \\"oppressors.\\" Some of these men included Justin Martyr (c. 100 AD-c. 160 AD). Father Copleston also included some of the arguements of St. Ignatius of Antioch (c.50-107)who, by the way, was one of the first if not the first, to describe the Early Church as the Catholic Church.Father Copleston made effective transition to the \\"Early\\" Middle Ages.\\" He commented on St. Augustine (354-430)who wrote, among other titles, THE CITY OF GOD. This work was originally written against pagans, and the work was a detailed explanation that life after death should be the goal rather than the corrupt City of Man. Father Copleston effectively explained the historical situation during St. Aguustine's lifetime, and, as bad as the situation was for the declinning Roman Empire, the City of God should be the ultimate goal of early Christians. In other words, the disintegration of the Roman Empire was not reason for dispair. Boethius (480-520)was mentioned in this section of the book, and Father Copleston explained Boethius's work titled THE CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY whereby Boethius considered philosophy as a guide to revelation which was an avenue of thought for one facing death.Father Copleston wrote a careful precis of early Medieval thinkers. The chapter (s) devoted to the Early Middle Ages included Eregina (815-877) whom some Medieval historians consider the first philosopher in Europe since St. Augusitine. Eregina speculated that thinking and knowledge of God were somehow combined. While Eregina was critisized for being a pantheist, his work influenced later Medieval thinkers.One of the problems that Father Copleston discussed was that of reason and revelation. Catholic authorities knew that reason and logic had their place in explaining The Faith, but the concern was that the \\"wrong\\" use of reason and logic could undermine the The Faith. St. Anselm (1035-1109)helped solve this problem by attemtping to \\"bridge the gap\\" between reason and revelation. St. Anselm wrote two influential works titled MONOLGOIUM and PROSLOGIUM to explain how logic and reason could explain revelation, The Faith, and even mysticism. Father Copleston clearly showed that Medieval historians are right when they consider St. Anselm The Father of Scholasticism.Circa the time of St. Anselm, Medieval universities were started and coexisted with the monastic schools. The latter were simply not large enough to accomodate the influx of students. Some of the Medieval unversities and their approximate dates of origin were Notre Dame (1150),Bologna (1158), Paris (c. 1200), etc. The dates indicate when these universities were chartered rather than first started. As the undersigned wrote elsewhere, the curriculum consisted of the Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic) and the Quadrivium (Plane Geometry, Arithmetic, Astronomy,and Music). Advanced studies included Medicine, Law, and Theology-the latter being called The Queen of the Sciences.Among those who taught at these universiteis was Peter Abelard (1073-1142)whose work in logic and philosophy established a basis for later studies. Abelard wrote a text titled SIC ET NON (YES AND NO)as a book dealing with apparent contradictions of the Bible, Church Councils, Church Fathers, etc. This book was designed to assist students to logically resolve these problems and was not written to undermine The Faith. Father Copleston was clear that Abelard experienced trouble because, basically, he \\"toyed\\" with The Holy Trinity which St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153)feared could undermine revelation. Father Copleston also cites Peter Lombard (1100-1160) who wrote THE FOUR BOOKS OF SENTENCES which was was a theology text designed to solve theological contracitions.While Father Copleston's book dealt mostly with Catholic thinking, he included a short chapter re Jewish and Islamic scholars whose influence in Medieval Europe cannot be underestimated. Copleston cited Avacina (980-1037) and Averroes (1128-1198). Both men examined Greek thought, and their work re Aristotle entered Europe via the University of Salerno and Spain. The European Catholic Scholastics did not refuse Islamic studies, and St. Thomas Aquinas referred to Averroes as The Commentator-The Commentator on Aristotle. Jewish scholars got \\"honorable mention.\\" Copleston evaluated Maimonides (1135-1204)who attempted to make THE TORAH and Judism more reasonable in lieu of the influence of Greek thought.Father Copleston's treatment of St. Thomas Aquinas (115-1274), while brief, was succinct and clear. Father Copleston was clear that while St. Thomas Aguinas accepted Aristotle's work, The Angelic Doctor (St. Thomas Aquinas) did not think Aristotle as infallible. Note should be made that St. Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), who was St.Thomas Aquinas' best known teacher,also did not think Aristotle as infallibe. St. Thomas tried to reconcile reason and revelation. Reason could lead men to God by examination of the natural/physical world. According to St. Thomas Aquinas, reason could not fully explain God's existence. Therefore, revelation had to given careful attention. Logic and reason could explain God via Creation. Revelation was explained via the Bible, Church Fathers, Church councils, etc.To argue that St. Thomas Aquinas influeced subsequent Scholastic Philosophy is an understatement. He had an angry debate with Siger Brabant (1235-1282)who argued that revelation had a \\"twofold truth\\"(relgion and reason). Father Copleston stated that according to St. Thomas Aquinas, truth was One. If reason and the Bible/revelation appeared to disagree, this was due to the limitations of men's understanding rather than any actual contraditions.The Francicans who originated about the same time as the Dominicans reacted to much of St.Thomas Aquinas' thinking. Some of the disagreement was due to the fact that St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Albertus Magnus were Dominicans. The Franciscans included St. Bonaventure (1221-1274)who argued that will and mysticism were the road to understanding The Faith. Duns Scotus(1265-1308)also presented similar arguments as St. Bonaventure in that intuition and will took precedence over reason. This is not to say that St. Bonaventure and Duns Scotus dismissed reason. The Francisan William Ockham (1288-1348)exceeded both St. Bonaventure and Duns Scotus. Ockham argued that experience and intuition were crucial and the shortest means of understanding revelation. Ockham thought that reason and logic were too laborious and a waste of time. The simpler method is known as \\"Ockham's Razor.\\" The shift in Medieval Philosophy emphasized the exact meaning of language rather than reason and concepts which is why some of these men were known as Nominalists.While Father Copleston was a Jesuit and a proponent of Thomism, he did not neglect the Medieval mystics. One cannot write about Catholic Philosophy and honestly neglect mysticism. Some of the mystics were Thomas Kempis (1380-1472) who wrote THE IMITATION OF CHRIST, and Meister Eckert (1360-1420). Both ment thought that Ockham and St. Thomas Aquinas tried to prove too much and neglected the \\"Inner Spark\\" and intuition and self refletcion. What this section of the book emphasized was that while there were serious differences between Medieval philosphers, the study was a continuous history with no actual abrubt break.Father Copleston devoted the last section of the book to Medieval political thought. Father Copleston stated that St. Augustine regarded the state as a necessary evil due to men's fallen nature. On the other hand, St. Thomas Aquinas saw the state as an agent to promote \\"the common good\\" and to improve men's material and spiritual well being. One political thinker that Father Copleston examined was Marcellius of Padua (1275-1342)who thought the Catholic Church and the Pope had too much political power and contributed to the instability of Medieval Northern Italy. Marcellius' argued that Church political influence accelerated problems in this area when the disputes could be more easily resolved by the German monarchs. What could have been mentioned is that the Catholic Church had suffered first from German interference earlier during Medieval History.Father Copleston's book titled MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY is well written and informative. Readers may notice that this reviewer first reviwewed Father Copleston's more compresenive two volume work. This book reviewed above should have been reviewed first. The reason it was not reviewed first is that the undersigned could not locate it in his jungle of books, monographs, etc. The undersigned highly recommends MEDIEVAL PHILOSOPHY.

In the first story, \\"Icicles,\\" Poppleton, a pig, doesn't want to knock down the icicles attached to his roof, even though others tell him the icicles could cause problems. Then one day a small finch flies into one of the icicles and, like dominos, they break off one after another. But the finch and Poppleton figure out a use for the broken icicles.In \\"The Bust,\\" the reader learns that every winter, Poppleton gives himself a project, and this winter his project is to make a bust of his neighbor's head. But he just can't remember what Cherry Sue's eyes look like . . . what her hair looks like . . . what her nose looks like. So Poppleton keeps knocking on her door, studying Cherry Sue's features, and leaving. Finally, Cherry Sue becomes exasperated enough to tweak Poppleton's nose, at which point he tells her what he's doing.In the third story, \\"The Sleigh Ride,\\" Poppleton wants to go on a sleigh ride, but it seems that every friend he invites to go with him is busy baking.

I'd first like to say that the review that states the actual story doesn't start until page 48 is wrong. The author's journal doesn't start until page 48, but if you read the first 47 pages there are many references to strange happenings in the house. And the first 47 pages help to set up the story. I really enjoyed this book but it really gave me the creeps. Don't read it when you're by yourself is my suggestion! It really was like having a conversation with someone- a very easy quick read- in fact I read it in one day it had me hooked so bad I couldn't put it down! Maybe it helps that I live in Western New York and that added to the creepiness. I definitely think this book is worth the read.

The book is formatted like a diary, which I thought was interesting. It is pretty spooky, and will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Echoes of a Haunting","review":"From the viewpoint of someone who moved in after this family, I thought the book was well written. This book brought back some memories and visions that were forgotten over the years. It was a book that made me see the house that I knew as home all over again and in a totally different light. My parents always had an explaination for any of the little perks that happened while we lived there. I could not put this book down. I have read the book, gave a copy of the book for a gift, asked friends to read it, and will be ordering another copy for my children. This book put me back in the house that I knew as a child and gave me goosebumps. My whole family has either read the book or are ordering the book. We have all had similiar responses to this book. It is great reading for anyone, as it is intriguing not scary. It puts you at the scene and is written in a way that keeps you interested. Eventhough I knew how the story would end, I could not put the book down until I had read the whole book. I just wish that I hadn't read the book so fast. I am looking forward to anymore books that Clara Miller will be writing. I can only hope that they are just as good. I truly believe, as the author said, that this house has some sort of force in and around it. Eventhough these strange things happened to her family in that house she felt a sense of love for that house. I feel the same way about that house and I will always think of that house as being my home no matter who lives there. I have never thought about my emotions regarding the house until this book. Now I wonder what hold this house really has on people. Two families afraid of this house but yet in love with this house (I can only speak for myself from my family when I say afraid of the house). As a child I had heard alot of stories about this house and the family that had lived there from the people of this small, country town and thought, as everyone else did, that this family was crazy. So, of course, I had to order the book to see what kind of lies were being told about my house. I was truly surprised when I related so well to everything that was written about my house. Through the author's words and description of my home she touched a core part of me that I never expected when I ordered the book. All in all this book is a must read for anyone and everyone.

The haunting that was described was scary enough, but the inconsistent telling of the story and the flip-flopping in the time line of events made it a sometimes tedious read.

Images of an acquiescent county home and its inhabitants are thrown into an eerie expance of suspense, fear, and rapid fire critisism from a cynical county community. The book reads easily as it is presented in a diary type format. The events are portrayed as real, not farfetched and ornate.

Dave writes in a straight-ahead, clear style derived from his many years as a gunsmith. Basically he writes with the same care and precision he uses in his repairs and restorations, which are works of art. The photos and drawings (many of the latter by his son) are all well done and to the point of the text. The volume itself is expertly printed and bound and is sure to last.If you are researching, repairing or are just curious about one of the S&W; six guns that Dave covers you will find all you need to know in this volume. His histories of the development of the various models are entertaining, as well as useful to the researcher. The repair text and illustrations are step-by-step. If you run into problems (like a stuck screw), he covers how to deal with that. If you just like a good read about some of the under-appreciated but significant firearm designs and the people who used them in the old west, then get this book.My criteria for the importance of a tome like this is how greasy it gets as I consult it at my workbench while in the middle of a repair or maybe just exploring one of the antiques detailed in its pages. In Dave's case my copy of his first book (Gunsmithing Guns of the Old West) is well stained. I expect this equally useful second book will also grow very grimy in proportion to its usefulness."},{"Title":"Smith and Wesson Six Guns of the Old West","review":"As a collector of all 19th century Smith & Wesson firearms, one of the things that has always surprised me is the lack of available information relating to one of the most well known and most common of all of the so-called western guns, the Model Three. Predating the better known 1873 Colt SA by three years, built in far larger numbers and many more interesting variations, where are the Model Three books? Rattling around in the head of well-known gunsmith/author David Chicoine apparently.Well it's finally here; the definitive tome of the Smith & Wesson Model Three. All those Americans, Russians, Scofields and New Models have finally been recognized for their importance in the most incredible volume imaginable. Was it worth the wait? It most certainly was.Here in a single large volume is a very comprehensive history of the Model Three going back to the Robbins & Lawrence factory where we are reasonably certain Daniel Smith met Horace Wesson around 1850. It tracks their progress through their first company, where they invented what became the Winchester 13 years later, the development of the first practical cartridge firearms (the S&W; Model One) through the Two's, One and a Half's, and finally the Model Threes. It's all here in a comprehensive entertaining manner accompanied by fabulous photographs and diagrams.This book is also a gunsmith's dream with page after page of carefully written and illustrated information on how to diagnose and repair every Model Three AND every modern Model Three copy. In addition there are chapters on ammunition and, for the shooter, loading and reloading. Did I say comprehensive? Well written? Beautifully illustrated? Awesome? A long over due and welcomed volume.

Set aboard a trans-Atlantic liner in the late '20s, the mystery is all snappy sailing -- full of fun characters and deft twists. And just when you know that you will get the answer to whodunnit you are left floundering and asking a dozen questions about why the plot took such an unlikely turn. I am not alone in this; a friend who read the book as well asked me to explain the uncertain ending. An amusing read if you don't mind the lack of a finale."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"I agree with much that's been said here by other readers. I enjoyed this book right up until the moment I'd finished it. And then - SPOILER ALERT! ONLY READ ON IF OR AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED THE BOOK YOURSELF - I started questioning the plot's logic.Here goes. So Lydia, the wife who we are led to believe was murdered by her husband Walter, actually left the Mauretania - the ship where much of the novel's action takes place - on the pilot boat, In which case, Walter didn't murder anyone. So why did he pretend to his mistress Alma that he had, that the body was in the trunk, and that he put it through the porthole as planned? If Lydia were still on board, which he would have to assume was the case, she would have seen him at some later stage in the voyage, so he could hardly have afforded not to tell Alma that the planned murder had not yet taken place.Furthermore - I suppose you could say that Lydia had no option but to leave all her expensive dresses behind on the ship because she couldn't carry them on the pilot boat - but you'd think she would have packed them, or at least told the crew to look after them. What possible reason did she have, for that matter, for failing to tell the ship she was getting off? And why in tarnation did she leave her make-up in the cabin - which she clearly did, because Alma puts it on? Moreover, since Walter's plan was to gain admission to Lydia's cabin by knocking on the door, certain that she'd let him in to find out what he was doing there, how did he get in when she'd already left the ship?And if the character Johnny was so infatuated with Lydia after seeing her on the stage, how could he possibly have thought that Alma was her, since there is no suggestion that the two were a close match in appearance?I wonder if there is a fuller version of the cover quote from Ruth Rendell: \\"Since the author is prepared to ignore all logic, I defy anyone to foresee the outcome.\\"PS I think it's fair to say that The False Inspector Dew is not a book that wears its research lightly. So it is deviously satisfying to discover Martinelli on board the Mauretania in 1921 singing Nessun Dorma, an aria from Turandot, five years before the opera's premiere."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"Lovesey often gives the sense his tongue is firmly in his cheek. The False Inspector Dew reads as though it were written in the 40s: the characters are drawn as wry twists on old cliches, sailing along (literally) in their frothy, and quietly funny, quest for love and bungled adventure. The False Inspector is not what he seems (like many of the characters). Like Chance in Being There, Walter is imbued by everyone else with characteristics he just doesn't have. Lovesey pokes fun at romance (particularly with the wistful and foolish heroine), detection (the ship's officer whom the false inspector displaces is equally as bad a dectective as our hero) and finally with plot, which he twists to suit his neat but far fetched needs. The cast springs from the Victorian parlors: the shipboard Johnny, the nearly harumphing captain, the well heeled family trying to marry off their daughter, the light fingered and lovely shill, and the aw-darn, I-really-liked-him murderer. This is not a slap your knee comedy, but your leg is consistently pulled in a dry English humor sort of way. There seems to be a real, honest to God, genuine mistake in the book, where one character refers to a character by the true name which hasn't yet been revealed. I re-read that part, thinking that Lovesey was having another go at my leg, but no, I think it really slipped through. This is a book best read where you can sit smiling to yourself without anyone asking you what the joke is. I had the sense that Lovesey has read all the old detective novels, and seen all the black and white movies and is having his way with them and us."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"The characters are adorable, especially Walter (the murderous dentist) in his role as Inspector Dew.

You may be booking a cruise when you're finished, or avoiding them."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"This is my 1st Lovesey book--I got his name from the Mystery Lovers' Book of Quotations. It reminds me of Tony Curtis in The Great Imposter. He even had a stint on a ship in the movie--as a dentist! This book seems to me to start out quite slowly. At least half the book appeared to dawdle, though the author needed to set up some context for later developments. Once onboard it got a bit more interesting, but after \\"Dew\\" is on the case, it got quite interesting. I liked the way Lovesey played on the mind-reading history to explain \\"Dew's\\" approach & success in part. The plot suddenly falls together & the reader does have sufficient clues to guess most of the mystery--except for the very end--which was a bit surprising though not a great shock to me. If one ignores hearsay & assumptions, possibilities are less limited & the truth can often be seen. There are a few questions about the final ending, but it is fiction after all. It's a good read, cleverly written, and a bit humorous as well."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"The False Inspector Dew is a fun quick read. The characters are wonderfully drawn and while it is true that the plot is not quite as intricate or complex as some reviewers claim, Lovesy tells an interesting story-one you will be able to devour easily in one or two sittings.The False Inspector Dew focuses on a series of characters-Alma who has fallen madly in love with her dentist and who has persuaded him to kill his rapacious wife; the dentist, Walter Baranov, who is swept up by Alma's passion and agrees to kill his wife at Alma's behest; Jack Gordon, a card shark who has located his mark and intends to fleece him on a boat trip across the Atlantic; Barbara, a wealthy girl whose mother is scheming to marry her off; and a millionaire's son who is conveniently both single and interested in cards. All of these characters come together when they decide to cross the Atlantic on the Mauritania in 1921. When a murder occurs, Walter Baranov (who is traveling under a false name so that he can more easily kill his own wife) is called upon to solve the murder. In the character of Inspector Dew (the man who arrested Dr. Crippen), Baranov acts out the fantasy of every murder mystery lover-he becomes a detective and sets out to solve a real crime."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"This book has more twist and turns than you can shake a handle at (What ever that saying means).

I can't say what this cardinal sin was without revealing the ending, but if you're an ardent fan of, say, Agatha Christie, because of the way she plotted her books, avoid this one.I'm back to reading Lovesey, and he is a wonderful writer.

The characters inspire both sympathy and laughter, and following &quot;Inspector Dew&quot; as he stumbles his way through the investigation is hilarous and suspenseful. The characters are deftly outlined, the plotlines neatly woven together, and the ironic narration is a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Best Mysteries Of All Time - The False Inspector Dew","review":"I'm surprised that &quot;The False Inspector Dew&quot; has received such critical acclaim. Though the book is certainly entertaining--it's gifted with Lovesey's devilish wit and gift for strong characterization--the supposedly &quot;ingenious&quot; plot is not nearly as well-crafted as one would hope. The plot twists aren't jarring enough to be truly exciting, and the reader isn't given enough evidence to guess the surprise ending. Clever, to be sure, but the construction isn't nearly as deft as it should be."},{"Title":"Electrodynamics (Chicago Lectures in Physics)","review":"Everybody says if you want a graduate text on E&amp;M, your only choice is Jackson. Happily that is no longer true. Melia's text is quite well-structured, starting with an empirical basis for Maxwell's equations, then moving on to electrostatics, magnetostatics, pre-relativistic radiation theory, special relativity, Lagrangian formulation of E&amp;M, relativistic radiation theory, and lastly a chapter on special topics (multipole moments, Bremsstrahlung, magnetohydrodynamics). The exposition is clearer than Jackson, and the reader is not encumbered with extra information.There are no problems in the book, so it may work best as a complement to Jackson (or perhaps Jackson may work best as a complement to Melia). In either case, this is a very readable book, and an excellent source for graduate students taking E&amp;M."},{"Title":"Electrodynamics (Chicago Lectures in Physics)","review":"Universities do not force their graduate students to learn electrodynamics because it will be useful to their careers. They do it because solving well-posed, canonical problems in science's most complete subject should help the student develop a sense for simplicity and rigor. A well-taught electrodynamics course should be less about mathematical minutiae and more about how to think and present arguments.Dr. Melia's class and text do just that. In class, Dr. Melia began each lecture at the top-left of the board, wrote and spoke clearly, rolled up past boards so that people who came in late could quickly get up to speed, and asked test questions he had prepared the class for. His text reveals the same eye for simplicity--and, more than an introduction to particles and fields, is a beautiful lesson on *how to teach*."},{"Title":"Electrodynamics (Chicago Lectures in Physics)","review":"This is the best book I have on Electrodynamics. It draws out the intuition with good diagrams that motivate the formulas. The formulas are carefully derived and explained. The book I would like to have written."},{"Title":"Electrodynamics (Chicago Lectures in Physics)","review":"The book is short and is not clattered by non-essential topics. In this way, the structure of electrodynamics can stand out. The author often pauses and examines the physical contents of equations derived. He also tries to motivate a derivation on physical grounds. I like that. The explanation, however, isn't always as direct as it could be and occasionally mixes up different issues, thus leaving the act of distilling the contents to the reader. I suppose everyone has to do that anyway to learn from a book. But, it does mean that the book needs to be read slowly and critically.In many places, explanation was rather contracted or was given hurriedly. This being a graduate level textbook and thus is building on an assumed prior exposure to the subject, this might be expected. But, in a few places, a physical situation being analyzed was not fully explained or the notation was not carefully chosen to convey physics. His treatment of time-varying field in Sec. 3.1 was (and still is) utterly confusing to me. For that, I consulted Panofsky and Phillips and found it to be a great help.In summary, I appreciate the underlying motivation of the book, that is to provide a compact, yet, complete account of electrodynamics. However, the book is not without some rough edges, except perhaps to those who know the materials inside out. For mere mortals, such as myself, it won't be a bad idea to get something like Panofsky and Phillips as a supplement.Based on another review, I got a hardcover copy. It costs twice as much, but it is printed on high quality paper and binding is just excellent. I don't think that the pages will ever fall out from a regular use. It has a good weight in hands and gold lettering (on the back only) complements the black cover very nicely."},{"Title":"Electrodynamics (Chicago Lectures in Physics)","review":"This is an excellent book ... very well written.

What he does is paint lines, curves, etc., or geometric figures on architectural structures. These structures could be almost anything--old churches or homes, modern office buildings, covered parking lots, stairways, walls. Varini's paintings contrast with the architecture while at the same time accentuate its features and fundamental forms. This unique, imaginative art is introduced by comparison to Paul Klee's painting \\"Ad marginem\\" (1936) with its red circle in the center which works to seem to change the arrangement and weight of the parts of the whole depending on the angle the viewer looks at the painting. Reference to Borges' maze-like short stories and trompe l'oeil elements of paintings such as Hans Holbein the Younger's \\"The Ambassadors\\" (1533) with its distorted skull in the foreground are among other art works and artists referred to to shed light on technical, theoretical, and historical matters with Varini's novel, unexpected, and in some ways visionary art. Fabiola Lopez-Duran, author of the four essays, has an acute understanding as well as appreciation of what Varini does and is trying to do in his art; and also a broad knowledge of art history which he brings to bear in elucidating both the background of the art and its uniqueness. Along with this, Lopez-Duran also has a firm grasp of postmodern art and critical treatment of it. She is the perfect author for this state-of-the-art book on Varini. And it calls for note, the book's front cover made of wood with expanding red spirals continuing on to the page edges works too to convey the distinctiveness of Varini's art."},{"Title":"Texas Air Control Board construction permit application for the Pantex Plant high explosives synthesis facility","review":"Having read and studied many astology books, I was amazed to find lots of information that I had never run across before. Combining a knowledge of astrology and astronomy, the writer invites the reader to do the same. It gives a unique persective using common language that helps one register the size of the universe.She also integrates the cycles of Pluto and Neptune, giving original information that spans the decades, helping the readers to understand generational differences and priorities. A slim volume, and a significant contribution to astrological knowledge. It was hard to find on Amazon searching for author's name or title, I finally located it by going to her website and linking to Amazon.

It well covers the story of his business career and the building of a sizeable fortune. This book covers his career from the beginning until his death in 1976. The novel also points out the fact that Getty was a millionaire at a young age. This publication also gives good coverage to the establishment of the Getty museum.It is pointed out that Getty,in his older years had actually become a philanthropist. This book is without question a very good coverage of the life of one of the giants in American industry. Read this book. You will be well satisfied."},{"Title":"Giants of American Industry - John Paul Getty","review":"I was disappointed with this book as with most books about J P Getty because it failed to talk about his home life in any detail. In particular, it failed to mention how he treated his wives, children, and grandchildren; how he refused to pay the ransom for one even though he knew about his whereabouts. It basically glossed over everyone he left behind, including his grandson William Paul Getty who celebrated his birthday one day after J P Getty's death.--Gummi Bear"},{"Title":"Going, Going, Gone: Vanishing Americana","review":"My husband got Going, Going Gone out of the library and read it, I read it, my Dad read it, we all liked it. This book catalogs many of those things our moms, dads and grandparents used or did in daily life that are vanishing through changes in society or technology: carbon paper, rotary phone, garter belts, or mending socks for example. The book describes the things that lead to the phasing out of the old products and methods. The photocopier killed carbon paper for example. The only down side I can see is that the book is too short. My Dad thought it was written from a slightly feminist point of view, but I didn't really notice it.

The strength of the book may well lie in its myriad of photographs that complement each essay extraordinarily well. The topics covered reinforce the fact that the authors are female (feminine hygiene products, white gloves, and mending, to name a few), and the reader will no doubt frequently ask himself or herself &quot;why didn't they include this idea?&quot"},{"Title":"Going, Going, Gone: Vanishing Americana","review":"Those things lots of us born just before, during or right after WW11 - were and are not.

It's well done, with clear instructions and photos, but I expected to see edgier patterns, more like those you see in the online knitting mag \\"knitty.\\" Also there is one omission that jumped out at me - the author mentions embroidering with duplicate stitch but gives no instructions for the technique.HOWEVER, having said that, I must admit that the target audience loves the book! My 17, 15 and 12 year old daughters keep it close at hand when they are knitting and refer to it again and again. That's really the test, isn't it? When asked to explain they told me they find \\"Stitch 'n Bitch\\" a little intimidating - too adult and too much information - whereas this book seems to answer all their questions in their language, and they love the illustrations.

Shannon Okey takes a playful approach with Knitgrrl, her introductory text geared for young women.She starts by posing a question: Why knit? Her answers are thought-provoking; soon, you'll be perusing succeeding chapters on yarn types, reading a yarn label, choosing colors, all about knitting needles and tools, how to read a pattern, holding your needles and yarn, casting on, knitting, purling, and much more.

Not because of what they stood for, which was admirable enough, but because of the blatant abuse of the English language. So the title Knitgrrl pretty much prejudiced me before I'd cracked the cover. Once I did, though, the hesitation vanished pretty quickly.This is an easy-to-follow, fast read that takes the reader through the basics of knitting (probably a bit too fast for a complete neophyte, but perfect for someone like me, who knitted decades ago and needs a quick refresher course), then turns said reader loose into fifteen projects ranging from the most basic to things that will be pieces of cake for experienced knitters, but will challenge those who are still on the novice level. A very good book both for beginners and for those getting back into knitting after a long time away. ***"},{"Title":"Knitgrrl: Learn to Knit with 15 Fun and Funky Patterns","review":"I have had the opportunity to take a good look at Knitgrrl: Learn to Knit with 15 Fun and Funky Projects by Shannon Okey. I'd have to say that it's a pretty nice intro to knitting for 6th through say, 10th graders.First of all, the projects are all small and trendy: Rocker-Girl Wristlets, Friendship Scarf, Boombox Bag, Faux Fur Stole, Kitty Dim Sum (kitty toys), Stripey Scarf, Ponytail Roll-Brim Hat, Heartfelt Roll-Brim Hat, DIY Leg Warmers, Music Player Cozy, Soda Cozy, Text-Messaging Mittens (trendiest), Downtown Messenger Bag, Lacy Double-Diamond Scarf, and Nakiska Alpine Headband. My favorites are the Downtown Messenger Bag--sturdy, yet sleek and attractive--and the Text-Messaging Mittens which open up just the thumbs of the mittens for quick messages to your best friends.Okey was able to provide a variety of small, yet imaginative projects by inviting guest designers to contribute to her compilation. That may account for the variety and ingenuity of most of the projects. The only project which looked completely dorky to me were the headphone covers, in pastel stripes. The model looks really happy wearing them, but most of my middle school students would be too embarrassed to wear them, as they look pretty weird.Next, the beginner knitting instructions. The step-by-step photos of the knit and purl stitches are quite nice, and clear enough for someone trying to teach herself. The slip knot photos must have been edited for space, though, as they do not illustrate the crucial step of pulling the working yarn through the loop. I wouldn't be able to teach myself the slipknot with only the two photographs they offer.There are lots of \\"extras\\" beyond your basic knitting instructions, answering questions like Why Knit? What kind of yarn girl are you? How do I care for my handknits? as well as a list of yarn companies, books, on-line info, and knitting magazines. [...]This is an attractive, imaginative, hip book for young teens entering the knitting scene and looking for lots of support and ideas for small knitting projects. The only teens who may find this book lacking would be more serious, ambitious, and intermediate level knitting teens who are searching for more advanced projects, such as sweaters and socks.All in all, if I were the mother of a middle school teen and wanted to interest her in knitting, this would be an excellent choice."},{"Title":"Knitgrrl: Learn to Knit with 15 Fun and Funky Patterns","review":"This is a great book filled with really fun projects.

The patterns are suited perfectly for young girls, and nothing is too difficult to make or so big that a novice knitter would give up. You've got the usual items like mittens and scarves, but you also have MP3 covers, cellphone cosies, catnip holders (called \\"Kitty Dim Sum\\"), and even the mittens are designed so the wearer can text while using them. What I especially liked is that each pattern teaches a different technique or shows a different facet of knitting; the \\"faux fur stole\\" teaches the young knitter how to handle increases and decreases, while the \\"Nakiska head band\\" shows how cables are made. The photographs of how to create the stitches are clear, as are the instructions. The three items I've made from the patterns have turned out well (and are really attractive!).Best of all, the patterns are fresh and young and the book itself is totally accessible, with none of that fake \\"down-home country style\\" stuff that adults seem to love no matter how bogus kids think it is.I strongly recommend this book - it would make a great gift for any young new knitter."},{"Title":"Knitgrrl: Learn to Knit with 15 Fun and Funky Patterns","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the layout and excellent photos of the projects and the other interesting items included in the book"},{"Title":"Knitgrrl: Learn to Knit with 15 Fun and Funky Patterns","review":"If you've got a 10 - 18 year old in your life who has been pining to pick up the needles, this book will make a great gift.

These essays reflect the present-day reality of the indigenous people of the island of Guam.This book is framed in the context of an island that exists amidst the many conflicts and contradictions of being \\"freed from colonialism\\" by another colonial power in 1898 and \\"liberated from wartime aggression\\" by a country that put in under a Naval Administration until the 1960s and who worked to eliminate the culture of the local people through forced assimilation and nominal citizenship. It is written to articulate the reality of the Chamoru people of Guam as an indigenous Pacific Island culture, an American minority group, and an island people threatened by the encroachment of globalization into their lives. These essays will cause the reader to think critically on the subjects of globalization, sustainable development, sustainable governance, cultural reclamation, and self-determination on Guam, amongst the indigenous and colonized peoples in the world, question the value of democracy if it is involuntarily imposed on a people. This book is especially relevant for the present state of the world.Just Left is included in an academic series that blue ocean press publishes - \`The 1898 Consciousness Studies Series'.

Inside you will find the route plotted to learn how to grow towards knowledge of yourself and God. If you ever thought there was a way to go but felt something was missing on your part, some knowledge you didn't have, this may be the key to what you have been searching for. Br.

Little did I know the treasure that was within.Not only does Maturin communicate what he intended to communicate, he does so in an exacting use of the English language with a very fluid and descriptive manner that is truly artistic. Unlike the \\"practical\\" utilitarian styles of writing that I find in most of the modern American books I have read dealing with the nature of man, this book expands the capacity of the reader's imagination, and uses this as a way of communicating truth with excellence by being somewhat abstract without being completely intangible. This alone makes it very different if not superior to many other books that seek to make concrete definitions for the differing aspects of human makeup without being particularly descriptive as to the functions of the parts which constitute the man.Another aspect of the book I find interesting is that it deals with humanity and its relation to God in terms of paradoxes. This lends a balance to the work that I would venture to say is virtually unmatched. Rather than gravitating toward a religious bias as to one facet of a duality, he explores the whole thing and succinctly explains how one perspective relates to the other.Get this book. Cherish it. Read it, meditate on it, and read it again."},{"Title":"Self-knowledge and self-discipline","review":"Formerly one of the Cowley Fathers of the Anglican Church, Father Maturin (15 February, 1847 - 7 May, 1915) converted to the Roman Catholic Church in 1898. In 1913 he was appointed the Catholic chaplain to the University of Oxford. If the date of his death looks familiar to students of history, it's not a coincidence: he was one of the 1,198 passengers that went down with the Lusitania when it was sunk by a German U-boat. He was returning home after a preaching tour of the U.S.Self-Knowledge and Self-Discipline is one of those \\"big\\" little books you come across once in a great while; it's a lost gem of spirituality and self-help from a time when most people still recognized that self-help implicitly included Divine-help. Maturin writes with that unmistakable, inspiring insight and style of other great British authors like G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis.In his discussion about the thoughts that we choose to give governance to our minds, Maturin describes them as \\"secret and unseen companions of the soul, intangible and volatile... [they] affect our whole view of men and things around us... these phantom forms that rise out of the darkness and return to it again, colourless, impalpable, ethereal, that speak in inarticulate whispers and touch us with ghostly hands, they are more real to us than the solid earth and the strong mountains.\\"The book is organized on the following topics:Self-KnowledgeThe Principle of Self-DisciplineThe Seat of the ConflictThe Discipline of the WillThe Discipline of the MindThe Discipline of the AffectionsThe Discipline of the BodyMortification and the Supernatural LifeThe Law A Preparation for the Revelation of LoveThe chapter \\"The Seat of Conflict\\" sets up the central thesis of this work, which is essentially a meditation on Romans 7, St. Paul's great self-analysis of his own inner conflict and the \\"tortuous workings of our nature.\\" Maturin's teaching is scriptural, magisterial, spiritual and practical. This is one of the best - and most useful - Catholic writings of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Self-knowledge and self-discipline","review":"This book is the most realistic, useful thing ever written if you want to control yourself and exercise self discipline."},{"Title":"Self-knowledge and self-discipline","review":"This is a fantastic book which helps the reader to clearly understand the importance of self-knowledge.

The persons being conversed with are mostly scientists, but there are medical practitioners, a couple of politicians, an AIDS victim, and some administrators. There are some superstars (Martin Rees, Arthur C. Clarke, Freeman Dyson, Stephen Jay Gould, Roger Penrose) and some others who are not very well known outside their area of expertise (e.g., Luis F. Baptista, Birute Galdikas), and still others who are perhaps best known for being in the public eye (Princess Diana's psychiatrist, Susie Orbach; National Public Radio's Ira Flatow; maverick science writer John Horgan). One has the sense that the conversations have been distilled from a larger essence.The most striking interview is with Dr. Nawal M. Nour, a Sudanese-born gynecologist who treats African-American women in the Boston area who have been mutilated by so-called \\"female circumcision.\\" Dreifus asks Nour if \\"These operations\\" are used \\"as a means of social control.\\"Dr. Nour's surprising response is that \\"the people who are perpetuating the practice are usually the women themselves.\\" She adds, \\"I find that people do it because of a deeply ingrained belief that they are protecting their daughters. This not done to be hurtful, but out of love.\\" (pp 171-172) Dr. Nour's prescription is to dispel such grotesque ignorance with education.One of the most interesting interviews is with medical researcher Polly Matzinger, whom I've read about elsewhere. She is the ex-Playboy bunny and waitress who famously began her scientific career when a UC Berkeley professor, Robert Swampty Schwab, to whom she was serving beer, realized her talent after hearing her ask, \\"Why has no animal ever mimicked a skunk?\\" She is currently a leading proponent of the exciting idea that it is not \\"self\\" and \\"non-self\\" that our immune system distinguishes between, but instead between the benign and the dangerous. This is a radical idea that is \\"turning the world of immunology upside down.\\" (p. 191)Perhaps the most unusual \\"scientist\\" interviewed (at least in terms of his occupation) is self-styled \\"forensic mathematician\\" Charles Brenner. He does the mathematical calculations necessary to analyze DNA evidence.The interview with physicist Freeman J. Dyson is interesting mainly because Dreifus got him to voice lukewarm support for the idea that Werner Heisenberg, Hitler's most talented physicist (and subject of the recent play Copenhagen) in part kept the bomb from the Nazis by not giving the project \\"the kind of push it needed.\\" Dreifus also elicited Dyson's opposition to Bush's new Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars redux) \\"because the system doesn't work, mostly because it can be easily outwitted.\\" (p. 22)As a sometime sampler of \\"food supplements\\" I was interested in the conversation with Stephen E. Straus, the virologist who serves as Director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in our government's National Institute of Health. He has a $90-million budget to test alternative approaches to medicine. This is significant because no one else has the resources do this sort of research on a scale large enough to be worthwhile. The drug companies will not do extensive research on food supplements because they can't patent the supplements and therefore feel such an investment will not pay off.I enjoyed reading this collection and was intrigued to see how much Dreifus did with the limited space she had available for each interview. Her disarming style with a sharp sense of how to probe often overcame the inevitable superficiality inherent in conversations lasting only about six pages each. A case in point is the question she springs on celebrity psychiatrist, Susie Orbach: \\"Your highly influence 1978 book, Fat is a Feminist Issue, posited the idea that some women had eating disorders because they had been undernurtured by their mothers. Do you still believe that?\\" This is the kind of question--like \\"Do you still beat your wife?\\"--that one doesn't have to stick around to hear the answer to. The point has been made. Orbach does allow that if she were writing that book today, she \\"wouldn't write it in the same way.\\""},{"Title":"Scientific Conversations: Interviews on Science from The New York Times","review":"An exploration of our great scientists from the unique perspective of a New York Times writer.

The Eucharistic Christ and the New Evangelization","review":"This book was easy to read and succintly followed a theme that was convincing to the reader. That theme being as the title suggests, \\"Another Jesus\\"? He starts with the scripture 2 Corinthians 11:3-4, where Paul was concerned that some of the Corinthian Church had been led astray and was in danger of being deceived by a different gospel and another Jesus.From that point on Oakland endeavours to write this book as a wake up call for a sleeping church today and to those that have been seduced into a different gospel which invariably leads to a Jesus not of the written Word, but of man's traditions. Just as Jesus said in Matthew 15:9 \\"But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men\\".He carefully sets out and establishes what another Jesus could be, and more importantly, he shows the reader what Jesus is not. He encourages you to be discerning and diligent in searching the scriptures to recognise deception in all its magic. He also asks, if one was to follow this other Jesus would it be important enough to seperate the church? Although he doesn't dedicate much time on this question, but rather leads the reader to come to a conclusion however uncomfortable it may be.Using the famous Sermon on the Mount he then presents his case on the false christ's and where you might find them. He uses well documented statements from \\"The Canons and Decrees of The council of Trent\\", and the encyclicals issued by the now deceased Pope John Paul 2 to add weight to his case. The book is well footnoted from where he has quoted, and he has footnoted web-sites from where he has drawn.He takes the reader on a journey to better understand the significance of a new type of evangelisation that is expected to happen in the Catholic church. Interestingly, the book was written before the death of Pope John Paul 2, and Cardinal Ratzinger is quoted in December of 2000 as saying that the church is searching for a new method of evangelisation to the world, and one that the world will hear. What that new evangelisation will be is answered in this book by the statements and encyclicals made (all footnoted and documented) and by other memebers and outreaches of the Roman Catholic Church. This book will be a real eye opener to many who are not blind already.The book ends as any good Christian book should, with a call to the Word of God and His scripture which is given to free those captive, and a call to the true cross of salvation is offered for those who have never heard the Good News."},{"Title":"Another Jesus? The Eucharistic Christ and the New Evangelization","review":"Much needed must read! I would highly recommend this great, well written book to all, especially to those of the RCC or those who know people in the RCC"},{"Title":"Another Jesus? The Eucharistic Christ and the New Evangelization","review":"Jim Tetlow and Roger Oakland in their book \\"Another Jesus: The Eucharistic Christ and the new Evangelization\\" is a blatant attempts at judging mysteries that are not understood. The gift of the Eucharist is a mystery that is well documented in the writings of the Early Church Fathers. Roger Oakland and Jim Tetlow have made it their mission to bash and misinterpret all things Catholic. Tetlow's \\"Queen of All\\" shows a lack of understanding of the person and role of the Mother of Christ, who is \\"she who crushes the head of Satan.\\"\\"Sola Scriptura\\" is a fallacy that denies the ongoing development and growth of the Body of Christ. Scripture and Tradition are both needed in discerning how the Lord is manifesting Himself in an ongoing way."},{"Title":"Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video","review":"I have to agree with all of the reviews here, in some way. On the one hand, Russell DOES fall victim to a kind of flowery, ambiguous language. Like many of us who tend to write about art or film or whatever, Russell tends to get carried away with her theories and they become very self-enclosed the farther they go. BUT, I think this book is extremely useful in many ways. It really sets up the stakes for \\"postmodern\\" (ugh) ethnography and situates its filmic manifestation within our present situation. Her argument is brilliant when it shows how these questions of representation are implicit within almost any ethnographic film. On the one hand, don't read this as gospel (i dont think Russell is the kind of critic who would want you to). On the other, it is undeniable that this book is an important addition to film studies."},{"Title":"Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video","review":"I had to write this review as Amazon is a place where millions of people buy their books and unfortunately see idiotic reviews such have been offered here before me and this affects the sales of the book. I felt I must defend Russel's book which is an excellent overview of the evolving state of the ethnographic film beyond its roots in anthropological observation. To appreciate this book, one needs to have a few tools to understand some of her ideas, such as the history of the documentary film and its authority over what is to be considered 'real' and 'true' in human experience. This is a book for people interested in a more intuitive exploration of the documentary genre."},{"Title":"Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video","review":"You can't follow the thread of Catherine Russell's argument; you can only pretend to, whether you're posturing for stuck-up film theory boyz or forced to &quot;identify the central concepts&quot; in film class. Just read one of her sentences, and then ask yourself, &quot;What is she trying to say?&quot; I'll start you off: &quot;Viola's use of video is informed by an existentialist theory of medium specificity. His treatment of possession is thus ontological and in many ways a more successful version of the 'cine-transe' imagined by Rouch&quot; (234). Over 300 pages of such absurd drivel make this book unreadable. Don't read it passively--question every word, every invented phrase, every name she drops. Her goal is to sound creative and learned (&quot;the cartography of modern culture&quot; *is* a neat phrase), but are we really impressed? No. Well-written books give you plenty of ideas for your time. This crazy offal just gives you one: film theory is utterly pointless."},{"Title":"Experimental Ethnography: The Work of Film in the Age of Video","review":"on anything that he/she cannot comprehend.

It is not so well known today because many are more interested in the fluff of the Holy Spirit and not the substance! Clear away all the froth and read this rich book. I have many volumes in my library, but this volume is a choice one. Samuel Chadwick was known as a \\"Man of one book\\" (see Dunning's biography of Chadwick). He studied until 2am, woke up at 6am having a cold bath and continued seeking the Lord. Such was his lifestyle, and it is such devotion to the Lord that brings about rich delicacies for the Church to partake of.Here is a quote from the book to give you an idea of it's contents.In a powerful plea for the life of prayer, E.M. Bounds says: \\"God's plan is to make much of the man, far more of him than of anything else. Men are God's method. The Church is looking for better methods; God is looking for better men.\\" He has staked His kingdom on men. He has trusted His gospel to men. He has given His Spirit to men. The Church is on the stretch for new methods, new plans, new buildings, new organizations, but \\"the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards Him.\\" The Holy Ghost does not come upon methods, but upon men. He does not anoint machinery, but men. He does not work through organizations, but through men. He does not dwell in buildings, but in men. He indwells the body of Christ, directs its activities, distributes its forces, empowers its members."},{"Title":"The Way to Pentecost","review":"Dr. Samuel Chadwick's books are all classics! If you enjoy the writing of A.W. Tozer, Stephen Hill, or Leonard Ravenhill then you will greatly enjoy the man who literally started the fire in their hearts, the late Samuel Chadwick. Dr. Chadwick was the President of the old Methodist college in Leeds, England. His writing is not typical Methodist of our day with their liberal views but he writes with the heart and fire of John Wesley.This short book was based on a series of articles that Dr. Chadwick wrote at Leeds College on the person and work of the Holy Spirit. Identifying himself with the Pentecostal Methodists of the late 19th century, Chadwick's theology is reflected in this book on the Baptism with the Holy Spirit. Chadwick is not charismatic or modern Pentecostal in his thought but believes the Baptism of the Spirit brings power for service (R.A. Torrey, D.L. Moody) and is evident through prayer and holiness.While you might not agree with Chadwick's second work theology, the passion this man had for Jesus is clear. You will read this book and you will be hungry to pray."},{"Title":"The Way to Pentecost","review":"This short little book is a good meditation on the power of God in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The book reminds me a bit of A.W. Tozer's \\"Knowledge of the Holy\\" which is very devotional in nature. Some of the book is a bit repetitive as this is simply a collection of articles that Chadwick wrote. Thus, chapter after chapter does not build on previous insight from other chapters, and one is not taken as deep as you might go in other books. Still though, there are some absolutely profound chapters in this book.In addition to this book, one would do well to read Leonard Ravenhill's \\"Why Revival Tarries,\\" and Jim Cymbala's \\"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire,\\" \\"Fresh Fiath,\\" and \\"Fresh Power\\" trio."},{"Title":"The Way to Pentecost","review":"A great primer on the baptism of the Holy Spirit. For such a short book, the insights are thought-provoking and incites greater thirst for the experience of God's presence and power manifested in the believer's life. In describing the decline of the spritual life of the Church, you would think he is describing this present generation, but this book was first published in England in 1932! For the young believer, it is a good book to start one on the path of what it is to be on fire for God; for the older believer whose thrist has yet to be quenched, it is a good reminder of what he has left behind for other avenues of what seems to be spiritual power."},{"Title":"New Insights into Astrology: Sex Is a T-Square Number Symbolism Harmonics Aspects Asteroids Research","review":"Nona Gwynn Press has chocked her book so full of information that it's a little dizzying, but similar to this book's other reviewers, I appreciate its content if not its somewhat uneven organisation.Asteroid details such as their astrological-mythological meanings and symbologies, dates and places and who discovered them (if known), number symbolism, and more astrological theory and practices await you with New Insights.I've owned this book for years and continue to use it regularly for the name and degree lists of asteroids. Asteroids' numbers are useful to know especially if you want to check an asteroid's position on a certain date (for which I highly recommend [...]) and Press provides them on her lists of their Heliocentric North Nodes (1990.)If I could change one thing about New Insights it would be the plethora of personal details unto the generations of Press' family. But I'm not one who prefers Astrology books with lots of chart examples - if you are, then you'll like this feature.Harmonics are covered in ways I've not found in other books (Addey's and Hamblin's are the ones I use) so if you have a yen to understand more about Harmonics charts, this book will add to your knowledge base. Her information on Composite Charts may be a subject of interest as well, and I was happy to find that details on using Arc Transform charts are included - not info you find every day.Also covered are Lunations and Solar Returns, and you'll find a useful list of Uranian Planets with their glyphs and keywords. Press' brilliance with statistics shines through on all subjects - ex: Delta Correction, a brief discussion on ephemerides' time differences.On each of Press' subjects, authorities are cited, some quoted, giving readers springboards for further research.All in all, I'd say New Insights is an Astrology book of a different kind, a little swirling, perhaps occasionally unsatisfying, very wordy, but well worth having on your shelf when you want to read something out of the ordinary from the world of Astrology!"},{"Title":"New Insights into Astrology: Sex Is a T-Square Number Symbolism Harmonics Aspects Asteroids Research","review":"This book tackles such fascinating subjects as Midpoints, Arabic Parts, & more.

Personally, I didn't need that much convincing and was more interested in the practical strategies of teaching. The three chapters on teaching, \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Read,\\" \\"How to Teach Your Baby Math,\\" and \\"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge,\\" were pretty much taken right out of the books by those names. I would much more highly recommend those books, as they include more information on how to teach those specific areas (and also include some convincing if you need it).However, these books present the material as if you will only be teaching that subject. I had hoped that this book would give strategies on how to combine teaching all these areas, but it really didn't. The only thing it said was to start with reading, then add encyclopedic knowledge, then add math (literally one sentence without any further explanation). It did not have practical information like how many sessions total is appropriate for a baby. For instance, the reading chapter has you do 15 sessions a day. The encyclopedic knowledge section has you do 30 sessions a day. The math section has you do 9 sessions a day. If you did all of that, you'd be doing 54 sessions a day--obviously impossible if you had to space them out as you're supposed to. A chapter is clearly missing from this book on what a home program with all of these areas should look like.If you buy all of these books (How to...Read, How to...Math, How to...Knowledge, How to Multiply), you will find a lot of repetition, as each book makes its case for why you should teach your baby. If you haven't bought any of the books in this series and are curious about teaching your baby, but you aren't sure you should or that it's possible, this book is a good place to start. But if you already have, let's say, \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Read,\\" and are hoping to get some new insights here--you won't. Just stick with what you have or go ahead and get another book, like \\"How to Teach Your Baby Math,\\" as opposed to buying this."},{"Title":"How To Multiply Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution) (More Gentle Revolution)","review":"Doman's books are a must read, but this book is just a summary of all other books.

Then take their courses, in Philadelphia, but they are a couple of thousand dollars. Do it all before your baby is born. I read this book 10 years before my wife got pregnant and it changed my life... and my daughter's (I hope). Now she is 3. But don't get too carried away. Believe me, some parents do get carried away. The ones in Philadelphia seem to belong to a sect. Just enjoy your children and add this to the fun. I took the course in Philadelphia but I really don't do much of the program. Still, I raise my daughter differently from what I would otherwise have done without having read this book. You will not be the same person after you read it.

It is about teaching your baby about life.You will have more respect for your child and will not let your baby grow \\"by accident.\\" Instead, you will be able to actively participate in the learning process and challenge your child to fulfill his or her intellectual potential.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking, \\"Can you tell me, Socrates, can virtue be taught?\\"Socrates claims that to answer such a question, a person would have to know what virtue is. An incredulous Meno asks, \\"Socrates, do you really not know what virtue is?\\"Socrates responds, \\"Not only that, my friend, but as I believe, I have never yet met anyone else who did know.\\"And so Socrates and Meno engage in a question-and-answer investigation of what virtue is and if it can be taught. They explore how to define words, how people learn, whether virtue is knowledge, and the difference between true opinion and knowledge. The process at one point leads Meno to call Socrates a \\"broad torpedo fish,\\" capable of numbing the mind with his probing questions.G.M.A. Grube does a great job translating, and his footnotes aren't intrusive. If you're wondering what the Socratic Method entails, Meno is a good introduction that satisfies that curiosity without being too dense. But if you want to fully learn Plato's opinion of virtue and its properties (and the immortality of the soul), you might want to check out Protagoras (where Plato reaches the opposite conclusion than in this dialogue) and, of course, The Republic."},{"Title":"Meno","review":"First off, I don't see any reason for anyone to get this edition, the other Hackett Edition called Five Dialogues contains this along with four other dialogues (including the great Apology), I don't see any reason why not to pay a couple more dollars for it.This was somewhat interesting, Socrates meets with Meno to discuss what virtue is and how can it be acquired. Meno seems to have some ideas but he comes in contact with a broad torpedo fish (Socrates) and this leaves him numb and in a state of perplexity, in the end we're not really sure what virtue is but we know a few things its not.The thing this seems to be best remembered for a part where Socrates questions a slave to prove that souls already learned everything before inhabiting a human. To prove this Socrates asks a series of leading questions which the slave gets wrong but then upon further leading questions he figures out the answer. This seems to prove the preknowledge to everyone, although I don't see how anyone getting some questions right when they're lead to the conclusion to prove anything of the sort, all it proves is that humans have the ability to think and learn.Overall this dialogue was one of the first Socrates ones I've read and it was a good introduction to Plato, but with that being said, I think some of his other ones are far better. Its worth reading in any case and this same inborn knowledge will be brought up again (for example in Phaedo)."},{"Title":"Meno","review":".For such a short story, so much is said. Reading Plato answers many questions and exposes the framework of so many later writers of history, a classic that should be read and contemplated. Spending the time reading on Plato's Meno reaps much, far more valuable than vast amounts of mediocre writers. Can you imagine if the masses spent as much time reading Plato as they do their shod journalism!Actually this idea of virtue has the basics of all philosophical thought, the direction of the whole or the overall purpose always direct the thoughts. Virtue acts as the driving force of the empirical observation and technical craft. Virtue is the purpose, the why, as opposed to the what. And so, it has been determined from the conversation of Socrates and Meno, that virtue is not knowledge, it is not the &quot;what&quot; but rather it is that which moves the direction behind knowledge and therefore cannot be taught. And if it is not knowledge then it can be observed by example, yet Socrates determined that virtue is from a divine source, the inspiration that is behind all knowledge."},{"Title":"Meno","review":"Meno is one of Plato's early and, to my mind, least successful, Socratic dialogues. The conversation centers, naturally enough, on virtue and whether or not it is teachable. Meno's definitions of virtue are woefully inadequate, by and large, and deserving of Socrates' typical arrogance. At one point, Meno says that one cannot learn about what one does not know. To counter this argument, Socrates, arguing that the soul is eternal and that learning is in fact recollection, sets about showing him how an ignorant slave &quot;remembers&quot; the answers to geometrical questions Socrates puts to him. Later, when Meno agrees with the notion that virtue is knowledge and can be taught, Socrates counters the point by saying he has yet to find anyone who truly practices virtue and is thus qualified to teach it. In the end, Socrates concludes that virtue cannot be taught and is in fact a gift of the gods. Only the gods have true knowledge and can thus do nothing wrong, in Socrates' opinion.The whole &quot;knowledge is recollection&quot; argument dominates my reaction to this dialogue, as the demonstration of geometrical knowledge involving a slave never sits well with me. One should not really look for answers in Meno, as the whole dialogue ends with little more than open questions. Many of the same ideas were developed much more completely in The Republic."},{"Title":"Eggbert: Belly Laughs","review":"lots of laughs.

The early version was the best balanced study of the period. The updating takes account of developments in scholarship, in history and archaeology, over the last 35 years. The result is a magisterial work, that may not please everyone, but will certainly provide food for thought for any intelligent person.Read this book.

I wonder if the best the reviewers can come up with is to attack Prof. Thapar's political credentials. I should think the political affiliations of Prof. Thapar should be immaterial as long as her work reflects sharp intellectual acumen, erudition and scholarship. Prof. Thapar has consistently demonstrated all of the above in her work, as well as the many well-respected scholars who are in agreement with the theses she offers in her books. The same unfortunately cannot be said for those who invoke the spectre of Marxist history again and again in an effort to discredit. In fact, the two hypercritical reviews of Prof. Thapar's book seem to be written by persons who have not bothered to read the volume at all, but used this forum to repeat cliched arguments that any self-respecting historian would be amused by. Read the book by all means, there is no better account than one written by arguably one of the most eminent Indian historians of our times."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"Thapar's new book is not a revision of the older edition. It is a completely new book. The contents of this one are even more politically surcharged by her commitment to the role of Marxism in India. The title of the book is also a misnomer, because she has hardly written anything worthwhile on the period post invasions of Islamists from Central Asia, and whatever she has written, follows a typical, predictable party line, according to which it is an anathema to even mention atrocities by the invaders on the native Hindus population of India. She stoops to indulging in blatant misrepresentations for instance, in the episode of the destruction of the Somnath Temple. She claims that there is no near contemporary evidence for this iconoclasm by the Muslim invader, when in fact a near contemporary Ibn Batuta has clearly mentioned it. The negationism becomes apparent in her entire treatment of the Aryan-Harappan controversy, where she dishes out old wine in new bottles, dismissing all the new evidence and rooting for the 19th century colonial-racist myths. The evidence of Sarasvati is dismissed by suggesting that the location of the river is contested with some placing it in Afghanistan, as if such rash speculations of dyed in red comrades in arms (Irfan Habib) and maverick proteges of hers (Rajesh Kochhar) should carry any weight. The discovery of fire altars is also dismissed on the grounds that they do not match the descriptions in the Vedic manuals, ignoring that a living religion does not necessarily conform to manuals that represent a fossilized tradition. The discovery of spoke wheels in Indus sites is not mentioned so that her Aryan fantasy of Vedic tanks (= war chariots) is left intact. And finally, political zooarchaeologists who have praised her in the past, are relied upon, contrary to all archaeological evidence, to assert that the presence of horse in Harappan domain was doubtful.The book opens with a rambling chapter on historiography, where all earlier hsitorians are depicted as tainted with 'Nationalism', a swear word for anti-National Marxist historians. There is no logical progression in this chapter, one cannot comprehend what she is trying to say, other than squirting the standard Indian Marxist agenda. The treatment of the Vedic texts is totally wrong - for instance, even a novice would know that the sentence 'Samhita is a collection of verses while Brahmanas are collections of explanations in prose' as she asserts, is wrong.Predicatably, she, like other Marxist historians, disputes that the Gupta period was the Golden Age of India, the idea being started by her mentor D D Koshambi, the father of Marxist Indian historiography in the real sense, who was fired from Fergusson College (Pune) and TIFR (Bombay) because he was spending more time on extra-curricular activities rather than teaching his students mathematics and Statistics. These same historians however do not shy from glorifying Moghul India. For instance, in her textbook for Std. 8 students published by the NCERT, Thapar calls the era of Moghuls as 'The Age of Magnificence'.What shall I say more, her disdain for anything Hindu is clearly manuifest all over the book. The book is dedicated to a mysterious Sergei, which reminds me of a romance titled 'My Sergei'."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"I have to concur with the later reviews.

The evolution of society through various stages, e.g. hunter gatherer to urban, is well discussed.One may find the plethora of italicized terms and names of historical figure a little distracting in the flow of the text, but it still makes for good reading and I heartily recommend it to those not too familiar with early evolution of India."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"Book highlights many interesting aspects of Ancient Indian History, Let take these :I never knew that Trade played such a key factor in Ancient India, growth of Sanskrit with Panini's grammer and the official acceptance.'Ancient India' paints a nice detailed picture of ancient India.Reason for it not getting 5 stars: Tone , authour finds it difficult to seperate her liberal world view from the history she seeks to write.Read it for the facts , disregard the bias"},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"Thapar, in this book, follows the model of India, charted by British historians whose purpose was to provide a rationale for the British rule. In this view, there is no reason to describe Indian achievments in the arts, sciences, philosophy. Rather, the focus is to see everything in terms of a supposed struggle between people of different races, vying for domination. This negationism arose from the needs of the British empire, but to continue it in the 21st century is indefensible.According to the historian Thomas R. Trautmann, &quot;Evangelical influence drove British policy down a path that tended to minimize and denigrate the accomplishments of Indian civilization and to position itself as the negation of the (earlier) British Indomania that was nourished by belief in Indian wisdom.&quot; Thapar follows this approach uncritically. It is true that many leftist Indians accept this view, but that is no reason to continue with it.Ananda Coomarswamy once said: &quot;A single generation of English education suffices to break the threads of tradition and create a nondescript and superficial being deprived of all roots - an intellectual pariah who does not belong to the East or the West, to the past or the future. Of all Indian problems the educational is the most difficult and the most tragic.&quot; Thapar's history does nothing to mitigate this superficiality."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"I have to concur with the later reviews.

It is a shame when a \\"professor\\" loses track of the facts, and jettisons objectivity while preciously guarding personal prejudices. Some of the \\"facts\\" in this book are entirely manufactured and rather ludicrous to those who are familiar with recent discoveries in archeology and linguistics.I couln't be less interested in this person's private politics -Marxists, the RSS, Hindu Nationalism etc are not my concern (and, as I suspect, aren't the concerns of most of the readers of this book, either). However, when personal bias clearly colours the tone and \\"facts\\" of a work and obviously detracts from its objectivity, it is time to look elsewhere for a lucid, impartial account of history.

A great deal of research and study must have gone into the creation of such a remarkable opus. I thought it was all-in-all, very respectful of its subject, and especially effective in peeling away centuries of pre- and mis-conceptions imposed by colonial/western commentators. I did not consider the book, in any way, anti-India or anti-Hindu. Anyway, a few points I will make are as follows:1. Ms. Thapar introduces many remarkable and unusual ideas at the very start of her book (in my opinion, the best part), such as race being a colonial construction. But, she fails to discuss these adequately, and very often allows her thoughts to pass on to oblivion, rather than to a definite conclusion. Maybe, a \\"definite conclusion\\" does not exist, at this point-of-time, but a more in-depth approach would have been preferred (even if it added pages to the book).2. Secondly, the quotes used on the back cover seem to imply, that this book should be primarily taken as rebuttal to farfetched claims made about Indian history, within India today. I don't think this is how this book should be advertised. It is so much more than just that.3. The material presented deals primarily with the social, and even economic, history of India. There is a great deal to be found on art, literature, science and architecture. But, my impression was off cultural, social and religious history, rather than political history. I understand that kings do not constitute the alpha and omega of history, but Ms. Thapar barely even mentions kings of influence, such as Kanishka, or even travelers and chroniclers, such as Fa-Hein, in any detail.4. Along that same line, I do not see why it is advertised to be the history of India up to AD 1300. The political history of the thirteenth century is dealt with in maybe 2 lines, if that. I will be very, very curious to see how Ms. Thapar will start volume 2, using a base as inadequate as this!5. My greatest reservation about Ms. Thapar's work has to do with her presentation of Sanskrit/Hindi words using the Latin alphabet. She follows the colonial tradition of ending almost all the words with the ritual \\"a\\". This may be to account for every consonant in Hindi (vyanjan) having a vowel (svar) attached to it. But, she could have made better use of pronunciation aids such as a line overhead to indicate the drawn-out \\"aa\\" sound. Some examples were just absurd, such as \\"pida\\" for \\"pidha\\"/pain. English is not a very phonetic language at all. However, it appears that Ms. Thapar wishes to inhabit the aural world of the colonialists from about 150-200 years ago, but she must realize that by doing so, she is only selling short her otherwise magnificent work.6. I should also point out that this book is not as beautiful a read as say, Prof. Basham's wonderful \\"The Wonder That Was India\\", or the collection of his 7 lectures, compiled into \\"The Origin and Development of Classical Hinduism\\". I will still recommend these books, unreservedly, to anyone with an interest in Indian history or culture. But, Ms. Thapar's book deserves to be read carefully as well."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"It's an excellent work despite the detractors who would view Thapar's works judgmentally, considering she has made no efforts to hide her Marxian credentials.As someone said, it's not a revision but a totally rewritten work. While I agree with this, it would bear pointing out that there is a basic unity of purpose in the two works viz., her stress on the study of the evolution and growth of polities by means of analysis of larger socio economic trends, supported by study of material and other evidence. To this end, there is a long first chapter on historiography incl sources. Her approach is a contrast to the royal chronicle style of writing Indian history, a legacy of the British colonial times still in evidence in the new nationalist histories.It's a riveting narration of facts and interpretation. The book is of uniform quality although there are one or two aspects where it could do with improved treatment.I have the chapter titled \\"The Peninsula: Emerging Regional Kingdoms\\" in mind. The current work still carries the treatment of the Tamil bhakti movement over from the original Penguin edition. This is in effect a retrofitting of the character of medieval north Indian bhakti onto Tamilnadu of almost a millennium before. Inadequate knowledge of the Tamil bhakti texts on the part of Thapar as well as her informants such as R Champakalakshmi, refered to in the author's preface, might be to blame here. Some insight into religious traditions and practice might have helped here to place the bhakti movement in appropriate socio economic context and thus evaluate its contribution to the emerging polity.Barring a few blemishes, it is a magisterial presentation and is unlikely to be bettered for quite a while."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"Here is something I've learned about Indian history: It is pretty controversial to write anything about Indian History. There is very little you can actually say or write about Indian history without angering someone who cares very passionately about the subject your are speaking or writing about. Undoubtably, the single biggest factor in aggravating the debate on Indian historical subjects is the \\"Hindu Nationalism Movement.\\" People in the US who are even aware of this phenomenon typically describe it in political terms, for example, when writing about the actions of the BJP or \\"Bharatiya Janata Party\\" but it should surprise no one that Hindu Nationalist ideas extend directly into historical research, writing and debate. Hindu Nationalism inspired ideas take many forms in the discussion of Early Indian History.First, there is the debate, now largely won, by the way, over whether the initial Vedic migration into India was an \\"invasion\\" or not. Obviously, Hindu Nationalists would rather have it be said that there was no invasion, and many would further argue that India is the home of ALL Indo European Languages. Well, the good news: No Aryan invasion, more like small scale migration over many years. The bad news: There is no way that the Indo European language family originated in North West India, so call that one a draw. Even finding a \\"neutral\\" source on this subject is difficult, but Romila Thapar does a good job of presenting the current historical facts in a non-inflammatory fashion.Another major area of dispute colored by Hindu Nationalism are the pre-Mughal Turkish led raids into Western India, which allegedly resulted in temple destruction and the building of a mosque over said temple location. These disputes have resulted in back and forth terrorist activity as well as the occasional mass killing. Here, Thapar notes that the raids seem not to have bothered the locals at the time, or rather they didn't see it as anything \\"out of ordinary\\" and that any later mosque building was done with the consent of the native community, not at the behest of an \\"outside\\" Muslim ruler.In addition to the controversial subjects, Thapar does a solid job bringing the reader up to date on current \\"hot topics\\" in the field of Early Indian History, like \\"Did the medieval Indian state formation process constitute a variation of European defined feudalism?\\" She also does a remarkably thorough job of discussing the caste formation process in ancient India- I confess to say that it's complexity, even at this level of generality, somewhat escaped my comprehension, but the writing is so clear and concise that I will likely revisit her discussion in a few months.All in all this was a solid introduction to the field of Early Indian history- worth a read for someone seeking a foundation in the subject."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"I really liked the section on archeology and scientific methods in the begining of the book.

I am a student of Sanskrit and the Sanskrit texts. Even though I am well aware of India's sufferings and very sympathetic to her, I do recommend that you read Romila Thapar for a balance in perspective. In many ways India will always remain an enigma, but as a veritable treasury of superb metaphysics, literature, music, and art, India is in my view unparalleled. The creativity of the Indian people, their sheer capacity for endurance and wisdom is awesome.In my endless search to understand India I came across the lady historian, Romila Thapar. Thapar is highly respected by some and vilified by others. I want to share what I found with those who - like me - might not be aware. Frankly, when I first began reading her \`Early India, From the Origins to AD 1300' my feeling was that she was a bit dry, western oriented, and tedious. Where was all the magic and mysticism I had loved in Alain Danielou's \`A Brief History of India'? Then thanks to the Internet, I realized that Romila Thapar had made some serious enemies. This led me to further investigate and to learn why such a respected historian would elicit such vehemence.Romila Thapar [born 1931], Professor Emeritus in History at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, does not believe that history should be used as a political weapon and is against what she terms a 'communal interpretation' of Indian history that chooses facts through an extremely selective partisan filter. Again, I am not Indian and have no cultural bias, no political agenda, and no vested interest in Indian politics.Thapar has a way of describing history that is very broad, encompassing many perspectives, more cleanly an overview abstraction, and perhaps beyond many. She accepts that history will never be fact because what has been written is always from a multiplicity of writers who are saying different things. She compares this to the 1950 Japanese film 'Rashoman' that tells the story of a murder from the four witnesses, including the dead. The film reveals how life is experienced so completely and amazingly from our totally different perceptions. We all live in our own holograms. For Thapar there is no linkage between 'belief' and history; and history will never arrive at any absolute truth, but is an attempt to analyze evidence to find what may have occurred.McCarthyism in IndiaAfter a bit of research I found an illuminating article entitled 'Hating Romila Thapar' from the magazine HIMAL, June 2003. Thapar is described as: \\"...an historian who is indefatigable in the pursuit of knowledge and prolific in its publication, and who is above all a devoted partisan of the truth...\\" - Oxford University to Romila Thapar while conferring on her an honorary Doctorate of Letters, 2002.Excerpted from HIMAL: \\"Thapar's academic work is controversial with the Hindutva lobby because it is grounded in professional methods of historical investigation, rather than in the pet historical theories of Hindu extremists relying on extrapolation from Sanskrit texts. The disagreement may appear academic in nature but the controversy around her appointment speaks to a larger cultural project being advanced under the guise of anti-communism. While it is true that Thapar makes use of some Marxist categories of historiography, unremarkable in itself given the strong Marxist tradition in professional Indian history writing, her opponents' objections are essentially political rather than academic. Thapar's documentation of early Indian life is at odds with Hindutva preference, grounded in a regressive Hindu orthodoxy, of seeing India as a purely Hindu civilisation, the political implications of which for contemporary India being obvious.\\"Excerpt: \\"The campaign [against Romila Thapar] represents the rebirth of McCarthism... [the] reference to McCarthyism is fitting - the Wisconsin conservative denigrated his political and ideological opponents by drawing on a deep-seated religious suspicion of left-wing ideologies, and advanced a powerful, dangerous cocktail of American nationalism grounded in so-called Christian values and unquestioning support for the nation and its political institutions.\\"Excerpt: \\"The matrix of political conditions in 1950s America and present-day India (and the outlook of many in the Indian diaspora) is similar. Hindu nationalists, both in India and abroad, are sensitive to India's position in the world and see themselves as fierce defenders of the Indian nation against \`dangerous' elements, typically constructed as Muslim and also at times as communist/Marxist. McCarthyism and the anti-Thapar campaign are both built on a populist politics of denunciation, of collecting a supposedly monolithic people against a hostile force.\\"In 1954, in a move strikingly similar to the history book shenanigans in India today, the US Congress inserted two words into the \`Pledge of Allegiance' recited every morning by American schoolchildren - '...one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all', so that the pledge would differ from similar statements of loyalty in the Soviet Union that express no divine connection. The insertion in the US pledge is mild in comparison to the broader ideological project of Hindutva, but it rests on a similar assumption, that religion can be used to buttress state-inspired formation of identity. Unlike many of McCarthy's targets, Thapar will not fall victim to the ongoing assault. Tragically, though, the ambitious designs of the Hindutva brigade are already being realised in part throughout India.\\"The mechanics of propaganda in the west are better understood by many of us these days - and revealed in the book, \\"Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda versus Freedom and Liberty\\" by Alex Carey (1996). [available on amazon]. There are some very interesting points of evidence on proganda in Romila Thapar's books. It hasn't only been the Jesuits and their Inquisition, and more recently the manipulative monopoly media, which managed to disempower and bewilder people. Considering propaganda as the tool of political agendas, we may see more clearly what Romila Thapar describes as the place of language and literature in India in the 11th century:\\"The more extensive use of Sanskrit coincided with educated brahmans seeking employment and migrating to various parts of the subcontinent. Where they were successful they were given employment and a grant of land. ... The Sanskrit section of the grant therefore had a political agenda, publicizing royal authority and legitimizing the titles and status of the king, along with his connections to ancient heroes and earlier rulers. The capturing of history became significant. By appropriating the compositions of the suta or bard - the traditional keepers of history - and editing these in a new format, the authors of the texts could control the use of the past and thereby the status of the rulers. The PURANAS, claiming to record the past, were now authored by brahmans and written in Sanskrit, although there was often a pretense that they were still being recited by the bard who was placed formally in the role of the original composer. The audience for this political agenda was the world of kings and courts.\\"The meaning is clear that these educated brahmans were given employment and land grants in exchange for skewing the written word to support the right of rule and power, which in our time is called propaganda. Thapar is worth reading - while we are still free to do so. Also do watch the BBC Hardtalk India interview with Romila Thapar available on YouTube."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"The book is, no doubt, the best for early indian history. It is a revised and expanded edition of the author's earlier work after a long gap of 35 years, and incorporates all the modern research on early india. The older volume of this work has been a staple for all who wanted to learn anything about ancient india. It has been a required reading in almost all the universities in India. The author is one of the most prominent indian historian and she is an authority on ancient india. Without saying much, it would be sufficient to state that this book is a must for anyone who wants to have a insightful glimpse of ancient indian culture and society. Any reviewer giving less then 5 star does not know much about indian history and historians. And mind you, it is not a 'coffee table' book but a serious read."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"If you really want to learn about the history of India, then you'll need to examine the historiography of India, that is, the writing of history. This is where Thapar begins this book, by examining the different schools of thought regarding the history of India.Some think Indian history can be boiled down to the Hindu vs Muslim angle, or the lost Golden Age angle, or the Victorian or Marxist angle. Thapar does not agree.She considers how these different perspectives have shaped the current understanding of Indian history, and then dives into the history itself. Along the way she considers and weighs different perspectives.She isn't limited to the Great Man approach, and does a particularly good job of considering different social layers, as well as the ebb and flow of Hindu/Buddhist/Jaina influence.Her book is not a fast read, and it's not a rousing adventure story, as many good histories are. This is a thoughtful, considered examination of the history of ancient India. If you want knowledge, look here. If you want an adventure, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"This book provides an excellent coverage of a critical period in India's history. The subject is approached in a comprehensive manner, using the findings of history, archaeology, and literature. Throughout the book, Thapar is fair-minded and balanced. Other Americans who have read this book have uniformly had a positive reaction. I therefore cannot understand the bile that has been spilt by the reader from Agra. Perhaps Indians like their history to be little more than propaganda for the country. Praise Heaven that Thapar takes a more intellectually honest route."},{"Title":"Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300","review":"Romila Thapur is one of the greatest living historians of India. There is a misguided campaign by right wing Hindu nationalists, extremists who have no interest in a secular pluralistic India, to label her as communist, which she is not. Using the internet and other means such as some of the reviews here, they are attempting to distort her important message about the pluralistic origins of India. Her unearthing of Sanskrit texts, records and other evidence calls into question their claims that India's ancient roots are purely Hindi. This is a remarkable scholar, her work unparalleled for its rigor. Her long career demonstrates she believes in facts, not polemics."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"The book covers both the political and technical matters of the V-2 (A-4) missile development. As the book is intended for a general audience the coverage of the technology is sufficient for the purpose of the book but not extremely detailed. This is also clear from the title of the book. The description of the political background and military situation is done in a very clear way. The list of references are extremely detailed and it is obviuos the the author has outstanding knowledge of the subject. The important persons are described in what I consider a very balanced way. I recommned this book to anyone wanting to learn about the inner workings of parts of the German WW2 military and political system as well as a the technology of these rockets. An excellent companion is the V-2 by Walter Dornberger which of course must be read with some caution due to the position of its author and time of publication."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"If you want to know a lot of technical information about the German rocket program in World War II this is the place to start. Neufeld has a grasp of the technical side of the program like no other historian, however his writing style leaves much to be desired. A good plus of the book is that he includes diagrams of the missles as well as a couple sections of pictures that give the reader an idea what the things and places he writes about look like. I found being able to visualize certain things makes understanding it much easier. He also includes an appendix with a chronology of the German rocket program that readers will find helpful for quick short references to each successive rocket in the program. Overall this is an excellent book, I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only due to Neufeld's writing style which makes this book tough going in some sections that include lots of boring, and in my opinion, overkill, technical detail."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"The two most important techonological developments of the Second World War were the Atomic Bomb and the V-2 ballistic missile.The development of the V-2 by a group of German scientists, led by Wernher von Braun led directly to the space age and America'ssuccessful effort to beat the USSR to a landing on the Moon. This book describes the efforts of von Braun and his team to build and operate the V-2. 3200 of these rockets were fired in anger, mostly at London and Antwerp. Von Braun and many from his team in Germany became prominent personalities in the Unites States space program, some of the well-known to the public at large. What is less well known is that the people who actually produced the rockets for operational use were part of an army of slaves who were terrorized, brutalized and murdered under the watchful eye of the dreaded SS.It took nine years of development to get the V-2 to an operational status and the author describes the technological, administrative and political difficulties von Braun and his people faced. At one point, SS chief Heinrich Himmler tried to get control of the program as part of his \\"empire building\\". In order to accomplish this, he had Von Braun arrested for a short time. Von Braun's apologists in the US in later years pointed to this in order to whitewash his checkered background, claiming that he was really anti-Nazi. However, the author shows that his arrest had nothing to do with any \\"anti-Nazi\\" beliefs he may have had, but was simply part of Himmler's power play, made in order to pressure the heads of the program to agree to the SS's take-over attempt.The author describes the horrors in which the slave-labor team worked in building and operating the Mittelwerk plant where the operational rockets were produced and the connections between this and von Braun's team. Von Braun is shown to have not had any direct connection with these atrocities, although he did hold the rank of Captain in the SS, but others, who later played a prominent role in the US space program, such as Arthur Rudolph had direct responsibility, which towards the end of his life, led to his depotation from the United States.One of the most interesting points brought out in the book was the fact that the V-2 program ended up being a disaster for Nazi Germany. It was comparable in size and cost, relative to Germany's war economy, to the American Manhattan Project which successfully developed the A-bomb, yet the total weight of explosives sent by the V-2's was less than that delivered by a single large RAF bombing raid. The rocket program ate up scare resources that could have been better invested in other types of armaments. The major irony is that the ultimate benefit from this massive investment by the German taxpayer was not reaped by them, but by Germany's enemy, the United States and its successful space program.The book is written in a dry style, so for that reason I give it only 4 stars, but it is still a very important and interesting book."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"This is an excellent book that goes into exceptional detail about the engineering process and technical feats of the V-2 development. It is one of the best books on the V-2's techincal development aspects, where others are quicker and focus more on the effects of the V-2 attacks.For example, Neufeld discusses at length problems of weight distribution, fin control, fuel, guidance, and even telemetry. The V-2 was an incredibly complicated weapon to develop; a casual person might think that putting a warhead on something long with fins with a rocket engine was easy - it was not.Several years after reading this book, I worked on US missile engineering programs; the V-2 lessons were applicable 50 years later.I have two minor issues with this book; first, the discussions of slave labor, personal responsibility, etc. could arguably be saved for another book. Understanding that to ignore them would be revisionist, this should be first and foremost a book about the rocket's technical history. Even the political history gets to be a distraction. Second, as a technical book, it does not and should not have widespread appeal. While I personally found the technical history fascinating, it is clear that not everyone will.If Neufeld were ever to rewrite these books, perhaps a two or three part series covering the technical, political, and sociological histories separately would help readers focus on the aspects of the Rocket and the Riech that interest them most."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"This is another must have book regarding the V-2 rocket. I have found at least four good books on this subject and they are all worth the price. See my pevious reviews regaing V-2 rocket books. These are all good reference materials."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"This book told me more than I wanted to know about the development of the V-2. It goes into excruciating detail about everything that went on: who did what and when, who in the Reich supported the effort, who opposed it (and how the supporters got around the detractors).I was most interested in the technical challenges and how they were dealt with (and bemused to find that some of the most gifted of the engineers were killed during the war-one wonders how much better Project Apollo might have gone if they'd still been around). There's also significant insight into how the Third Reich really worked (more a collection of competing bureaucracies than the monolithic entity it's generally considered to be) and an extensive discussion of the culpability of von Braun and some of the others in the atrocities of the Third Reich and the V-2 manufacturing effort itself, particularly the slave labor camp at Mittelwerk.In short, interesting but a bit too much; however, still the definitive work on the subject. I will have to reread Ordway's The Rocket Team for comparison someday."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"A rather serious book that focuses more on the politics and organizational challenges than on the technology and day to day operations. He also discusses the forced labor workers who worked not only at Peenemunde but also in the underground factories, worked literally to death in some cases. The book itself is rather dry and the political aspects tend to dominate the narrative. Only recommended to those who wish to study the subject."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"Obviously, the book stresses more the organisational issues (which can be cumbersome) than the technical details of the V2 project. An organigram of the ordnance/ministry/SS would have been helpful, as well as a map of the various sites. Not many technical details, especially on the Wasserfall project (I am not sure I understand by which mean the missile were to hit a plane...). Subjects are not always presented according to their chronological order. No detailed information on the actual devastations caused by the rockets (where, how many, hit rate). Otherwise, it seems that the information is pretty accurate."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"Neufeld does an excellent job of presenting documents and detailed information on Dr. Wernher Von Braun during World War Two. Where he goes astray is in his interpretation of the information. He presents a flimsy thesis of Von Braun as a Nazi collaborator. He stops short of calling Von Braun a war criminal but states he is morally responsible for the slave labor used from the Dora camp. Neufeld does not present any viable alternatives for Von Braun except that he should have done something to protest the use of forced laborers on the V2. Much is made of Von Braun's SS connection but Neufeld seems to ignore the consequences for those who crossed Himmler and the SS. Neufeld gives the reader a good look at the Peenemunde days while drawing the wrong conclusions of the situation for Von Braun and the German rocket team. No excuses are needed for Von Braun. The job for readers of history is to put what occured then in context of the time and situation."},{"Title":"The Rocket and the Reich: Peenemunde and the Coming of the Ballistic Missile Era","review":"I am familiar with Michael Neufeld's earlier work with the Paper-Clip interviews on audio tape on file at NARA. What is enigmatically missing from these interviews (and the book) is what these pro-Nazi scientists knew about BERGKRISTALL/ESCHE 2 Guzen II &lt;BERGKRISTALL/ESCHE 2 underground tunnel installation at St.Georgen/Gusen Austria&gt; at Mauthausen Concentration Camp. Yes the ME-262 jet engine was engineered and stored there but some &lt;other&gt; very interesting mind boggling technologies were developed there with the help of Jewish slave labor. These slaves were murdered to eliminate any oral historical record of this new strange technology and the Nazi otracirites. Eventually in May of 1945 the invading US 41st Recon Squad 11th Ard Div 3rd US Army liberated the camps. But Russians got to this technology in the tunnels before the US forces could as our boys did not know what they had found until the O.S.S. went over photo recon much later.By November 1947 the Russians had scooped up and exploited as much as they could and eventually dynamited the tunnels leaving us with nothing but scrapes. To this day they still have unfettered access to this technology but we caught up to them (so to speak) by bringing these Paper-Clip boys to Wright Field (Wright-Paterson AFB today)in Dayton Ohio. This was the real beginning of the Cold War Space Race.In the Neufeld interviews you will learn of some NEW things you never knew before about the Pennemunde Boys like Project Wasserfall (i.e, submarine fired missle system), the Washington and Brooklynn Rocket Program (V-9 or the V4a bastard rocket - first attempt at ICBM). Maybe some day soon someone will discover the connection between Kplt. Hellmut Neuerburg's U-869 REAL mission from Kriegsmarine and this Wasserfall project! (i.e., a Type IXC/40 submarine that accidently sunk itself with an acoustic T5 torpedo off the coast of New Jersey halfway between Brooklyn and Washington DC in early 1945 near the end of the WWII.)"},{"Title":"The Answer Is God: The inspiring personal story of Dale Evans and Roy Rogers","review":"A very inspiring book - everyone should read it.

I soon began to form quite a rile hatred of this book. It became obvious to me that what I was reading should never have made it past the manuscript stage. It really is that bad. There are many reasons that this book is a real stiker, and I will outline some of the points below.1) The author injects himself too much into the book, which soon becomes irratating. He makes silly un-worthhwhile remarks in the footnotes, which aren't used to expand on a point, but rather as a method for the author to insert gleeful comments, ultimately wasting the readers time.2) inconsistency in code written. In some sections, the author will have written a script (for instance) &lt;javascript=something&gt; in some places and &lt;javascript=&quot;something&quot;&gt; in others.3) Non-sensical code examples. The code examples shown look purely academic and have no resemblence to any real world use. They are also hard to follow at times. They are certainly not inyuitive at all. This is the case with almost all the Javascript examples.4) The code that is written can seem a little intimidating, and very messy. Often the author will try and boast by showing us (as he even states) useless code examples. WHY???5) Code examples contain errors, which is very frustrating. On page 137, he refers to builtin javascript variable with code example doucment.bgcolor. It should be doument.bgColorOn page 258, he outdoes himself by making two FATAL programming errors. This is the case where an assignment statement (=) is incorrectly used where a comparison (eq) operator should be used.The other involved an incorrect use of the open() statement.This program of course did not compile, and dents the confidence one has when relying on the book for code examples.6) Errors in formatting. On page 222, the user is greeted with formatting codes (looks like LaTex) which have somehow slipped past the author and made it's way into the book.On the upside, the HTML section was fairly good, but then again, there isn't too much room for error when explaining this simple language.My advice, find another book. Avoid this one like the plague!"},{"Title":"Web Programming: Building Internet Applications","review":"This book provides horrible code examples, the author does not explain the syntax of code at nearly the empirical level required for a novice web developer. He omits blocks of code from larger program examples if he feels he has &quot;explained&quot; it already, which makes the larger code blocks even more difficult to comprehend given his lack of explanations. This book is not suitable as a tool to teach oneself from scratch."},{"Title":"Web Programming: Building Internet Applications","review":"I was given this book as part of a graduate IT course. As I had an excellent understanding of HTML already I skipped to the Javascript section and was sorely disappointed. As another reviewer has pointed out, there were several blatant errors in the code that were quite unbelievable. Surely the assignment operator (=) and the equality operator ( == or eq) should not get mixed up in a published book, yet in this case they were. I tried to read on but kept on encountering poor editing and what seemed to be a lack of understanding on part of the author. Needless to say I quit the course and bought the Definite Guide to Javascript."},{"Title":"Web Programming: Building Internet Applications","review":"Let me start out by saying that if this wasn't a \\"required\\" textbook for a class I am taking in college I would have shipped this back to Amazon a long time ago and demanded my money back. That is how bad this book is.Have you ever tried to take a class and the book you are using is filled with page after page of errors? We're not talking about small errors, but errors of the magnitude that it affects the subject matter being taught. I've never seen so many coding errors in all my life. I started this class not knowing a thing about Javascript and have no doubt I could have produced a better text than this.Next, let's talk about the outdated examples. This book may have been great in 1996, but times have changed and technology has changed on the web. Many of the methods the author talks about are dated and just plain inefficient in the modern web world.Strike three is the author's inconsistent use of programming syntax. In one example he'll close his tags, the next example he uses an in-line close, the one after that he doesn't close the tags at all. It is like reading a paper a 3rd grader wrote.Unless you ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY have to get this book for your class then don't. Before you spent a dime on it see if you can buy it used (I'm sure there are PLENTY of people who want to get rid of it). Finally, suggest to your instructor that they need to find a different book -- one that recognizes it is 2008 and one that wasn't written by a novice trying to teach on a professional level."},{"Title":"Web Programming: Building Internet Applications","review":"Required for a class, I have to suspect the college is getting a kickback or something.

In short his inability and blatant disinterest in teaching are echoed throughout the book (and my university course).I am sure he has made a quick $buck through the sale of this book as a staple coding reference for many of the U.K. Universities and colleges (where his friends work - standard lecturer swindling technique!!), albeit at the expense of students education.My advice for any java/java applet code references is to look for SUNSOFT PRESS books (real-SUN), as they are fairly easy to follow"},{"Title":"Web Programming: Building Internet Applications","review":"This book really got me working right away.

Earth, 6 million years ago, dominated by a malevolent alien race, enslaving a time-travelling humanity. This final book of the series handles its climaxes well and raises issues to be addressed in the future or the past -- certainly in the next series of books by May. Julian May's vision of Pleiocine Earth questions the heritage of the human race: past, present and future. It is intensely thought-provoking and draws from influences as varied as mythology, psychology, religion, politics and folklore. One of the best marriages of both hard science fiction and fantasy I've seen to date. The ending could use a bit more of a denouement -- it would be nice to have more time to savor the climax - but all in all, a masterful series that is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"The Adversary is the last in the Pliocene exile series anddelivers fireworks.

At least I can read the first two again"},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"My Dad has had the first three books in The Saga of the Exiles hanging around for as long as I can remember and I finally got around to reading them about 2 weeks ago. And I ate them up, hoo boy. The first three were a literary feast and by the time I finished The Non-Born King I NEEDED to read The Adversary and I finally found it in the library at my university. And let me tell you, folks, this book is the crowning glory on the best achievement in sci-fi writing to date. What an amazing culmination of all May's talents- her wonderful, evocative prose, the flawless creation of her characters, the twisting, thrilling plot, to name a few.The Adversary details the lead up to the Grand Tourney, Aiken Drum's substitute for the Grand Combat, the contest itself and its repercussions. And what repercussions. I'm not gonna tell you, you'll have to read the book ;). Such a short summary is hardly worthy of the novel itself, but to go into more detail would be to ruin May's carefully crafted work- and by the time you finish the last page, you'll be astounded by the depth and breadth of her vision.Before I read The Saga of the Exiles, my favourite fantasy/sci-fi series was Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun- but I found Julian May's Saga infinitely more gripping, confronting and so much more entertaining. I've heard criticisms of the series, none of which I agree with, the two foremost that 1. it's difficult to understand a lot of her language without a dictionary by your side, but to this I say: even if it's so for you, PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T BE PUT OFF. You'll never find a series more rewarding than this one.The second criticism I've heard was 2. that it's clear cut good vs. evil. I've never heard anything sillier in my life. One of the main things I loved about the Saga was its ambiguity in terms of where the reader's loyalty can lie- I wanted EVERYONE to win at some point, \`elfin' Tanu, \`demonic' Firvulag, Lowlife humans; and I've heard a lot of people express their love for Marc Remillard, the infamous Adversary himself.All I can leave you with is this: wow. What a beautiful series. The Adversary- what a BRILLIANT bloody ending. So satisfying. Oh. God. I think I'm going to go start The Many-Coloured Land again and read the whole series a second time. How fabulous. Oh. Wow."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"The breathtaking conclusion to the Saga of Pliocene Exile,we are confronted by three principals-- King Aiken Drum, former misfit; Elizabeth Orme, former psychic, now ohmbudsperson of the Many Colored Land; and Marc Remillard, felled leader of a Rebellion against a 22nd century galaxtic civilizatio.I cannot emphasize my admiration for May's writing. Her style is vivid, smooth, alive. In this book, Remillard takes center stage, the most provocative character in sci-fi. He is Milton's fallen Lucifer-- brilliant, driven, obsessed to the point of cruelty-- ultimately noble, self-sacrificing-- in this way he is rebornBut don't think that May ignores her other characters. They continue to evolve, gaining substance, soul. I never found myself saying &quot;No, that doesn't fit&quot;-- she makes this incredibly complex work while remaining true to the personalities of her characters and the scenario she has created.The tension in this book is less about epic battles with armies of thousands (although there is that here), as in Nonborn King, and more about a war of wills, manipulations of chess pieces on a board by the principals. Somehow, the story gets still deeper, then comes to a satisfying, appropriate conclusion.IMO, the best sci-fi series ever written."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"The end is nigh, Night is about to Fall. The ogreish Firvulag plot amongst themselves, eager to fight the Final Battle and defeat their Foe once and for all.

The scattered Lowlives, once renegade humans hiding in the woods, are forming a third power block, using technology smuggled from the future and the deadly bloodmetal, fatal to the alien races. And high above them all, in her self imposed isolation, reluctant planetary guardian Elizabeth Orm bears the burdens of three races on her tired shoulders.The signs are all around, the portents fulfilled, the NightFall war is coming, and with it, the Adversary - Marc Remillard, Paramount Grand Master Psychic. Rebel. Monster. He was one of the most powerful minds in the future, before he turned against everyone he loved, and led thousands in a war against the peaceful Galactic Milleu. His actions caused the deaths of millions, and he fled through the time gate, hoping to restart his plans with a six million year head start.

I don't believe there is another blend of sf/fantasy quite like May's sweeping vision, and I have read all 9 books in the series several times. I wonder why Hollywood hasn't gotten its blood soaked hands on this saga yet..."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"What I really want to do is review the whole series. It seems to me that it really is impossible to talk about one of the nine books separately, far much more than in other series. Common complaints in the other reviews are lack of full explanation, lack of sufficient denouement. But in this case, I don't think that applies. This is a NON-LINEAR series! The denouement for the Adversary, for example, is scattered through the Galactic Milieu trilogy, especially Magnificat. Conversely, much of the denouement of Magnificat can be gleaned by reading bits of the Pliocene Saga which talk about what is thought of the Rebellion twenty-seven years after. To fully appreciate these books, you have to read them all, then go back and look through them again, examining Rogi's conversations with the 'Family Ghost' and other places. These books don't follow one after the ot! her in a neat orderly manner. It's an unusual way to write a series, but if you've read some interviews with Julian May, you'll know she didn't write the books in a chronological manner, but kind of planned all nine at once.One reading will never do these books justice. I would suggest reading the Pliocene Saga as a sequel to the Galactic Milieu books, because that really is what they are. May just happened to publish them first. Since I read the Milieu first, I cannot imagine how anyone can fully appreciate Nonborn King and the Adversary without knowing about Marc Remillard first.That reminds me . . . there is one area where the cross-referencing lets me down. I want to know more about Marc and Elizabeth's work in Duat, more about that not-insignificant gap of six million years we have missing out of Marc's life! But I think at this late date I have to give up hope."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"The human Grand Master operants are a focus of this book. Elizabeth is a grand master farsensor, and she realises Marc Remillard is in the Pliocene, and who he is, and asks for his help in curing a Tanu baby. Some of them reject the Torc and will die, in general, but Elizabeth and Marc know techniques that may help, and lead the Tanu to operancy, something the Firvulag already enjoy.As Marc and Elizabeth grow closer, he must deal with his own rebellion, as the number of Milie rebels dwindle, and his children don't want to participate in his breeding plans for them, and his Mental Man project. The children want to return to the Milieu.A stubborn conservative part of Tanu and Firvulag society still wants to bring about their own Armaggeddon, the Nightfall War."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"What can I say about this final book (though not the end)in a wonderfully creative series, I am amazed at Julian Mays ability to create such a rich and complex world ! the characters are unique, well defined and feel real, you are able to immerse yourself in their world so easily that you are thankfully distracted from your own very mundane exsistance!There is so much to this series that it is difficult to summarise adequately the sheer originality and creativity that went into this scifi/fantasy classic! I shall instead leave that up to you, to follow the misfits of Human society and dare to travel to the Earths distant past and be part of an adventure like none other, this series is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, you wont regret making this a fine addition to your collection! SIMPLY BRILLIANT!"},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"I liked this book a lot. I put off reading anything else until I finished this series. My only singular complaint is the order in which they were published in relation to the Galactic Milieu. I made the mistake of reading Jack the Bodiless a couple of years ago and subsequenlty forgot the tittle and author. I then read the Saga of the Pliocence Exile on the prompting of a friend. I found myself vaugely remembering the name Marc Remillard. It took me weeks to figure out what this was all about, and by then I had finished the Pliocene Exile without realizing it might have been easier just to have read Galatic Mileu first so I could figure out what was up with Marc. I just satrted re-reading Jack the Bodiless and plan to then read the Pliocene exile again so I can sort it all out. It is much easier to read them in order of the events taking place than the order of the publication date."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"Adversary wraps up the 4-book &quot;Saga&quot; with superior style. JM creates a climax which is the perfect extension of all that came before. No last-minute change of heart 'ala Darth Vader in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. May's characters live out the natural extention of who they are and how they came to be. I am unusually sad that we will hear no more of Aiken, Lord Sugoll, Marc and Elizabeth. In the 9 books which make up this story arc there are close to 4000 pages. Who could believe that is not enough. Hollywood could never do justice to this story but lord, how I wish they would try."},{"Title":"Adversary","review":"Juliam May delivers this in final book to the saga of the Many Colored Land. Her ability to create a history and tie it to the 'present' surpasses all other writers who attempt to create an all-inclusive universe. She blends fiction with real life so that the reader can readily believe her fabulous tales."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"This is one of those books of which all too many Lutherans have heard but that far too few have read. I myself must admit that although I was baptized and confirmed in the Lutheran Church, I had not read the Large Catechism until just recently. Upon finishing it, I asked myself why I had not done so years ago, as it would have saved me much trouble.The Large Catechism is Martin Luther's summary of his own teachings. He wrote the catechism for one simple reason - to remind the infant Lutheran Church of the things for which they stood and to advise them as to how they should live and worship. His explanations are clear and straight-forward. He is remarkably blunt at times, not being a man fond of euphemism, in his admonition for a godly life against a worldly one. Yet at no time does he profess the necessity of leaving the world to follow God. It is his contention that one only need live by God's commandments and everything will work out in the end. It is this down to earth, common sense theology that made Luther, and from him the Protestant Reformation, so successful.Reading Luther, it is easy to see how people were drawn to his ideas. After centuries of clerical obscurantism, endless canonical laws and regulations, papal pronouncements, and a host of other arcana, a theology that can be summed up as \\"Love God, follow his commandments in your actions as well as in your hearts, observe the sacraments of baptism and communion, and seek comfort in the Word of God\\" must have been a breath of fresh air to the beleaguered people of Germany.Luther's commentary upon the commandments is both helpful and enlightening. He admonishes those who would think they have heard or thought all they need to think again. Often, he will surprise you with an observation so clear and true that you will wonder why you never thought of it yourself. It is from this experience that you then realize that his admonition against thinking you know it all proves itself.While the book is recommended to all Christians, indeed, to anyone for that matter, it is especially recommended to Lutherans. For too long we have forgotten the roots of our faith. We need to refresh our memories as to who we are and what we believe, and most importantly why we believe it. Read not only the Large Catechism, but the Augsburg Confessions, the 95 Theses, the Table Talk... for that matter, get a copy of the Book of Concord (of which a new edition has just been published) and read it through. You may discover that you are part of a denomination you have never really known. Take my word for it, you will reap the benefits of your labors."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"Luther's large catechism is an invaluable primary text for protestant studies. This book outlines the points of Christianity that Luther deems fundamental, and in Luther's own words you read how the father of the reformation viewed the Christian life. It is a short read, and well worth the time for the insight into the times and thought that birthed Lutheranism and the reformation."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"I bought this hoping that it would be a better translation than the free versions online. The reviews of this on the Kindle store were all about the catechism itself, so i bought it, and now wish I did not. There is no table of contents, which is terrible for someone who wants to use the catechism and go to different sections. The only way to go to a section is to guess its page number. This purchase wasn't a lot of money, but i'd rather not even have this version on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"This book is easy to read and understand. It is concise and practical for anyone seeking insight into Luther's teaching of God's Word. I highly recommend this book to those who are new to their faith in God or want to expand from the shorter catechism."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"Everyone must read this extraordinary piece of historical literature. I enjoyed this most compelling source to the inner thinkings of Luther."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"this is one of the best spirtal books I have seen."},{"Title":"Luther's large catechism","review":"I am a Roman Catholic who is looking for precisely what Martin Luther's doctrines are. Upon asking an Evangelical Lutheran for a resource to study such doctrines, I was told to consult this book. After reading it cover to cover, clearly this book is intended for the instruction of children (as indicated by Martin Luther in these pages). If you are looking for the complete doctrines of Martin Luther, look elsewhere. For the record, I wish to familiarize myself with Luther's religion in order to convince others that the Protestant revolt resulted in many man-made religions that are diametrically opposed to the one true divinely instituted Church of our lord Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"ALISTAIR MACLEAN'S NIGHT WATCH","review":"\\"Alistair MacLean's Night Watch\\" was actually penned by Alastair MacNeill, working from a novel outline left by MacLean at his death. MacLean is best known in the United States for \\"Where Eagle Dare\\" and \\"The Guns of Navarone.\\" The storyline of \\"Night Watch\\" is vintage MacLean, with a complicated plot and lots of dangerous action on an international scale. This novel continues with the cast of U.N. secret agents introduced in \\"Death Train.\\"The genesis of the plot is the clever theft of the Rembrandt painting \\"NIght Watch.\\" The U.N. agents assigned to secure its recovery soon find themselves involved in a series of overlapping international intrigues, their mission threatened by personal conflicts and unforeseen challenges. For those of us who miss Alistair MacLean, \\"Night Watch\\" is like diet soda, a reasonably refreshing and serviceable copy of MacLean's writing style from his later years. MacNeill keeps the action moving along smartly and throws in more than enough exotic detail and locales to keep up reader interest. The twists and turns last to the very last page. That said, MacNeill is not quite a master of MacLean's understated ironic humor and precise use of language. The dialogue in particular is occasionally awkward.This book is recommended to the reader looking for a good adventure story. The plot is fast moving and complicated enough to be easily a step above the average beach novel."},{"Title":"ALISTAIR MACLEAN'S NIGHT WATCH","review":"A novel in the series about a UNACO strike force. In this one the action takes place in South America and involves drug lords, spies and loads of other detective-story types. The action is mostly fast-paced, quite intriguing, with a few interesting plot twists. Very similar to other MacLean stories that were completed by Alistair MacNeil, such as &quot;Night Of The Assasins&quot; and &quot;Death Train&quot;."},{"Title":"ALISTAIR MACLEAN'S NIGHT WATCH","review":"\\"Night Watch\\" was written by Alastair MacNeill from a story by Alistair MacLean. The plot involves the theft of a famous painting. UNACO, a United Nations detective team is put on the case. There's lots of action and locations that could have been taken from a James Bond movie, but the story is neither very interesting nor very well told. What starts as a mystery ends up as a halfhearted attempt at a spy story, and the writer adds lots of unnecessary details and a subplot about one of the characters' marriage, which slows down the pace. The book also lacks MacLean's trademark humor. Not recommended."},{"Title":"ALISTAIR MACLEAN'S NIGHT WATCH","review":"I just finished this book and it was great! I often read Clancy and I really enjoyed the same type of feel in this book. The main difference is that it took about 3 days to finish as opposed to 3 weeks with Clancy. I would love to follow the cast of characters on another round, they were very intreaguing."},{"Title":"Las Mamis: Escritores latinos recuerdan a sus madres (Spanish Edition)","review":"One has to bear in mind that writing about people one knows is very subjective, and this is the author's right. People simply are not objective about those close to them. The writers of this book have accomplished a creation that has resulted in a beautiful specimen of literature, rich in description and sentiment, both amusing and tragic.How can one not laugh when Jaime Manrique quotes the only comment his mother makes after she sees her son's pictures in a magazine spread for the first time: &quot; You look fat, You'd better lay off those pies&quot; and how can one not cry when he writes &quot;The most wonderful tribute I can pay to my mother is to say that whereas most children automatically love their mothers, I've grown to love Soledad.&quot; But these quotes don't mean much without reading all that precedes them.And then, who will ever forget, once read, Alba Ambert's haunting search for a mother she has never known and how she consciously forms a life for herself based on this lack of knowledge?If you are looking for straight storytelling, you will find it here, but you will also find great sentiment and poetry within these pages. That in itself is worth the read. One no longer cares as one reads along if it is true or not; it still touches the soul."},{"Title":"Las Mamis: Escritores latinos recuerdan a sus madres (Spanish Edition)","review":"Esmeralda Santiago edits Las Mamis, a powerful gathering of Latino authors who recall their mothers.

Excellent book! Very interesting. You most buy it if you want to know more about these Mamis - Mothers of different Latinamerican writters are the inspiration in a way or another in their lives.

Beautiful stories put together."},{"Title":"Las Mamis: Escritores latinos recuerdan a sus madres (Spanish Edition)","review":"I bought this book for a Mother's Day gift. No way will I give it to my mom. Graphic stories with sensitive content. Sure, it pays homage to mothers in some ways. But, I don't relate to it at all--not even on the &quot;hispanic&quot; level."},{"Title":"Las Mamis: Escritores latinos recuerdan a sus madres (Spanish Edition)","review":"When I first saw this book in the bookstore, I could not believe that someone finally put together a book about Latin mothers. As a person with a Mexican mother, I was hopeful that my unique experiences would finally be told. I was wrong. The writing in this book is dishonest and pretentious. I kept getting the feeling that the writers were trying to impress the readers with their clever writing and big words. It certainly did not help that the editors chose to exhaustively list all of the awards and accolades ever bestowed upon the writers. What does this have to do with writing about your mother? Even though some of the stories were potentially touching, I did not shed one tear because I simply could not get over the &quot;look at me&quot; writing. If someone wants to read a beautifully written book about a mother that made me cry and think about my own mother, please read Growing Up by Russell Baker. Russell Baker's mother did not have to be Mexican for me to be touched by her son's honesty and the beauty of his writing."},{"Title":"Volkswagen Workshop Manual: Types 11, 14, and 15, 1958-1960","review":"After using gregorys/hayes manuals for my Landcruiser for the last 10 years this was like a big breath of fresh air. The detail is unbelievable and the book contains some really good pointers on how to tweak items to get them to fit not just how to put them together. Things like mm clearance on trim parts was great!! The book also has instructions that are very good for a novice car restorer like myself.Only thing that would be good is if a folder style version was available (like the original) so I could photocopy pages and take them to the workshop."},{"Title":"Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts","review":"Aptly edited by experienced needlecrafter Dianne Hire, Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts is a fascinating book that displays quilts constructed from the inspiration of oxymorons, innately contradictory phrases such as Clearly Ambiguous, Extinct Life, Silent Scream, Linear Curve, Icy Hot, Deafening Silence, and more. Each quilt's weaving embodies the riddle, and brings the subtle paradoxes of a common yet bizarrely meaningless phrase to life. With sketches and glimpses into the thought processes of the quilt designers, Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts offers a rare and recommended view into creative consciousness of quilt makers."},{"Title":"Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts","review":"The title itself is a contridiction. &quot;Absurdly Logical Quilts&quot; The author has examined the quilts, and contridictory titles, of 40 top American present day quilters. She has explained in simple detail the range of mediums, materials and techniques used by each quilter. It is interesting how each quilter describes her own work of art. Having followed quilting for a number of years, I thank Mrs. Hire for giving us an indepth, and sometimes humoruos, look at this unique art form."},{"Title":"Oxymorons: Absurdly Logical Quilts","review":"What a fun book for those people who want a book that is more than country squares and fabrics.

I can see why the authors wanted to use the &quot;good girl&quot; theme as a hook, but both men and women get frustrated by negotiating. They know their stuff, from behind-the-scenes at funeral homes to scholarly research on negotiating.Their tips are very straightforward and right on. They understand the world of home-buying, car-buying and more. They are absolutely right: don't accept what's offered first.Get information. Find out what the going rate is and don't pay too much.This is a good book to keep on the shelf. Besides the general perspective, the authors offer direct guidance for specific situations. You never know which one you'll need next."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"This book to me seems to written by journalist, yes. I question after reading this dribble that they have any real business world experience. They seemd to have just researched what was required to complete the book. I would like to see the resumes of these guides. I would like to know how many bargaining tables they have really sat behind."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"I read this book upon the recommendation of a friend. At first, I was skeptical since I prefer fiction to non-fiction or self-help books. Still, I trust my friend and the concept sounded intriguing so I went for it. Boy, I wasn't disappointed. I had no IDEA how poor a negotiator I really was in the long run. Here, I thought as a freelance writer and entrepreneur I had mastered the art. Suffice to say, I couldn't put the book down. It grabbed me from page one, with it's candid prose, terrific humor, and dead-on descriptions of how &quot;good girls&quot; (okay, like me) aren't getting what they really deserve.I saw myself in every case study and practical example of how other women are doing better than I am in this area. I really connected to their stories. In doing so, I learned a ton about myself--including when and where I can improve my negotiation skills. I am excited about applying this information to my own experiences (in fact, I've already started at both work and in my family relationships).I highly recommend this book to anybody who thinks they deserve more from their interactions with other people but don't know how to go about getting it. I've already bought 15 copies to give as holiday gifts to my girlfriends. (Yes, I'm a planner!) Thanks and kudos to the authors!"},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"Exhibiting all the traits of a &quot;good girl&quot; and fuming from my last job review, I thought this book would be a perfect weekend read. By the end, I was bored and this book has been tossed into my pile of rejected paperbacks.This book is more successful in listing personality traits of a &quot;good girl&quot; rather than giving effective strategies that are sure to lead to bargain table success. There are some negotiating tactics, but they aren't anything new (listen, know how to say no, get things in writing, shop around, think before you sign, etc). Once I finished the book, I knew what made me a &quot;good girl,&quot; I knew there were a lot of women like me, and I knew in what situations &quot;good girls&quot; failed, but I still didn't have an applicable strategy for remedying these issues.For instance, the authors recommend researching your expected salary before negotiating your next job contract. This isn't new advice, and I still didn't know where to turn for this information -- coworkers, online, library? There are a few cases where the authors give resources -- but they are ones I am already familiar with or are too obscure to be useful (what numbers to call when barganing for a casket, find out what your car is worth with the kelly blue book).And be forewarned, the entire book consists of hundreds and hundreds of anecdotes. It is the reader's responsibility to figure out how to apply other women's successes and pitfalls to herself. While sometimes entertaining, this approach is not going to transform a &quot;good girl&quot; into a negotiating shark.There are few good points in this book but most of it is just common good sense."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"My spouse and I used this book recently in buying our new minivan. The information about buying cars in the &quot;Good Girls&quot; book was very helpful in our negotiations with the car dealers. Using the tips in the book, we were able to get exactly what we wanted at a price well below sticker. The book made us much more confident in dealing with the sales people, and I felt that we were very well prepared, thanks to the information included in the book. This book isn't just for good girls, but for anyone who wants to learn how to negotiate better. I'm very glad this book came along just as we were buying a new car, and I think that it would be very helpful for anyone who will be buying a car, a new home, or doing anything that requires good negotiating skills."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"The book tells you what women do wrong but it does not really teach you how to do it right. The authors interview a lot of people who may know something about the topic but they do not do so in depth. They then string together a lot of quotes without real analysis and practical how to. I should have known from the introduction that the authors were not experts in this area."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"This book was not really what I was looking for. I wanted to think about negotiation generally, and how I as a woman am approaching it, and how I can be more effective. Although the book has some limited general advice at the beginning, almost all of the book focuses on specific situations (buying a car, getting a divorce, etc.) Since all of the situations presented were inapplicable to me, the book was of limited value. Readers interested in this title should check the table of contents and excerpt on this page. I would not have picked this book if those features had been available when I bought it."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"Kudos and thanks to the talented and tough team of Elizabeth Austin and Leslie Whitaker for writing a superb, well-reported and well-written business book not filled with silly metaphors, juvenile imagery and psychobabble. &quot;The Good Girls' Guide to Negotiating&quot; is well-documented and practical with insight, advice and tips for use in many different arenas and life trials. There are success stories and lessons, all written with candor and aplumb, in a style that is readable and understandable.Perhaps because both women are trained journalists, this book has substance and solid information for application on a variety of fronts, from home to work, volunteer office and even to the funeral parlor. I recommend this book as a graduation gift to any young woman from high school, college or graduate school. It's also perfect as an engagement gift, birthday, guide to someone newly divorced or someone swtiching careers or life paths. This is advice all women can heed, from how to approach a deal to how to feel confident about fees.So many business books I have read over the years-- particuarly those aimed at women-- appear to be condescending or just plain foolish. They state the obvious in metaphors that may attempt to be mythical but come off as cartoonish. Not so with this welcome book. It is a proud addition to my bookshelf and I suggest the good old boys get a good look at it too.Way to go, girls, you did good."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"This practical and fun-to-read book will help you in any type of negotiation, personal or business. Every woman will be able to relate to at least a few of the personal stories of negotiation trauma and triumph. The book has a complete index so specific topics can be easily located. Detailed information on helpful resources is included when applicable. A rare book - enjoyable to read and wonderfully useful!"},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"This is a great book which has helped me take charge of my life in business by using the techniques outlined by Austin and Whitaker. As I read the book it occured to me that I would like to ask the authors specific questions not covered in the book.The majority of reviews on this book have been very favorablebut each of us seems to have more questions or needs not covered in the book. Usually when a book is as successful as this one appears to be the publisher arranges a book signing.I have yet to hear of this occurance and would relish the chance to ask a few specific questions and get my book signed by Austin and Whitaker."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"I have been in business to business sales for 10 years and found this book refreshing. Although it has a limited shelf-life with some very hip references, it deals with very specific topics (buying a car, a house)as well as help develop a negotiating attitude. I gave it to my mom (who has always been afraid to speak up) and my sister who pops off whatever is on her mind. Mom learned you don't get what you don't ask for and sis learned to remember &quot;what's in it for them&quot;.It is an easy read-pick it up put it down."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"For all of us who have faced the nightmare of being assertive in negotiations, in asserting our rights as individuals, consumers and professionals, this book is a must. I could readily identify with many of the issues confronting women in everday life. The methodologies for overcoming shyness and lack of confidence were extremely helpful, understandable and doable. All you need is a different mindset and approach to getting what you want. The authors are easy to relate to and thus their suggestions are easier to grasp. Through humor, the authors made their subject come alive. I found the reading quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating: How to Get What You Want at the Bargaining Table","review":"&quot;The Good Girl's Guide to Negotiating&quot; provides the organizing principles for successful negotiations. The prose sparkles and the ideas illuminate.This book identifies the intrinsic skills that women--who were raised to be ladies--possess, and then illustrates how to employ these talents in a myriad of situations which require negotiating finesse. The authors provide entertaining and insightful vignettes that highlight the principles of smart negotiations.I've used the guidelines the authors offer to negotiate a five figure business contract, as well as to bargain for antique Hollohaza porcelain in Budapest.This book is the perfect gift for any woman who wore white gloves on Sunday to visit the great aunts and uncles, who danced at chaperoned cotillions and who learned to say &quot;No&quot; only to frisky dates. It tops my December holiday list for my dear friends, who will be delighted to learn how to use all the qualities that have made them ladies to negotiate for anything with aplomb."},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"I loved this book. It was simply wonderful to read. The title matches up perfectly with the content. And the content is very well presented. I would have liked the book better if it had included a Glossary, but the fact that one was not included doesn't kill my high opinion of this book.Estate planning can be a VERY complicated endeavor. However, it need not be for most people. And this book is aimed at presenting the basics regarding estate planning for the average Tom, Dick, or Mary. It covers wills, will substititutes, and trusts. It covers retirement planning (a little) and some on planning for incapacity.Of course, what would an estate planning book be without a little discussion on Federal Estate Taxes and techniques to reduce the bite of those taxes if you have a little larger than normal net worth. Lastly, there is some talk about lawyers that practice estate planning, and how to consider hiring one if you might have a need to do so.Nolo is noted for its self-help mentality, and this book is geared to help Nolo's target audience. If you think your net worth is significant and you will require the services of a competent estate tax planning attorney, then this book is probably not one you will want to read. However, this book does cover the basics and might be helpful to ease you into the subject. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"If you have ever embarked on a mission to get your affairs in order, or to help someone get theirs in order, you know how daunting the task can seem. I bought three other books prior to this one, and wish I would have started here. The other books are vast in their expertise, but are too complex for someone getting started. This book is the perfect place to start if you want to gain knowledge about estate planning prior to either making your own will (and/or living trust), or prior to going to see a lawyer for his or her help. This book explains the essentials in simple English. It truly delivers on its sub-title, \\"What you need to know & nothing more\\".p.s. If you are going the do-it-yourself route, I recommend that your second purchase is Quicken WillMaker 2006."},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"This was not the first estate planning book I bought, but it was the best. Without dumbing the issues down, the author carves out manageable modules to make each chapter as clear and understandable as possible. The book features anecdotal paragraph case studies based on real-life examples to flesh out the major points. In contrast to more encylopedic approaches, and as part of the NOLO series, this book is for non-lawyers. It makes clear that estate planning is about how to avoid probate and how to arrange for the conveyance of your assets to your heirs. That is, estate planning not about tax sheltering per se. Obvious, perhaps, to a lawyer, but not to most people. Another strong point is the clear and cogent explanation of trusts. A trust is a written agreement that defines the relationship among the grantor, the trustee, and beneficiaries. Here as well, the book delivers big-time by rendering legal abstractions accessible to the general reader. What a great service!"},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"This book is a very good introduction to intelligent estate planning. It served the exact purpose that prompted me to buy it...reading it gave me a good working knowledge of the estate planning process, some red flags, some suggested courses of action, and some tax considerations. Having 2 parents over 80, I feel I can now discuss estate planning with them and a professional planner......and understand what he/she is saying."},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"My wife and I are starting our estate planning because we have minor children. We also have a stepfamily dynamic which made things a little more complicated. After reading this book, we have a much better understanding of how to accomplish our goals, and I'll probably check out Nolo to find out how to do it ourselves. This was by no means a comprehensive \\"how to\\" book but certainly let us know what options are out there simply by providing the basics."},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"This book is very easy to read and understand.

Clearly and concisely presented, it delivers exactly what the title promises - the basics."},{"Title":"Estate Planning Basics","review":"For those like me with fairly non-complicated estate planning needs, this book should suffice. It covers pretty much everything including how to name who will take care of young children.The major methods for avoiding probate are covered. I think these things could be done without an attorney for most people, although there are probably many ways to make regrettable mistakes. A lot of these things would never occur to me absent a crisis such as transfer of death car registration.My favorite sections are \\"Estate Tax\\" and \\"Reducing Federal Estate Taxes.\\" It's great to know that some people have an incentive to make cash gifts, thanks to Uncle Sam.This is an easy-to-read guide that will serve as a reference source for many years depending on how quickly the law changes with respect to estates."},{"Title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Bad Rap (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (IDW))","review":"The missing star is - once again - because I wasn't totally convinced by the artwork. I found the drawings though captivating not really as realistic as I would've liked them.BUT: I thoroughly enjoyed the writing this time. Unlike Demon House (which I found less true to what's seen on TV) Bad Rap is not only fast paced and intense with lots of turns so that you won't suspect the killer too soon, the dialogue between our CSIs is funny, witty and rings true. I snickered a lot - and that is a very good thing indeed."},{"Title":"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: Bad Rap (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (IDW))","review":"This book is great! i couldn't put it down I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good CSI case.

It opens 360 degrees to become a 19\\" fairytale castle with fold-up towers and cardboard figures inside the windows.

Roy is a very accomplished engineer and designer and a book on a more technical aspect of solving the oil crisis would have been more suited for him. His goal was to introduce the avg. person, or politician new technologies but I fear people will start making under thought laws based on such works. Too many people already feel they are no longer ignorant after reading a website. If one reads this book and it sparks their interest into doing their own research that would be wonderful and great and Roy should be very proud if this happens... Sadly, to many people will just take his ideas as gold (as is) and form their entire stance on the subject off this short reading."},{"Title":"Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo (German Edition)","review":"Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo is the best book I have ever read in my life! I think I already read it 8 times! And everytime I read it, I figured out more and more, about Christiane's life! And about the other people! I think it's good to publish books like this one. Its pretty interesting, and you can learn more about drugs! You can see how it affects people, and what some have to do to get the money for their drugs! She sold her body to get the money for her addiction! And it all started with smoking wheat, and then taking pills, ...and then being addicted to heroine. She had a very hard time. When they moved, when her parents divorced,... But she wasn't just a dumb teenager. You can see that very often, when you pay attention to the book! She was actually pretty smart, and cared about people, but while caring a lot about others, she forgot to care about herslef! She always wanted to be a good girl. As well there were times, when she was like most of the kids in her age. Doing stupid stuff! But everybody does/did that, and its not wrong, it's just a hard age! If Christiane wouldn't have found her boyfriend &quot;Detlef&quot;, the story might be very different! She did a lot of things just like he did, she talks about that in the book very often! And because he was at the &quot;Bahnhof Zoo&quot;, she was there everyday ,too. And that's the place where they get the money for their drugs, and their heroine. She tried a few times to get rid of her addiction. But if you were addicted to it once, you have a hard time to stay away from it! She was &quot;clean&quot; for a long time, but she still could not stay away from it a lot of times! I think everybody should read this book, about that little girl which got addicted to drugs, got money for them by selling her body, and didn't have a real, nice, and most of the times, funny life, like a lot of other teenagers, without being afraid of to look for money for the next &quot;shot&quot; of heroine."},{"Title":"Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo (German Edition)","review":"This is a horror story- not in the cinimatic slasher/monster sense, but in the sense that it is jarring to think that these things REALLY happened to a REAL person. It is a slow-motion documentary of one girl's transformation from a bright and promising child to the walking cadavar of a heroin addict. I read this first when I was fourteen and living in Dortmund, Germany. No anti-drug message in any commercial, movie, or book has ever come close to affecting me to the extent that this novel has."},{"Title":"Wir Kinder Vom Bahnhof Zoo (German Edition)","review":"If you did not read this book yet , read it now.This is one of those book that leaves you without a coment.When I read WIR KINDER VOM BAHNHOF ZOO I tought a lot about it.

In this case, however, I'm so excited to recommend this book that I can't wait! In the Introduction, Elisabeth Elliot explains this book is a compilation of short articles that have appeared in her newsletter over the past 10 years or so.I've only read 7 of the 2-4 page devotionals, but each one was excellent, and 2 of those have been life-changing. God has used them to speak to me right where I'm at, in such a powerful way! I can't wait to read the rest of the book, but I'm savoring it, reading only a couple chapters a day, so it's not over too quickly!The chapters that mean so much to me are &quot;Shoes of Iron&quot; and &quot;The Future is Not Our Province&quot;. I spent two days of my journaling/Bible study/prayer time journaling about &quot;Shoes of Iron&quot; and looking up related writings in other devotionals, etc. The more I read and wrote, the more I learned. I expect &quot;The Future Is Not Our Province&quot; to similarly inspire me when I sit down with pen and paper. These two devotionals alone would be worth the price of the book! At the end of each devotional, Elisabeth includes a quote from a Christian writer, mostly from long ago. It's fascinating to see how the writings of someone who lived in the 1600's relate so closely to how God is working in my life today. These quotes and prayers are a good jumping-off-point to learning about Christian classics.This book would make an excellent gift for either the serious student or a busy person who has limited knowledge and/or time to meet with God. The chapters are meaty without being difficult to understand.If you haven't read Elisabeth's book &quot;Through Gates of Splendor&quot;, you should do so! In it, Elisabeth tells the story of how her husband Jim Elliot and several other men were martyred in the jungles of Ecuador in the late 1950's by the Auca Indians who they were trying to reach with the gospel. Her faith is so inspiring and the fact that she took her young daughter back down there to work amongst those people is nothing short of miraculous.If you enjoy &quot;Secure in the Everlasting Arms&quot; half as much as I did, you will be richly blessed! Please see my other reviews of Christian books and music."},{"Title":"Secure in the Everlasting Arms","review":"This book is an incredible resource for encouragement, wisdom, hope, and insight. My mother, a godly woman who has been my mentor through the years, gave it to me on my 40th birthday. She said that Elisabeth Elliot writes the deep truths she has learned over the years but in a way that she never could. If you want to be mentored by someone with a sweet spirit of grace and who has been through trials and triumphs than get this book. You will learn and be blessed in a way that few books can match. You'll want to buy one for all of your friends after you read it!"},{"Title":"Secure in the Everlasting Arms","review":"Secure in the Everlasting ArmsFew writers communicate the reality of a life lived in Christ with as much depth and eloquence as Elisabeth Elliot. Her communication of The Magnificence in the ordinary, everyday things we all encounter and often pass over as mundane trivialities, is not only enlightening, but faith building as well. Light reading with extreme depth, quite a feat for any author, but one easily accomplished by Elliot. She is, truly, one of the great Christian writers of our time."},{"Title":"Secure in the Everlasting Arms","review":"I've been so blessed by the sweet encouragements of this book.

When he was released he went home, but was never the same. Since coming home, he and his wife Martha have six children. As the children grow up Jack is mentally abusive towards his family members while Martha is somewhat negligent being too tired to do more than care for her spouse. The oldest child, Jill raises the other five kids.Over the years, each child finds his or her own way to avoid dad. Jill battles her father at times, but mostly hides in books and later in anti-war movements and sex. Johnnie, perhaps the recipient of the most abuse, is weak and sleeps away life. May designs clothing on any scrap of paper she finds. The twins Door and Mouse lean on each other. Only Christine can reach Jack as she loves his war stories, but even she often fails when he becomes obstinate and hard.MY SISTER JILL is an insightful look at a dysfunctional family in which the father never fully recovers from his war years so the children suffer the consequences. The story line engages the reader who empathizes with the plight of the children, but scorn Martha for behaving pathetic and helpless in protecting anyone including herself. Thus the audience receives a taut heart wrenching character study that provides a powerful look at a family in trouble.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Throws (Compete Like a Champion)","review":"The book advertises to be an instructional guide to track and field.

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"I see that this book is getting mixed reviews, and the thing is I agree with all of them. While Hannah is kind of spoiled and selfish like those on her father's side of the family, she has a good heart that's in the right place. She's not all sweetness and perfection like Christie, Annie and Pearl. She's pampered, but not blind to the misfortunes of others. I give it four stars for being a book that can stand on it's own outside of a series and not the same old \\"daughter\\" story.And I agree with everyone that the Hudson series is a waste of paper, by the way!"},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"After reading &quot;Wicked Forest...I didn't know what to expect from this book.

The DeBeers series isnt my favorite series though. The 1st and second were rather boring. The 3rd was more adventurous but I didn't like Willow in this series.

In this book she is bland and acts like a crazy person and a bad mom."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"I am not a fan of the DeBeers, I didn't really like Willow and the whole thing with Palm Springs... but I like Hannah. Hannah had a lot of more of what a VCA gal should have, also Heyden was classically VCA/GW. He really reminded me of Logan from Casteel, not a fave of mine but at least believable. Willow was a sell-out in this book and fullfilled all the horrible things she stood up against in the other books and in her childhood.I also loved the Southern thing and think the Stanton's could have had a series of their own. They reminded me of the Adare's in a way I hope the GW brings more of that kind of magic and mystery back into VCA.I can't wait to read about Grace and hopefully Bunny too... all in all not too bad... way better than Summer."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"twisted roots, the novel that has caught many readers eyes, became a best selling book for its interesting plot.

I remember after reading Wicked Forest, I practically threw the book at my wall in frustration. lol At least this one was not so sad, I guess.

I will definitely read the 4th book in the series... the plot is still very addicting."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"Based on the title, I thought this was a medical-dental text on how to perform difficult root-canal procedures, but silly me, it's actually a novel.

Andrews fan, but i must say that the man writing under her name (yes, she is in fact dead) is really desperate for some new plot lines. It seems like the same thing happens in every book: young girl suffers bad family life, gets a boyfriend, has sex, someone destroys her reputation, she makes a big mistake, and then everything falls into place in the end. Well, it was good in the first couple of series', but it's getting old. This book was ok, not great, not horrid, but it just didn't have the same suck you in storyline as, say, the Landry series. Read it if you want, but it's nothing compared to Willow and Dark Forest (i think that's what it was called). So if you read it, you can pass some time, if you don't, you're not missing anything.

All the promise shown in &quot;Willow&quot; and &quot;Wicked Forest&quot; goes to the dogs with this one.

Siblings?"},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"At first the story is very boring, it's long and clich&eacute;, it only get good when they Hannah, Heyden and her uncle Linden left Palm Beach and when they arrived at Casa Luna, the Ghost writer should had wrote a novel about the Stanton family instead of De Beers, they are much more interesting. I think Hannah was a cry baby at the beggining, come on being jealous of a little baby. How can she feel her mother love her less, it didn't seem so, they try to include Hannah in everything, also her step-father was very nice to her. How can she feel she had no real family? Her mother, her uncle and the family of her step-father love her, okay maybe the family of her step-father were not blood relate to her but they are family.I think Heyden was often too harsh on Hannah, even rude and when he left her I though he was very coward but at the end we understand why he left but still I still feel he was selfish to did that.I think it would had been nice if Linden and Bess would had get married and they would have been happy again but no Linden go back to his resident home and Bess stay with her grand-mother and Chubs.At the end Willow told her daughter that she did had blame her (Hannah) for the death of little Claude, how selfish of her to felt that, because she want better to feel angry at someone, blame someone for the death of her baby, it make her feel better. Well it was a very good thing then that Hannah ran off.Why having Cade die? I think they had enough drama in this book allraady and poor Danielle, Thatcher cheat on her and she move with Adrian to Frence, yeah poor them. I wonder what happen to Thatcher, having a frivolous life, who had no real meaning, must be very lonely that type of life, well is if Thatcher got feelings, which I doubt, he just like the other rich people of Palm Beach self-center!I think the letter Summer send to Hannah and tell her her life story and the one of her mother and in the same time recommand she read the serie of her mother life and hers too but starting with Rain of course!

Her mother is totally devoted to the baby, and Hanna might as well not exist.But there is a new boyfriend in Hanna's life, Heyden. And when he gets involved in the picture, they discover that they have quite a talent for music singing together and playing guitar. So they form a plan with the help of Hanna's disabled uncle, to get to New Orleans where the jobs are.

I could punch her! If I ever met someone like Hannah I would shake them and.... ugh. I won't even think about it. Hannah is NO protagonist!

The characters are so distinct and yet so different, especially at the weird farm. Another great V.C. title."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"I've been reading V.C. Andrews since she first came on the scene in the early '80's (she lived in neighboring Portsmouth, VA), and this is without a doubt the LAMEST &quot;V.C. Andrews&quot; book ever written. It trots out all the old hackneyed cliches: insecure teenage girl with unhappy family situation and unstable mother who runs away with sensitive boy from wrong side of the tracks and finds danger in the form of mentally ill stranger before being reunited with family as evildoers are punished. It's a shame, too, because the DeBeers saga started off well, but the author got really lazy with this one. (For anyone who doesn't know, V.C. Andrews actually died in 1986; the subsequent books were written by horror writer Andrew Neiderman.) Hannah is so unbelievably whiny and childish it's impossible to root for her (what sixteen-year-old still calls her mother &quot;Mommy&quot;?), the characters are painted in broad strokes of black and white with almost no nuances (stepfather is good, mother is disturbed, father and twin half-brothers are BAD, and boyfriend is near saintly), and the plot is both obviously recycled and utterly ridiculous. I'd have rated it a 1/2 star if there was one, but since there isn't my advice is this: if you must read it, check it out at the library and save your money on this one. If you want to read V.C. at the top of her game, go back and read the first books (the Dollanganger saga or &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot;). &quot;Twisted Roots&quot; is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"Mommy? Mommy?? Mooommmy!!!This book is a snore in IMO. I too think Hannah is a big baby for getting so bent out of shape about a baby. The change in Willow is most shocking. I thought she was stronger then that! She acted like a complete wimp. Granted she suffered a great loss but you think she would have learned something about coping in all those psychology classes she had taken. Sure Ruby suffered after the loss of her ***(might be considered a spoiler so I won't put it) and sure she retreated to fantasy land but she would have been proud of how her daughter (Pearl) had reacted. Hannah on the other hand is nothing to be proud of. By the end of the book I was skimming because Hannah was just too irritating."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"This is truly the worst novel ever written in V.C. Andrews' name. What kind of a protagonist is Hannah supposed to be? The whole time she is complaining and whining. So what - you're mom didn't breastfeed you? What sixteen year old acts like that?I am shocked how V.C. Andrews' name is getting more and more abused. It slowly started with the Landrys. The Logans were okay in some parts. I'd rather not talk about the miniseries and the Hudsons - but THIS is a joke! Don't even waste a second of your precious time reading it!"},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"I read this on a plane and I actually liked this book. It was entertaining enough and trashy enough. It's from the point of view of Willow's oversheltered, filthy rich daughter. Hannah was a great character-yes, she called her mother mommy, but she had a mind of her own and she didn't fawn over her mother like some of the other Vc Andrews daughters did. Both her mother and father do things that annoy her throughout the book, which was refreshing. Her father and Daniel were not one hundred percent evil, they came in shades of gray, for a ghostwriter novel. Her father was self absorbed and impersonal, but her mother was also selfabsorbed and negligent and haybrained. So Hannah makes the choice of running away with her crazy uncle and her boyfriend and she is forced to face the consequences, which I thought were actually realistic. The only time I got bored was when they were staying with those people, because I found them irrelevant to the story. But Hannah actually seemed pretty smart to me, and there were points in this book I could really cheer her on. Her dysfunctional relationship with her spoiled yuppie brothers was also really entertaining. I could just see that family. I also thought Cady and Adrian were great little villians. And the plot wasn't as absurd and ridiculous as Into the Garden or the Hudson series, which actually stopped me from reading VC andrews for awhile. This was decent, and Grace's story looks like it could be interesting as well."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"Where the Dollanganger, Casteel, Cutler, Landry, and Logan series paid a lot of attention to family secrets and twists and turns, the DeBeers series is severely lacking, and this book is a pale imitation of the good books that Neiderman started out with when he ghostwrote for VCA. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, and the storyline is predictable.Willow started out as a decent character in the first book, but fell apart in the second book to become a weakling. In this book, we weakness is highlighted further over her actions and reactions regarding her sickly son (Hannah's half-brother) and honestly, everyone is so flatly written that it's impossible to feel bad for anyone. Adrian and Cade are ridiculous, even more so when they corner their sister and try to get her to strip (a scene which is illustrated in the stepback image to this book) Thatcher is a horrible dad - but that doesn't surprise me given that he was a horrible husband to Willow AND then to his current wife! Ashton and Bunny are as unlikeable as ever, and this whole series was frustrating and disappointing, even more so than the Hudson series."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"You know how when you read a book and you think it deserves more then 5 stars but that's what they give you, This deserves so much more ~ This book is about Hannah Willow's daughter. To be honest I didn't think I was going to like this book, I wanted to know more about Willow, I thought they would hardly be mention in this book but she was and so was her husband Miguel. I was so happy when Willow divorced Thatcher ~ He has not been a good father to Hannah, and his parents don't see her or want to see her.

She passed away years ago and yet new books keep being published. It's a shame that someone is marketing using her name. The writing is not the same as her writings either."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"The first two novels in the De Beers saga were wonderful. I highly anticipated the arrival of Twisted Roots from Amazon. The beginning was okay, gave a good insight to Linden and Willow and Miguel's relationship, as well as Hannah's relationship with her father. However, I was very disappointed in the end. This book did not have a single thrilling aspect to it. And to be honest, it was a bit of a snoozer. I was even more disappointed to find out that this is the end of Hannah. Her appearance in the De Beers saga was definitely short lived as Into the Woods features the beginning of Grace Montgomery's story. If you decide to read this saga, read the first two, skip the third and head straight into the fourth. You won't miss anything, believe me."},{"Title":"Twisted Roots (De Beers Family 3)","review":"My sister warned me about this book. Told me it was stupid. But I read it anyways. And I have to say she was right. It was very boring and took me longer then expected to get through it.Willow was an idiot for some of the things she said or did to Hannah concerning baby Claude. But Hannah was also a big crybaby. Having a younger brother and sister in the home is a big adjustment no matter what your age. It's only happend to billions of other people in this world. So what. Why does Hannah have to be any different? Deal with it. You aren't the only one.I will continue to read these books. No matter how bad of reviews they get. This book was one of the of worst."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"useful tool for learning Italian.

I was, however, very disappointed by this edition and the number of mistakes and poor editing I found. Gone are the tables and charts which were so helpful. The literature sections are far too complicated for the beginner student. Had I been able to see this edition ahead of the deadline for ordering texts by begining of the semester, I would have seriously considered other options."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"I took 3 semesters of Italian, with each semester covering 1/3 of the book, so I completed the entire book. This book is good if you follow it in a traditional classroom setting, especially since the proffessor pointed out all the mistakes in this book, which unfortunately, are quite numerous for a textbook. I have also checked out the 4th edition, which is much better than this one as it is better structured and contains useful charts,(which are now omitted) and is thoroughly proofread. The 6th edition just came out, so hopefully it is an improvement from the 5th."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"I read this entire book across two college semesters before moving to Italy. After having spent $500 or so on Italian language books, this is one of the few that was worth the money.

I highly recommend this book to any serious student."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"This book has proven the most helpful language book that I have ever used. The grammar is clearly presented and the text is interesting. Most importantly, it teaches italian as it is spoken in italy.

Yes, the price is high but I believe that one would need to use several other books in combination to achieve the level of this book. It will continue to help even advanced students of italian."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"Learning a new language is always a difficult task. The materials that you use to try and learn a new language must be of the highest caliber. Prego!: An Invitation to Italian is a book that would definitely fit into this category. The book is laid out in to easy to read sections, helping you to slowly and confidently build your Italian language skills. A typical chapter is laid out in the following manner: Opening Page, Introduction to Vocabulary, Grammar Points, Dialogue, Review Exercises, Cultural Readings, Summary List. The depth of information in each chapter allows you to begin seeing the fruits of your studies immediately. The authors definitely understood the complexities in creating a book of this type. They stood up to the challenges and created a book that will have you chatting Italian over your favorite espresso in no time!"},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"I took the full course of italian a year ago and I find myself constantly referring to this book to double check my grammar. I think it's a great book. I could never sell it."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"I am teaching a beginner 1-year long course to college students from this book. I find that this book over-emphasizes a lot of grammar points (which would not be used by the language learner for a long time to come), and at the same time the vocabulary items are almost useless (I ended up skipping them altogether for the last 3 chapters). There would rather be a need for words from everyday life than the topics given importance in this book. Plus, the examples it gives to explain grammatical points should be a lot simpler."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"The book was exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. This volume is very hard to get and indeed impossible to purchase new in Australia. It is a good textbook for people at higher than beginner level but not yet intermediate level of Italian proficiency to start with and work through it to improve proficiency. It is easy to understand and unlike a more popular series of texts here in Australia is not just written in Italian so it is simple to follow. I have been using it in class for almost 2 years and prefer it to the later edition although I would say if all I had was the 7th edition as opposed to the 6th I would probably find it just as useful."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"This is an alright text book. It does what it's meant to do. A person can learn Italian from this book as long as they are also in a class as well, but it definately has some flaws. One -it needs more examples of some of the more difficult grammar points. Two - the order is strange. Why did you start with avere? Somehow essere seems like a better place to start. And the chapter themes! They pretend that they have chapters arranged by topic, but it seems very haphazard to me. Also, several major grammatical topics are missing from this book, and as a result, many of my teachers have had to give us multiple hand outs to compensate. It's ok - but it could be a lot better."},{"Title":"Prego: An Invitation to Italian","review":"I could never seem to find a class offered at a time when I could attend.

I can now read and speak Italian at a beginner/intermediate level."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Agent","review":"&quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; is Phillip Kurata's first novel, but in its lean, evocative writing and uncluttered structure, you'd never guess it was the work of a first-timer. In leading Habib ben Hamed, a feckless Tunisian intellectual, to his inexorable fate during the political unrest of the 1960s, Kurata brings home two major truths: that in times of injustice, the war between conscience and personal safety is usually unwinnable; and that revolutions eat not only their young, but anyone in their paths. Kurata has been compared with Graham Greene and Albert Camus; in his detailed insight into how dictatorships work, he obviously knows his Orwell and Arthur Koestler as well. In its persuasive portrayal of the collision between modernism and traditional Islam, &quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; is urgently pertinent reading in 2002. The deceptively simple yet compelling story keeps you turning the pages to the final paragraph, which is breathtaking in its lethal spareness. &quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; is a must-read for anyone interested in the literature of revolution and politics."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Agent","review":"Phillip Kurata's vivid prose style and deep sociopolitical insight capture the essential conflict of post-colonial Tunisia; but more than that this spectacular literary debut speaks to an eternal question confronted by every man and woman: How do I live truthfully and what price do I pay for compromising my integrity? Kurata makes these costs explicit through richly drawn characters and the consequences their actions bring about. This novel succeeds because, unlike so much contemporary fiction, it possesses a moral center that pulls the reader into the lives and locale of a distant yet all too familiar place. It is fair to compare &quot;The Reluctant Agent&quot; to works by Lampedusa, Hemingway, Koestler and Solzhenitsyn. I hope there will be an encore performance."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Agent","review":"Anyone who ever spent time in a third world country in the post colonial cold war era will recognize the characters and settings in Phillip Kurata's The Reluctant Agent. The country is Tunisia shortly after its independence and Habib Ben Hamed is caught between his own world and that of the former French colonizer. Unfortunately Habib is at home in neither and becomes caught up in a postcolonial drama he cannot fully comprehend nor control. The political rhetoric is of socialism and progress but the reality is that of power and domination as the world of the colonizer gives way to that of the local ruling class.Reminiscent of Graeme Green's best work Kurata draws the reader into a rich psychological world of men and women caught up in historical forces that sweep them along to inevitable endings. The exotic settings of North Africa, colorfully described in clean declarative prose, amplify the inner turmoil of a hapless Habib caught between his heart's desire and the cruel reality that denies it.My own postcolonial third world experience was in Somalia at the end of the cold war but the settings and characters differed little from those described in Kurata's novel. I saw many Somalis draw sustenance from their former colonizer's culture even as they moved quickly to their own destruction crushed between the early socialist rhetoric of their postcolonial freedom and the twin barbarisms of dictatorship and cold war politics. Many of today's headlines stem from the cold war and postcolonial issues still unfolding in developing countries. Thus, Habib's dilemma is as relevant today as it was twenty to twenty-five years ago. Kurata, who lived in Tunis, saw to the core and created a world that allows the rest of us to see it too."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Agent","review":"I'm an occasional reader of fiction spending much of my time scanning newspaper articles and opinion pieces dealing with U.S. foreign policy and world affairs. So Phillip Kurata's first novel, The Reluctant Agent, though set in the '60's of a turbulent Tunisia, was a real find as it addresses contemporary issues of cultural and political conflict in a repressive Islamic society. Ben Hamed is the protagonist, an unlikely hero, an Arabic 'everyman' who just wants the good things in life but finds himself caught up in an escalating spiral of intrigue and danger in order to survive. Kurata has an artist's eye for background detail and character development. The story builds and carries the reader forward to what becomes an extremely powerful ending."},{"Title":"Prejudice and your child","review":"Dr. Clark book,&quot; Prejudice and Your Child &quot; is a must read for anyone who's into social work or studies the subject of race-relations with regards to the African Americans child."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I apparently have stumbled onto the town of Mitford late. But my delight is complete with each page unfolding the lives of the people in Mitford. Father Tim is the town's priest. Through his life we meet all the character's of the town and grow to love all of them. Mitford is the town who takes care of their own, where the town cafe has all the news, gardens flourish, and the church is the town's social center. The pace is relaxing, sweet, and full. Father Tim is struggling in his own faith but yet leads his flock with unerring strength and grace. While he frets over his human foibles, he is stretched by new relationships, first a dog, who only responds when scripture is quoted to him, then a boy, who is struggling to find love and acceptance, and finally in the neighbor who lives next door. Father Tim and Cynthia's relationship grows in fits and spurts together. Reading this book was like going on a vacation. I became relaxed and refreshed chapter by chapter. I can't wait to read on about Mitford while sipping my cup of tea."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I had never heard of the Mitford books until they were mentioned by some elderly ladies in my book group. I resisted reading the first one because I thought it would be corny. It seemed that way at first, but the more I read the more I cared about the characters. I'm almost finished with the second book and the next two are waiting on my bedside table. I've become teary eyed quite a few times over the various characters. These are the first novels I've ever read that caused me to stop and pray. When Father Tim has prayed with some of the characters, it made me think about things I wanted to pray for. I'm enjoying these books as much as I did the James Herriot books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I must admit that it took me until I was nearly halfway finished with this book before submitting to its charms! At first it was seemingly too \\"cozy\\" and \\"gentle,\\" but just like Father Tim often muses about Mitford - there is much more depth and drama beneath the surface. I urge everyone to stick it through the halfway point because if you do, you will find yourself transported to a world that will warm your heart. Fr. Tim's goodness and compassion is inspiring - his quirky foibles and mishaps are amusing - and his unexpected romantic yearnings for his lovely next-door neighbor are very endearing. Cynthia (the object of Tim's affection) is another likeable character whom I also wanted as a friend! This book is filled with all kinds of adventures, misadventures, interesting characters, and tender moments.If you took CHRISTY, OUR TOWN, \\"Columbo,\\" ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL, and \\"Boys Town\\" and put them all in a blender, you would end up with AT HOME IN MITFORD! It's a refreshing and good-natured treat in the midst of a too-often disappointing world.

From Puny Bradshaw, Emma, Miss Sadie, Barnabas, Dooley and Cynthia---too many to list them all---each character is like someone you've always wanted to know and after doing so, you end up loving.KUDOS to the author, Jan Karon, for her writing style and abilities. Her characters really do become the reader's own family and friends.And I am thankful that there are a total of 9 books in this series and it is refreshing to finish At Home in Mitford (#1 in the series) and pick up exactly where it left off in the second book in the series, A Light in the Window.BUYER BEWARE: there is no sex, blood and guts, tatoos, drugs, murders, shootings, stabbings, cursing or vampires in these books! Just a good old fashioned town that \\"takes care of it's own\\" and a rector that follows God's law and teachings.

(Those who find it saccharine are far too cynical for my taste.) Mitford is populated by people we all know and some we wish we knew. Father Tim is all too human, filled with insecurities, but nourished constantly by his relationship with God. It it well worth the trip through the North Carolina mountains to visit Mitford. These are the kinds of books I wish wouldn't end. Thank you, Jan Karon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read the Mitford series as soon as each one was published.

While Mitford might be a little idealistic, it has a whole cast of characters who look like people we know and act like people we know.

It is encouraging to see this portrayed in these books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I enjoyed this book alot!

We were transformed to Mitford. Every spare moment he would urge me to pick up the book and start reading. He would hurry home for lunch so I could read to him. We carried the book in the car, on trips to visit our daughter, and I would read to him. Every character was brought to life and we felt like we knew them personally. When we finished book 4- Out to Cannan we didn't think we could wait until the 5th book came out, but we made it and gobbled up &quot;A New Song&quot;! Can hardly wait for #6! My husband now is ready to change from our Baptist church and find a nice little Episcopalian church with a rector just like Father Tim!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon vividly brings the citizens of Milford, North Carolina to life in the first installment of her amicable series that understandably achieved massive popularity. While the subplots concerning an international jewel theft and a dognapping vignette both seem extraneous and a tad farfetched, the uplifting novel more than succeeds in paying homage to the proudly quotidian.The three-dimensional characters are all similar to everyday folks whom readers will know. Interestingly, the protagonist is a sixtyish never-married minister--not the typical lead character in current novels. Further deviating from the stipulations of modern day literature, he does not live a double life, engage in a tawdry affair, betray his duties to the church, or spout new age babble under the obnoxious guise of religious inclusion. He is a dedicated Episcopalian and all Christians and non-Christians will admire his commitment to his vocation.What makes the desultory anecdotes referenced above all the more distracting is their complete lack of necessity to the plot. The book's tribute to the mundane is captivating enough without contrived plot twists to build drama.The prose maintains eloquence throughout with its wholesome simplicity and on a few occasions the author's wording reaches rhapsodic heights. Certain sentences are so powerful that they not only conjure up palpable scenes, they nearly pop out of the book and act out the setting for the reader. At one point she describes an unwelcome rain with the hopeful undertone \\"every drop that fell contained the promise of another leaf, another blossom, another blade of grass.\\" For transitional purposes she writes \\"early the following morning the leaden skies cleared, the sun came out and the village stirred briskly.\\" The local newspaper is quoted in describing the nascent spring with a poetic paragraph that includes, \\"she (spring) is shod with ivy and dandelion... unfortunately she is easily distracted and often stops to tarry on a bed of moss.\\" Listening to a parishioner's confidential tale, the minister is described: \\"he laughed happily; if there was anything more amazing and wonderful than almost anyone's life story, he couldn't think what it was.\\"Many wonderful and amazing life stories populate the pages of this pioneering work. A visit to Lord's Chapel and all its parishioners and neighbors relaxes the weary traveler and leaves one feeling renewed and wanting to come back in one of many sequels."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is the first in the six-book (so far) Mitford series of novels by Jan Karon. Her stories are refreshingly decent. The protagonist is an Episcopal priest, Father Tim Kavanagh. He believes what he preaches, and not only talks the talk--he walks the walk. The stories take place in a small North Carolina village of approximately 200 population, Mitford--the kind of place everyone would like to live, if they could.Karon keeps your interest, as evidenced by the fact that she is a best-seller with this series, but she does not resort to foul language--the nastiest word in the book is 'poop'--violence, explicit sex or car chases to keep her readers interested. These are thoroughly decent stories, written by an author who has decorum and restraint, and whose tales you would not be ashamed to read to your children or your mother.In this story, Father Tim--a never-been-married bachelor--takes in an eleven-year-old boy from his disabled, poverty-stricken grandfather who has him because his drunken mother is unfit. He also adopts a nondescript dog &quot;as big as a sofa,&quot; deals with the many problems of his parishioners, and begins to fall in love with his neighbor--at the age of sixty.In this series it would be well to start with this book and then immediately proceed to book number six in the series, &quot;A Common Life,&quot; which for some unknown reason was published out of chronological sequence.If you are like a great many others, you will quickly become a fan of Karon, who has written children's stories as well, most notably &quot;Jeremy,&quot; the story of a stuffed rabbit which she wrote for her own daughter--a book which has received much acclaim.Joseph PierreAuthor of The Road to Damascus: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I fell in love with Mitford and the characters therein. This book came along at just the right time in my life. Recent events in the news and the everyday hustle-bustle of life makes one want to escape to Mitford where life is as it should be. It is a wonderful, feel-good read and I fell in love with all the characters from Father Tim to dear ole Barnabus. At Home in Mitford is like a return to childhood when the days were simple and worries were few. I absolutely loved this book and am hurrying off to read the rest of the series. This is a book that remains with you the rest of your life. P.S. I had this review tucked away in the &quot;private&quot; review section for some reason, so I decided to bring it out into the public because I've been singing the praises of Mitford for 3 years now!! Since this book, I've read the entire Mitford series and it only gets better!! When life gets me down, I return to Mitford and I always feel better. I can't wait for the next book!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read this book as the December selection for my book club. The book was chosen as an antidote for a rather heavy read in November. In my opinion,I was overdosed with the literary equivalent of orange marmalade cake and felt somewhat in sugar shock as I completed the novel. The book would have been more believable if it were set in the first half of this century. I understand this is fiction but I could not suspend belief that any town in the 1990's can be so untouched by outside forces (don't they get cable). When I began the book ,I was hopeful that religion could be woven into the story in an effective and interesting way but found its treatment rather pat. Jan Karon has been compared to Garrison Keillor and Bailey White but I feel she lacks the depth these writers bring to their characterizations. Keillor and White are interesting because they give characters skin, bones and warts. We are able to see ourselves in them and are still uplifted by their humanity and heart. Karon's characters are more of the Gomer Pyle, Floyd the barber, Aunt Bea variety, one dimensional and predictable."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I finally dwelved into the Mitford Series, beginning with the first book in the series, At Home in Mitford, by Jan Karon. The book features Father Tim, the local recor, and the many colorful characters that make up the denizens of the fictional town of Mitford. Karon paints vivid picture of this peaceful town and the rolling hills that surround it. This is a feel good book, that has a meandering pace, and a great heart. Father Tim often quotes verses from the Bible and will pray for strenght and guidance. There is the old cliche about how somethings are like crawling into a warm comfortable bed, well this book is like crawling in a warm, comforatable bed, with a fire going ini a stone fireplace, and the sound of a steady rain outside. A delight!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In the first few dozen pages of this book, as Jan Karon is letting you get to know the characters, not a lot happens, and I confess that I fell asleep a few times. But soon I took the bait of Mitford and was hooked. It's a comfort to read, and I came to have affection for Father Tim, following closely his relationships and caring, as he did, for his parishioners. It's of the same ilk as The Number One Ladies Detective Agency, in that some serious issues are dealt with in a way that doesn't make the reader feel beaten up emotionally. This book is a comfort read, and after I finished it I was anxious to start the second in the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I truly enjoy Jan Karon's Mitford Series. I cannot read this series without laughing out loud. Mitford is a town we would all love to belong to. I enjoy the way each character is developed and how they grow in each book. This is a series you will read again and again. I find I love each book more than the last. After I have finished each one I always say that was the best book and my husband just looks at me and says \\"thats what you said about the last one.\\" If you need a place to relax and find joy you can find it here."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is the first of 8 or 9 books about the life of Father Timothy, an Episcopal priest in his early 60s living in Mitford, North Carolina. He is a well loved priest, and has been ably serving his congregation for ten years.But his life gets thrown a curve ball when he discovers he has diabetes, and when he discovers that he is falling in love with his new next door neighbor, a spritely, beautiful 50 something woman named Cynthia.He also takes in an orphaned young man named Dooley, a dog named Barnabas, and a housekeeper named Punky.Yes, this is a down home, cornpoke story. Not much happens in this town, but you do get attached to the town's characters and after a while, you feel like you too are a resident of Mitford. You feel like you are walking the streets with Father Timothy as he heads over to Percy's for his daily breakfast.I liked the book, but it is a little gushy and I was shocked to discover that I had 8 more books to read. I did listen to volumes two and three on my iPod, which were more of the same, except not as interesting. Maybe it was just a matter of one being enough.But some people will definitely want to read all the volumes in the series, and Jan Karon is a good writer with a strong biblical base. But this book is not exactly a page turner, and if you like gripping storylines and more action, then you might be bored by this series. For me, I suppose it was a nice break from all the academic stuff I read."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is the first book in the Mitford series.

I didn't continue to turn the pages of this book because the plot was so riveting I couldn't put it down. I kept reading because I needed to know what happened to Father Tim and the other citizens of this charming little town. Karon does a wonderful job of making the reader care about these lovable characters.Think of this book as a cozy mystery with no dead body. It does, however, have a jewel theft, a kidnapping, a runaway and several medical crises to keep you turning the pages. If this isn't enough, there is also a romance and an old secret that comes to light, so it has something for everyone. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford series of books are my new &quot;must read&quot; recommendations to my reading chums. &quot;At Home...&quot; introduced me to the wonderful characters and it was instant LOVE! I am now on the fourth of the series and can't wait for the next installment.The unobtrusive religious setting is a refreshing background for the stories. Without using torrid sex scenes, the love story unfolds in such a warm way. The moral of the story?-- that even lives that appear hum-drum, ordinary and boring are filled with excitement, surprise and love, if you look for it!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Sure this book is sweet and pastoral and decent, but it is nice to read a book I can recommend to my (much) younger sister and don't have to worry about my little brother picking up.Ms. Karon has well developed characters (I could identify with Father Tims' weight struggles) and realistic situations (I can also understand not finding time to go on vacation).Highly recommended for anyone who likes a gentle book that restores your belief in the decency of... dogs."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this series of books. I recently visited Blowing Rock, NC and discovered these wonderful books. I have read non-stop since my discovery. I think this would be a wonderful TV series - right up there with &quot;Touched by An Angel&quot; and &quot;Promise Land&quot;. A real treat for readers"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is the kind of book I'd like to write if I could: the kind I'm always looking for on library shelves and seldom find. Jan Karon gives us characters that are true and vivid descriptions and dialog. The people in Mitford live real lives, and their faith is part of that. And guess what? There are lots of places like that in this country!It's a joy to read something that's uplifting without hammering a &quot;message&quot; into the reader. This book fills a niche between the overly saccarine and the completely depressing. I wish more books like it were being written today."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I had the good fortune to meet Jan Karon while I was reading At Home in Mitford. What a delightfully upbeat, spiritual woman she is - and how wonderfully that sensibility is conveyed in her novel. Mitford may not be real on the atlas, but it is the place we all have in our hearts; the picture we hold in our minds of life as it could be. There are troubles and challenges and deep joys and celebrations. Through them all, the characters stick by one another and take each day as it comes. What a gift to be reminded that such a place may yet be real in our time and place, beyond the lure of imagination"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Having just moved to North Carolina, I bought this book with the hopes that I would learn more about my new home. I not only learned about my home, I learned about the beauty and wisdom that Jan Karon's characters possess. I was instantly swept into a story with mystery, humor, drama, and best of all, eccentric characters with passionate and shady backgrounds. Although based on the life of a pastor, I was not overwhelmed by religion, but rather, pleasantly aware of it's importance to the characters. Thank you Jan for a wonderful trip into the imagination"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I think I live in Mitford! Miss Sadie lives just down the street, Barnabas is my dog, Father Tim pastors the local ARP church, Dooley was in my class last year,and Emma is the secretary at the Baptist church I attend, which is described as the Baptist church with suppers, hymn sings, a sense of family, unconditional love, and a little salt. This book blessed my soul by providing a glimpse into the lives of the residents of Mitford,and by giving me a renewed sense of thankfulness for the knowledge that I do indeed live in just such a town. Bravo!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book was an absolute treat for me this summer. I read it and then I reread it. I can't wait to share it with my Mother and some of my friends. The characters have become good friends and Father Tim is a member of my family. I can't thank Ms. Karon enough for sharing these wonderful citizens with me. I don't know when I have enjoyed a book as much as I have enjoyed this one. It is definitely a keeper and I am avidly devouring the next one. I wish Ms. Karon many, many years of writing"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After years of listening to mysteries, love stories and assorted fiction and fact, I couldn't believe my hears when I heard the soft, lovable tones of John McDonough's narration of this gem of a story. As an Episcopalian, I was touched by Father Tim and his dog, Barnabas. Then, when Dooley came into his life and the cast of characters began to expand, each adding a richness and texture to the community, I was hooked on the whole experience. It's the kind of book that has you laughing one minute, then crying the next, so totally wrapped up in the lives of the people Father Tim touches in his daily rounds.I'm glad I found your books, Jan Karon, and I hope you write many, many more"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"When I first bought this book, I bought it for it's cover and I wanted somethingsimple to read.

It can sweep you into another world, one where you wish you could live. Retirement sounds better all the time if I can find a Mitford...not quite perfect, just as in real life. Karon's ability to quote Scripture and cite biblical themes makes the book even more inviting and more relaxing to read. Can't wait for her to put some more on the shelves!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Once I started &quot;At Home In Mitford&quot; I couldn't leave the deck chair on my porch, I was so engrossed, even my annoying neighbors didn't annoy me. Each character from Father Tim to Dooley has something to teach us about giving and receiving love as well as lessons on being in community with each other. The minute I finished this book I went out and got the next one, then the next one, then the next one.... I hope Jan Karon can keep up."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this book about life in a small Southern town and really came to know the characters.

When I read, which is not as much as I would like, it must be something entertaining, and easy to pick up night after night before bed. This book fits the bill. I have laughed and fallen in love with all of the characters, especially Dooley. I am in the process of fininshing Out to Canaan, and also have to add Fancy Skinner to my list of favorite characters. I end with a question to the author: Ms. Karon, may I please have Marge Owens recipes for Orange Marmalade Cake and her famous Chicken Pie???"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is a great way to retreat from a hectic day. Sometimes I laughed and sometimes I had tears in my eyes. I've read her first two books in a week, and I've just started the third.

This series of books is definately worth reading!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford series had been recommended by my cousin and several friends. I finally bought a copy and couldn't put it down. Several of the reviewers complained about the 1950's style characters; they are part of the appeal. It is refreshing to read a book without all the sex and violence that are usually found in so many books today. At Home in Mitford reminded me of Cold Sassy Tree, Fried Green Tomatoes, and even parts of To Kill a Mockingbird. I can't wait to read the rest in the series, and I hope that Jan Karon is planning on many more."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"&quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; is full of wonderful and engaging characters.

Get this book and have a great time!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is a book I can give my mother to read. I liked the cover - it reminded me of a 5'th grade reader from the 50's, and the book seemed like a world from the 50's that slipped into the 90's. I didn't worry about how PC it was, or if it wasn't intellectual enough, reading it felt like watching a &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; marathon on a lazy Sunday with a hangover. Most of these posters seems to have forgotton that there was misery, low-lifes, and some real bad guys in the book, but it was like you were looking at it through a telescope, (Like most of us do) instead of being immersed in it (no thanks). I look forward to the rest of the series, but I want to read something substantial before I have more &quot;dessert&quot;."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I've been drawn to the Mitford series each time I visit a bookstore in search of a new read. I finally took my chances (funny how I think only Oprah can pick a book these days) and bought the book. I read it in 3 days and loved every minute of it. Not being a religous person I found the religion to be uplifting and non-invasive. Jan Karon needs to keep writing this lovely series. To all the people who said it was sickening sweet, well stick with Oprah, she can pick a depressing book at any given time. Lighten up and enjoy a funny, heart warming book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If I gave this book four or five stars, I'd be lying to you. So many people love the Mitford series. A friend told me I really should read Jan Karon's books. As a Christian, I appreciate the strong faith of many of the characters in &quot;At Home in Mitford.&quot; So, I truly wanted to love this book. But I can only say I liked it. As one reviewer put it, everything is &quot;nice.&quot; There is no tension. Even as people encounter problems, you can read on quietly feeling that everything will be okay. Karon is not going to shake you up.Don't get me wrong. This isn't a terrible book. The characters are well-developed. The ending picks up a little as Karon describes someone's illness very well (I don't want to give too much away here). I enjoyed the book enough that I will probably borrow at least one other Mitford book from the library. But any book-lover with a limited budget will understand me when I say that this is a book to borrow, not buy.By the way, if you want to read truly excellent books about people in small towns, try John Hassler's novels."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Most of the other reviews refer to the book version. A lot gets lost in the abridged tape version, more so than with many other books. This series is about character development, charming stories, detailed descriptions, etc. What you get in the tape is just the main plot line and conversation. No depth. You're better off with the books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a late-in-coming fan to the MITFORD series, I met the audio book with leaps of joy... after all, hearing the words in the author's own voice is a rare treat! Unfortunately, the abridgement that is so necessary to keep the listening time and cost manageable makes it almost painful for a true fan to hear... you are excruciatingly aware of each and every edited scene, and every cut rankles more and more. Jan Karon is a joy to hear, and the book remains among my favorites, but for my grandmother's Christmas present, I'm looking elsewhere. At least one other audio book producer has all of the MITFORD novels unabridged, and while they're decidedly more costly, it's worth it. Listening to an abridgement of a work like AT HOME IN MITFORD is like drinking flat ginger ale... or like eating at the Grill when Percy ain't cooking!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read all of the Mitford series books out so far and LOVED them all! Excellent reading. I was excited to by the Audio Books in order to share the loved experience with my husband. So I bought the abridged audio cassettes read by the author. What a let down! You want to talk about abridged! This is very abridged. For a book that takes a lot of its basis on &quot;taking your time&quot; and &quot;stopping to smell the roses&quot;, the audio book went too far in leaving entire chunks out! You do not get a feel for the characters or events. It's like Cliff Notes for &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; on tape! I do not recommend the abridged version of these audio tapes. Made me feel very rushed and left my husband very uninterested! I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy hearing how Jan Karon &quot;personalized&quot; the characters. I especially liked her rendition of Mrs. Sadie Baxter."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"One of the most heartwarming books I have ever read"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The book came quickly and in good condition.

I can't wait to buy the next in the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Well, I've about Mitford for years from my friends, and I finally got to sit down and read the first one. If I were to rate this book against all literature, I would give it 3 stars at best. Everything is too crafted, manipulated and unreal. People will argue that it's full of the &quot;real world&quot;: people get sick, people die, people are lonely, there is theft, there are mean people, there are homeless people, there are drugs. Yes, but the story is never really concerned with delving into the realities of these things - instead, each is simply a burden on weary yet loving pastor and so he prays about it. And everything works out to the perfect ending.I think Karon's main purpose is to try to craft a world where things go wrong but you can see God moving and so hope is restored. Scripture, prayer and evangelical &quot;answers&quot; to life fill the pages. And, though not bad, Karon's proposed solutions for the world are like bandaids lightly resting of top. She numbs the mind with pleasure, but she does not stir in the dark depths of each of us and address the realities there. Authors such as Dostoyevski, Tolkien, and Lewis are better at bringing forth a powerful and penetrating hope in the face of the worst evils. Karon's work is trite by comparison.However, understanding that this book is more about escapism than it is about real life, I will say that she does a good job with this. She is a good writer and fairly engaging story teller. She develops a cast of characters that become alive for you - the pastor, the grocer, the grill owner, the vet, the housekeeper, the tough boy, the dog, the doctor. The one really weak character was Emma.The one real criticism I have (on a lighter level) is that the cast of characters is too large - with Karon usually assuming you can keep track of them all. It was like reading a Russian novel, but without the index to refer to. After awhile, I gave up trying to figure out who all the extraneous people were, and this - unfortunately - meant that I was less involved in the story and didn't care as much as the pages went on.I'm sorry that this review sticks out like a sore thumb among the raving reviews. As far as escapist literature goes (and we all have a preference - whether mysteries, horror, romance, whatever), this is a worthy endeadvor."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books and I read a lot. I enjoy anything from Grisham to Nora Roberts, and I just can't say enough about this book. I can't wait to get the others in the series. I was reading this on an airplane and I found myself laughing out loud. Very spiritual book! Made me do some soul searching. Read it!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is the first book of five in the Mitford series. In this book, you are introduced to a cast of characters that will keep you reading for hours and always wanting more. We meet Father Tim, who is subsequently adopted by a large dog and who befriends a town boy who is very much in need of love and attention. Then throw in a new neighbor with whom Father Tim is totally smitten. Throughout all this, a long-buried town secret comes to light to add just the right touch of mystery to this wonderful little hill town."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I cannot wait to collect the whole Mitford series and continue following Father Tim's adventures. The gentle spirituality of this book is a tonic. I thank Jan Karon for introducting me to Mitford. I encourage everyone to visit."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"A masterfully crafted array of characters are blended to create the small-town America that our society longs for. In an age when guns and violence in the schools is commonplace, Mitford is a reassuring place that we can all visit to regain some of the innocence that we once had.Jan Karon wonderfully captures an audience in her small town, without the aid of violence, sex, or any other heinous crimes. This is not to say that there isn't suspense or drama lurking at every page turn, however.All fiction writers would do well to adopt Jan Karon's view of life in America. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I love this entire series. I have high expectations when I read Christian books and many are disappointing and fall short of how God wants us to lead our lives, but this Mitford series is not only a great read but is in fact a great example of God's love in action! Father Tim may be very human but he does a great job of leaning on God to go beyond human and to minister to the people in his life and community in a way that is very heartwarming and inspiring. The characters are not only believable but very lovable. I would like this series to go on and on. Hooray for Jan Karon, I hope she writes more in the future."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford series, starting with the delightful &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; is a breath of fresh air in a stale world. It is &quot;Andy of Mayberrty&quot; with a spice of Christian wisdom. I read this book first while on vacation and found it to be a perfect traveling companion. It carries you along on a pleasant journey through the lives of some very memorable &quot;characters&quot; and is very satisfying reading. We own two sets of the entire series as we have loaned the books out to friends several times and not one has been disappointed. These stories are indeed a treasure. Why haven't you read it yet?"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My aunt raved about this book when I visited her last Christmas. I wish I would have read it right away. This book is fabulous! I could not put it down. The characters could have been my neighbors, the situations were realistic and the solutions to problems were uplifting. It reminded me of Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Anne Burns. It is amazing how much can happen in an &quot;uneventful&quot; mountain village. I can't wait to find out what happens when Father Tim returns."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I adored this book, and I'm a 35-year-old female atheist. It was introduced to me by a 27-year-old Christian friend.

A wonderfully cozy read. I highly recommend this and the rest in the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I picked up this book on the way to the airport-having no idea what it was about but looking for some amusement on a long flight. after the first chapter or two I thought this book was too Readers Digest for me--but a few more chapters down the road -I was hooked. And couldn't we all use a Father Tim in our spiritual lives?-How appreciative I was that he had his own issues to wrestle with-his own baggage to carry-- he was 6 feet tall in my eyes! As a &quot;southern novel &quot; it was soothing to read about a town of genteel eccentric for a change as compared to the loonies often depicted in the darker southern epics. I read this book in 3 days and ran out to buy the next 2 in the series and finished both in record time.Have just purchased the last two but I am trying to savor as I don't want the experience to end!!!Keep writing Jan Karon- you are indeed a primrose in a fictional deep and dark forest."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Two of my friends at work recommended this series to me, and after reading this first book in the Mitford series, I've started reading the next and will read all the rest. This series is for anyone who likes a nice, easy-going, unassuming town full of fresh air and friendly folks. Sure, it's not for everyone, but no book is. I enjoy peeking into the lives of these interesting characters (it's almost like a light-hearted soap opera!). I've seen that several people have written reviews where they think a &quot;dog that knows scripture&quot; is ridiculous. I look at it this way: 1)it's fiction, and 2)usually when someone quotes scripture, their tone of voice changes, and it's probably this new tone that the dog is obediently responding to. I hope that Jan Karon keeps this series going, or at least uses some of these characters, even just in cameo roles, in other stories. If you like peaceful, easy-going stories, this book is for you."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My mom got this book from a friend, read it, and passed it on to me, saying &quot;It's a great book, you'll like it.&quot; As a college student who alternates between reading literature and reading &quot;brainless&quot; romance books for study relief, I was skeptical of the book at first. Then I started reading it. I throughly enjoyed the story! It was well written and fun. I found myself alternately racing through chapters to see what would happen next, reading slowly and enjoying it, or laughing out loud because of something funny the characters said or did (which earned me strange looks from my roommate)! My only complaint from the book is it flowed a little too perfectly. Everything worked out perfectly in the end. Normally, I love books like that, but tthe ending was a little too perfect. That aside, this book was fantastic. I intend to finish reading Karon's series, she has something good here! I wold recommend this book to anyone who needs a fun, lazy day read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Hi, Jan Karon, I'm a reader from Hamburg, Germany, and I just loved your books! There is only one question open: When can we expect the cookbook to go with all the mouthwatering dishes the people of Mitford cook up for their friends? I'd dearly love to have the recipe for &quot;Company Stew&quot; and &quot;Rector's Meatloaf&quot; and all the menu suggestions that Avis makes. The books are full of warmth and smiles, they show us a world that we all long for, where people care for eachother and COOK for eachother. So: let's see that cookbook soon!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book was a pleasure to read. It is well-written and easy to read. The characters are not fully developed but they don't need to be. This is a slice of life book about a country pastor and the folks in his town. This story demonstrates the faith in a higher power felt by most Americans. The beauty of this book is the way it is subtly inspiring and faith promoting while delivering a great story that keeps the reader coming back."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I love a book that I can readily recommend to all my friends. This book pleased my religous grandmother, and many non-Christian friends. It's religious side is uplifting without being sappy.

Join the revival, read it today."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"&quot;At Home in Mitford&quot;, the first in the Mitford series, is a novel that will sincerely touch your soul, as you follow the life of Father Tim, as he learns that life, indeed, can begin after 60. Surrounded by a parish, and a town, of loving and lovable characters, Father Tim meets love in the form of author Cynthia, adopts a lost boy (Dooley) and a God-fearing behemoth of a dog named Barnabas. This is one of the few books in my life which has made me laugh out loud, cry, and rejoice that there are indeed still authors who truly deserve the title of artist. Ms. Karon is that deserving person."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book and it's wonderful characters become real people to you as you read. And in the process they all remind us that the little pleasures are so wonderful. They communicate with each other in such delightful ways. All the intertwining of their lives brings such joy to the reader. And to read a book that has included the wisdom of religious faith in such positive, encouraging fashion was like finding a light in the darkness. These people give me hope. I believe that there are Mitford's out there all over. And I can see the same spirit in my home church community. A story about people who genuinely care about each other and try to find the courage to share their lives, has been one of the greatest reading experiences of my life. I've bought this book for all my friends."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I picked up the audio cassette of At Home in Mitford as an impulse when leaving my local library. No sooner had I listened to the first few minutes when I knew that I was hooked on the people and the countenance of this quaint North Carolina town. Jan Karon draws pictures with her words, and Jon McDonough's reading is warm and, at times, whimsical. I've listened to all five of Jan Karon's Mitford books and have enjoyed each one. None in the series is a let down. I'm ready to pack my bags and move to Mitford, and then on to the White Cap. I particularly recommend A New Song to devotees of the Outer Banks."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I don't normally read novels because I have a very short attention span. I normally stick to magazines. Unless a novel gets me in the first chapeter I don't finish it. This one caught me right off.My mother suggested I read it when I was home for Christmas. I found it easy to supplant people I know into the role of the characters. I felt like the plot moved pretty quick. I couldn't put it down. It was a little sweet but in a refreshing way. I can see where it would bore some people but personally I enjoyed it. I would recommend it but not to those who usually enjoy suspense or thrillers it is a little too slow for that. (referring to paperback)"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book will uplift even the hardest of hearts! The blend of faith and humor is enlightening and inspiring. Mitford is a town that should exist. Karon gives all the characters a different lifestyle, but they are all written with a sense of dignity and respect. The blooming relationship between Timothy and Cynthia is romantic and classic. It's a must read for broken hearts and faithful hearts! One might as well buy the 4 next ones in the series because you will never want to leave Mitford!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I am not quite finished with the first book in this series, but I do intend to purchase and read them all... While it is taking me longer to read this book as opposed to other books I read, I am finding this book really charming and humorous... and for once, something I can highly (safely) recommend to say, my mother or aunt. It is an easy read that could be enjoyed by a variety of ages. I love the references to the Bible, and just the little stories about the people who live in Mitford. I live in a small town, and it seems not a whole lot different from Mitford! This whole series is a welcome addition to my library!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you are Christian and a believer, you will probably love this book. If you are anything else, however, you will feel excluded, and ultimately insulted, by the story's simple-mindedness and complete lack of character diversity. Every character is a faithful practicing Christian-- even the couple of people who aren't fervent believers at the start of the book become so by the end. Add to this dialogue that is completely lacking in credibility: every character sounds the same, and I'm not referring to the accents. I'm reminded somewhat of Angela Thirkell: a syrupy tone without a trace of bitterness anywhere to balance all that sweetness. It seems appropriate that the main character should develop diabetes-- a potentially dark plot turn portrayed in the same breezy tone as everything else, so that it becomes one-dimensional like everything else. This book reminds me of the \\"Simpsons\\" episode where the makers of a demonic cat and mouse cartoon series are forced by the government to remove the violence from their product. The resulting cartoon turns the murderous lead characters into motiveless, smiling cutouts rocking together on a porch-- and the kids switch off the TV. I'll follow suit and stop with this first book, thank you very much."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book was required in my book club and I felt like I was swimming in molasses it was so sweet except for the gross descriptions of Dooley's dumps. How can adults spend their time on such juvenile reading? It's not for me."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I don't know how so many people love this book. There is no story, no conflict that can have a satisfying resolution, no challenges, no passion- at least not up to page 155 which is where I bailed out. I thought perhaps when a new neighbor is introduced, she would discover the alien pods lurking in everyone's basement, but I see from the back cover, she actually marries the main character. They must have got her too."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I liked this book, but felt that there could have been more of a plot or story behind the town. All of the things that seemed like big mysteries didn't turn out to be that way. It was a nice peaceful story of a town that I would like to visit. However, that's all it was, and a little long to have no purpose."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Love this series but there's another that just astonishes me on how good it is. Try Homer Hickam's &quot;Coalwood&quot; series. Begin with the #1 NY Times best-seller October Sky, then go to The Coalwood Way and then Sky of Stone. Mitford fans, trust me on this, you will not be disappointed. Hickam's Coalwood books are the real thing. No matter how affected you might be from the Mitford books, I think you'll be hooked just as much if not more with the Coalwood books!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I thought this was going to be one of the best books I had ever read but it wasn't so. The story goes on and on repeating itself in just different situations. As one of the other critics stated, I &quot;baled out&quot; before the book ended. I did make it to page 414 out of shear determination but I finally lost the battle. I am going to try the next book in the series to see if it is better than the first."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I didn't think anyone else would mention this so thought it could be helpful to SOME people but there is some mild bad language in this book.I can understand why people love this kind of book, just everyday life centered around a clergy and his staff. I did find some nice Christian thoughts etc BUT a warning for those of you christians that really like a 100% clean language book. This isn't it sadly. I am not saying its really bad but I stopped reading it as there were too many \\"oh my G**\\" and not done in a 'prayer like way!' There were other few mild language. The first one I could see as a non christian character and the pastor putting up with it but then there were more that didn't fall into this category.I realise that this warning may not be applicable to a lot of people but for those including myself that like a 100% clean language book then I am just letting you know, that there is that small anount in there."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I seem to remember hearing that a book had to have some tension in order to have a plot. If this is the case--At Home in Mitford has no plot. Several members of my family recommended this series to me. They were all in the 60-plus demographic--could that account for our differing opinions? I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. The characters are one-dimensional and barely discernible from one another. The writing is simplistic and unimaginative. And as I have mentioned, the plot is nonexistent. I won't be reading anymore about Mitford--well except if I need a good sleep aid..."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I am still wondering when the book will actually begin. What is it about? There doesn't seem to be a protagonist, antagonist, plot or story line.

I really can't figure out why thousands of women like this book so much."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After reading this book I considered converting to Satanism just so I wouldn't be associated with these people or thier creator, Jan Karon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book, and the whole series, is very uplifting to read.

After seeing these books virtually everywhere--and their bestseller status--I decided to see what all of the hoopla was about. I borrowed this book from a friend (it came highly recommended by several people) and attempted to read it. Note attempted. I can see where some would find the \\"idyllic\\" little town of Mitford appealing--I guess. I found it unbelievably Stepfordish. The cast of characters--especially Father Tim--are just BORING. I was warned about the apparent lack of plot and action--neither are necessary for me to enjoy a book. But this was just ridiculous. The dialogue--who talks like that? I feel a smidge of guilt for writing this review when I did not complete the book (this is a first), but I just can't do it. I cannot get through this book, and where I once felt like I cannot leave a book unfinished, this book will remain thus. Life is simply too short.

What was the time and place supposed to be - an English village of 50 years ago? It was not believable as a present day American town, I don't care how rural it is! The dialogue never rang true and the characters were just too quaint and folksy. I felt like I was trapped inside a Thomas Kinkead painting. I enjoy the folksy thing as much as the next person but let's have a bit of reality. Show me a twelve-year-old boy who talks the way this one did. I was hoping and wanting to like this book but was very disappointed."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon has a hard time keeping track of her characters names - at least two first names change throughout the book and one name vacillates on spelling {Jena/Jenna}. The author's overuse of the word &quot;he&quot; is more than just irritating; it is confusing. Numerous times, &quot;he&quot; refers back to the wrong antecedant. And, a small &quot;h&quot; is even used when referring to God. The plot, if you could call it that, is boring, and the characters are unbeleivable. Catherine isn't described fully to us [as a blond] until the book is almost over. If J. Karon wasn't going to describe her characters when they were first introduced, she should have continued to stay mute instead of dashing our own creative images of the characters when the tale is nearly through. I had to read this for our book club, or I would have stopped after trying the first hundred pages. My open-minded husband disliked the book, too."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I really enjoyed father tim and his small town full of interesting chatacters.

It is pleasant to visit a place where neighbors know and care for each other. I especially liked Father Tim; it is rare to see a positive portryal of clergy in fiction books these days. Yes, Mitford is a pleasant place, nice and quiet. Too quiet.Near the end of this book, I must say the story was becoming dull and too sugary sweet. There are now seven (?) of these books--which proves you only need one idea to make a living as a writer."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My women's book group at church read this book because we heard it was so popular. We all agree it is one of the worst books we have ever read, a complete waste of time. It is true that this book is like candy, empty sugar, no value. There is absolutely no depth or meaning to this escapist nonsense. One of the parts that really points this out is the fact that the pastor finds out he has diabetes and begins his exercise program by jogging a mile up a hill on the first day! This author can only appeal to those of little faith who cannot accept and live in the world given us by the creator but instead want to live in a sappy dream."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was shopping on Amazon for Kindle books, and noticed that the paperback version of this book is cheaper!How can that be, unless Amazon or the publisher is gouging the consumer!?

Father Tim's life was changed when a stray dog took an immense liking to him as well as a young boy named Dooley that moved in with him. Not to mention, there was also the attractive and funny neighbor by the name of Cynthia that just moved in next to his house. On top of all these things, there are problems, issues, and stories of the Mitford folks that Father Tim had to deal with.\\"At Home in Mitford\\" is a warm, funny and sweet book that deals with small town personalities and living. Through the eyes of Father Tim, we get to see interesting as well as eccentric characters in Mitford that we can't help but relate to. At the beginning of the book, I was overwhelmed by all those characters and couldn't keep track of who is who but after a while, I was able to. Overall, I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it for readers seeking a cozy and intimate read."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is a book about a loveable and charming small town full of interesting characters. This book is a fun read, but don't expect an exciting plot. There isn't a central problem or conflict to resolve. This book simply follows the lives of the main characters over the course of about a year and a half. It's fun to read about this almost-perfect small town life and imagine that life is really like this."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I thought that this book was excellent. There's a character in this story for everyone. It's a book that your whole family can enjoy. There are not very many wholesome good books these days. This is one of them. I recommend this book and also the second book in the series, \\"A Light in The Window\\". Hope you like this story as much as I did. It's a very readable story.

As Father Tim nears his sixtieth birthday, he begins to realize that, as much as he loves his work, his preaching has become stale, and he has become tired, and perhaps a bit lonely.As the year progresses, however, the empty gaps in Father Tim's life become full. Contact with several strangers in the town invigorate his preaching. The recognition of a serious illness begin to help his physical condition. And, three unexpected characters come into his life to begin to fill the empty places.At Home in Mitford is a charming book which can make any reader feel at home. I am looking forward to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was a little hesitant to read this book, given some of its religious genre. But when I finally got over that and picked up the book, I realized my worries were unfounded.&quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; is one of the most charming books I have ever read. Characters are loveable and each one is always getting into some kind of trouble. Between highlighting events in each character's lives, and just telling one good story, Karon has written a wonderful book. I can hardly wait to read the rest of the Mitford series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home In Mitford is one of the finest books I have ever read! Jan Karon is truly a gifted writer. I could not put this book down; I took it everywhere with me and opened up the pages every chance I got. I mentally and emotionally stepped into the pages of Mitford very early in the first chapter and felt as though I were mingling with all those wonderful characters, especially Father Tim Kavanagh. I wanted to stay in Mitford forever! I have since read all of the books in the Mitford series and am very sad that this wonderful adventure is now over. However, I understand there are two more books coming. I do hope that this is true and soon! I am suffering withdrawal symptoms. Hurry, Jan Karon!!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Mitford and learning about the town and people through the eyes of the village Priest.

It was time well spent and has strengthened my faith."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My mother recommended this book to me, as I am constantly sending her books via Amazon.com! For me, it is much slower paced than many of the books I usually read. It began so slowly, I put it aside for awhile, but after reading all the enthusiastic reviews, came back to it. Mitford is truly one of the quiet towns that many of us dream about retiring in, where everyone knows everyone else. As my parents both hail from that exact type of Southern town and are very active in their church and social lives even today, I can see why Mom enjoyed the books so much. I'm looking forward to see what happens next in the lives of Father Tim, Dooley, Cynthia, and of course Barnabas!

The chraracters are all introduced as if you already know all about them; there is very little depth to the character development, even for the main characters. They are all &quot;nice&quot;, which is very dull when it lasts throughout the entire story. And where's the plot? The preacher wanders the town, out of touch with all reality except that of his little sphere, and minor things happen to him. Pointless. Skip this book and read something with substance."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I so wanted to like this book. I live near the area that inspired the Mitford series and for years have meant to get around to reading the first installment. I was shocked to discover how tedious and poorly written it is. Karon doesn't seem to have a natural feel for engaging plot development. Her narrative is forced, contrived and often full of holes. Her characters are disappointingly one-dimensional and her belabored efforts to capture regional dialogue are shameful. I imagine it is possible that this series improves as it moves along but I found At Home in Mitford so painful there is no chance that I will continue. My hat is off to the powerful marketing minds that promote this series because they have definitely spun a silk purse out of a sow's ear. My recommendation is to not fall prey to the advertising hype. Borrow, do not buy, the first book. If for some reason it clicks for you, then you can invest in purchased copies of the subsequent books in the series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"There's not much plot and very little character development of the multitude of quirky characters that populate this hamlet. Yet, for some unfathomable reason the reader is pulled into the homespun, humorous happenings of Father Tim and the parishioners of his Episcopal Church. From next-door neighbor Cynthia who asks him to &quot;go steady&quot; to Homeless Hobbes who has known the glamour of Madison Avenue, you will find yourself inexplicably drawn into the everyday meanderings of this town. Maybe everyone secretly wants to live the laid-back life in a town where the biggest news is a dog-napping, where a criminal in the attic becomes a favorite son, and where schizophrenics are coddled not institutionalized. There is something safe and secure in a book where prayer is the key to solving all problems and favorite Bible verses roll off every character's tongue. If a few sugar-coated hours appeal to you, read this book. But if your tastes lean to the darker aspects of human nature, you need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read At Home In Mitford and though it a book without depth. It reminded me at first of James Herriot's books. His books I liked; this I didn't care for too much. There were no surprises. Also no suspense throughout the book. I knew what was going to happen. There would be a new heart for Olivia. Emma would marry her much younger man. I actually had to put the book down when the man came out of the bell tower. Not really. Would a real preacher want a wife who lets rollers in her hair? It is cute for the story but not in real life. All in all I simply didn't seem to be able to get in this book. It was a cute read.

The Mitford people are the world's dullest! I'll never be able to finish this book, and wouldn't want to -- there are too many interesting stories in the world (fictional and nonfictional)-- why waste time with dull ones? (PS.

If you ever find out you have two weeks left to live, move to Mitford because every day is a freaking eternity! I would not have finished this incredibly boring, preachy, plotless book if it wasn't required reading for the book club. Needless to say, I'm not interested in the rest of the series. If you want to read about a bunch of lily-white, holier-than-thou, cutesy, unbelievable small-town folks (who must have some secret income somewhere, because their jobs and their lifestyles are completely incompatible), then this is the book for you.

However, I also somewhat understand the appeal of this book. Warm, safe and comfortable.It is a chore to &quot;keep caring&quot; up until the end. One of my problems was I hated Cynthia. (Tim's love interest) WHAT A SILLY PUTZ.&quot;You were wonderful&quot; she coos to Father Tim after he plays the &quot;knight&quot; and rescues her cat (again) because &quot;oh Lordy pooor Violet&quot;&quot;You're lovely&quot; she says to Father Tim. Who goes around saying &quot;you're lovely&quot; to people they hardly know?She acts like a child half the time. She actually cried when she burnt supper and knightly Tim has to rescue her once again. Blech and double blech. I kept hoping she'd die or fall in love with someone else.I am utterly aghast that this book has turned into an actual SERIES. YIKES. THAT is going TOO far. I would never read another Mitford book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The characters are not well-developed, the plot was totally predictable, and one does not get any feeling of deep feelings from the people in the book. If you think &quot;Disney for Adults&quot; or &quot;Golden Book for Grownups,&quot; you'll understand what these books offer. I was given a set of 4 Mitford paperbacks, which I read in a couple of evenings. I found them relaxing and even sleep-inducing, which isn't all bad. Fine writing and fine fiction? Of course not. Given the stress in the world today, I understand the popularity of books like these that are utterly undemanding, emotionally or intellectually. The hunger for these (as expressed in many customer reviews) does say something sad about the emptiness of people's lives -- so empty that they must fill them with these shallow fictional characters? Because of the bland nature of these books, they make a good gift for someone in the hospital. Just be sure the personal you give them to is Christian, because the books will offend those of other faiths with the idea that perhaps the author is trying to convert them!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"It is hard to remember this book is suppose to be set in modern day times because of the fact that the characters are all ignorant almost to the point of stupidity. Or maybe thats just because their lives have been pretty perfect for the most part (Sadie is the only one i found that had anything close to real hearthbreak) The basic plot is that they live in a perfect town. They all get along. And if they pray about something, it comes true. I would suggest this book if your having a bad week and want to get away. go on vacation to a uncrowded beach or cottage. sit alone. read it. and pretend it could possibly be true. BUT even if you can do all these things you will run into so many things that make you say HUH? To name a few:Its the late 90's and Nobody in town seems to have any trace of technology that I noticed except a house phone or a fridge.(at one point the pastor almost gets hit by a car beacuse he steps out in the street and the witness yells \\" it was a person with a phone in their car! A phone!\\") The main character, the pastor, basically walks around town visitng all his friends who have problems and fixing their problems so they are not only back to normal but 10 times better. I also saw an earlier comment that pointed out this small town is out of touch with the rest of society yet instead of the corner store selling peanut butter, velveeta and cereal it sells Duck, Brie and Wine ( which the characters buy and bring along on ther picnics and dinner parties as they float along in fairytale land). One lady needs a new heart because she is dying. She doesnt want the heart but she gets sick and the pastor begins to pray about it and within month or so she is in the hospital recieving it. She doesnt have to wait on a transplant list for years, suffer in the hospital on oxygen and meds waiting on her deathbed. Nope..just wakes up one day, takes a helicoptor to massachusetts and gets a new heart. good as new. hmmm.... Lets not even talk about the fact that half the town seems to be millionares thanks to family money, but instead donate their money to charities and sit around drinking tea all day. Even the homeless man in town gives his stuff to less fortunate.good lord.But as I said I can understand if you want to escape everyday life and you are able to zone out and pretend there is such thing as Mitford and its perfect posse of people, have at it. It's suppose to be uplifting, but in a way is kind of depressing becauseI guarantee nothing in your life will ever be this perfect."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this book! I love Father Tim, a person so close to God and so easy to identify with. As I read this book I couldn't help but chuckle, therefore resulting in having to read some portions out loud to my husband. Each character is so well thought out. I felt that I knew them myself personally. Jan Karon helped me open my eyes to the people around me and accept their perculiarities with more patience and love.

Well--lucky for me that I checked the first one out of the library and did not waste my money. The characters are flat, two-dimensional, and do not think or speak as real human beings. I was stumbling through, forcing down a few pages each night, but after the insufferable brat Dooley appeared with his &quot;poop&quot; obsession, I gladly gave this one back to the library. Everything in this book is lame--characterization, dialogue, plot (if there is one). This one is bland beyond hope."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I wanted to like this book. I like series, I like small town America, it seemed that this would be a perfect book to curl up with. I actually feel guilty that it just didn't grab me. The idea of a pastore in a town that feels hopelessly out of date sounds good, but Karon didn't quite pull it of. My biggest complaint is that it is boring. I just didn't care what happened. There was very little excitement, substance, or even plot to keep the story moving. It seemed that the general gist was that Father Tim wanders around town and then goes home. That's it. A disapointment."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Perhaps I was drawn to all those 5 star ratings but I should have restrained myself! I ordered the 4 Pack of Jan Karon's Mitford Series and what a $$$$ mistake. I barely got through the 1st installment without feeling like I had eaten a life time supply of cotton-candy. Too sweet and no fat! There is absolutely no depth to the Milford characters and no concrete 'gotcha' story line. I would only recommend it to insomniacs.You might be saying now &quot;If you disliked it so much why didn't you just stop reading it?&quot; Well... you see I made this financial investment and I thought for sure that something was wrong with me for not liking it. But then I went back into the reviews and read further. Sure enough, there are people out there that disliked it too! Sure we are outnumbered but we are out there. I just don't get 'it' - this book is dreadfully boring. My recommendation - if you have never read this author - buy just 1 BOOK at a time or better yet show up at my next garage sale and buy the whole lot for $4.00 or BO."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book was so boring. Nothing happened, dog barked, pastor took a walk, rode his scooter, visited the hospital...If your looking for an exciting/drama filled book you will be disapointed. This would be a good book if there is nothing else to do and you just want something very calming to read."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is an incredibly well written prose tone poem. I admire the craftmanship... I admire the beauty of the subject... but I have rarely been so bored in my life. I'm going to finish the book though. I think it probably is good for me. But... there are no gladiators, no high speed chases, no Andu'uvian death rays, no smashing planets, no knights at war, no.... well you get the picture. I don't know how to rate it. I want to give it a &quot;zero stars&quot; and I want to give it a &quot;five stars&quot;.... I do honestly think that many people would enjoy this book. It's restful. There is much love portrayed here. But... there are no gladiators."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Having read the 5th book in the Miford series first, I appreciated the character reviews that Jan Karon gave. I got so engrossed in those characters that I am now starting the read At Home In Mitford and intend to read all of the Mitford books.

I'm glad Karon gave those small character reviews for me."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book was fine for my sight impaired mother..... however the packaging from Amazon was very poor....two loose books in a cardboard box. substandard for Amazon!!!!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Wonderful book.

I could not wait to follow up the book with the another one--to \\"visit\\" Mitford and all the people that inhabit this magical place. Each book has new intrigues to keep readers motivated to come back for more.Like many things I find myself doing, I began reading Jan Karon's books, backwards---that is, I started with HOME TO HOLLY SPRINGS. And that might be the best way to do it. I was so captivated by Father Tim's character that I could not wait to go back to the first book in the series. I have not been disappointed."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Kaon's vignette style depends upon frequent use of white space between sections. The Kindle version of this book does not incorporate white space the way Karon intends--or at least the way the original print version did--and this causes awkward (and sometimes confusing) transitions between story threads."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"this was a gift sent to the jail near me, for my nephew he received it in a timely fashion but refused to read it.

I had heard about it from a friend & got the first book & could not seem to get started. I picked it up again when in need of a new book & got hooked. It is the story of a man in his sixties, an Espiscopal Priest, who is Pastor in a small town & his daily life, & the characters that live there.. The towns characters play a big part in this story & some of them are fascinating.Alot of changes take place in his life in this particular first book & continue through the rest of the series. Jan Karon is a wonderful story teller & I enjoyed each & every one of them.

Like so many others I have read and collected many series, but the At Home In Mitford series surpasses them all. The writing is so captivating that you find yourself wrapped up in the story without even realizing it. I know that I personally found myself longing for a more peaceful, simpler, small town existence. I began to long for a place where the people &quot;take care of their own&quot;.

This is a return to a simpler (better?) time when people lived in small communities and everyone knew everyone else's foibles but cared about them just the same. Life centers around the small Episcopal church which Father Tim leads, and the interesting characters who are a part of his church. A breath of fresh air, like coming home."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I started reading &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; at my daughters suggestion and immediately knew that my husband, who is not a novel reader, would love it, so talked him in to letting me read it to him. We were transformed to Mitford. Every spare moment he would urge me to pick up the book and start reading. He would hurry home for lunch so I could read to him. We carried the book in the car, on trips to visit our daughter, and I would read to him. Every character was brought to life and we felt like we knew them personally. When we finished book 4- Out to Cannan we didn't think we could wait until the 5th book came out, but we made it and gobbled up &quot;A New Song&quot;! Can hardly wait for #6!

My hat goes off to Ms. Karon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I will be forever grateful to my daughter-in-law who loaned me this book. Knowing nothing about the story, I began reading it looking for the &quot;grand scheme&quot;, thus missing the beauty of the story-reading about the joys and rewards of uncomplicated lives simply and honestly lived. It awakened in me the desire to uncomplicate my life and to find beauty in the everyday lives and places that are a part of my surroundings."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"One would have to live in a small town to realize that Mitford is alive and well in the United States.

Once you start, you can't quit."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is definitely a feel good book. In this day and age it is very comforting to be able to sit down and read a book that literally helps you escape to a quiet place and leaves you feeling peaceful. No psychopaths murdering people for the fun of it, no sex scenes, and no foul language. Just wonderfully insightful writing about a town everyone wishes they could live in. I think the greatest compliment a person can give a writer is telling them their life is enriched becaue of their writings and feeling that I definitely would have missed out on something good if I hadn't come across Jan Karon's books.

I didn't want it to end . But, I knew that I had Light in the Window waiting. Jan Karon's Mitford series is so loaded w/ food for thought. The Mitford series is filled w/ lessons on life , and , in a subtle way, reminds me of what is important in my life w/ my husband and my baby. I thank God that I have such truly beautifully written books that help in keeping me grounded in the day to day living.I want life to be like Mitford. If I have faith,I feel that I can live my life the way God had planned. The appreciation for the simple things in life, the day to day stuff, Karon makes it all sound so special and wonderful!!

Highly recommend reading this series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a cozy, charming little story. I found myself relaxing several degrees each time I picked up the book. Couldn't stop thinking though, there needs to be a cook book to go with this &quot;Mitford series&quot;. My mouth was constantly watering over all the delicious meals being prepared. cakes, pies, soups, stews ,etc. Anyhow, loved the book. Looking forward to more from Jan Karon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I'm impressed with karon's first effort and can't wait to read her subsequent books. I became totally absorbed in the Mitford community and had that sinking feeling when the novel ended; I felt like I'd lost some new friends. Thus, I'm happy to see that the saga continues in subsequent books. As an editor, I was generally pleased with the editorial work on &quot;At Home in Mitford,&quot; though perhaps the author and editors miscalculated the reader's interest in a few places, such as regarding Miss Sadie's story (in my opinion, it went on far too long--I would have given a few vigorous red slashes to the manuscript...! But forgive me, editors can't help critiquing). Another thing: Perhaps the copy editing could have been a little less slavishly devoted to the comma styles mandated by the Manual of Style! Sometimes the comma style interrupted the readability. (As an aside, note that that copy-editing error seriously flawed the sequel to Larry McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Doves,&quot; which won the Pulitzer Prize. I think the sequel would have been much better if an overzealous copy editor had been told to keep his or her paws off what sounds natural! Don't worry too much about it, though, Jan; just ask the copy editor to relax a little, and trust your instincts!) But, overall, I could tell that care had been taken with the editing and proofreading--aspects of creating books that are sadly underestimated in publishing today. In short, thanks for the wonderful read, Jan. It is an engaging snapshot of a small town--and a religiously oriented world, one that seems heartfelt rather than dogmatic (to cynics like me). Congratulations!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is my first encounter with Jan Karon. What a delightful discovery!! Karon's style is so conducive to &quot;relaxing with a good book!&quot; Fr. Tim is most appealing for his lack of pretention, and his obvious gift for understanding the everyday problems of his congregation. He reaches out without taking over!! I can't wait to begin the next book in the Mitford trilogy!! H. M.

I read the first few pages and I felt trapped in the world of Mitford: a place that I had never heard of, yet, never wanted to leave. The irony of this novel is that as much as I thought of Mitford as a Utopia (and still do), it seems to be full of real problems faced by one and all. I highly suggest this book for a wonderfully detailed story. She does a fantastic job in indulging you with the humorous life and times of Father Tim and the rest of Mitford's inhabitants. A superb opener for a series!Phil"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a wonderful little book. I'm on my way out to buy the rest of the series!!

Let's hope Jan Karon keeps this series going."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Finally a priest that is handed to his readers with human qualities that make a person want to be in his flock. Father Tim is refreshingly real. Bob Newhart would be ideal to represent this priest in a weekly telivision series. Promise Land, Touched By An Angel, and now At Home In Mitford. A town we all would love to be a part of!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford Series is the best of the best! With each book, characters are more fully developed and become even more beloved. Cynthia is my idea of a real woman...nearly as admirable as the Proverbs 31 woman! I would love to attend Lord's Chapel, and have a chat with Father Tim. It is so wonderful to have christian literature surpass the standards we have come to expect in good secular reading, and I, for one, hope that Jan Karon continues to expand the series book by blessed book! Our town is having a Bane and Blessing sale based on the novel, and I must say that Granville is every bit as delightful and full of characters as Mitford. I am even more grateful that I live here now that I have finsihed the Mitford series!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"From having lived in a small town in NC (as did my entire family) this book is quite accurate in its detail, thinking, talking, and the interactions between the people.

It is the book that finally makes you feel good and lifted up."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Haven't quite finished &quot;At Home In Mitford&quot;, and I went out and bought the next three volumes.

Recommended reading to anyone who wants to feel good."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My roommate brought the first two books in the series with her to Germany when we studied abroad. I went through both of them so fast. The story is so wonderful and touching. The characters come alive and you end up wanting to move to Mitford and meet everyone. I haven't had a chance to read the rest of the series, but I am looking forward to them. Every page makes you feel warm inside and loved."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Ms. Karon's characters leave you with a desire to locate them on-line to find out what happens next! They are so genuine, country-warm; high contrast to normal hustle-and-bustle of life. Her settings sound like a living Thomas Kincaide painting. Their expressions of faith and reality of God in their lives add a little salt to make the reader thirst a bit. Looking for subsequent sequels (like to find out what happened to the Irish &quot;cousin,&quot; and Puny Bradshaw's children; and the next generation of Mitford-ites!). Sensational!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Having spent part of my childhood in the town upon which Mitford is based (in the North Carolina mountains), it was like reading about home. The characters are a delight, and I haven't been so wrapped up in a book in a long time---as I said, I barely noticed the five hour plane ride. This was a recommendation and a loan from my mother, and I pass at least the recommendation on to anyone!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is a terrific book and it was shared by my sister, my Mother, my daughter and myself! If you grew up in the south, this is a town you can identify with OR lived in!! I would love to move to Mitford and go to that church with Cynthia and Dooley and Ms. Sadie. Not to mention eating at the Main Street Cafe (is that the correct name?) Anyhoo, it is one great set of books that I have inhaled and I'm passing them on to my seniors to read. I WANT MORE!! Thanks for giving us great summer reading, Jan."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I bought the book on a whim at Half Price Books. I saw the work &quot;rector&quot; on the first page and groaned. Very agnostic by nature, I had to push myself to keep going. I am so glad I did.Jan Karon is an incredible writer. She is almost poetic and the imagery is vivid. The characters are charming and funny. Who would have thought that a love story of a 60-something rector and his 50-something neighbor (amidst other aspects of the book) could be so gentle and sweet and intriguing.The jargon of some of the villagers was a tad annoying as was the little boy (that the rector adopts) and his frequent use of the word &quot;poop&quot;. However, the idyllic place the book transported me to very night for a week was comforting.The religious angle wasn't overwhelming either. I tend to dismiss spiritual allusions and this book is full of them. But these fit right in. I recommend this book whole-heartedly. It's a welcome break from the frenzy of urban life."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"My mother and mother-in-law, both of whom have read all of the books in this series and loved them, told me that I just had to read these books. They also both cautioned me that in the beginning chapter, all the characters and foundation building details, which are an absolute necessity from the get go, would slow down my reading at first....but, keep going, they said. I did, and I will thank them forever. I have since joined the ranks of those who have read and loved each and every book in the Mitford series.Father Tim is a benevolent pastor to not only his church, but to the many citizens of this delightful community. The town is full of all the positive and negative characters one will find in any community, and Ms. Karon has found the good humor of their sometimes ridiculous situations, as well as the sweet, poignant moments. This is also Father Tim's story, and his way of handling the challenges of life in this splendid little town of Mitford. You will forever wish that you could live there!Older children will also enjoy the series. My eleven year old son is hooked on these stories, and they are perfect for reading aloud."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"A friend at work had raved about this book and lent it to me to read. I must say that I was skeptical at first, but after reading it I realized that it was everything she said it was and more. The story is about an Episcopal preacher, Father Tim, and other residents in Mitford, a fictional small town in North Carolina. Having gone to college in a small North Carolina town, this book was like coming home again. The characters are so well-developed, I felt as if I knew them personally. Father Tim is a sixty-year-old preacher who has never been married. He is befriended by Barnabus, a dog &quot;as big as a sofa&quot; who comes out of nowhere and jumps up on Father Tim knocking him down. The only way to control the dog is to quote scripture.Later in the book, he also takes in an 11-year-old boy, Dooley. The boy's grandfather has become sick and is very poor. The boy has been living with the grandfather because his mother is a drunk who can't raise the child. Dooley is a likelable character, but one who gives Father Tim a test in patience.Cynthia moves in next door. She is an author from New York who writes children's books about her cat, Violet. Soon Father Tim and Cynthia realize that they have deeper feelings for each other, although they don't want to admit it.This book really gives a feel for living in a small southern town. Karon has evoked a sympathy for the characters that makes you want to keep reading and finding out more about them. I can't wait to read the next book, Light in the Window, and see what happens with Father Tim and Cynthia!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon creates an absorbing cast of characters in this novel, the first of the Mitford series.Central to the story is Father Tim Kavanaugh, bachelor priest at the Lord's Chapel Episcopalian church in the small mountain town of Mitford, North Carolina. Father Tim leads a quiet life. That is until Barnabas the dog and Dooley Barlowe the pre-adolescent enter his life, and he begins to develop a friendship with his neighbor Cynthia Coopersmith, and countless professional and personal concerns intervene.The plot is interesting, but the book stands out for its likable, true-to-life characters, and for the peaceful atmosphere that permeates it. Father Tim, with his unflagging devotion to God, is an inspiration.Jan Karon's books have entered my canon of &quot;comfort reading,&quot; perfect for a pick-me-up when I tire of the darkness and dysfunction of many modern novels."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Refreshing, delightful and providing a chuckle every now and then. Just like my little town I moved to one year ago. Excentric people that have nothing but love and kindness for their neighbor. And all shepharded by their Rector. He reminds me of our new minister. I love this book and have read the next in the series which I loved even more. Now on to the next."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a wonderful, easy and very amusing read. I loved it from cover to cover and couldn't put it down. I live in a small town (not quite as small as I imagine Mitford) but we have just as many quirky people. Father Tim is wonderful, I wonder if real ministers have the same conflicts as he does. This made me look at my minister in a whole different light, realizing that he is just a person, struggling through life just like the rest of us mere mortals. I would recommend this to people of all ages, I have passed it on to my closest &quot;reading buddy&quot; but when I get it back I'd love for my ten year old to read it with me again."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"These books start out a little slow--it took me a little while to get into the first one. I kept thinking, &quot;What is it everyone loves so much about these books?&quot; Then, after a couple of chapters, I realized I was hooked on these characters &amp; kept reading straight through all the books. I loved Dooley &amp; the dog.The only thing that I thought was a little unrealistic about the book was the fact that those &quot;mountain&quot; people were just a little too &quot;cultured.&quot; I live not far from &quot;Blowing Rock&quot; which is the town this book is supposedly based on, and a lot of my relatives live in that area. While the &quot;accents&quot; were accurate, I've never known a single mountain person in that area to attend an Episcopal Church--most of the people I know don't even attend church. An Episcopal church would be a little too quiet and ritualistic. Most of the mountain people I know prefer clapping, foot-stomping churches. I thought the &quot;grill&quot; where they all gathered to eat was also a little unrealistic. Most mountain people do not &quot;eat out.&quot; It would have been more realistic to have them gather daily around a woodstove in some little country store. (I've sat around plenty of these stoves, with a bunch of men in overalls chewing their tobacco).These books are great, though. I love the progressive relationship between Father Tim and Dooley, and the relationship between Cynthia &amp; Father Tim is great! Who doesn't like a love story!These are your typical &quot;Rated G&quot; books--nice, clean, &amp; wholesome!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have zoomed through the first 4 Mitford books and am now midway through the 5th. The characters grab you and transport you to a town where I think, deep down, we would all like to call home. Father Tim is a &quot;real&quot; person with very human characteristics. Yet his basic goodness will restore your faith in humanity. The theology is not shoved down your throat, but rather is grasped between the lines. All the characters are memorable. Cynthia and Dooley in particular help shape the wonderful story line. The huge dog, Barnabus, who is disciplined only by hearing Bible verse, worms his way into your heart. I am so glad I discovered this series, and I recommend it to absolutely anyone!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Let me say that 50 pages into this book, I knew it was going to be an alltime favorite. As I reached the halfway point, I was sad to know that I'd soon be finished. I am cheered by knowing that I have 4 more books in the series to go.This novel has opened my eyes to the beauty of small town life. I have also looked for ways that I could show such care and kindness for those around me, even though I'm in a big city.The characters are so real--with flaws which just make them more human. I laughed at loud many times, especially at the only thing that controlled Barnabas the dog.If you are a Christian, familiar with church politics; from a small town or with ties to one; a Southerner; a dog lover; or a human being, you will find something that grabs you in this little town."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a great! I enjoyed the book, the simplicity, the writing, the development of the characters. At the end loose ends were tied up, but I was so glad to have the next book in the series! I'd hate having to wait a year. I read the second one immediately after finishing the first."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was looking for something to read after being charmed and entertained by Van Reid's Moosepath League novels. My sister, who loves the Moosepath books too, suggested Jan Karon. I will admit that I resisted for quite some time. I had the idea that they were probably &quot;women's&quot; books, but nothing could be further from the truth. Any really good book is above such pigeonholing. This one certainly is. Like Mr. Reid's books they explore what a minister I once knew called the &quot;mystery of kindness.&quot; Ms. Karon's Episcopalian minister, Father Tim, is one of those gentle souls who seems a little clueless in the ways of the world but who turns out to be as wise as anyone. Surrounding him are a host of memorable characters, a lot of small town skullduggery, and the possibility of middle-aged romance. It is amazing how many of these elements describe the Moosepath novels, though the writing styles of the two authors are very different! Mr. Reid's is a little more old fashioned. There's some basis for comparison with the Andy Griffith Show, too.So if you're a guy! And if you like a good chuckle and you don't need to have someone being murdered on every other page, don't let the cozy covers and all the women raving about these books keep you away.But now that I've read &quot;Mrs. Roberto,&quot; after I read all the Mitford books, what do I read next?"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you combine Barbara Pym and E F Benson, throw in a little Garrison Keillor, and then transplant the result down to the American South, you might just get an inkling of what Jan Karon has done in creating the town of Mitford, North Carolina.I haven't encountered anything quite like this town, or anyone quite like its various residents, in all my previous travels in the worlds of literature - but having discovered Mitford and her townsfolk I'm extremely reluctant to leave. Each one of these people is a completely unique character - and boy, do I mean character. There's Father Tim (his last name is Kavanagh, but you won't know that from this book - I only know it from reading the back cover of another book in the series), the rector of the local Episcopalian church. He's the moral and spiritual center of Mitford, as well as one of its leading citizens. He's also been \\"adopted\\" by a humongous dog which he names Barnabas. How the dog (or should I say small horse?) meets up with Father Tim is just the starting point of this wonderful book.There's a twelve-year-old boy named Dooley who captures Father Tim's heart, who looks and sounds like he just wandered in from the outskirts of Mayberry.And then there's the good rector's new next-door neighbor, a gorgeous and intelligent dream named Cynthia, who captures his heart in quite a different way. It's rather obvious what road this relationship will be going down, but the resolution won't be appearing in this book (apologies for the spoiler).These are the three main characters in \\"At Home in Mitford\\", but there are dozens more that you will undoubtedly adopt into your own literary family."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I noticed on one review, the writer said she wished Mitford was a real place....well, it is. My husband and I pastor a church in the hills of KY, and it IS Mitford in so many ways....the town square, the local cafe where everyone congregates, and a host of colorful characters that add so much to our lives. I've even found myself reading &quot;Mitford&quot;, and giving some of the characters names from our community. My husband usually doesn't read for pleasure, mainly for study and sermon preparation, but I've talked so much about &quot;Mitford&quot;, that I now have him started on book 1. It's an enjoyable and pleasant read for him. I'm just finishing up &quot;A New Song&quot;, and am enjoying getting to know their new congregation. I own a Christian book store, and am glad to see these books making their way to the bestsellers lists. I encourage my customers to give &quot;Mitford&quot; a try.....just relax and let Jan Karon take you on a little trip to a wonderful corner of the world."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon has been on my book list of &quot;must read&quot; for some time now. Finally I happened upon &quot;At Home In Mitford&quot;. My nights have now been longer because I can't put the book down. Father Tim, Barnabas, Dooley, Puny, Homeless, Uncle Billy, Cynthia and the entire Mitford family have me not wanting to miss a moment with them. Visiting Blowing Rock many times, I found myself trying to figure out where I might find Father Tim the next time I'm there. In my mind I can even see the church she might have fashioned his church from. It's amazing how Ms. Karon can write and in a secret sort of way teach us all life lessons. Visiting Mitford made me long for the days when I was young and our neighbors really knew who we were. At midnight last night I had finished my book and wondered how I'd get though the night until I could get to the book store on my lunch hour for &quot;Light in the Window. Will Father Tim finally wakes up and realizes that he's about to loose one of the dearest persons in the world? Thanks Jan Karon for such wonderful stories."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"How do you criticize a book that is sweet and nice with a very slow and quiet pace? Is it right to say anything bad about it? Probably not. Yet I don't think I will read another Mitford book. There was nothing really wrong with the book, yet I have no desire to go back to Mitford. It was a nice town, full of nice people, who were nice to each other in a very nice way. Even the \`mystery' was nice with a nice solution. The book had a nice group of characters who lived in a nice town, where nothing really bad happened. There was no tension or excitement to the book, because you just knew every problem would have a nice solution. There was a very strong Christian faith theme running throughout the book, that could be a bit off putting to those of another faith, but over all it was a nice book. If you are looking for nice, this is a book you will love."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As an author AND a reader, my inner critic is always \\"on,\\" but I have to tell you these books -- at least in my opinion -- are as close to perfection as it gets! I am almost finished with book #3, and I have grown to love these characters. Fr Tim, Dooley, Cynthia, Puny, Sadie, Uncle Billy, and the list goes on and on. I have had some laugh-out-loud moments, but what I really love about the series is that it focuses on the goodness of people. With all the awful news we see on TV -- there are times I have to turn off the news for a couple of weeks because it is ALWAYS bad -- but Jan Karon's books are like a soothing balm. We need more books like these! Jan, thank you for giving the world-weary something to cling to and for reminding us that love is the greatest gift in the world. I will mourn the ending of the series.

What a great soother, which manages to be thought-provoking in small and subtle ways at the same time. Yes, there are some here who want to be more challenged by their reading, but I would argue that there is a place for every type of book and for its type, these are the best I've found."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"&quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; is an old fashioned kind of book. Filled with interesting, quirky, hometown people involved with everyday living. A little mystery, a little drama, a little romance and lots of wisdom. I'm glad I read the first in the series...I plan to read all three."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I should admit that I have started this book with a strong doubt, and hesitated to like it until it was nearly the middle of it. The characters, the town, the events, too good to be true at times, yet, deeper than expected, heartwarming and full of hope and goodness. Being a non-Christian, I was surprised to find myself to relate to Tim, his values, and his spirituality, as well as admire his quickness and warmth. It was a wonderful escape I looked forward to, everynight."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This review applies to the unabridged audio cd version.I admit, when I first began listening to this book on cd, I was thoroughly bored. I didn't think I'd be able to make it through the first chapter let alone the first CD. But as I had nothing better to do while driving to work I kept listening.I am so glad that I did!!! I promise you, if you can get through the first few chapters you will find yourself pleasantly immersed in the lives of those characters that inhabit the fictional town of Mitford.I agree with other reviewers that nothing much happens in Mitford, but to me that was the charm that lured me in and kept my interest through 16 CDs. It made me nostalgic for small town America and sparked some hope in me that maybe one day I'll be able to retire to a place where nothing much happens, yet where the spirit is continually nourished with down home goodness and not to mention down home cooking.So please, give this wonderful novel a chance, allow yourself to be transported back to a place where time moves a bit slower and where nothing much translates into so much more."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Was it H.L Mencken who said, &quot;No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public?&quot; No matter. Here's the proof - a fabulously successful book that reads like the script to a sanitized soap opera. It's not great - or even good - literature, but it IS a marketing triumph. (Even the cover art gets into the act, wooing one's subconscious by mimicking the covers on Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon books and tapes.)From a structural standpoint, the book is cleverly geared toward a public accustomed to watching TV rather than reading. The narrative within each chapter is divided in chunks of several paragraphs to several pages in length, which shift the reader from one story line to another, just like a camera cutting from scene to scene. There's no continuity, and nothing much in the way of character development. Cliches abound in descriptions of both people and places.Speaking of places, the real locus of this book isn't western North Carolina - it's Neverland. It is legal for a town down there NOT to have a Hardee's? I don't think so! (Maybe one shows up later in the series.) &quot;The Local&quot; is NOT what I think of when I think of Southern Small Town Shopping. Can you see a couple of Good Ol' Boys picking up a wheel of brie and a bottle of chardonnay before they head out possum huntin'? (&quot;Dang, Bubba! Yew done fergot th' Stoned Wheat Thins!&quot;) No, buying Velveeta and a six-pack at the Piggly-Wiggly or Winn Dixie is more like it. The picket-fence-perfection of the place defies belief. And where, pray tell, are the black people in this Southern Eden? There's only one - and she's a former domestic servant! It smacks of tokenism at it's worst - and this in a book written in 1994! Kind of makes you wonder if the Klan didn't get to Mitford before Father Tim did.In Mitford, virtue is ALWAYS rewarded and evil is ALWAYS punished. EVERY prayer is answered the way you want it to be, EVERY doctor is Marcus Welby, and EVERY cop is Andy Taylor. This is riduculous. Mitford makes Bedford Falls and Mayberry look like Sodom and Gomorrah. It's escapist fiction at its most (unintentionally) ludicrous. One of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head when he or she described reading this book as &quot;like being trapped inside a Thomas Kinkead painting.&quot;Don't get me wrong. The virtues exhibited by the characters are admirable. Would that we all acted with the kind of integrity that they display - and not just the overtly &quot;Christian&quot; characters. Even those characters who have undergone decades-long crises of faith are instantly reconizable, in a tradition going back to Dante, as &quot;Virtuous Heathen.&quot; True evildoers are nameless and faceless. (The only &quot;personal information&quot; you get about the drug runners who steal the hero's dog is their license plate number.) No, the characters, good and bad, are just not convincing. Admittedly, the good ones do have to cope with adversity - but since somehow, they ALWAYS get what they're seeking, it's difficult for working stiffs like myself - who DON'T always get the promotion or the girl - to relate to them.In short, this is not Real Life - this is Wish Fulfillment, pure and simple, masquerading as Real Life. I suspect it's aimed at readers caught up in a hectic world where - as we all know - nothing is as unfailingly pure, wholesome, and/or cut-and-dried as it is in Mitford. Now, if you're a person who NEEDS to escape to Neverland once in a while - and I'd certainly include myself in that group - at least try a better-written book that doesn't pretend to be a &quot;slice of life.&quot; If I might make a suggestion - try something out of P.G. Wodehouse's Blandings Castle series, or perhaps one of his &quot;Uncle Fred&quot; books. They just can't be beat for verbal felicities, and as for plot twists - well, try one and see. And they're every bit as wholesome as &quot;At Home in Mitford.&quot; To quote Wodehouse, &quot;It's nothing that you have to hide from your growing boys, or shove under the cushion of the Chesterfield when the Vicar comes to tea.&quot;"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a speaker and author, I'm a voracious reader of books of various types. I feel you just can't draw from an empty well. So, I'm constantly learning while gathering material from many different sources.

I have since been a huge Mitford fan, and have read the entire series repeatedly."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What can you say about any book in the Mitford series that hasn't already been said? Jan Karon never fails to amaze me. She has the ability to take a \\"religious subject\\" and turn it into a great read for anyone, whether they are Christian or not. And you learn to love all her characters and feel like you know them. I've often liked, or even loved, one character in a book and maybe even most of the characters, but never before have I felt that I love the whole book (and thus the whole town) -- even the unloveable -- and also know them all personally. These books all have an almost \\"Lake Woebegone\\" feeling to them, and yet they are not copycats of anyone's work.

I read one book after each treatment and it was such a wonderful gift. I made myself wait for the next installment or I'd have raced through the entire series! It may be peaceful in Mitford but that doesn't mean nothing happens. There are people who are salt of the earth, irritating ones, funny ones, sort of like most communities.

I was captivated the entire time. How could a book be so interesting with out murder, scandal, and sexual tension? There were no sex driven lords and cheating ladies.

Beaton and McCall Smith."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Little Explorer: My New MoccasinsHere you have the ingredients for a perfect book. You have a perfect town, perfect people, perfect priest, and perfect religion. Yes this is a fluffy extreme fictional work. If you want a light read, this is your book. If you want religion, this is your book. It has a jewel thief who becomes a religious icon, a homeless man that leads with the banner of Christ simplicity, and some really bad dognappers that are drug dealers. You also have a sick man who is miraculously cured of pneumonia with prayer, a woman with a fatal heart condition who gets a new heart through prayer, and a cop who gets shot but survives with his love at his side. You also have a priest with a sudden and extreme diabetic condition that gets worse as he falls in love with a perfect woman. The author presents a somewhat long but entertaining story with characters she fleshes out well. The negative to me is that it is too too too perfect. If you are looking for affirmation of the perfect faith, this is your book, but I pull one line out from the book that struck me with significance - \\"Do not look at what the Christians do, look at what Christ does.\\" I give the long book a four because it did make me think about my own belief in the power of thought. I might read the sequels because you cannot help but like the characters like Dooley (Opie of Mayberry RFD) and the dog Barnabas. The priest is fairly human at times. But I will not read a sequel to quickly because like the diabetic priest, I can't handle too many sweet sugary stories at one sitting."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"A delightful visit to small town life.

I read to relax and recharge and have come away from these books re-energized.

The town of Mitford is located in between tall mountains that not only separate the people from the rest of the world physically, but also segregates them from the world's problems. This type of book allows people to relax and dream while reading.Tim, the Episcopalian preacher, boldly faces all of his problems without regret. Throughout the book he was confronted with difficult problems, such as an enormous dog, a young boy, diabetes, and much more. Plenty of opportunities also come up that he more than happily deals with. This shows that Mitford is rich with surprises and never-ending peace. Tim is stubbornly motivated to go on preaching without rest or any help from others. This type of characteristic especially made him too tired to enjoy living life normally. As Tim helps to improve the life of others based on faith and trust, he finds that everything is becoming more and more difficult for himself. He soon meets a special woman that just moved in next door who helps sooth all of his difficulties.Tim continually strives to preach wonderful sermons that lead his own flock of people, while he himself is struggling with his own faith. Throughout the book, every character stays simple and kind to one another. In the end, all of his friends realize how much he has done for them and they arrange for Tim to go and relax on a two month vacation. As a result, anyone that reads this book will be touched by the love and kindness every character shows."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What an absolutely delightful book for those who are willing to embrace a little hope and wish-fulfillment. Yes, it's a very optimist look at life; but, hey, it's fiction and that gives the author (and us readers) permission to wallow in whatever state of mind we'd like. Unfortunately, it seems that a very small percentage of the reviewers are living in a world of negativity to such a degree, that they can't allow themselves to enjoy some rapturous joy in their literature.

But don't we all deserve to be touched by an angel once in a while? The Mitford series centers on Father Tim, an aging priest who ministers to the small by lively congregation of the Lord's Chapel. He is by turns fussy, funny, and faithful (the kind of faith that is simply there, not overdone, just a part of daily life). And Karon's gift as a writer is that she allows his story to unfold. We discover the characters and the subplots without the heavy hand of a writer who wants to ensure that we \\"get the message,\\" and we're delighted in the process. Even if your usual bedtime fare is A Brief History of Time, I encourage you to visit this little town for a while.

It's not a glamorous read for those looking for pimps, hookers, drug dealers and more doses of depression. Filled with colorful and eccentric characters that heaven forbid ... sometimes pray!!Now residing in a metropolitan area, I enjoyed the opportunity to escape the moment and venture back twenty years.

The plot was transparent. I don't mind a page-turner, but this book totally lacked substance. It's not that I require blood and guts to be satisfied with a book, but this book was so saccharin-sweet that I needed to brush my teeth.One of the most annoying things was the author's method of writing dialog (&quot;'at ol' dog...&quot;) ... it was cumbersome to read. The way the rector kept quoting scripture was too contrived ... as if each day the author read a Bible verse and forced herself to incorporate it into the story.Beyond my distaste for the unbelieveable sitatuions, I did not think this book was written well (case in point, is the character &quot;Jena Ivey&quot; or &quot;Jenna Ivey&quot; ... we see it both ways)."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After hearing all the uproar and seeing the multitude of book store displays devoted to Mitford, I found the actual book to be trite and contrived and (gasp!) not at all well-written. Karon has somehow misplaced her village--is it Yorkshire? is it New Hampshire? Certainly, it isn't North Carolina. Her dialect was unconvincing and at times downright confusing, her characters were all too pious, and her village a bit too idyllic for my taste. I also found the book to be edited carelessly--someone referred to as Leo is referred to as Lou several pages later. It's all a little too white bread for me (in fact, the only African American character is a domestic and is quaintly referred to as a &quot;raisin&quot; by Our Hero). If you want small town life brought to life with humor and charm, check out EM Delafield's Provincial Lady series."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This well-written book, the first of a series (actually the first of a small cottage industry, apparently!) has much to recommend it. The writer has a keen eye and a good ear. The story (what story there is) is engrossing. Issues of spirituality and faith are handled with insight and real illumination, and without condescension. The author likes her characters and the town she writes about.At the same time I found myself annoyed as I read on. The time presented in the book is clearly the present, though one can only tell that by the occasional reference to things like cordless telephones and contemporary television shows. The town and the people living in it have little or nothing to do with the way life is actually lived in America at the turn of the 21st century, even in small towns. It is the present seen through a nostalgic haze, as if the writer is projecting her idea of a past America onto a present situation, a past that never really existed outside of 1950's television shows.In Mitford, everyone is NICE, even teenagers. Problems are solved as they were at the end of '50's sitcoms: all's well that ends well. There is no character who is not a Christian. There are no atheists. Everyone is white, and the only character of color is presented as a stereotype: a maid, who calls her employer &quot;Miss&quot; in the Southern manner of fifty years ago. NO one seems to have a sex life. There are no gay or lesbian persons in this town, of course, not even closeted ones. And there certainly are no Jews, Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists in Mitford.However much this book has to recommend it (and there are considerable pleasures here) I could not escape the feeling that I was being manipulated, and that my worst prejudices were being catered to and taken advantage of, rather as they are in contemporary movies. &quot;Titanic&quot; comes to mind. The book is not story driven or even character driven. Situations are set up by the writer and then resolved in the most superficially satisfying way, again, like bad &quot;50's&quot; television shows.However if you want a good &quot;escapist&quot; read, then certainly this book, and the series that follows, is enjoyable, if you take it on its own terms."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is the perfect book to take on vaction. The author creates an engaging picture of a small North Carolina mountain town. The hero is an Episcopal clergyman in late middle age, and he is surrounded by all sorts of entertaining villagers. The writing is suffused with a gentle humor. What is unusual is that the author treats religious people with respect and seriousness, and even manages to teach some spiritual lessons, albeit in an understated manner. This book will make you laugh, and may even bring a tear to your eye. I am telling all my friends to rush out and get this book, and I look forward to reading the other books in the series"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was looking very forward to reading this book and desperately wanted to like it. I threw in the towel three quarters of the way through. I respect Karon's goal and believe it was sincere, but the novel fell extremely short in many ways. Mitford is a picturesque town filled with people that ALL get along. There are no disagreements among them. Every thing is sweet, too sweet, right down to the dialogue between the characters. They speak too perfectly. Everything seems to work itself out in an almost perfect way. I understand that this is a Christian based novel, however as many Christians know that prayers aren't always answered in the way we expect or want them to be. Answers to prayers don't always come wrapped up and neatly tied with a bow. One of the deciding factors for me to give up reading this book involved Barnabas the big black dog that bounded unexpectly into Father Tim's life. Father Tim finally takes to him and adopts him. Some time later, the dog is snatched into a car (appeared to be the possible owner, may not have been- didn't read any further to find out). Everyone in the town begins to contribute to a reward fund. Okay fine. Father Tim adopts the dog, never trying to locate the dogs possible owner. Even when the reward money is being collected no one mentions this. This town of hypocrites is collecting reward money for a dog that doesn't actually belong to the \\"church\\" rector. Nobody ever gives a thought that there could be a little kid crying his eyes out because his dog ran away. I'm sorry if I gave some of the story away, but in all honesty, consider it a favor. This book is just a poorly written adult fairy tale. I give it one star that is on the brink of burning out! If you must read it, save your money and borrow it because if you make it through, you're not reading again."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Well, I finally finished slogging through Jan Karon's &quot;At Home in Mitford&quot; more than a month after starting it. I haven't found any book to be such a chore to get through in a very long time. If you're a fan of good literature, don't believe the hype and AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE THE PLAGUE. If you're offended by anything and everything the secular world offers up, then by all means visit the local library and check this out in order to be clubbed over the head with 450 pages of inoffensive drivel. Just don't tell me what a wonderful book this is. Because it isn't. THIS IS NOT A GOOD BOOK. PERIOD. No plot, poorly written, and dull, flat, one dimensional, forgettable charcters. Need I go on? And there are eight books in this series? I can't even imagine. Marketing genius but little else.For a vastly superior series of novels set in rural America with a religious theme, check out anything by Jon Hassler. He blows this Mitford nonsense right out of the water."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"13.00 PLUS TAX FOR A FIFTEEN YR.

There's one thing I have to say, though -- as a Catholic, now that I've read most of her Mitford novels, I do feel a bit uncomfortable with the complete absence of Catholicism in Karon's Christian world. Maybe it's the setting in the South, but the fact that there are Christians who are Catholics is never, ever mentioned -- she has one minor character who's Jewish, but nary a Catholic anywhere. I wish she wouldn't leave us out completely -- her happy Mitford world is otherwise so inclusive, and now that I've realized it, it does give me an uncomfortable feeling that there might be some (perhaps unconscious?) anti-Catholic prejudice on the part of this wonderful author."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I bought all four books because they came so highly recommended. There is a charm to them, but the events are predictable and the character development is virtually nil. Still, because they are a sort of fictional &quot;hot milk,&quot; the Mitford books make nice nighttime reading. Seriously, I've used them to put me to sleep after a stress-filled day. Because of that, I've given several as gifts to friends recuperating from surgery, divorces, etc.! P.S. There should be a warning on the Mitford books, though -- I had no idea the books would be filled with Christian dogma, which did not bother me but which may offend some people."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford has been a wonderful add to my collection It has mystery, suspence, emotion, and even a little bit of romance. Father Tim, the rector of a small church goes through a bit of a mid-life crisis. He discovers his lovely neighbor, a single writer, Cynthia Coppersmith. A large, hairy faithful dog, that becomes his best friend And a young boy, Dooley Barlow, who first asks if he can &quot;take a dump.&quot; Faced without a home Dooley comes to live with him, bringing a truckload of responsability. Other than that, several other characters are having crisis' of their own. From the outside, one may thing this to be a boaring book about boaring people in a boaring town, but their lives are a boaring as ours! They meet new people, hold lunchons, and get married, not to mention have to burn a table for firewood. Above all, this is a clean christian book with something for every adult. It's a refreshing way to sooth the stress in one's life. But, if you're seeking a thriller, stay far away!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Very slow reading. Not like the Remember, Redemption, Return series that I really liked. I could not relate to the characters, and the writing seemed scattered."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I bought this book for a dollar at a used book store for two reasons: First, when my mother was dying in the hospital, a friend who didn't know her terribly well gave her a copy, and I was curious about what she would have experienced if she had lived long enough to read it. Second, I enjoyed Lauren Winner'sGirl Meets God: A Memoirmemoir a few months ago, and this book series plays a huge (if admittedly embarrassing) role in Winner's spiritual growth. I only lasted for two chapters before realizing that this is not a book that has any value for those outside its intended audience. There is surely a devoted group of readers who like mundane stories about small-town life, and I did enjoy that this particular town held a certain esteem for high church traditions, with a rectory and bishops and a diocesan chain (my personal background is of a more evangelical nature, so this was new and mildly intriguing to me), but I got the inescapable sense after just a few pages that nothing I cared about was going to happen. The priest finds a huge dog who likes to hear him quote Scripture (I don't know exactly what translation, but it's one of the ones not too far removed from King James English) and 18th century poetry, and that's supposed to be.. funny? And his secretary gives up Little Debbies for Lent just when he wants one, and the patrons of the local diner don't know the names of famous 17th century Dutch painters...Reading this book is like watching a Honeymooners-style sitcom with no edge and no jokes, or like reading an Agatha Christie novel without the dark joy of knowing that one or more of the characters will be murdered in a preposterously convoluted way. I feel a certain peace in my soul that there is an audience for that kind of thing, but I am not that audience, and I will not be making any attempt to finish this book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I really loved this book and all the other books in this series. What I would like to know is if Jan Karon plans to write anymore to the series? I thought I had read somewhere in the book A New Song about her writing two more. If you could let me know, I would really appreciate it. I hope she does continue. The books were a great comfort to me and a change of pace from the Daniel Steele and Anne Rice type books I normally read.

At first I thought Mitford might be similar to the Mayberry of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; with a cleric instead of a sheriff as the lead character, but actually, Mitford seems to be a place where people from Mayberry would go to escape the hustle and bustle. Plus, as annoyingly quirky as the Mitford characters are, there is nobody there as well-drawn as Barney, Gomer, or Floyd the barber. Maybe this book would work better as a TV show. Or as a sleeping pill."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"...applies to this writer's attempts to evoke a 'folksy' ambience in her Carolina mountain town. Unfortunately, what little plot there is seems very contrived; attempts at representing vernacular speech are awkward; paper doll characters plod through the standard &quot;village locales&quot;.The premise of following villagers' daily lives is similar to the PBS tv presentation of the series 'Ballykissangel' but without any of the hilarity, pathos or conflict which that series so ably portrayed.I'm pushing through to the end, reading aloud sections in the evening, during which my husband invariable drifts off to sleep."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I'm a native of the area on which Mitford is based, and I can say that Jan Karon does no justice to the area. This novel was full of simple character types -- all from a white, middle-class background -- who don't resemble anyone I've ever met in my life. If you're looking for an escape from the real world, this may be it, but I'd recommend being white and fairly well-off (the only minority characters are stereotypical black \\"mammies\\"), otherwise you're in for a long-winded trip through hell."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you get down to this review,you just like reading reviews, but as I went down through the reviews I found a trend: Those that listened to the audiobook didn't like it. I listened to the audiobook and I didn't like it either. It's abridged and read by the author. I usually like that arrangement, because I feel the author won't read it if it's too badly abridged. This is one of the worst abridgements ever! The story jumps from one situation to a completely unrelated subject with no transition. This was a book for our book club. I'm glad I'll miss the discussion session for this book because it was AWFUL! The writing is stilted - even people from the Ole South don't talk like that any more, and the story, as you've read above, is pure Mayberry - but this show wouldn't have lasted a season, even if it were the 60s."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read all of Phillip Gulley's books about Harmony. He writes from the minister's viewpoint. This author is not a minister, and while she has a great command of the language, it takes her too long and too many words to describe what is happening. And what is happening, for the most part, is not usually consistent with the life of a minister, which I've been for over 30 years. Almost all of what Gulley writes has or could happen to any pastor. However, this book is written well, and is in the style of a novel. Parishoners will find this more appealing than would pastors."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After my wife and 15-year-old daughter enjoyed the Mitford Chronicles so much, I promised to read the first volume in order to be able to substantively discuss Mitford life with my womenfolk. I have finally finished \\"At Home in Mitford\\" and thought others might be marginally interested in a masculine perspective on the book.First, I have to say that it was somewhat less than absorbing. My wife and daughter finish one of these 350-page books in 2 or 3 days, whereas it took me several months. And the difference is due to something other than reading speed. In fact, for a while I thought that my 13-year-old son's comment after reading the book jacket, \\"That's all I need to know about Mitford,\\" was pretty close to the mark.After working on the book for several weeks and not seeing anything happen, I asked my wife for an outline of the plot. Her answer: \\"There is no plot. It's just the meanderings of small town daily life.\\" This was difficult to absorb! I wondered (to myself), \\"Why would anyone want to write about such a thing? And if one did, who would want to read it? And if one read it, how could one in good conscience inflict it on someone else?\\" Nevertheless, I persevered.That said, however, I must admit, upon finally finishing, that it was a good book; I even enjoyed it. After coming to terms with Father Tim not being an Indiana Jones type, I was able to appreciate his life and \\"adventures,\\" such as they are. And he does have some adventures. Shootings, drug dealers, and international jewel heists somehow make their way into the book. The book is also packed with dry humor; I found Father Tim and his countrymen a hilarious bunch of characters. I hope they were not insulted by my laughter. Possibly my familiarity with small town Southern life contributed to my enjoyment of their daily tribulations.The book is set in quaint little Mitford, North Carolina, the parish of Father Tim Kavanaugh, an Episcopal priest who was raised as a Baptist. Father Tim is a solitary, but contentedly cheerful, sexagenarian bachelor recently diagnosed with diabetes. We see Mitford through his eyes and thoughts. Father Tim has a strong commitment to the people of his parish, and he, in turn, is beloved by them. The supporting characters appear as genuine people whom the reader gradually comes to know through natural, unforced dialogues and the author's original descriptions of daily activities.I especially appreciated author Jan Karon's portrayal of authentic Christian faith and the application of such faith to everyday life. She does it in a frank, non-preachy way which I found uncommonly attractive and strikingly effective. Her presentation of Biblical theology is for the most part sound and accurate. The book is more effective than most standard evangelistic tracts in winsomely presenting authentic biblical faith in the Creator. She uses believably realistic accounts of normal people's joys and sorrows to depict the reality of life with God in a broken world.My one serious criticism is that Cynthia Coppersmith, Father Tim's neighbor and emerging love interest, is divorced. It was disconcerting to have to change my view of the Tim-Cynthia romance upon learning of her marital status. After all, how can one \\"root for\\" a developing relationship which the Son of God identifies as adultery? (\\"Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.\\" Luke 16:18) Their illegitimate romance leaves a bitter taste in the reader's mouth. I strongly object to the books' implicit approval of remarriage after divorce. The Mitford Chronicles are for the most part so wholesome that the commendatory presentation of the Tim-Cynthia relationship desensitizes people to the seriousness of divorce and serves as a persuasive voice to legitimize remarriage after divorce. Due to the nature of the books, most people will find Karon's implicit message far more credible and enticing than when they encounter the same message in other cultural opinion sources. It is a sign of the degradation of our culture and the dilution of Biblical authority in the culture that most readers are completely unfazed by this divorce and remarriage issue.Unhappily, the illicitness of this relationship stains the remaining books in the series as they are centered on Tim & Cynthia's developing romance and eventual marriage. It would have been far better for Karon to have cast Cynthia Coppersmith as a widow. Nothing of consequence would have been lost, and it would have made her relationship with Tim legitimate. Father Tim's total lack of concern about Cynthia's divorce is terribly inconsistent with his Baptist upbringing, with his position as a small-town Episcopal priest, and with his lifestyle of otherwise-consistent Biblical faithfulness. His silence is a serious literary (and moral) fault. I would like to have seen him \\"tear himself away\\" from Cynthia after learning of her divorce. I suggest that readers mentally re-designate Cynthia as a widow in order to appreciate the Mitford Chronicles.Possibly the most surprising result of all is that I have agreed to read vol 2: A Light in the Window. It turns out that I \\"need\\" to know more than what's in vol 1 as the books are less than swift in getting to certain points. Can you believe that I have even gotten started on the second volume?"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"All of Jan's Karon's novels epitomize escapism at it's best. Every time I finish one of her books, I am sorry and even a bit depressed at having to once again leave Mitford and it's charming, warm, and amusing residents.

I do agree that the dialogue can weaken at times (I grew weary of Tim's &quot;Indeed&quot; and &quot;Consider it done&quot;) but for a work so heavy on characters this is a minor annoyance. I read with interest all of the reviews and found even the negative ones to be sincere and if I were the author I would be pleased to know that people were so strongly moved one way or the other by my work.

I too was sad when I finished one book and awaited my next installment of Mitford."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"During a stressful time in my life and after a round of heavy books, I was in search of something uplifting and relaxing, and At Home in Mitford perfectly fit the bill.The main character is Father Tim, a 60 year old Episcopal priest in the small town of Mitford. Although his grouchy secretary is convinced he is lonely and needs to get out more, he maintains he is content with his bachelor life and time-consuming parish duties. The first indication that his placid life is about to change occurs one day when a giant black dog the size of a Buick tackles him and proceeds to cover him in slobber. The only idea that pops into Father Tim's head is to shout out a Bible verse, and the dog inexplicably stops its vigorous licking and lies down with a contented sigh.A dog that only responds to Bible verses is hardly the end of the adventure, however, as his life is quickly invaded by a dirt-covered, love-starved, ill-mannered boy named Dooley who arrives on his doorstep one day and bluntly states that he is looking for a place to \\"take a dump.\\" We are also introduced to the elderly and strong-willed heiress Miss Sadie, a hilarious and ornery set of old men who meet at the Grill for breakfast every morning, take-charge fireball \\"Puny\\" who is forced on the rector when the parish decides he needs a housekeeper, and a host of other local characters. Along with all this, life-long bachelor Father Tim is horrified to admit that he can't stop thinking about his lovely, quirky new next door neighbor, Cynthia (in spite of the fact that his dog is determined to kill her cat).The Mitford books are easy to read, cheerful, and uplifting. They are unquestionably character-driven; it is the relatable, funny, and everyday oddball characters that keep you reading. Unfortunately, my biggest complaint is that the plot is infused with several over-the-top events, including a jewel theft, a dog-napping, and a drug bust. It seemed to me like Karon was finding her voice in this first book and was a little afraid to keep the plot ordinary and let it be driven by the characters. Thankfully, Karon seems more confident in her characters in the later books of the series and these outrageous events are much fewer.All in all, the Mitford books are very enjoyable, and I thought the way that Karon infused spiritual truths through the thoughts and actions of Father Tim was believable and encouraging. There are simple yet profound challenges sprinkled throughout, musing over real-life struggles such as how hard it is to \\"simply\\" obey the Word. I didn't find it preachy, probably because reading about a priest trying to figure out how to apply truth to everyday life is completely believable to me.Mitford is a sunny, sweeter-than-life town with just enough reality and struggle to make you think, but not enough reality to make you feel bludgeoned with the evil in the world. Personally, it was just what I was needing.For: Fans of James HerriotAll Creatures Great and Small,Love Comes Softly (Love Comes Softly Series, Book 1), anyone who needs a relaxing, uplifting read."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this book. It was heartwarming and such a sweet read. Quite a long book so it took awhile to complete, but well worth the time. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is a heartwarming look back at Americana at it's best. At the very beginning there is imagery that walking through a door can take you into a different world. Words that set the theme of this book. It's a step back, a \\"frigate\\" that takes you to another land. The recipes are the bonus."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford Years books are my absolute favorites! I've read them all at least three times over the years, and I never get tired of them. When I'm reading about Father Tim and the rest of the gang, I feel as though I'm with friends. Unlike many other Christian fiction novels, these are extremely well-written. If you love sweet books with wonderful characters and a convicting message, the Mitford books are for you!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I love this entire series of books. It was lighthearted, good reading that I enjoyed very much. Jan Karon does an excellent job of drawing you into the lives of Father Tim and all his cohorts for his adventures along the way."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you are looking for a series of books that will hold your interest this is it! Karon is a writer everyone in a family will enjoy including men. After the first book you will want the entire series. Make sure you start with the first book."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In my opinion AT HOME IN MITFORD is one of the most fantastic books you can't help but feel like your there."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a wonderful find ! I love books and am an avid reader,I have been blessed to have received this wonderful book from my sister.A pleasure to read and impossible to put down. No bad language,no violence,just pure love,joy,and how most anyone would love to live their life as this.Keeps you interest at high level all the way through the book,and leaves you with such a good feeling,can't wait to get to the rest of them.Jan Karon has to be a truly blessed author.Thank You"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read all the books in the Mitford series. I could not put them down. I thought they were all very good. I think Jan Karon did an excellent job making the reader feel these characters were real and that we were right there with them in the story (and I'm not one to be like that at all!) I haven't found many books that I enjoyed reading as much as I did this series. I can't wait for more stories written by Jan Karon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I loved this book, Mitford sounds like an ideal place to live in. This was a nice change from a lot of the depressing books I've been reading lately!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This series is a wonderful \\"good old days\\" step back in time. Small town pastor interacting with many diverse characters -- laughter, tears, joy and heartache, as well as a 60-year-old pastor falling in love for the first time. A terrific read!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I can think of several reasons why I shouldn't give this book five stars. It's a bit too sweet and sentimental--perhaps more than a bit. It preaches Christianity at the reader, but it is not the Christianity of angry causes; rather it is a Christianity of the gentle sort Jesus preached on the mountain. The town is idyllic, for the most part. Having lived in small towns, I know for certain that life there is not always without thorns. Mitford has thorns, but they are blunted.So why then did I like the book? Because it was a journey to a nicer world, not a perfect world but a nicer one. One needs that from time to time. It was the Andy Griffith Show, with a dash of Lum 'n Abner and the novels of Joseph Lincoln, had he been born in the South rather than Cape Cod.There is no central plot. Rather there are a number of connected stories or incidents. There is no grand resolution. We leave Father Tim on a dreaded plane, about to go to Ireland for a vacation ordered by his bishop. The characters are quite good for the most part, although I think Dooley, the boy, is not very realistic. But it is the atmosphere of Mitford, North Carolina that kept me reading late at night.I know I shouldn't have liked this so much, but I confess I did. The bad part is that I now own eight more in the series and will be obliged to read them as well."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a wonderful novel this is. Jan Karon has captured small town life and its wonderful citizens in this first novel of the acclaimed series. Being an Episcopalian I was immediately drawn to the life of \\"Father Tim\\", Mitford's Episcopal Minister and one of its leading citizens. His humble, honest, and heartfelt life truely inspires all who know and love him. Being an Episcopalian myself, I can relate to, chuckle, and enjoy the insights of the church that he has to deal with. All the characters in the novel are interesting, enjoyable, frustrating, and just plain human (aren't we all?). I look forward to reading the rest of the series and I rate Miss Karon's novel right up there with Fanne Flagg as being one of my favorite authors to read.Very Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In the 1st book in the Mitford series, we are introduced to Father Tim, a kindly rector who is overworked, overwhelmed, and is thinking of leaving his town parish in Mitford, North Carolina. He doesn't eat right, exercises only in his walks around town (he gave up his car for Lent 9-years-ago), and will not take a vacation. Being called the \\"portly priest\\" embarrasses him, but it is not until he discovers that he has diabetes does he make major changes to his life. Cutting out his beloved Little Debbie snack cakes, jogging three days a week, and finding house-help does much to improve Father Tim's physical health. But his mental health still suffers from his lack of time to relax. And several events that happen to Father Tim over the course of this lovely story initially only add to his frustration and fatigue.First, he becomes adopted by a huge, furry dog that he names Barnabas, and quickly learns that the large dog is controlled only by the bellowing of scripture. He then takes in an orphaned boy, whose alcoholic mother decided to \\"get rid of\\" all of her five children. The boy, Dooley Barlowe, goes to stay with his grandpa, and when he becomes gravelly ill, Father Tim steps in to care for the boy full time. One of Father Tim's closest friends becomes romantically involved with a dying woman after the recent death of his wife, and Father Tim worries about the heartache that his friend will feel when he loses another loved one. And, after over sixty years of living alone, Father Tim discovers a romantic stirring in his own heart over his new neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith. In the end, Father Tim realizes that all of these things have been a big blessing in his life, and that the Lord does indeed have big plans for himself and his cherished home in Mitford.Taking a break from the cozy mysteries that I normally read, I was looking for a series that both my mother and I might enjoy. Based on the many glowing recommendations that I found, I picked up a copy of the books on tape for both of us. We both loved this charming and lovely book! As other reviewers have mentioned, the book grew on me the longer that I listened to it. It took awhile for the story to unfold, and for the characters and setting to become real to me. But after that...I found myself unable to read anything else, or stop myself from listening to the tapes! My mind kept drifting off to Mitford, wondering what Father Tim was doing, or if he would finally express his interest in Cynthia. I laughed, I cried, and at times I yelled at the cassette player. Father Tim can be exasperating at times...he won't take a break, and he bumbles his way around a romance with Cynthia. But, he is also kind, gentle, devout to Christ, and selfless...all of the things that make him such a rich, charming character. I can't say enough about this wonderful series...except that I was more content and felt more blessed in my own life after listening to it.The next book in the series is called \\"A Light in the Window\\". Enjoy!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The Mitford books are ones that I reach for whenever the world seems too big and scary for me! Jan Karon finds a way to comfort and entertain at the same time. Father Tim and the cast of characters are in my heart, and I find myself giving these books as gifts, because I want to touch the people I care about the way these books have touched me."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Kudos to Jan Karon. Her Mitford series is remarkable. Very talented story teller. Proves that a good storyline can be wholesome and captivating all at the same time. A must for fans of Christian fiction."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"No other series of novels captures your heart like the Mitford series. They are the paramount of penned fiction on the market. You easily believe the characters, merciful Tim, uncivilized Dooley, and artistic Cynthia are totally real and so is their quaint charitable town. It is far superior to Mayberry! You will enchantingly sit down and open \\"At Home in Mitford\\" and believe you are a resident watching the animation of winsome daily life unfold.Due to his pastoral commitment, Timothy places you in captivating unfolding mysteries; making your spirit churn in anticipation of the next unraveling segment. It just takes this one book to hook you on the delectable bait of sequels.I live in Idaho, but was recently in North Carolina where I tried to depict amiable Mitford. You do want to believe it is real!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I had heard of these books. I am a pastor and could not help but hearing of them. I had no interest in actually reading one, though. This one was given to me as a gift by a friend. I almost had to read it. I am so glad I did.There is not much story. The book describes the exploits of Fr. Tim, an Episcopal rector in a rural southern town. Fr. Tim is getting up in years but he faithfully stumbles along from crisis to crisis in his parish life, solving each problem with a mixture of common sense, prayer and concern for those involved. The results are good for everyone except the good father. He fails to take care of himself until he is forced to do so.When I am not reading academic works or preparing for a sermon, I like exciting things. This includes military fiction, science fiction and real history. I have too little time to \\"waste\\" on things that do not seem as if the will be of use either pastorally or because of personal interest. I did not think this book would hold my interest. I was wrong.Karon describes the vagaries of small town life and of clerical life but does so in a refreshing way that is peaceful and restful. This is true even when issues such as a heart transplant, drug dealers, jewel thievery and dog-nappers are concerned. Reading this book did not accomplish a great deal for me except that it did do this: it gave me a pleasant rest. It amused and refreshed. It was pastorally needed in my life. I only hope I serve my congregation as well as Fr. Tim serves his. I look forward to the subsequent books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I'm a big Mitford fan. Have been from the beginning. It's so nice to find a retreat from a tough world. Having read every Mitford book, I was delighted to find another book that travels the same course. (I needed a new book to read). If you love Mitford, you'll love Bliss, Mississippi in the new novel The Town That Came A-Courtin'. I have read an advance reading copy and strongly recommend it to all who love Mitford. We cannot have too many books with Christian values, quirky characters and pure fun and joy."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is a simple, charming book which I thought at first was going to be too goody-goody for words but which I found to be nothing of the kind. The central character is an Episcopalian priest and the locals of a small town, around whom the plot evolves-warts and all !Having come from a recent reading diet of crime and mystery thrillers, this dear little book is like a restful holiday for the mind. I would recommend it sincerely to anyone who wants a little gentleness in their lives at the moment."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"In modern times where any bit of 'entertainment' can leave you feeling a bit down, its nice to have something that lets you walk away with a smile. The quality writing and uplifting story with solid values can make you feel grounded as well as full of hope. The world is an amazing place and though this book is fiction, it gives a positive perspective that may help you get a fresh focus. The characters from Mitford always have something going on and Father Tim seems like someone that you could really enjoy knowing."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I started this book wondering what was going to happen, expecting something different. When I finally just let myself get caught up in the story, it was like I belonged in Mitford. There isn't any great action, but you don't need it. When you read this book, you get so wrapped up in it, it's almost as if you were there. If you want to just relax and be a part of something good and wholesome, this is the series for you."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"The simple life, oh how we all long for it, in Mitford you will find it. Jan Karon writes with a style similiar to James Herriot in his &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; series. Jan also weaves her Christian faith throughtout the book in a way which is relevant to her reader. Put the kettle on, make some tea, sit down in a cozy chair and become acquainted with the people who live in Mitford.You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"are you telling me she has wrote nothing before this hard to put down gotta share it with my friends book?! As with all of her subsequent books that i have read she does not fail to ease my hectic bus ride to work or calm my thoughts or worries...in fact if a devotional was included i could think of nothing better to start my day! Midford is the small relaxed town of yesterday that we all long for...neighbors that care and a town clergyman that works hard for the Lord and is rewarded with the love of the townspeople. Throw in non stop twists and turns to Father Tim's everyday life and displayed is the life of a true Christian. Not perfect but striving to be and being a great example to all in the meantime. Super read...get it today!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon I hope you keep writing this series foras long as your able.

This is the kind of book Oprah should honor."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After reading this engaging, uplifting book, I bought a copy and sent it to my friend who had just lost her mother. Although my friend is back in the swing of things, I sent her this book in memory of her mother for that day when she feels lonely and misses her mom and could use a faithful friend like Father Tim. It's that kind of book"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I'm buying all the Mitford cassettes for my 87 year old blind mother, but I have had the wonderful experience of reading the first three and I'm heading to a bookstore for the last one (or buying it here--I switch around to support locally owned stores, too). I began &quot;A Light iin the Window&quot; around eight at night, and didn't go to bed until completing the book around two am. Be careful--as you can tell from the above reviewers, this author is highly contagious. I now have a fatal case of Karonitis. How fast can she write? Susan Lundy"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read this book during a brief visit to my hometown a couple of years ago and briefly ignored my own family to visit with this wonderful cast of characters that have been created by Jan Karon. The warmth and humor with which Ms. Karon writes reminds one of a more personable Miss Read or a more subtle Garrison Keillor. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a break from the hectic pace of life and a peaceful place to call home"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"After years of listening to mysteries, love stories and assorted fiction and fact, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the soft, lovable tones of John McDonough's narration of this gem of a story. As an Episcopalian, I was touched by Father Tim and his dog, Barnabas. Then, when Dooley came into his life and the cast of characters began to expand, each adding a richness and texture to the community, I was hooked on the whole experience. It's the kind of book that has you laughing one minute, then crying the next, so totally wrapped up in the lives of the people Father Tim touches in his daily rounds.I'm glad I found your books, Jan Karon, and I hope you write many, many more"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book came very higly recommended. Don't get me wrong, i did enjoy the book in places, and finished it. But there really was no plot to speak of, and it tended to ramble a bit. Also, it was predictable. Sometimes that's good, but not always. readers like a little suspense. Like Miss Sadie's story, i saw the love story part coming a mile away, even though some of it was rather unexpected. Which made it tolerable.Some of the dialouge was rather difficult to read. I mean, yes, twelve year old boys do talk a little differently then older people, but not to the point where they turn That into \\"at\\". And slipping poop in as a substitute for foul language was understandable, it was still hard to believe anyone would use that word quite that frequently. for instance\\"all that poop\\" and \\"i aint doing any of that poop\\" really? And i have yet to figure out if the boy dropping paryts of words was meant as slang or as an accent. If so, why didnt anyone else speak like that?It's a nice little read, if somewhat boring."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I love these books!!! I have re-read the series for the second time and they are just as wonderful the 2nd time through! I met the author a few years ago and she is delightful!

Please write more...I miss Mitford!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"A rather insubstantial, predictable lightweight novel.

The story is pleasant to listen to and the characters delightful. I grew up in North Carolina and love the small village stories from my own childhood. I think this book is better to read than listen to unless there is a recording that uses a southern voice. No offense intended toward the wonderful reader here - he just does not sound like he comes from North Carolina!!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This audio version of Jan Karon's first book is fantastic!

Like a good vacation spot, I wanted to share it with people who would enjoy it as much as I did, but let it still remain my secret haven. I'm sad for the people who couldn't rejoice in the happy endings and the happy beginnings. Yes, we need literature that reflects the sad and violent nature of our times, but why overdose on the Hard Copy/NYPD Blue version of &quot;reality&quot;? What's wrong with indulging in the good side of human nature for awhile? I know people like Miss Sadie and Cousin Billy. I know Dooleys and Punys, too, and it's true -- there isn't always a Father Tim there for them. But sometimes there is! And how wonderful to find kindness and faith at the heart of a novel. We're supposed to eat broccoli, too, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't get company stew and mandarin orange cake! Thank you, Jan Karon!

The small town life described on these pages remind me of the stories my father tells of growing up in a tiny town on rural Ohio. Every description of Dooley was funnier and more heartwarming than the last! I loved each and every character and became so fond of them that I hated to see the book end.

My aunt bought me At home in Mitford and I absolutely loved it,it is like eating candy.I really reccomend this to readers of any type!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Welcome to Mitford, the kind of wonderful small town we allwish we lived in. Jan Karon's first book in the Mitford Yearsseries introduces us to Father Tim, the Episcopal rector, Barnabas,a huge dog which adopts him, and all the people in this smallNorth Carolina town.You really come to know and love the people here and to really careabout what happens in this small town. The book is infused withwarmth and humor, in a way that is rare among modern novels.If you are looking for a book to let you escape from our too hurriedworld into a place where life is good and peaceful, Mitford is theplace. Once you visit Mitford, you are likely to run out andbuy the other books because you will want to return soon."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If Mitford was a real town, I'd move there just to meetFather Tim and his funny little town. He is 60-ish, anEpiscopal priest, unmarried and getting worn out. In avery short time frame, he gets a dog, an 11-year-old boyand maybe even a girlfriend. This is his story (as well asMitford's) so it is told from a religious viewpoint, butwithout having religion &quot;crammed down&quot; your throat. It isvery easy to enjoy even if you wouldn't normally readsomething classified as &quot;Christian fiction&quot; (now that'san interesting classification in its own right)."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I am a person that almost exclusively reads fiction from the 1800s (19th century that is). Since I am a librarian, I am really trying hard to branch out and read works that are a little more current. This sounded like an old fashion tale that I could get into because it contains a different/older set of values - the values found more in older literature. Most readers coming into the library for this series are older and for some reason, though I'm \\"only\\" 34, many of my preferences match more to people 30 to 40 years older than myself. (Old soul and all that stuff). I'm not religious, but you don't have to be to enjoy this story of a church pastor that is trying to get along - trying to deal with some changes and perhaps a post-mid life crisis in a way. This pastor happens to be a 60 year old bachelor that is just starting to develop some feelings for a woman. Being that he is in fact 60 years old (never married), you can imagine how difficult this is for him to be in a relationship that could force some change in him. I like the fact that it is a longer book - it gives you the chance to live more with the characters and then at the end, want to continue that relationship - it's nice that there are many more titles to follow that I can enjoy. I've previously read Anthony Trollope's Barchestor Towers series (6 long books - 19th century) that also has a Clerical setting, perhaps that is what led me to Jan Karon's works."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read the first three books of the Mitford series and I am more interested in Cynthia, Miss Sadie, Rose, Billy, Puny, and the group at Main Street Grill than I am in Father Tim. I think Tim spends too much time wallowing in self-pity. Tim even admits to wallowing, but does nothing about it - except say thankful prayers for having Cynthia and the others who put up with him...then he continues to think of himself. Tim is a weak main character that has yet to gain any strength.I do enjoy the Town of Mitford - I hope Jan Karon gives Cynthia, Puny and the characters at the Main Street Grill a voice - I am tired of hearing about them through Father Tim.I highly recommend the Miss Read series of which J. Karon has spoken. Miss Read is a strong main character with that wonderful English wit - that only the English can master."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I appreciate Jane Austen and her village characters and as a result I appreciate Jan Karon's memorable cast of villagers.My sister-in-law gave this to me for my birthday, and I took a time before reading it. It seemed so simple after the convoluted tales that pass for reading material these days but, unlike orange marmalade cake, it is practically guilt-free. That's saying something!I've read a few more in the Mitford series and always appreciate the struggles of everyday faith. I especially appreciated the words used to answer the man in the attic \\"You should be asking, is He down here?\\" There is the salt to cut the sweetness."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"MY INTEREST WAS HELD THROUGH EVERY TRACK. GOOD STORY LINE AND MORAL LESSONS."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I read all of the Mitford Series and the first one is tough to get through because there are so-o-o many characters, but well worth the patience.The Mitford Series are charming, warm, spiritual, fun and sometimes, sad - there is real life portrayed in this enchanting place - people get sick, people die, people have problems of all kinds but, as hard as it is to believe, the people in this town come together and help their own.I don't know if such a town and its people exists anywhere but boy I sure would love to live there.The critics are so used to reality shows, and ugly politics, ugly news reports they can't handle the gentle, peaceful Mitford..if you are spiritual, gentle, kind, loving, caring, or looking for that - escape to Mitford - beats watching the news these days."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Appropriate for all ages, easy reading, well written, especially liked the map at the beginning of the book. You won't be disappointed with this wonderful book. You will feel as though you know all the characters personally."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I want my 13 year old daughter to read this book. Great values and interesting story about an Episcopal priest in a small, unspoiled town in America. She likes to stretch herself beyond children's books, and this is the kind of book I want to throw into her hands!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"Jan Karon's gift is a treasury for all who enter the world of Mitford. Reading or giving this series of books is a gift for all."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"What a pleasure this and all of Karon's books are! Pure delight with their Mayberryesque type settings. True, they have more than a little &quot;Christian&quot; attitude thrown in, but it's all part of the theme.The characters in this book are so likeable. Yes, this is not the real world, but who wants that all the time. It's a great escape from things like the rampant commercialism and decay we all live with. Just give me a good book that I can fall into any day and I'll be happy. If you liked &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; or &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; you'll probably like this book as well, though those two have more than a little &quot;real life&quot; in them. All-in-all these books are great reads and shouldn't be missed. All of Karon's books are great."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This is such a wonderful story. I never really thought how busy a clergy man's (or woman's) life is and how much they actually do in their chosen vocation. Father Tim, the rector, in Mitford is the central character. He is just turning sixty at the beginning of the story and has reached a time in his life that he has lost a little of the joy and fulfillment he has always felt before. He is need of a vacation, which he has not taken in years, but which he always finds excuses to not take-he is getting burned out. Enter a huge bad-mannered dog (who is only controlled by hearing scriptures from the bible spoken to him) who has decided to adopt Father Tim, a young untamed boy, a new attractive neighbor, a jewel theft, a sixty year old secret love story, missing food and much more and you have a story that is so wonderful and so human and so enjoyable. I felt the urge to go to my bible and eagerly look up the many stories on Jesus because it made me feel so close to him and loved by him. Don't make the mistake that it is a preachy type story from what I just said but rather a feel good story that makes you want to reach out. The characters are all portrayed as actual everyday people we know ourselves with all their foibles and goodness combined. If you want a book that will leave you with a good contented feeling then this book will fullfill your wishes."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At Home in Mitford is the first in a series of books written by Jan Karon about a small town in North Carolina. The main character is Father Tim who has a parish in Mitford, and the book is filled with wonderful characters from the town. It is a cozy and enjoyable ride getting to know Father Tim and the rest of the townspeople -- from stray dogs to a boy in need of direction, romance to encounters with a jewel thief, and a lovable but definitely offbeat little old lady.Jan Karon left her successful career in the fast-paced world of advertising and moved to Blowing Rock, North Carolina which she credits as the inspiration for Mitford, not the actual characters but the feel of a small village. She is able to make you feel like you've been to the main street grill and that you can actually smell the flowers in the town gardens.The character development of the townspeople was very good; you want to know them more and more and what happens to them. Father Tim is both pleasantly multi-dimensional and not totally predictable.The \\"bad guys\\" characters could have been developed more thoroughly, but perhaps that will come further into the series.I recommend this book for a happy and comfortable read, somewhat like drifting around a swimming pool on a float, peaceful and agreeable with a splash of excitement"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"If you like warm &amp; cozy reads that are character driven, then At Home in Mitford is for you. The imagery that Jan Karon paints is picture perfect, with streets named Lilac Lane &amp; Old Church Road, and the local diner, The Grill, where the townfolk gather and catch up on the latest goings on.Mitford is the ideal of small town, southern life. It is here that Father Tim lives &amp; breathes, where he is the pastor of a small parish. For the past 12 years, without a vacation or break, Father Tim has nourished his congregation while neglecting himself. Little does he realize how a new neighbor, a little boy, and a faithful dog will come into town and change his life. Mitford has a cast of wonderful, colorful characters and the pace is just right for the simplicity and loveliness of Mitford. This is not a book if you're looking for action, but if you like warm and cozy reads, this book is a must. I can't wait to read the rest of the series~"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a avid reader of authors Stephen King, Jonathan Kellerman, and the like, it was nice to read something without death and mayhem. I was given this book to read by my godmother who told me it was okay. I loved it. I didn't want it to end. Needless to say, I'm ordering the whole series. What a nice breath of fresh air. I am only 29, and the characters in the book seem to mostly be elderly, but I wish I lived in Mitford. What a lovely thought."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"As a &quot;cradle Episcopalian&quot;, I was thrilled to discover the Mitford series when it first came out. My mother is anxiously awaiting the publication of &quot;A common life&quot; this spring,as are many of the ladies(and gentlemen) In our parish. We have decided that Father Tim is a composite of several priests that we have had over the years. It isnt hard to get a discussion group going when word gets out that another Mitford book is due. Several people I work with recommended the original book to me(Not Episcopalians,by the way), and we are all waiting for April! Jan Karon has captured the essence of 20th century old fashioned Episcopalianism in the finest detail, including the priest who marries later in life,and discovers that he can never quite retire! Kudos and blessings to the author and to all the books in this wonderful,inspiring series!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I have read the whole series and thoroughly enjoyed them all. I wish she would continue to write about Mitford. I really hate for it to end. I would love for her to write more about Dooley and what happens in his future and how he handles coming into all of that money Miss Sadie has left him. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"At first, I did not want to read this book because my mom recomended it and my mom and I have different tastes when it comes to literature. But she insisted that I read it, so I did. I loved the book. It is a nice escape after a hectic day. I have just started on the 3rd book of the series. I've had a yearning to visit a small town in the mountains since I have started reading these books."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I began reading The Mitford Years first with mild pleasure, then skepticism, and at last, full-throttle enthusiasm. Yes, Mitford is a romantic ideal. Towns like this surely exist, but most of us don't live in them. We live in cities or suburbs besieged by traffic, development, crime, and dysfunctional or anonymous neighbors. Mitford is a welcome vacation, and that's exactly the perspective that allowed me to enjoy the series whole-heartedly. I've read my share of dark fiction, and I believe such writing has something important to show us, but why do we tend to treat the negative stuff as &quot;real&quot; literature and dismiss inspiring fiction as fluff? What's more, few novels include characters who participate in organized religion, and if they do, they are portrayed either as charicatures, zealots, or angst-ridden doubters who finally must reject their religious beliefs. Only rarely do we encounter characters who seem to weave their religious beliefs almost seamlessly into daily life. Even if I don't live in Mitford, I do know many, many people who would fit right in, and I like to think they would enjoy a Mitford vacation as much as I have."},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"I was laying in bed one night with my mom. We were both reading. My mom was reading &quot;At Home In Mitford&quot; Suddenly she started to laugh out loud. I asked her what was so funny and when she explained, I started laughing too. I asked her if I could borrow the book when she was done. Normally I don't read adult books, my being only eleven, but I must say that this is possibly one of the best books I've ever read - right up there with Harry Potter! I could not put the book down! I took it too Indiana with me. I finished it there but left it with my grandma so she could read it! Every time I picked up the book, I began a new trip to Mitford. In Mitford I found a place where I could go in times of sadness (as I said, parts of the book made me laugh out loud), when I was in search of a break from my little brother, or just to have some fun. I loved Father Tim's character and Dooley's &quot;proper English&quot;. Sometimes, it seemed as though the people would jump right out of the page and start acting right in front of me! The description was that vivid! I have also read &quot;A Light in the Window&quot; but I have to say, the first one was better. I've just started &quot;These High Green Hills&quot; and I say,&quot;Keep 'em comin' Ms. Karon!&quot;"},{"Title":"At Home In Mitford (The Mitford Years #1)","review":"This book is truly an escape to another time when things were more pleasant!
