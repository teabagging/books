This book had a few unrealistic parts and was not always practical, but it did have a pretty good plot line. I did not like the way Bronte made her characters so naive and how she made them have no common sense. I am glad I read this book and would recommend it to other people if they like confusing love stories about people who don't like each other. DWright"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"While reading Wuthering Heights, I found myself thinking how strange somethings can be in this world. Like the idea of marrying your own cousin was something i thought of as nasty, and would never happen. But after reading this book my views chang, but I still find it wrong. The book starts off slow and boring, but the middle of the book gets alot better. The love that Catherine and Heathcliff have for each other is something almost magical. But then the book has a cruel plot in which they never get a chance to get married, or really a chance at love. Like when Catherine quotes &quot;I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again:&quot; (Bronte 74-75). This love story ends in a cruel twist of fate for them, but Heathcliff plans revenge after he can't get his love. So for the rest of the book you get a chance to witness Heathcliff's evil heart at work, and his revenge on the Earnshaw's and Linton's."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte contains a complex, confusing and unreal story. Bronte begins with the end of the book, thus making readers think backwards in sequence. Also, Catherine and young Catherine become harder to tell apart as the story progresses. Bronte refers to both girls as &quot;Catherine&quot; and &quot;Cathy.&quot; Another baffling subject, the coincidence that the second generation coincides with the first. Catherine, Heathcliff and Edgar's relationship corresponds to Cathy, Hareton and Linton's relationship. Also, was it per chance that young Cathy's birth and Catherine's death lie on the same day? Bronte utilizes the first generation to model the second, making the story predictable and not interesting. Carrie Chandler"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights, to me, portrays a sorrowful story that shows the thin line between love and hate. Throughout the book the characters would reveal their love for one another; then all of a sudden, they would betray their loved ones. Like when Linton would express his love and gratitude for Cathy, and then quickly despise her when Heathcliff tells him she only wants him for his money. Heathcliff's attitude also changes. His impressions and appearance seemed very nice to young Cathy at first when they met at Wurthering Heights (199). Heathcliff also kidnaps her and Nelly, and strikes her (247). I also believe that Heathcliff did not start all of the problems. Cathy brought her woeful death upon own herself. She did not follow her heart; she should have married Heathcliff instead of Edgar. Isabella shouldn't have been so dumbfounded about marrying Heathcliff so quickly without really getting to know his true personality. For a while the book seemed kind of dull, and did not make any sense at first, but once I reached the apex of the story it seemed to get pretty interesting. JR.WBHS"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really don't see what has made Wuthering Heights a &quot;classic.&quot; I'll admit Cathy and Heathcliff's love was probably the strongest love I've ever read about. However the hate and darkness in the book pretty much drowns out the love story. Most of Heathcliff's hate is derived from Catherine's love but most of his actions are very severe. I believe the reason he acts like he does after Catherine's death is because he is without his &quot;soul.&quot; Death pretty much occupied the whole book. Almost everyone died and it caused people to act in strange ways. As strong as Cathy and Heathcliff's love was, I believe that Bronte's obsession with death and revenge drowned out this love. Again I pose the question, Why on earth is this book a &quot;classic&quot;?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon reading Wuthering Heights, I rate the book a 3 from 1 to 10. Such a low score relates to the long, drawn out wordiness on insignificant parts to the story. Over exaggeration of minor details really confused me in this book. The book made me think that a long, drawn out explanation of a minor detail such as Mr. Lockwood's description of Catherine's library as &quot;... select book choices,..&quot; delapidated &quot; (16) was important but as I completed the book, I realized it was just another attempt to go on and on. I feel if this book became a play people would say it is melodramatic and boring. The plot did grab my attention ( I must admit), and for that reason I gave the book a 3 instead of a 1. However, I think Bronte really &quot;messed up&quot; a developed, intringuing story line with insignificant details that gave readers the idea that the point contained a hidden point that one might find later in the book or one people needed to know. I mean, Who cares how Catherine kept her book collection. The story contains a completely different plot!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Never watch The Titanic again.

The book grabbed my attention immediately and was an easy read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I had to read this in high school (16 years ago), and I remember it being a much easier read at the time than it is now (for me). Although I love Bronte's extreme detail of setting the scene or describing the garb that her characters wear -- the old English writing is definitely something that took me a bit of getting used to. I re-read several parts til I absorbed what what being said or who was saying it.The story of Heathcliff and Catherine is definitely an amazing one, and was the reason I chose to do this re-read. With so many references in 'Fifty Shades of Grey', and that character's love for old English writing I chose to re-read this classic & keep it on my main page of my Amazon Kindle for easy access to read it, refer to it & mull over.It is a classic re-read, but if you are not used to the old English you may want to use the dictionary on the Kindle and look up some of the 'lingo' that the Brontes were so famous for using.All in all, it is a great book with deep rooted characters, unrequited love, anger, and jealousy -- and much more that I do not want to give away. For that, you need to acquire this classic for yourself!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Violent, gory, sexy, passionate, wild, untamed, exhausting, tragic, sick, but ultimately forgiving. And written by a parson's daughter living in the barren Yorkshire moors.How much of this novel is sexual fantasy and how much is experience? It's impossible to tell. There's no explicit sex in the novel, but we can say it's nothing but implicit sex. It's not about love or hate, it's about two people who've made themselves into a single being. Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights can neither love or hate her adopted brother Heathcliff: he and she have become part of each other, in their soul and in their flesh.If Wuthering Heights has a tragic element, it's not a conventional one: the moral of the tale isn't that one should resist one's animal impulses. Quite the reverse: Catherine and Heathcliff are one and the tragedy unfolds because of Catherine's decision to disregard her irrational but unbreakable bond with Heathcliff. Just as Catherine should have embraced a life with Heathcliff, maybe we should embrace our animal nature.Emily Bront is a woman of her time and her prose reflects this, yet there are scenes of intense physical violence. Where could a sheltered young Victorian woman have gotten the experience to write of these feelings and actions with such authencity?One of my very favourite novels. I first read it over 25 years ago, in Yorkshire as it happens, and I just read it for the fourth time, again in Yorkshire. A true work of art.Vincent Poirier, Montreal"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There was Linton sucking on his candy as a weak teenager with confused alliances. It is moments of surreal force like these that make people love or hate Wuthering Heights.With so many reviews, I'll add a little. This is fiction to the extreme so WARNING reading W.H is like stepping into a giant colorful painting with abstract and realistic elements.Heathcliff (contrary to popular belief) is not the star of the show. Every character is allowed to bloom to the extreme and make you wonder if they lived to the full.Even with five stars over this review...I have an issue with the book it was and is still unsettling. In fact almost everyone except the two narrators...a tenant at the Grange and the housekeeper Ellen Dean...have either horrid language and seemingly do not care about their lives or anyone else's or they have other huge irksome problems.Also...the free Kindle ed. does not include translations of phrases or any special introductions or additional information."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In Wuthering Heights, two families are caught in a destructive cycle of love, hate, and retribution. At the center of it is Catherine, a proud, headstrong girl, and Heathcliff, an orphan adopted into Catherine's family. Catherine and Heathcliff are both romantic iconoclasts who defy convention. They prefer roaming the wild moors over the life of high society. They enjoy mischief and detest christian morality. Their love is one of passion and rebellion. Even though they are very immature, they are admirable in that they are true to their own natures and want to live lives of joy and ecstasy. In one insightful passage that illuminates the theme of the whole book, Catherine says that she dreamed that she was in Heaven, and she was so unhappy there that she begged to come back to earth. The angels kicked her out and she wept with joy to come back to Wuthering Heights, her home on the wild Yorshire moor. Even though these characters behave despicably, we can't help sympathize with their humanity.Wuthering Heights is a criticism of Christian ideology. Catherine and Heathcliff are full bodied, complex, emotional characters. They are both repeatedly referred to as wicked, devilish, heathen, selfish, coldhearted. But they are also genuine people with the courage to live in accordance with their convictions. It is this quality that makes the two \\"good\\" characters, Edgar and Isabella Linton, fall in love with them. Edgar and Isabella, raised as gentry, live as they have been dictated to. They are irrisistably attracted to these two individuals who don't care what society thinks of them. Heathcliff and Catherine glow with pride, passion, strength and health. While Edgar and Isabella are hollow and anemic. The other Christian character, Joseph, is hypocritical and debased.The landscape of Yorkshire is a character in itself described with immense appeal. In the winter, it is bleak and wild and hauntingly beautiful; with wind that moans with the voices of the past and moonlight that sparkles on the snow. In the spring and summer it is halcyon and exuberant, bursting with flowers, birds, breezes and green growth. We understand why Catherine and Heathcliff love it so much. The name Heathcliff itself references the heath of the moor and the cliffs that the two children were so attracted to. Heathcliff is the embodiment of the moor, the earth, and all that is real and sensible, all that Catherine loves and dies to be separated from. Wuthering Heights exalts the earthly realm over the heavenly realm that conventional ideology would have everyone aspire to.As sensitive as Wuthering Heights is towards these flawed characters, it is also a cautionary tale. The love that sustained so much joy and passion in Catherine and Heathcliff is also a love that destroys them. Catherine marries a wealthy, kind man who loves her, but she cannot look past his dull exterior to love him. She is consumed with her obsession with Heathcliff, wastes away pining, and breaks the heart of those who love her. Heathcliff, embittered by Catherine's choice, wrecks havoc by plotting an elaborate revenge on the second generation. His love for her fuels his hatred of everyone else who has a claim to her. While the story could be interpreted as the tragedy of thwarted love, it could also be said that had that love been consummated, it would have been just as destructive, just as dysfunctional. While Catherine and Heathcliff believe themselves to be deeply in love, it can hardly be called love when all they do is hurt each other and make everyone around them miserable and wretched.Wuthering Heights is an incredible novel. The language is resonant and fluid, the characters are complex and vividly brought to life, the atmosphere is masterfully invoked. It is discomfiting, moving, and challenging. It is really an ingenious piece of social commentary revealed through a love story. It is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The old classic that I had never read but have seen the movie many times.

It's quite slow-paced, as you might expect from such an old novel, but it's never boring.[SPOILER ALERT]It seems like pretty much everyone dies in it, it's natural death after natural death; the story would have been very different with modern medecine! It's easy to like characters one minute and detest them the next, plus it's quite difficult to grasp who is who initially; don't make the same mistake as me and look at a family tree because it sort of spoils the story when you find out who gets married etc.[END OF SPOILERS]It's a good story, and the final few chapters are very intense and fast-paced. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a classic and introduces so many themes that are prevalent in literature today but I find myself disliking the novel itself. Bronte tells the story of a man who is renting a room and learns the story of the man who owns the house and the neighboring property, Mr. Heathcliff. This may be the only novel that I've ever read in which every single main character is utterly unlikable: from Heathcliff who is cruel and sadistic to everyone except Catherine, who is shallow to her husband Edgar, who is proud and weak, to his sister Isabella, who is naive and immature, to Hindley, who is nothing more than a vengeful little boy who grows into a vengeful man. His son, Hareton is tolerable though he is depicted as stupid. Then we come to Cathy who is a spoiled little brat. Even the man original narrator, Lockwood, comes across as pretentious. The only redeeming character in my eyes was Nelly, who is flawed but loving. That being said, the novel is so well written and presents it's characters in such a light that you feel like you know them. The prevailing message seems to be that no matter how fall someone has fallen, they can redeem themselves with love. Not sure that I believe this but I can't deny that Bronte work prevails as a masterpiece of literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book as a teenager and felt so accomplished for making it through, what I considered to be, a very archaic book.After having just finished reading the book again, I was very torn about how \\"good\\" I thought this books was.

I also realized that as a teenager I saw this as a fictional tale and probably thought, naively, that people as cruel as Heathcliff just don't exist in this world... Why ever would a person spend all their energy and machinations on making everyone around them miserable? Indeed, why.I gave this book a four star rating, not because the tale was enjoyable, but because it offered so many epiphanies on how I regarding the experience of reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a fabulous book for a fabulous price. cant go wrong!

It is no wonder that during the life of the author, she never received the satisfaction of knowing what a classic she had written - it was only after the reprinting of her novel, posthumous, that Emily Bronte received the praise that she deserved, for a book that deserves much more than a praise.I read \\"Wuthering Heights\\" often - not because I believe in I believe in the dramatics of love, but simply because I believe in it. Love, that is. Wuthering Heights is full of characters who are morally bankrupt, and despicable to the core - but you cannot help but feel for them anyway. One moment you feel sorry for Heathcliff, and with the turn of a page, are filled with such hatred for him. But that an author can create such convincing characters, that they can evoke such emotions in you, is what makes this book so special. For me it's a lesson, that when one finds love, one must look past the color, the creed, the caste and the credentials to embrace what you have found - for if you let it go, you will break your own heart, and in the process, bring pain to all hearts enjoined with yours. A classic tale, about love, friendship and betrayal - a must read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The basic premise is about two children growing up in the same house- clever and mischievous Cathy and enigmatic Heathcliff. They soon go beyond normal sibling interaction and enter an obsessive an disturbing love affair with one another, but due to Heathcliff's status as an adopted street arab and Cathy's death, they can never be together. Gradually, Heathcliff is driven to near insanity, and the story continues from the eyes of Nellie, a maid, and Cathy, the first Cathy's daughter.*** SPOILER ALERT***A little warning to anyone who was expecting a happy story- this isn't one. Cathy and Heathcliff's \\"love\\" can best be described as creepy attatchment, and the ending gave me nightmares for a week.That being said, there are some genuinely touching moments in Wuthering Heights, such as when Cathy 2 makes peace with her cousin and tries to teach him how to read. Cathy 1's and Heathcliff's childhood interactions are also sweet.But at first glance, there is little that's likeable. The characters are fairly unpleasant and cruel to one another. What redeems them is that they're interesting; even if you were rooting for their deaths at the end (hi, Heathcliff), you still want to know what happens to them.What really makes this book soar is a gorgeous and dark writing style. Emily Bronte manages to pull off a very difficult piece with flying colors. The details make the book come alive and the sense of urgency was beautiful. It's hard to describe, but there's a dreamy lyrical quality, almost as though you're in a seductive nightmare. What makes me give her even more props is that everything about Wuthering Heights is balancing delicately- a wrong chapter or so and the story would collapse.The overall method of telling the story is also great. Told through Nellie's careful first person PoV, Heathcliff and Cathy are allowed to remain enigmatic and seem as though there's more than what meets the eye, like a veil over everything.I would recommend this, but not for most children. It's more of a psychological thriller than anything else, but wonderfully written and a compelling story with beautiful development."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i was made to read this in high school and hated every word of it...how could i like a book where i despised every character, right?? then i read it again in my mid 20's and i still despised every character...but absolutely loved it! it's now one of my fave novels and i've read it many times over. i think the style and subject matter is a little beyond the reach of most teens and it's a shame it's offered to them as it has probably put many off trying many of the classics later in life."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Such a dark love story that started from two people but affected everyone around them.

The way Emily Bronte wrote of the unending love between Heathcliff and Catherine is captivating, especially when you read the story of Ms. Bronte and how she came to create the story. A must read for all lovers of classic novels!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The book, Wuthering Heights is a classic love story set in the time period of the 1700s. Emily Bronte focuses on the sad and tragic unforbbiden love between Catherine Earshaw and Healthcliff as well as the even more heartbreaking story of Catherine Linton. The story of the two young women is told by Ms. Nelly Dean, who is relating the story to a character by the name of Mr. Lockwood, who lives on the propety owned by Heathcliff, the major antagonist throughout the book.The setting of the book is set during the 17-1800s, which is stated by Mr. Lockwood in the beginning of the story. He starts out by describing his \\"days as a tenant at Thrushcross grange in the year 1801\\" (chapter 1, page 1). Healthcliff is relating his adventure to Nelly Dean telling her that he and Catherine wanted to get \\"a glimpse of the grange lights,\\" (chapter 6, pg 46). This is a clue because grange lights are lanterns and it shows that electricity was not invented just yet, so it can't be anything after the 1800s. Another clue came from Heathcliff again when he states, \\"or reading sermons, and being catechized by their manservant, and set to learn a column of scripture names if they don't answer properly?\\", (chapter 6, pg 46). Religion was prominent all throughout Europe in this time era, so the setting is appearant in the beginning of the book.Conflict is a major reappearing event that is found throughout this entire novel. The first and the most significant is found in chapter 9, pg 78. \\"It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; and he shall never know how I love him...he's more myself than I am.\\" This is the beginning of the love triangle that develops because Catherina loves Heathcliff more than anything else in the world, but they can never be together, (while they're living). The next major conflict in the story arises from Catherine and Heathcliff's offspring. \\"And believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love...,\\" (chapter 24, pg 243). Linton's declaration of his love for the young Cathy is shown, which signifies the beginning of their love and the horrible revenge that is exacted on them by Heathcliff. The interesting and tragic conflict that occurs between Heathcliff and Catherine comes when she passes away from insanity and a broken heart. I adore the love between Heathcliff and Catherine, aside from the turmoil and havoc it brings. \\"She has disturbed me-incessantly-remorselessly-till yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil\\", (chapter 29, pg 275). This quote showed me something different. A conflict felt within Heathcliff's heart about loving Catherine and being haunted and agonized by her soul for 18 years while still loving her and withstanding the pain.Wuthering Heights was defnitely a book I'll always hold dear to my heart. Emily Bronte knows how to write an epic book that kept me raptured from beginning to the end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A young girl by the name of Emily Bronte delivered the world a story. Although 'love' is contained in all aspects of this book, this is not a love story. Wuthering Neights is the tragic and heartbreaking story of two lovers destroyed, and the outcomes that follow.From beginning to end, this novel was a page-turner for me. I simply did not want to put it down, and at times, I couldn't. We begin our story with Mr. Lockwood, a new tenant in the manor of Thrushcross Grange. Throughout the story, he writes in his diary, documenting the life of the inhabitants of Thrushcross Grange. Though Wuthering Heights is told through the viewpoint of more than one person, everything is documented by Mr. Lockwood himself. The setting is in England, 1801. If you are a fan of the Bronte sister's or tragic British literature, then this is the story for you! We have our resident of Wuthering Heights: grumpy Mr. Heathcliff, the landlord. The state of the manor is unacceptable to our newcomer, but he leaves determined to make a better impression than his first. His sights of the manor are atrocious as he describes it on page 9 as, \\"the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment, 'Go the to Deuce', even the gate over which leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words.\\" As rude as the atmosphere was, he returns for more, to write a story.On our new day, we meet Joseph, our very own illiterate and unhappy servant. Following, we meet the beautiful but pale young man, Catherine Linton and a young man by the name of Hareton Earnshaw. The names confuse Lockwood and he recognizes the tension and mystery within this 'family'. After a strange and frightening encounter that you will read about, he retreats to his home.Meeting up with his servants, we are introduced to Nelly, who has great ties with the residents of Thrushcross Grange. The story unfolds into a mess of tragic love, as we are whisked away to 20 years in the past, as told by Nelly. She was a servant to the Earnshaw family, whom we meet early on. There is Catherine, Hindley, Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw. One day, after returning from a long trip, Mr. Earnshaw brings back a boy rather than a souvenir. His name is Heathcliff and he is a gipsy boy from the streets of England who comes into their family, and leaves them changed forever. There is tension within this household, but only towards the two young boys who you will read about. Heathcliff and Catherine hit it off early and are the best of friends. However, society would have things different.As I mentioned before, this is not a love story. As we progress, we find this to be more of tragedy, failed love and revenge. So much evil doings and rebellion unfolds as you read on, that it will make your heart burst! Every harsh and cruel decision made through rude intentions causes you to be ripped apart, but it gets better! I cannot even put to words the way that Wuthering Heights will mess with your emotions, but it is definitely worth it! Catherine and Heathcliff find love, but the standards of the world would prove to be stronger than they could handle at such a young age. The bond they would create is soon left to wither away and haunt them forever. The legacy they leave is known by all. I encourage all readers to not underestimate the tragedy of these pages. It is gripping, heart-wrenching and unforgettable. It has personally moved me and I could not ask for more!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I have just finished reading Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte. It's probably safe to say that this was about the millionth time I have read this classic. Forget the Twilight Series and Edgar! When I was a teen, I thought it was all about Heathcliff's brooding devotion to Catherine even 20 years after her death. With that in mind, I was curious to reread Wuthering Heights now as a middle-aged mom. The verdict? Well, the dysfunction of the whole clan was a lot more uncomfortable for me than it was when I was younger, but overall it really is a great book and I still love it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Love It! If You only read one novel in a lifetime, make it Wuthering Heights. Plot, characters, set, scenery, romance, & mystery... Heathcliff is the greatest literary character of All Time!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To give \\"Wuthering Heights\\" some credit, the story and characters aren't half bad. The plot is interesting in and of itself, and the characters are all easily imagined if not terribly well-rounded (with the exception of Heathcliff, who can be appreciated fully when you consider both his cruelty and his motivation and origins). All in all, the material is promising.Unfortunately, the writing is so convoluted and verbose that you'd need a machete to ... your way through it. And \\"...\\" is an accurate verb; typically whole paragraphs and pages are filled with needless complications so that it's more like deciphering a code than reading a story. The sheer amount of effort that it takes to get very little payoff quickly breeds apathy. After a while, I didn't care who Catherine married or who was narrating or anything else.The book has some other flaws (most noticeably the use of death as a cheap plot device) but the writing's really what sinks the book. If you like slaving away for minimal payoff, this book's for you. Otherwise..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hands down, the worst novel that I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to settle an oddly masochistic wager with a family member. The characters are all contemptible, the writing dull, and the story inane. When it was over I had mixed feelings of relief (thank God it was over) and regret for wasting that much of my life on it. What a horrible, horrible novel. If there is such a thing as hell, for me, it would be an empty room with nothing but a copy of Wuthering Heights in it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must confess that I got kind of bored at the beginning of the book, I found it a little confusing but after reading some more pages I got the gist, maybe I'm wrong but it reminds me a little bit Lady Chatterley's Lover.I read the first chaptersin almost two weeks since I found it kind of hard to read, but there was a point when I just couldn't stop from reading it, I was so touched by the way Austen gave life to every single character.I'm looking forward to read more of this writer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The great tragedy of this book is that the author didn't kill off Catherine and Heathcliff MUCH SOONER. Then she might have been able to introduce alternate main characters who were actually interesting.Although given Emily Bronte's track record with the aforementioned losers, maybe populating her novels with characters that the reader would find interesting just wasn't her strong suit...."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've never before written a negative Amazon reader review. As an author, I know how much they can sting, and I try to limit myself to only reviewing books I've really enjoyed. However, since the author is long dead, I doubt I can hurt her feelings. And if by my words I can possibly prevent one other person from undergoing the suffering I've endured, I'll feel that my job here is done.I decided that at the age of 52, it was time I started reading some of the classics that I'd missed along the way. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE first, and though I found Ms. Austen's writing to be tedious, the book was mildly entertaining. I thought I'd try Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS next. I'd always heard how romantic the story was, and no less than three people, upon seeing me with the book, told me, \\"You'll love it! You'll absolutely love it!\\"Please tell me you're kidding.This book is wretched. Painful to a degree I've never before experienced. I've read books that put me to sleep, books I found impossibly dull, books I found too stupid for words. But I have NEVER hated a book so much in my life. The characters in their entirety don't possess a single redeeming value. They are miserable, obnoxious, hateful excuses for human beings. Even the DOGS are hateful. Why should I care what happens to any of these awful people? Why should I care if they've made themselves miserable through their own choices and then spend the rest of the book whining and complaining about how pathetic their lives are?I hadn't realized just how much I loathed them until halfway through the book, when a major character died, and all I could think was, \\"THANK GOD! THANK GOD!\\"And then, there's the dialect. Ah, the dialect! I could tolerate it if it was used sparingly. But when a certain character goes into a speech that lasts for half a page of small print, in a language that can only be described as Not Even Resembling English (yes, I know it's supposed to be Scottish), the result is unbearable pain. Every time this character speaks (which is, thankfully, not often), I find myself puzzling over his words in an attempt to translate them into something that seems even mildly coherent. Sometimes, it's possible to do this just by context. At other times, I shake my head in bewilderment and disgust and simply move on to a different page. Considering how slowly the story moves (is there a storyline? a point to all this suffering?), I could probably skip entire chapters and not miss anything.I'd also like to know where the romance is. Since everybody in this book seems to hate everybody else, with the notable exception of the uncouth monster, Heathcliff, and the spoiled-rotten, obnoxious Catherine, I can't fathom where that might lie. Am I too dense to understand? Or has the literary world been tricking us for 150 years, convincing the sheep of the world to follow along in praise of this \\"romantic\\" classic?I think I would rather have my fingernails pulled out forcefully, one at a time, than finish reading this book. I'm halfway through, and life is short. Am I really willing to spend that much more of my short time here on earth torturing myself just for the satisfaction of knowing I actually read the dreadful thing? I think not.I also think my foray into the classics has ended right here. I'm off to read some Robert Parker or Janet Evanovich. Maybe even some Jackie Collins. Anything to cleanse my palate of the terrible aftertaste of Heathcliff and Catherine.To each his own. I know there are people who rave about this book, people who love it. I'm glad somebody does. Every book deserves to be loved by somebody. But in this case, with this particular book, that somebody will have to be Somebody Else. Because it certainly isn't me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Far too drawn out, poorly written- Not at all engaging or otherwise, this book brings on suicidal tendancies to it's unfortunate readers.

I don't mean to sound sexist, it's just true. I've never met a woman who didn't love this book, And I've never met a man who liked it. I hated it. I won't say it was a bad book, because it's a classic, and the most you're allowed to say about a classic is that you didn't enjoy it, which I didn't. Sorry to say, this is the FIRST classic novel I've ever read that I didn't enjoy.

I enjoyed it greatly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is one of the true classic romantic novels for all time. Emily Bronte's novel was controversial at the time because of the lovers who defied social mores,and that Heathcliff was an anti-hero. It's the original gothic novel. Stephenie Meyer claims to be an heiress to Bronte,even having her heroine Bella read \\"Wuthering Heights\\",but can't hold a candle to the classic.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" has a simple premise. Catherine's father adopts a gypsy boy,Heathcliff. The two have a bond like brother and sister,but as they grow older it becomes more romantic. Catherine marries the gentle,kind,aristocratic Edgar despite the fact Heathcliff passionately desires her. Their love remains ambiguous. Did they have a mutual longing for death? Heathcliff is abusive to Catherine,avoiding her when she pines for him,wishes she were in Hell after she dies,and abuses his children. Did their love have a sexual element,making the lovers at the end unknowing half-siblings,the children of the same mother but different fathers? Some have argued that Cathy&Heathcliff;'s love is so metaphysical they never shared the bed,and that Cathy despises sex anyhow. Cathy's passion for the moors drives her to mental,then physical illness.\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is as beautiful and fierce now as it was back in the 19th century. Bronte powerfully evokes the wilderness,as well as the cruelty,obsession,and passion between her leads. The moors remain as wild today."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"i came across wuthering heights while i was reading the twilight series,specifically \\"eclipse\\" as it was mentioned in it..i was curious as to what the book was all about so i read it..in my opinion, it is tragically beautiful especially the catherine-heathclif's moments. true, both of them are horrible, horrible human being but when it comes to their relationship, you can't help but to root for them. One of my favourite part was when catherine was deciding whether or not to marry linton and had explained what heathcliff meant to her to her housekeeper. My favourite quotes from that part: \\"my great miseries in life has been heathcliff's\\", \\"he is more than myself than i am\\" and my favourite which was mentioned in eclipse, \\"if all else perished and he remains, i should still continue to be. but if all else remained and he were anihilated, the universe would turn into a mighty stranger\\"Another favourite part was when both of them were reunited before catherine died. there was a speck of humanity in them when they were reunited and you somehow forget how horrible they were.Another favourite part was when heathcliff learned that catherine died and the way he handled the news, it was devastating and for that moment, i feel sad for him and again, forget for a moment of how rude and vicious his character is. that one small paragraph was a mix of love and grieve all together which was written with so much power that I had to stop reading for a minute to digest it.the story is mostly about the consequences of the love between catherine and heathcliff..their love affected a lot of people and i guess it shows the dark side of love and obsession."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've tried to read a number of Classics, and usually think people must have been awfully bored before the electronic age to slog through them and enjoy it. This was the exception. These people are so weird (and savage) it's practically like reading science fiction. A fascinating, and compelling, glimpse at what life might have been like at one time, rather than the white-washed image we usually get -- spun to our current sensibilities."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what else to say beyond that. How can you not love a classic?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As an English teacher as well as parent to several kids having gone through high school, please recognize that boys (even Honors level students) are turned off to reading even such beloved novels as Wuthering Heights. Classic novels primarily about love and romance can be offered but should not be assigned to 15-year-old boys since, generally speaking, they are not interested in this type novel and tend to avoid reading it at all cost. There are so many wonderful novels (Of Mice and Men, Lord of the Flies, for example) that will engage even the most reluctant readers, and can be offered as a choice to the more girl-oriented classics. Teachers, please be conscious of assigning these books without offering an option. Otherwise they do the opposite of that which you hope to instill in them . . . deterrents to reading! To those choosing to read this book for its classic value, this version of Wuthering Heights is very reader-friendly. I liked it the best of the many versions, especially for younger readers."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good version, the whole book is there (some versions have made it two volumes) with space between chapters to write your notes. Short, concise and helpful notes on the themes and motifs in the front of the book.As for the book itself, it has old-fashioned language though it is poetic enough for anyone to enjoy. The tone is dark, but en-capturing and exiting on a social psychological level. It can teach you a thing or two about the effects society and upbringing have on people."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I didn't really like this book, because it was just boring, and I couldn't understand what they were really talking about. It just didn't interest me, and it was confusing. I didn't like the characters too much and didn't get them. I think this book could've been better, and I personally wouldn't want to read it again. I had a hard time getting into it, the whole time I was reading it. It was pretty boring."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just recently finished reading Wuthering Heights, and to be perfectly honest I have to say that it's a terrible story.The basic plot is centered around Mr. Lockwood and his visit to rural England and the house called Wuthering Heights where he is told the life story of a man named Heathcliff along with his love for Catherine, his hate for his bother (and his brother's son (Heraton) and his neighbors at Thruscross Grange and their son (Edgar) and their daughter (Isabella) [who he marries] and the son that he has with Isabella (Linton) and the extra hate that he gains when Edgar marries Catherine), and his story of revenge against the afore mentioned individuals who he hates.That brings us to the novel's problems. The true highlight of a novel is not its story, but rather its hidden significance, and while Wuthering Heights does bring out the extreme emotions that can be associated with love (i.e. passion, jealousy, spite), it does so in such a way that kills any male reader. It's true -for some reason, the ladies who read this book tend to like it much more than the guys.Perhaps the reason for this is the fact that the novel, with all deep and meaningful thoughts written in, reads like a victorian era after school special. Catherine totally had a crush on Heathcliff, and Heatcliff liked him back, but Catherine started hanging out with the wrong crowd -Isabella and Edgar. After a while Catherine just didn't want to hang out with Heathcliff, and one night she got so out of hand that she totally made out with Edgar! Heathcliff finds out and totally gets made, but he moved to another school for a year so it was okay then. Besides, his brother was mean to him. The next year he totally surprised everyone when he came back! Catherine was soooo regretful that she made out with Edgar, and she wanted Heathcliff back -but Isabella had a crush on him too! They totally got in a cat fight that day, saying how much they both hate Heathcliff. The problem was that Heathcliff was soooo made at Catherine (still) but had a crush on her (still) so he totally made out with Isabella! Then Isabella dies, then Edgar dies, then Heathcliff brother dies, then a few people get married until Heathcliff finally bites the dust.You're probably thinking that I have blown the story out of proportion, but the sad truth is that I haven't. In actuality, Heathcliff and Catherine do fall in love, but they never admit it to each other -they always bicker and argue and yell about how much they hate each other until Catherine dies. Just like how middle school kids will talk about how much they like so-and-so, but not to that individul. In actuality, Catherine does marry Edgar, Heathcliff does run away, and on his return Isabella does admit that she has fallen in love with him, Heathcliff does marry Isabella for revenge, and the rest of the story is then about people dying and Catherine's daughter Catherine and how she was forced to marry Heathcliff's son so that Heathcliff would get extra land when his kid died.Touching love story, isn't it?While some might call it a wild romance and a true testament to our inability to control the strongest of human emotion, I find that the love story is very elementary (on the account that it really does read like an afterschool special) and at the same time blown up -almost like Emily Bronte was a love-starved victorian era woman longing for a romance in her life (which she was) and the rest of the story was just a simple story where people are mean to each other and then die.Sorry Emily Bronte!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am aware that this is not a novel meant to put a smile on your face or make you think of flowers and rainbows etc. But I was unable to get any enjoyment out of this book because the characters are so completely ridiculous in their courses of actions. Granted, the theme of the book is how hatred, jealousy, envy, and the like can overcome a person's soul, but she took it too far. The overblown &quot;love&quot; between the characters would invariably be followed by an act of viscious cruelty. Many of the good reviews for this book are from high school students. The reason most of them liked it, in my mind, is because they are immature and have idealized images of the emotions described in the book and how people would react to those emotions. We all know what it is like to love, to hate, to lose, but even under the most painful situations no one would act the way these characters did."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know this may sound disrespectful to all of you connoisseurs of fine Brittish literature, but I hated Wuthering Heights.

Funnily enough, it's not as bad as it sounds."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because it was a 'classic' and I can't quite see what the big deal is. Number one, isn't it supposed to be a 'tragic love story' between Cathy and Heathcliff? Well, Cathy is his daughter in law and CATHERINE is the one he loves.How can it be a love story when they are practically brother and sister and never showed each other much affection anyway?? And why does everyone die from catching a cold? Living in England ain't that bad and also I could not understand ONE WORD of what Joseph was saying! The narrative in this book also confused me a bit.I'd start a chapter believing Nelly to be narrating only to find out half way through that it was actually Mr Lockwood. Also what really confused me was Who was Ellen? Was it another name for Nelly Dean?? This book was quite clumsy,and how did Emily Bronte turn a useless story into a 400 page novel? The only decent part of the book was when Catherine is dying and Heathcliff holds her and actually kisses her.That is the only part which shows their true feelings. Also Nelly was a back stabber - Every secret she was told by Catherine and Cathy and even Isabella, she tells someone else!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Did not like this at all. The fact that it was short was the only reason I finished it. I am not too sure what the appeal of this book is to others."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is easy to understand why Emily Bront's first (and only) novel was ill-received upon its first publication. Perhaps the ultimate Gothic novel, Wuthering Heights is a far cry from the simple tale of ill-starred lovers one might expect from the pen of a Bront. Dark, sordid, even vulgar at times, the story of anti-hero Heathcliff - a gypsy child adopted, but never accepted, by the Earnshaw family of Wuthering Heights - teems with all the basest passions of mankind.Befriended only by the younger Earnshaw child, a girl named Catherine, Heathcliff grows to hate all those who dare tread upon him because of his low birth. He grows obsessively attached to the beautiful, wild-spirited Catherine, and when her pride forces her to marry another rather than stoop to Heathcliff's own station in life, he begins plotting the grand revenge that will send all of them to their graves.Few - if any - likable characters populate this book. It is a tale of love, but it is not an uplifting tale. It is a story of cruelty, selfish passion, vengeance, and finally madness. Despite its depressing theme, however, Bront's exceptional writing raises it to the deservedly lofty height of a classic.Told mostly through the first-person narration of housekeeper Ellen Dean, the story progresses through Heathcliff's tormented childhood, Catherine's marriage to Edgar Linton, Heathcliff's elaborate revenge against the child of Catherine and Edgar's marriage, and finally his strange departure from the world of the Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Seriously hated every page of this book. Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities. It must have read like absolute trash in the time period it was written, and still does today. I fail to see how anybody could find this story romantic. If a man told me that this book epitomizes his idea of romance, I would run for the hills and never look back. I honestly can't waste any more time on this book, even to write a lengthier review."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I received this book in a timely matter and it was also in great shape and very clean.

I was pleased to see it arriving on time, but I was slightly sad to see that the font was not what I expected. I usually like smaller, more squarish words, but the words in the book are rather large, sort of like large-print, and the shapes were sort of vertical-retangular. It doesn't have anything to actually do with the content of the book (which by the way, is beautiful. Who doesn't love a tale of people going insane?), but I wish that the publishers had put a nicer font in it.I'd give it a 5, but I really sort of felt disappointed over the words."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I kept waiting for this book to win me over, but it never did. I get it that Heathcliff and Catherine had a deep, passionate love for each other. But neither is a lovable character and I can't imagine falling in love with either of them. I wonder if this is a book that does not translate well from the era in which it was written to the modern day. (I think Heathcliff would be reported to child protective services in today's world.)

I know it's supposed to be a classic, but there are hundreds of really good books in this world, and this just isn't one of them.We always try to compare the Bronte girls to Jane Austen, but each of the Bronte sisters published her first book in 1847, and Jane Austen's books were published between 1811 and 1817, so they aren't really contemporaries. Austen's books really describe everyday family concerns, mostly relating to marriage. Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights both described families and their connections, but the stories were more out of the ordinary; these are almost more like soap operas than like Austen novels. This book contains some references to a ghost and lots of cruelty and intrigue, none of which exist in Austen's books.Another huge difference between this book and Austen's is that none of the main characters are likeable: Hindley was mean to Heathcliff, Heathcliff is a jerk to everyone, Catherine and Cathy are both a little spoiled, Hareton is proud and rude, and Joseph is just annoying. There are only three characters who aren't awful, and one dies pretty quickly.English teachers will probably still force their students to read this, but I'll stick with Austen myself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My only complaint with this Oxford version is that the explanatory notes are all at the very end of the book, not on the individual pages (ie, footnotes).

'Wuthering Heights' is amazing. The story is intense and passionate. It makes a bold statement on bi-racial love, class and cultural barriers, and revenge. My most favorite character is the most evil of them all - Heathcliff. His story just shows how much damage resentment, pride and revenge can do to a human being. It is a timeless lesson. The only negative of this book is that the relationship between Catherine, the younger and Hareton feels underdeveloped. It just happens too quickly. Otherwise, I think the ending is appropriate. The younger characters don't repeat the mistake of their elders. Too bad they're cousins. It gives the story a twisted, perverted edge. In the end, though, this book is most certainly worth the read. The story is captivating, suspenseful and intense. When you read it, you don't know what's going to happen next. You just want to keep reading to find out. A genuine treat. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-written book. The style and language are impressive. However, this book is not for the faint-hearted. It was written as a gothic novel and is faithful to its genre. I honestly felt very depressed and angry at several of the characters throughout the course of the book. It is valuable to increase the reader's awareness of English literature, but if the object of one's reading is pleasure, I would recommend reading a book by either of her sisters, Anne or Charlotte."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book because I thought it would further my knowledge in vocabulary and because my mother absolutely loved this book.

(This goes for all the other \\"authors\\" on DTPAmazon that are selling this eBook here.)This book deserves all 5 stars, but the fact that they are selling it for a profit, brings it down to one star (I would have put zero, but it wouldn't let me).As soon as I can get my hands on a computer document for this book, I will be putting up on the Kindle store for FREE!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If you had a feeling that this book was written a long time ago, well, you're right! The novel, Wuthering Heights by Emile Bronte, is along the lines of most romance/drama novels out there. It has a very familiar story and plot twits that will not keep the reader occupied. When I tried to invision the settings and characters all that I could invision is a grey bloob with generic settings and overly used characters. The same generic plots may suit some people fine but it seems to me that the average reader may want to move onto something alittle bit more innovative and interesting.Now, onto the characters. The three main characters in the beginning of the book are Heathcliff, Catherine, and Edgar. Heathcliff is a poor waif that has been friends with Catherine seince they were little children about the age of 6 and is now madly in love with Catherine. Secondly, Catherine has always loved heathcliff but her greed gets in the way of thier love often. Edgar, who is ALSO in love with Catherine, is a very rich and well educated individual. As the plot continues Catherine marries Edgar for his money, not doing what her heat deisred by marrying Heathcliff, which turns out to be her biggest mistake.Although this book has its \\"up's\\", it also has a large share of \\"down's\\". And the lacklust enviorments dont help one bit. The lack of plausable discription takes its toll on this could be great story. At one point in the book while discribing a trellus of flowers it was depicted as follows: \\"I noticed that there were flowers surrounding the barn.\\". Not to be rude... but... What kind of barn was it? was it old, or new, or red, or green? Flowers? What kind? What color? This very bland discription of what MAY be a older barn that MAY have help horses, and that MAY have had flowers the MAY have been yellow creats no mental image of the area that MAY exist. Wuthering Heights was once descibed as a gloomy building. I mean, excuse me? A gloomy building? Is it 2 stories high, or maby 3? What color is it? Surroundings?Over all the only thing that this book did for me is show me how NOT to write a book. I would not recommend this book for anyone unless you have read EVERY OTHER BOOK in the world. The only reason that this book did not get 1 star is because it is not a total loss of reading. It does have its good points. I would like to talk more about this book but I am pressured for time at the moment. In conclusion I wouldn't reccomend this book and think that it is almost a waste of time. If you are extreemly into classic liturature then go pick this novel up. But besides that then no."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This review is on the \\"other\\" Wuthering Heights Penguin Classics edition (Corot's \\"Gust of Wind\\" on the cover), 1995, reprinted with a new Introduction, Chronology and Further Reading 2000, Reissued with revisions and a new Preface 2003.Forgive me as I have read only 38 pages. But I find it necessary to say now it has been an extremely frustrating experience. The novel is oddly laid out, with tricks of the flashback filling in details that should have been straightforwardly presented at the beginning, such as WHO IS MRS HEATHCLIFF? Honestly, I went back and scanned over the first 38 pages several times and just could not figure out who she was, despite consulting other helps. Was she (is she) Heathcliff's wife, his son's wife, some other wife? Heathcliff says she is my daughter-in-law but then it is stated later his only son died. WHAT? Maybe the \\"Harleton Earnshaw\\" is an adopted son. Some of the characters have the same name or nickname such as CATHERINE versus CATHY. There's another Cathy (Linton) that is different from CATHERINE EARNSHAW but CATHERINE is also called Cathy, which just causes unnecessary confusion and is indicative of slipshod writing.And then there's the ghost story and the dreamscape which is a cheap trick (many movies include the nightmare scene you think is real but the oh so clever movie scriptwriters cause the malignant balloon to pop, the protagonist waking up! and you are tricked once again). At least I am thankful the local Yorkshire \\"Wuthering\\" dialect is not overused, but thankfully there ARE frequent footnotes you'll have to look up to make any sense out of some of the text and dialogue. Perhaps the book will improve; I'll be glad to report on it if it happens."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought this as one of my collection of Classics.

It was a fairly easy read, and the English was not hard for me at all. I did refer to the notes at the end of the book but for the most part it was stuff I already knew, which surprised me. This isn't a book that shows people always making the best and right choices in life. Over and over everyone makes the worse possible choice, choosing to be evil rather than good.

One can read this novel over and over, and still not be sure of Emily Bronte's intentions (btw, she had a wonderful, witty style). She seems to have been portraying the detrimental effects of social class rigidity (the mal-treatment of the waif Heathcliff, ideas of what constituted \\"proper behavior\\" for girls/women, among many other things), of violence on children, and of poor parenting.One problem with the book is the all-too-convenient (and nearly perfect) character of Nelly the Narrator. She is the most likeable character in the story but not very realistic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Before posting my review, I always read several other reviews. I swear, some people would write a review that says, &quot;drinking water makes my mouth wet&quot; and then give water one star. The Victorian novel typically isn't your light hearted, Erma Bombeck-ish literature. Yes...it is dark, brooding, mysterious, and long. It is supposed to be that way! I think it is sad that Emily Bronte died at such a young age, leaving only this one novel. In my opinion, the Victorian novel is the pinnacle of great literature and Wuthering Heights is among the best.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the language of Joseph was too difficult to understand. It took great patience for me to &quot;translate&quot; those passages. Bronte obviously wanted to describe that character by his speech and it was very effective, but it was too much."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a good book and another one I had to read for senior english in high school..It had a good plot and a captivating love story between Cathy and Heathcliff....The action went at a good pace and WH was a page turner for me...good job Bronte!

I would recommend this book to everyone that likes classics and love stories"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte should be on the next Oprah. There is so much love and deception in this book it would make a great topic. This is the second time I have read this book the first time was in high school and I hated the book. It was partly to do with all the Cathy's. Once you get passed who is who in the book and you understand the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff you begin to understand the book better. I found that is easier to map out the families so I knew who was who and what family they belonged to. This is truly a great novel of love and deception and is now off my bad list and on my good list."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a shame Emily Bronte died so young. Her novel is fantastic. The characters may be hard to accept for someone who lives in middle america suburbia and thinks no evil exists. This book deals with love, jealousy, revenge, hatred, dueling neighbors, and more. This novel is a must read for a lover of the classics. ... I am not going to recap the story as many as done, I would just like to say if you love a torn romance novel, this one is a must."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic book that I wanted in my collection.

You really feel what the characters feel. You get frustrated for them. You pull for them when you really shouldn't. You want it to work out for them even though you know it's impossible.

I have a very short attention span and have always had difficulty with the verboseness of 19th century literature. But I was finally required to read this for a class so I was left with no choice.I am incredibly grateful I took that class. Once I got through chapter 1, I could not put this book down. Bront has a way of making your emotions go to war over even the most wicked characters. Wuthering Heights is daring, disturbing, and captivating. The psychology in this book is extraordinary and the plot will have you hooked.It is rare for a book to wrap up so flawlessly that you're left 100% satisfied, but Wuthering Heights was that book for me. Even my most cherished stories left me disappointed in some way or another. I couldn't describe the feeling I had when I finished reading Wuthering Heights. It really will test you, but if you want a story that doesn't play it safe, I say start reading this as soon as you can."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Classic story, love it each time I read it.

The book shipped to me so fast and I have already read it. It is so great I couldn't put it down. Well worth the price, this is a great buy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is not a love story. It is about all consuming passion. Anyone who says otherwise fails to understand the true meaning of the novel. I'm not going to waste time stating the general plot premise. This story is a classic and the relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is well known.Wuthering Heights is about classicism, torture and religion. Heathcliff is a representation of the devil. The entire story focuses on getting into Heaven or Hell and being smiled upon by providence. The love between Cathy and Heathcliff is the quintessential abusive relationship. The main characters are not likable; they are repulsive and cruel. The estate of Wuthering Heights (and by virtue of its name) is the focal point of the ever changing social dynamics (from Heathcliff and Catherine to their respective children).It sounds like I hated this book but in fact I loved it! It shows the raw and sadistic elements of human beings and the need for kindness and compassion. The writing is exceptionally eloquent, although it takes the reader forty pages to get caught up in the characters. Wuthering Heights is a moving masterpiece. Please read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I accept that it is one of the great books of all time but I find it too dark, too depressing, too bleak... I cannot rejoice in a love that is so destructive that it cares not for what happens to those around it, it merely obsesses about its own gain. Yes, beautifully written and constructed and I've had to read it a couple of times for various studies over the years, but I find life has enough problems so I turn to romance novels for a feeling of warmth and a brief feeling that somewhere love could be beautiful, not something you get from Wuthering Heights. The hopelessness of so many of the characters makes me uneasy and I'm left feeling as though those cold winds from those hills are blowing through me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a well-structured, inspiring literary classic that is very deserving of its place. I found it to be a little slow to begin, and a bit hard to follow, but it picks up fairly quickly. The story is partly love story and partly tragedy. All the tragedy that occurs in the novel makes the reader feel a little depressed at times, but it is well worth it for the ending. Heathcliff is an unlikeable character initially, but as the story unfolds I can almost be sympathetic towards him. In the beginning Heathcliff appears selfish and greedy without cause, but his behavior is not unjust. True, he is still vengeful and unlikeable, but at least he had a reason. The characters portray the downside of humanity, the not-so-good aspect of ourselves, but also explains the why not just the what. Emily Bront did a wonderful job of pointing out humanity's imperfections while still providing readers with a good story. Given the era she lived during, it seems to me that she was far ahead of her time when she wrote this. The novel holds great power over the reader, and once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down until I had finished it.I didn't particularly like the fact that almost all the characters were self-destructive, but I was pleased with how Hareton Earnshaw turned out. Of all of the characters, my least favorite was Joseph, who just seemed like a bitter old croak to me. Indeed, Lockwood says this of him, \\"Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy [...] vinegar-faced.\\"To me, a good story has emotion. Wuthering Heights left me feeling appalled at some of the actions the characters did, and saddened at times, and angry at others. The story is filled with vivid details and depth, making it an awesome read. It is a dark novel, but absolutely stunning. If you're looking for a fairy tale ending, you won't find it here, but that doesn't mean this isn't a good book. I highly recommend this, even if you only read it once."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is one of those authors who has an extreme grip on the English language, and I just loved having this on my Kindle to read at my leisure. This was a great buy for the price, and the fact is that Bronte is always good to read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book was hard to read. It is just amazing to think that a woman that died at 30 (just 2 years after this book was written) could come up with something like this. It makes you wonder what kind of life she had.I enjoyed the book but it took me several tries and quite a while to get through it.A classic worth reading but not easy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"this book is my favorite novel of all time, even though I have read virtually thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of novels of all types. I have several printings of this book, and have re-read it no less than 5 times, and I am never disappointed in the novel itself, although sometimes the edition might not be that great. I prefer a book as close to the original (unedited) as I can find, but don't mind extras included (articles, thoughts, essays, poems, etc), as long as the story itself is untampered with. this novel is about love, in all of its many forms, and about the vital importance of truly knowing yourself, and living your life accordingly. Not by other people's standards, nor how others might wish you to be, or even by who you may wish you were (instead of who you really are). If you do not do this, your life will always be a misery for you, and probably for everyone else around you as well. I have never found another novel to take it's place in my heart or my soul. I \\"am\\" this book, and it is me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've been reading and re-reading Wuthering Heights for 45 years, and each time I open this novel I find something new. From my first reading at the age of 12, I was and remain intrigued by the format of the novel: told by a rather dim-witted tenant intrigued by his decidedly odd neighbor/landlord named Heathcliff after he hears the tale from his housekeeper of Thrushcross Grange in remote Yorkshire during two lengthy stays. It's a complicated and elegant structure that serves the reader very well. As a 'tween I was captivated by the romance of Wuthering Heights. In my 20s and 30s it was Catherine Earnshaw Linton, who chose respectability over passion, who interested me. In my 40s, I looked again at Heathcliff, who is just about the most diabolical and evil man in literature. And now in my 50s I find myself especially interested in Catherine Linton Heathcliff, Heathcliff's chosen victim for his revenge of the supposed sins committed against him by her parents. She is the daughter of two weak parents: Catherine Earnshaw, whose mind and body broke before she reached the age of 20, and Edgar Linton, who lacked the physical vigor to fight Heathcliff or protect his daughter. Yet though Heathcliff chooses Catherine Linton Heathcliff for his revenge, she is no victim, and it is Heathcliff's inability to destroy her that leads to his ultimate despair and death. To many readers, the story of the second Catherine feels tacked on (and many movie versions leave it out altogether), but in it resides Emily Bronte's message. The second Catherine and second Hareton offer a new start for Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange with a new kind of masters -- not a pampered and privileged pair who've been protected from the harshness of the world, but a couple who've survived the worst treatment that Heathcliff could devise for them and have emerged with their humanity intact."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"All time favorite classic.

This engaging book (she credits GOD as a co-author)skillfully written, takes you on an excursion with entertaining vignettes. With snap-shot glimpses of the fifth dimension, you delve into a spiritual realm reminiscent of Carlos Castaneda's books: The Eagle's Gift, Tales of Power, The Teachings of don Juan...etc. The difference--and it's a BIG difference--is that Donna Howard innocently portrays her sojourn, with shockingly breathless passages, like rollercoaster ride video-footage.

I have since ordered a second one as a gift from Amazon. There really isn't a lot of choices for these things anymore, considering the software and online sources that are available now. Even Amazon only has a couple of them available. This journal is an old time throw back to the days when we got our weather strictly from the TV news casts and newspapers for that's all we had. No internet, no cable weather station on 24 hours, no news sources other than the local ones. It was fun back then to keep track of the wind, rainfall, temps, storms, etc. that infiltrated the years past for there was no other place we could turn to in order to get that kind of info. Despite the fact that diary's such as this are out of fashion to be sure, there is still a lot of fun to be had in doing things the old fashioned way. Make no mistake about it, its tempting at times to just say that nothing happened today as to the weather so I think I will skip it. It's a little tedious to pencil in all the almanac figures everyday and perhaps add your own little twist to it. (There is a space available everyday to write in your random thoughts). But you have the freedom of doing what you want when you want and in the end have a true diary full of weather, (and sometimes not so weather) related stories that are as fun to look back on as a personal diary is. This journal isn't for everyone to be sure. But if you or someone you know and love is a weather junkie, you may just have found the perfect gift for them in this diary.

There was a place for all the important things I'd see as well as a place for short comments. Each day, as I filled it up I could review the weather of years past and be reminded of how changeable it all is. I also recorded lunar events and special storms, family changes and significant political dates. It is a great record, easily kept and easily reviewed.

And I was not disappointed. Bringing together in one book the best and latest there is to know about anger, she deftly discards old death-dealing ways of viewing anger and offers healthy, \\"holy\\" ways to use this anger for both personal growth and social concerns. I came away with quite a few good tidbits! Best of all, it was nice to hear a few of her own personal stories--they added a richness to the text."},{"Title":"Transforming Fire: Women Using Anger Creatively","review":"This book should be required for every women with boundary issues, stifled rage, or even difficulty with confrontation. Teacher, therapist and theologian Kathleen Fischer looks at the various myths surrounding women and anger in Western, particularly religious, culture, and does an excellent job of deconstructing the myths, placing anger into context and suggesting methods for integrating and dealing with this inevitable facet of life.Especially helpful was her section on forgiveness, in which she both warns readers as to the dangers of forgiving too soon, and shares the painful, but liberating journey toward resolution. The anecdotes she shares, either personal, or from women who have shared them with her, are very helpful and interesting. An excellent, reassuring and healing work, and one I am very glad is on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Transforming Fire: Women Using Anger Creatively","review":"I have found this book to be a wonderful tool to understand my anger. I look forward to finishing the last chapther and taking the steaps in my life to walk with anger in a more healty way."},{"Title":"Transforming Fire: Women Using Anger Creatively","review":"This work is so inclusive that it is inconclusive. The authorattempts to summarize various perspectives about women's anger fromChristian, Judaic, and Buddhist perspectives. The problem is that shedoesn't do justice to any of these faiths because she just picks andchooses the pieces of each belief system that agree with her veryfeminist perspective. She is particularly fond of Carol Gilligan'swork, so if you like Gilligan's works, you may also like this book.If you consider your own beliefs to be &quot;new age,&quot; you willalso probably enjoy this book. However, if you are a practicingChristian, or Jew, or Buddhist, I suspect that you, like me, will notfind the work particularly insightful or helpful."},{"Title":"A Grammar of Signs: Bartolo Da Sassoferrato's Tract on Insignia and Coats of Arms (Studies in Comparative Legal History)","review":"A must read for students of medieval jurisprudence and for all those with an interest in either the history of law or of heraldry. The edition of Bartolo's text is fastidious and the translation is fluid, nuanced, and nearly flawless. The introductory material makes a good case for Bartolo's not knowing Hebrew nor having been given the right to bear his arms by the emperor. And after all these years, the hilarious letter by Valla is more an indictment of Valla's arrogance, predilection for invective, and ahistorical viewpoint than of Bartolo's &quot;bad&quot; Latin."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This is the 8 CD Package Family CD Pack.

I was just about to push into my early teen years, and I really had no clue what to expect. I read this book, and I although I couldn't relate to everything in it at the time, it was presented in a clear, logical and Godly way. As the years went by, I began to relate more and more to Dr. Dobson's words, and I recalled his suggestions often. Now, I'm buying this for my much younger sister as she begins her trip into her teen years."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This book provides indispensible advice and education for the parent and pre-teen. When I was entering adolescence, my parents gave me this book. I cannot describe what a relief it was to learn that I wasn't weird and that the feelings I was having and the stage I was entering were normal. A must-read for all Christian families on the brink of the teenage years."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"I have two boys who are thirteen and nine years old. I also teach a preadolescent sunday school class for my church. I read the book and began immediately encouraging my oldest son to read it also. As a thirteen year old boy, he had more important things to do than read a book his dad recommended, so I bought the teaching guide and taught it to my sunday school class. We are now exploring other areas, but every time we cross a subject that we studied in the book, the kids remind me where that came from and which of the symptoms the person in question is suufering from. This book has helped a great deal with my children as well as other children in my sunday school class. Parents have even asked me where I gained the courage to teach the book and thank me for doing something that they felt was to touchy a subject for them to take on. thank you Dr. Dobson for having the insight to write this and your other books."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"My wife took our 10 year old daughter (5 years ago, shopping trip), and I took my 11 year old son (1 year ago, snowmobiling) on overnights, as suggested. Our kids considered it a rite of passage and looked forward to the trips with great anticipation.Dobson teaches about the many changes of adolescence, which has helped each of our teens to avoid the many pitfalls of that age(so far!). We have loaned the tapes to many friends, and each have been pleased with the experience.Many ask when to do this trip with their child. Dobson recommends right before puberty- when the child will still think sex is \\"gross\\", but old enough to have interest and understand.This sure beats the talks our parents had with us!"},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"What parent is prepared for the roller coaster ride of adolescence when their first child starts \\"growing up\\"? I thought I wouldn't have to think about it until my child was 13! Ha! The moodiness has already started -- at 10!I enjoyed this book by Dr. Dobson, a well known & trusted author. The book helps the parent see this phase from the child's perspective and is written in a style the child can relate to. It assists them in trying to make sense of it all. It offers the child a preview of what to expect as radical physical and emotional changes begin and suggestions of how to handle them with practical common sense and their faith. The section addressing the \\"facts of life\\" is respectful, frank and thorough, but only offers age appropriate \\"details\\". It is appropriate enough for a 10 year old.The book cover-to-cover may not keep the attention of a 10-12 year old who is accustomed to reading \\"action\\" type books, but if they are searching for answers, it's all there. Whether you buy the book for guidance as a parent, for your child to read, or as a tool to open up discussion on these topics, it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This book is written to 10-12 year-olds and covers self-esteem, feelings of inferiority, peer-pressure, body changes, romantic love, and emotions. I just finished reading it to my sons. It provoked many questions and good conversations. I guess most everyone either loves or hates Dr. Dobson, but this book is just solid preparation for the teen-age years. Other than a couple of overt calls to faith in Christ, the book could be extremely helpful for a parent of any faith to use to help their children get ready for the challenges of adolescence. After all, there's not Christian puberty and Buddhist puberty. The problems addressed are universal."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"I purchased this book for a niece who is almost twelve and has recently lost her mother because of a traffic accident. This book offers good advice to young people who wish to make wise, godly choices. I, like Dr. Dobson, value the Bible-based teachings that this country was founded on. Secular people will not like this book."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"I am 11 and this book has helped me tremendously. I believe it has saved me a lot of trouble in the future. Even the delicate subjects are explained in a way the does not make you shudder. J ames has written many other great books. My mom has bringing up boys. It was hard to put this book down. I read it in 3 days. It is the best six dollars and forty four cents I have ever spent."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"How do you get started on the subject of the birds and bees? It seems all you need is for someone to shove you through the door (with your fingernails leaving ruts in the door way!). The book opens the door gently for you and your kid. The 3rd chapter covers all the physiology and does it so easily. The rest of the book surprised me with the emotional and mental changes. My daughter has requested I read the rest of the book aloud to her. I read it first and wished I had had this book as a kid. Dobson says that about 85% of pre-adolescent kids willing and desiring to talk to the parents close down communication after the onset of puberty. Do the right thing for your kids before it's too late."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This is a great book to give your preteen or teenager to read as it discusses a lot of the hard to talk about issues teens face today. It covers sexual matters which most adults find hard to talk about with their kids. Excellent reading."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"it is a little boring talking about this book but it still gives you information about friendship. freindship is not just asking, &#34;would you be my friend?&#34; you need to know their characteristic and see if it suits you or not. true friendship is when friends help friends out, not just to burrow their video games"},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This review is for the entire series called Preparing for Adolescence: The book, Family Guide, Group Guide and Family Cd's. Though each part of this can be used independently I recommend using it all together. The book is excellent, as are most of Dobson's parenting tools. This book addresses the concerns of this most turbulent age in childhood - that of becoming a young adult and leaving the time of being a child. I found it to be extremely helpful. The Family Guide is for use with your child and has many helpful ways to engage your child and keep communications open. The Group guide has further exercises and studies. I think the thing I liked most were the Cd's. The first one is for parents only - an overview of the study and encouragement for them as they navigate this time. The remaining Cd's are for the child. Though Dobson does not use alot of modern lingo his messages are direct, to the point, and honest. Each one is based on a subject that is of interest to the child. I thought it was excellent. I highly recommend it to parents. If nothing else it will help you to stay engaged with your child at a time when most children seem to be pulling away. The other benefit it that Dobson can address issues to your child that they may be reluctant to bring up with you or to embarrassed to ask about or afraid to admit that certain things are bothering them. This allows you to approach a subject without being nagging or nosy - they will feel their boundaries are still intact. Wonderful parenting resource!Thank you GospelLight/Regal for the review copies."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the \\"Just say no\\" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"We used the Preparing for Adolescence book for our Disciple Now with 5th and 6th graders.

The author writes at a level that students can understand.We will use this again for sure."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"I did this study when I was a kid - going into my teen years. I did a study on it with my church and my parents - it was really helpful to me. Now, my own son is ten, and he and I are going over all the material. It is a great way to introduce your teens-to-be to the concepts, challenges, and rewards of growing older. It's more than a discussion about sex - it deals with all the craziness of the teen years. You should have the talk you're your child before someone else does. This book will help you do it in a Biblical and common sense approach. Highly recommend. I know that not everyone agrees with everything that comes from Focus on the Family and Dr. James Dobson; however, this book is pretty straightforward. The most important thing is that YOU guide the conversation with your childe. This book serves as a great starting point."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This book was recommended to me by a great child psychologist. I'm just thrilled with the information in this book as well as the discussions my son and I were able to have after we both read it.

It is definately a survival guide for every parent in the midst of raising teenagers."},{"Title":"Preparing for adolescence","review":"This book explained many of the changes that where happening to me at this key time in my life.

You name it, this guide has it. However, when I got Super Mario Sunshine, I just looked aroung for walkthroughs on the internet and I found some at various gaming websites. They all had information on where to find shines, how to get them, and blue coins. Not that this isn't a great guide, but I prefer things for free ...

Arguably, it sometimes must be a better option to buy it directly from the company that conjured the game. With Brady Books issuing of their strategy guide to Super Mario Sunshine, it does showcase some great detail on some of the most difficult courses, but it just doesn't seem to showcase enough particularly on the harder levels, and the secret courses. I only suggest that you get this, if you can't find any other strategy guide. Otherwise, get the actualy strategy guide that officially Nintendo made for Super Mario Sunshine."},{"Title":"Super Mario Sunshine Official Strategy Guide","review":"This guide is super useful. It gives helpful advice for getting the Shine Sprites and also says what episode of each world is the best for getting 100 coins. There is also a useful map for each area, showing where all the Blue Cons are, plus other things like extra lives, different nozzles, and Yoshi eggs. And at the end of the guide, there are descriptions of how to get every Blue Coin, numbered to correspond to the maps. This guide makes it much easier to get 100% in the game, and I would recommend getting this guide if that is your goal. My one complaint is that sometimes the map seems to point to the wrong location. For example, a Blue Coin found on the beach of Gelato Beach is not quite where it shows on the map, which caused me a bit of trouble. (It was coin number 11, I believe. It's actually on the other side of that walkway.)

There has been quite a bit of editing done since that tome was published. This version -- Kindle -- is what the paperback should have been. Evidently that thought crossed Mr Garrows mind over the years. The time spent redacting Souls was well spent.It's still a frantic book, but those were frantic times. Mr Garrow weaves his tale as a deranged spider might weave his web. It may not be perfectly spun, may be geometrically askew, but it serves it's purpose very well. Once you're into it, it will hold you there; keep you reading.I never worked in a steel mill, though I grew up in a steel region -- the Mid Monongahela River Valley in Western Pennsylvania. I heard the stories coming up in the forties and fifties of the last century of men in the mills. The man who raised me spent 47 years at the Allenport site before he died. Some of those stories I heard from him were witty, others tragic. This book tells both those stories -- humorous and dramatic -- in an emotionally lively rush of words.We drink a bit here in the valley and a few of my afterhours are spent in local -- small town -- taverns and clubs. The old Allenport Mill site is only a few miles down the road. Since most of the men and women who frequent those places are now retired steelworkers,the majority from Allenport, I ask those familiar with Souls about scenes set in the mill and the consistent reply is -- \\"He nailed it. Somebody finally got it right -- \\" about the mill in that era when the industry was becoming slowly unhinged.The 'love' story here goes beyond man and woman, extending out to family, the neighborhood, co-workers and even out to strangers we sometimes pass as we trip down this rocky road we all stumble through called life. The 'love' story is quite honest. You'll let out a few laughs and every so often feel that tightening in your throat when things go awry.The writing style is somewhere between Thomas Wolfe's Of Time and the River and James T Farrell's Danny O'Neil stories. But Phillip Garrow is not Wolfe or Farrell. He's his own man telling us a story of a time and place. He rambles, raves, runs on breathlessly and, at times, roars. His people cast a shadow, stand up and talk back. He paints landscapes - industrial and pastoral -- with a fine brush; the brushstrokes melding in coheseively to leave a strikingly truthful and vivid picture in the mind when the reading is done.I don't know if you can ask more of an author than that."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"A book that is well put together and excellent for the young and old readers. Another plus was the fact I was born and raised in the area where the story takes place and could relate my own personal experiences to the book as well.

A strong story and stronger characters!"},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"In June of this year I returned to Pittsburgh after twenty years away from home. I returned to a place that was forever changed by the global economy. Where had the corporate powers of the Steel Valley gone? Westinghouse Electric Company no longer existed; Gulf Research was gone; the 2nd Avenue Plant of J&amp;L Steel was a modern-day electronics industrial park and most of all, the Homestead Works of US Steel (oh yeah, USX) had become something called the Waterfront, another retail sweatshop filled with low paying, why-should-I-care-about-this jobs. This was quite an overwhelming change for the son of a Pittsburgh Steelworker to absorb. What happened to the glory days of steel? Where are the people who earned &quot;a damn good living&quot; and gave pieces of their hearts and souls back to the company? I found a rewarding answer in the tragedy and tribute of a novel called Souls of Steel. The author, Phillip Garrow, has taken the bits and pieces of every Steel Family's life and turned it into a literary work worthy of the company of The Bard himself. In his novel, Garrow mixes the typical (sometimes vulgar) steel man's vocabulary with a prose that is so poetic it deserves to be read aloud. Modern literature is starving for works like this. My opinion is that Souls of Steel should be mandatory reading not only for students of modern American literature, but also for the calculating geniuses produced by today's MBA factories. Souls of Steel captures the spirit of the glorious hay day of steel with the tragedy of its fall. The fall was hard, not just for the Steel Company's balance sheet but for the delicately teetering lives of the workers, who were attached to the mill's success or failure.Garrow's ability to turn a phrase will lead me back to his work just to hear the words again. For example, he speaks of a retiree having &quot; a smile-rich and deep as a steel man's heart&quot;. It's easy for me to envision that smile. I see it every time I look at my dad.It's hard to believe one can find romance in the viscous, growling of the steel mill dragon, but Garrow has done just that. Obviously, I find this book not only a must read, but a must read again and again.Steve BaranPeters Township, PAPH: 724-969-0595"},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"Souls of Steel is the most passionate love story I've ever read. At first, I thought it was a book about a steel mill worker and what it was like working for the steel mill, but its not, don't let the cover mislead you, because once you start reading, you won't be able to put this book down. Souls of Steel is so well written, you become a part of Tad and Laura's life, you'll share in their happiness and sorrows."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"Souls of Steel was quite interesting to me. I found it very relative to my background, being that my father was a steelworker and I was in high school in the 70's. The main characters, Tad and Laura share a world very similar to many folks that I grew up around. I enjoyed Phillip's writing style, quite poetic and dramatic but still very easy to get in-to. Read it! - you'll love it. You'll laugh and cry, worry and get angry - it's a very emotional piece."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"Souls is such a moving love story. It pulls you into the lives of the characters and you belong to them until the end. I didn't want it to end almost as much as I couldn't wait to see what would happen! Tad and Laura have what everyone wants. This is the story of an ordinary life and of a love that is anything but."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"Souls of Steel is an engrossing if frustrating read.Reading more like an autobiography than a novel, it focuses heavily on Thaddeus (Tad) Gallow and his young bride Laura. Tad begins his life in the steel mills by taking a summer job before going back to college. He finds an unexpected passion for the work, and his wife finds an unexpected fondness for the very good money Tad brings in. When fall comes, Tad takes the 'short-cut' of skipping college. After all, they both reason, why put themselves into debt to get an education when he's making money equal to or better than anything he's likely to make even after getting a degree?So starts their journey stemming from a short-sighted decision of convenience. The consequences of his choice are brought home to him shortly after signing on as a permanent worker in this passage from page 94 where he enters the locker room for the first time now that the \`boys of summer' are gone:October's final moments. A cool Monday morning, heavy with honey dew; earth held soft in the last leaf fall of Pennsylvania's kaleidoscope autumn panorama. Tad strode -- senses sharpened -- humming a piece from Emerson, Lake and Palmer's Karn Evil Nine. He manuevered around abandoned lockers -- doors swung open in silent sayanora to the boys of summer, gone 'til faroff spring. Tad cruised along, dressing without a thought in his pleasantly blank mind, when -- out of the blue -- an ice berg realization struck his hull jagged. What'm I doin' here? Tad quit dressing and looked about -- his eyes open for the first time since he crossed the railroad tracks in May. A frightful rush of senselessness washed over him. He knew none of the men dressing about him -- faces strange hostile gray old haggard. The Powder Puff was dark, lost, and filthy. The bright college boys were gone. Long gone. Tad was run through with pain. There's no escape. The remodeling loans, the classes at Cal, the Family, the marriage have sealed my fate. Every minute-a the next thirty years-a my life's gonna be served behind the barbed wire an' brick walls-a Allenport Penitentiary. He couldn't breathe. His pulse raced. His heart pounded in his temples. He grew so dizzy he had to lean against the locker. . .The above passage highlights both the best and some of the worst of Garrow's writing. The best points are that his imagery is great, his epiphanies highly felt. The downside is that the reader is constantly distracted by the writer and the choices he made on how to present his subject. The book is filled with sentence fragments, wierd capitilizations (not just a few, but everywhere) and a constant shifting from the first to third person and then back again. It has a 'stream of consciousness' writing style in which the author strings together a list of adjectives with no commas between to suffice for description, causing entire sentences that are incoherent and maddening in trying to decipher what the author means. The author uses phonetics to convey speech patterns, but then carries this throughout the narrative also, which detracts greatly from the read.Despite all of these problems, I found it an enjoyable book. My interest did not stem so much from the story written down, but the true story going on behind the pages: a college drop out facing the realization that his life is going to be spent in the steel mills, that his marriage and financial obligations have now sealed his fate, and using writing as a tool to rescue the creative side of himself from wilting away. In this light, it is no wonder that the author made over-the-top choices in his writing. He used his brightest, most jarring colors to paint a picture in an otherwise very drab world.Souls of Steel appears to be the authors first book, and as it is copyrighted 1999, it is a shame that he has never apparently written another. A second work with far more discipline and much less desperation would probably be a fantastic read.I can't recommend this title for everyone, however. I would limit it to these people:Those who have an interest in the steel industry from a blue-collar perspective.Those who are interested in Western Pennsylvania culture and history.Those who are willing to take a wide detour out of the normal standards of writing and tackle something that stretches the written word to its very limits.Those who are interested in writing and want to see a whole collection of what not to do in a book.Those who want to read a story that has an entire collection of what not to do in a book, and have it still work (which in and of itself is an incredibly rare feat).If you fit into any of the above categories, you will not find this read a waste of time, and, indeed, it may be time well spent in terms of expanding your perspective on writing. Alas, this is never going to be a mass-market read, or even a really suitable read for those that it was supposedly written for (the men and women who lived the steel-industry era). The mental acrobatics required in order to follow the story are certain to discourage all but the most agile of readers."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"Mr. Garrow has created a touching story about the death of the American steel industry, the tribulation s of the men who committed their lives to this industry to put our nation on top of the world only to get cast aside,and a love affair; deep as it is real, that weaves the novel together (along with wonderful poetry). this novel is full of unique symbolism and carefully executed wordplay that makes it such an enjoyment to read. Like all things carefully constructed and beautiful, it should be examined slowly and thoroughly, and appreciated for its literary genius and originality."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"A tale of the passage to manhood for an unlikely steel worker, Souls of Steel describes the culture of steel workers at the time when steel was king. Some of the most intense passages are those describing the operations within the steel mill; you can feel the heat.

The cover is deceptive. The author articulates a love story deftly mixed with reality and fantasy. The story weaves emotional romance with love experiences utilizing a collapsing industry as its backdrop framed in fading ethnic cultures.I beleive this novel is destined to be made into a movie."},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"I know the author of this book personally, and can from experience that every other review of this book are just reviews by his close friends making Souls of Steels sound better than it really is (most of them have never even read it). So for those of you who are interested: here is the truth. Souls of Steel isn't so much a love story as it is a story of one man's day-to-day routine in a steel mill. If you like monotonous descriptions of someone working, and what happens at their job every day, then this book is for you. Be forewarned, however, that the text constantly switches between 1st and 3rd person perspectives without indication to the reader. There is also a lot of center-aligned filler (mostly useless poems that don't apply to the story what-so-ever). Also be warned that the author uses randomized capitalizations, no hyphens in phrases that should be hyphenated, and frequent non-dialogue misspellings to denote the usage of slang. The characters are rarely called by their own names in the book, and lack the proper dimension to be interesting. The love-story angle of the book is rarely untilized, and takes a back seat to the authors true love: the dead and empty steel mill in which he used to work. The story itself (what little there is of it) has few intersting plot points, a dull and unbelievable climax, and meanders drudgingly through 350 pages of common drudgery. Expect to see words used improperly (**PRETENTION WARNING** the author uses the word deamon instead of demon many times), sentences written in the passive form, and references to events and people that only the author would understand. The book is highly autobiographical in nature, and I can tell you truthfully it is one of the most boring books I have ever read (if I could rate it zero stars, I would). Beware!--PEACE"},{"Title":"Souls of Steel","review":"this book is very different from others.The writer uses a new form of writing with the center justified italisized.Its like shanging the scenes while your watching a movie.This is truly a great novel and i give it a huge thumbs up.I have great faith that this book will be one of the greats along with whatever else this clever author has in store for the future."},{"Title":"Eight Yards Down and Out: A Fox Trot Collection","review":"Roger warms up for football season.

Many useful tips can be picked up by skimming through the book but - given the complexity of many of the examples - the book is best worked through in detail.

However, if you want to learn RDS features and capabilities this books sample application is pretty valuable.The first 7 chapters are a good UML overview. The rest of the book on physical implementation gets rather confused and relies on quite a few strange method implementations by the author.

As a result, there is not that many books that are available compared to a subjet like XML (Wrox have 2 books with UML, while they have 10 books with XML in their title, not including the ones that talks about it).Unfortunately (or is it?), UML is one of those knowledge that are simply a requirement to any enterprise development with good time to market and much better documentation and knowledge of an application. VB came to market as an easy tool and it is still like this. With time (and versions), VB is now capable of doing good scalable enterprise architecture but it also lacks the enterprise developers that the C area got.This book will help change the tide in VB favor. First of all, this is UML book to learn from scratch what UML can provide and why is it important to use UML to have a successful application.

There is also a pharmaceutical spray version of marijuana that can be used in 23 countries, but not within the United States. It is legally used by approximately 300,000 patients in the US. It is believe there are several million patients illegally using marijuana for medical purposes.The use of marijuana has been found to be effective in treating the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, Tourette's syndrome, and pain. There are studies showing marijuana is useful for patients with hepatitis C, gastro-intestinal disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). There are some indicating that marijuana is useful for patients with cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's diseases.A drawback to marijuana is it has toxins that can create a high effect that dulls mental senses. These toxins and the high effect can be removed by vaporizing the marijuana.Marinol is a synthetic chemical available in capsules made from sesame oil that contains pure THC found in marijuana. It is allowed by the Food and Drug Administration to suppress nausea, while is a common ailment by patients who receive chemotherapy who need to fight nausea in order to take their medication. Patients state that medical marijuana is far superior to Marinol which lacks cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids found in marijuana that allow marijuana to be more effective. In addition, nausea patients have difficulty swallowing the Marinol capsules. Patients state they prefer inhaling such medication, which can be done with marijuana but not with Marinol. Inhalation also offer for better dosage control, whereas capsules have the dosage pre-determined. Marinol is also expensive, costing up to $1,000 for sixty capsules.Sativex is a cannabis spray administered under the tongue. It is available for Canada and 22 other countries, primarily for multiple sclerosis patients.Medical marijuana has been found to help stimulate appetite and repress nausea. This is helpful for patients with cancer, HIV, and AIDS. Six studies found marijuana suppressed nausea in 90% of people studied while one study found it suppressed nausea in 59% of people studied.It has been suggested the marijuana can be useful in stimulating the appetite of people with anorexia and with morning sickness.Marijuana was found in a study to reduce muscle spasms in 88% of patients studied with spinal cord injuries.Marijuana has been found to reduce spasms with patients with epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, menstrual cramps, cerebral palsy and a number of other disorders. It also reduces tics faced by people with Tourette's syndrome.A study of 339 Parkinson's disease patients found 46% of patients found substantial relief although it took almost two months of use before the relief took effect.Marijuana has been found to relieve pain. Recent studies and studies going back to the 19th century have found this to be the case. In the 19th century, marijuana was prescribed for migraines and for pain from rheumatism. A number of patients experience pain related to several ailments for express pain relief from marijuana.A study with a small sample size found that Marino diminished some of the negative psychiatric effects experienced by Alzheimer's patients. An animal tissue study found it cannabinoids may slow the progression of Alzheimer's.Marijuana may have positive effects for other psychiatric ailments. It may improve the mood of people with clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and chronic fatigue syndrome. A study of insomnia patients found that using marijuana helped them sleep better. It is noted that insomnia is often a side effect of withdrawal from heavy marijuana usage which can last for up to several weeks. Marijuana should not be used to alleviate stress as stress comes from external conditions.The use of marijuana may help alleviate the symptoms of addiction withdrawal, be it alcohol, tobacco, or narcotics.Marijuana decreases fluid pressure on the eyes of glaucoma patients. Thus using marijuana can prevent blindness from glaucoma. Among the few patients legally allowed by the Food and Drug Administration to use medical marijuana have been glaucoma patients.There has been a study that indicated that the direct application of cannabinoids to some types of cancers in animals shrinks them. This does not mean that inhaling them would have a similar effect.Marijuana increased heart rates which could pose a problem to people with heart disease. It can make some people feel faintness. Smoking marijuana can be harmful to the throat and lungs. It should be noted that the amount of smoke involved from typical marijuana users is far less than the amount of smoke involved in tobacco users."},{"Title":"Marijuana Medical Handbook: A Guide to Therapeutic Use","review":"Finally, a well written book giving concise information on the benefits of using medical marijuana.

And onto the \\"plot\\"!You have your stereotypical beefcake named Marco, who, whenever described, holds a striking resemblence to the supposed author of this book. Marco is your average Italian pirate/womanizer who is his own boss and even the boss of a quaint pirate island somewhere in the Caribbean where prostitutes are welcome to visit and have children with Marco's crew.Marco, on one of his escapades, comes across a rather dilapidated, almost-run-by-criminals island where he saves twelve-year-old Christina, who, upon first being introduced, doesn't appear half bad. Marco gallantly swoops her and her stereotypically annoying crone of a guardian, away to his island. Blah, blah, blah, six years pass.Marco still is an irritating, virtually one-dimensional character who has to walk through doorways sideways because of his overbearing muscles (I particularly loved his episode with the mercenary-like cook and her constant want of a raise, and how he said something along the lines of \\"Woman! You try my temper!\\"), while Christina has turned into a spoiled brat. Of course, she's a voluptuous, golden-haired eighteen-year-old who is lusted after by every memeber of the crew, so all her moral short-comings are overlooked. I swear, I have never come across a .... character. And not even in the good sense of the word. There were numerous occasions where I wished I could jump into the book, punch her in the face and then laugh at her while she cried for Marco because her hair got mussed and her immaculately tiny nose was now less than perfect.All in all, you have just about every stereotype imaginable. The steamy whore who thinks she can run the hero's life. The annoying child-turned-woman who thinks she owns the hero's life because of a frivolous promise, the ugly, bearded Spanish pirate rival, the heiress of an American colony company, and her jealous guardian who wants her dead so he can get the money.I think the only likable character was the darn cheetah, who, in a Sigfried and Roy-esque manner, was a pet.

The Masculine hunk of romance novel covers proves this theory by writing one of the greatest pieces of literature to ever grace paper. This gem in a world of dirty rocks is his book entitled Pirate.How can words even begin to describe the beauty and genius held within these pages? Fabio's grasp of the English language is like the delicate, yet strong and firm grasp a flower petal has on a drop of dew. His ideas and feelings are truly that of a god among men. While reading this book, one gets the idea that Fabio could conquer the world with one fell swoop of his well-muscled and excessively-oiled arms.The plot of the book is true poetry. Fabio proves that he can create incredibly unique and innovative storylines by unexpectedly writing of a heroine pining away for a strapping, dangerous hunk. Never before has any such novel been written. Their love is forbidden, even bordering on incestuous and illegal. Yet the red-hot intensity of the chemistry between them burns hotter than a fire fueled by incredibly flammable items. When the two finally unite in love's golden splendor, the fire erupts into a burning, scorching inferno- not unlike a volcano.If ever a more innovative, unique and intelligent book than Pirate could be written, it would certainly be a sign of the apocalypse. Read this book. Savor this book. Lick the cover of this book. Feel the vibe of Fabio with every tender word. You will fall prey to his manliness...it's only a matter of time.Recommended reading for: those with severe delusional episodes, which include dating and/or someday marrying Fabio."},{"Title":"Pirate","review":"I'm sure they had the best of intentions, but one day, my mother and sister dropped off Fabio's book for me to read. The next morning, during breakfast, I started to read Pirate. Guess what? This book is as bad as I thought it would be.For instance, it is not enough that the hero (a 22-year old beefcake named Marco Glaviano) has his looks spelled out for us in great detail on the fifth page of the story. Oh no! His looks are spelled out in great detail for us every single time the heroine (a 12-year old &quot;innocent&quot; named Christina) chances to cast her eyes in his direction.Nary a noun goes unadorned with one or more adjectives. In itself, this may not be a such a huge flaw. However, the adjective choice, and sometimes even the noun itself, leave much to be desired. As a prime example, skim to any one of the myriad of sex scenes. By the way, Christina is 19 now, so we don't have to worry about pedophilia. In the &quot;plunder&quot; scenes, penises are never called penises. Oh no! They are always referred to as &quot;manhood,&quot; &quot;masts,&quot; &quot;members,&quot; or once, in a passionate spurt of inspiration, a &quot;phallus.&quot; None of these terms are used on their own. They are always preceded by such modifiers as &quot;swollen,&quot; &quot;magnificent,&quot; or, my personal favourite, the clinical-sounding &quot;turgid.&quot; One memorable &quot;plunder&quot; scene went something like follows: &quot;Her sails unfurled about his mast.&quot; Keen, eh?Although reading this piece of literature often set off gales of derisive laughter, I must admit that over all, Pirate is very readable, if only for its comic effect. All in all the book reminds me of cotton candy. It looks like a lot, but it only amounts to just the teensiest bit of sugar. There is absolutely no substance to it, but people buy it anyway for the sugar rush."},{"Title":"Pirate","review":"Okay, first off it's by Fabio. You can't even begin to think to take it seriously. Picture the \\"I can't believe it's not butter\\" model, smiling broadly in a puffy shirt, wind blowing in his face, describing the story to an actual romance author who's writing the book for him (yes, there's another name in the author slot with his).Remember, it's Fabio. So use the appropriate accent. Say things like \\"I vant to be smarrrt. I vant to play chess on the beach.\\" Its about pirates so remember, \\"Pirates go Arrr, Matey. but I am smart, so I just say Hello.\\"And yes, the pirates (he's obviously the pirate captain) get drunk on the beach and say \\"Harrrr\\" a lot. There is the actual super-sexy phrase of \\"Climb upon my mast and billow like a sail.\\" in the book, which makes me laugh everytime I think about it. There are no surprise twists or turns. And there is a centerfold picture of the guy himself if you get the 1st ed paperback.This book is a great laugh, fun, light and as complex and dizzyingly clever as the model himself.Remember, It's Fabio!"},{"Title":"Pirate","review":"First off I want to point off that Christina was only 12 year of age when she was rescued by Marco after he passed by in his ship and saw that the island she lived on was being invaded by pirates.Christina was an orphan and her guardian sent her to that island fully knowing that it was frequently invaded by pirates hoping that she would get killed and then he would inherit her fortune.Ignore reviewers who admit they only read the first page or only read Amazon's brief and incomplete discription for they wrongly think that Marco was having relations with Christina when she was 12.Yes Marco took Christina to live on his own Caribbean island but he had a lover and didn't really pay much attention to Christina and he didn't really even like her too much and thought of her as an annoying pesty little kid and really let Christina do her own thing for years and nothing happened between Marco and Christina though she did try throwing herself at him only to be rejected by him until she was 18 years old and kind of seduced him and I think he was drunk at the time.Like so many other reviewers I didn't like Christina but I actually liked Marco and even though I didn't like the heroine I actually liked this book and I recommend it but I think Fabio should have sent Christina off with the son of Marco's business aquaintence and given Marco a more stable girlfriend but I will rate this 3 stars for what I liked but no more than 3 stars!"},{"Title":"Pirate","review":"This was a great romance novel I read it when I was in high school.

It is not just a &quot;positive thinking&quot; bandaid to cover the emotional hurt like so many self-help books. He really gets to the root of personal problems unlike so many other authors. The author shows why he doesn't believe in labeling peoples thinking as negative or positive. That cognitive psycholigist approach actually blames the person for their thoughts, causing more judgement and guilt on themselves! I did that exact thing after realizing I could never just flip all my negative thoughts into positive ones. There is too many hidden emotional problems that can't be cured by positive affirmations. Tony shows that our thoughts are always good and creative...always &quot;protecting&quot; us from hurt or harm. It's totally normal for ones mind to place protective behaviours after an emotional hurt occurs. Also, these so called &quot;negative&quot; feelings reveal to us the need for emotional healing. It would be dangerous to just put up a positive front, and ignore all of these messages your mind is telling you. It's time to really begin the healing. Begin healing TODAY!! Get this book! It will change your life."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Negative Thinking","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. Without repeating everything the previous person said, I would highly recommend this book. I have read many self-help books, but found this one life changing. I am sending it to my brother who we have always labeled \\"negative\\", but now I see he has just been protecting himself, and his behavior has been justified, and does in fact change as his trust level rises. This book makes perfect sense and I find I will use the list of recommendations in the book for creating a healthy relationship as I raise my son. I have been inspired to look for more writings by this author who is truly a genius in the field of psychology."},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Negative Thinking","review":"I highly recommend this book.

It teaches why those rules work, and how to break them. But it doesn't stop there.

While some of the references (script girl is particularly amusing) are very dated, the text mainly covers technique and avoids technology.The illustrations and printing style point quite obviously to the book's mid-60s origin. An introduction by someone who remembers what it was like to shoot film in 1908 and knew D.W. Griffith personally should tip you off immediately that this book is something special. Still, the illustrations are clear and help illustrate the text's points very well.In spite of what many recent amateur (and professional) film makers think, technology does not make your film good, it just makes it easy. TECHNIQUE makes it good. And that's what this book teaches in a very clear, readable, and understandable way.Very highly recommended if you've had your fill of general introductory texts and are looking for real instruction and explanation for how to actually MAKE a film."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"The five C's: camera angles, continuity, cutting, close-ups, and composition. This book takes the filmmaker through understanding exactly what goes into getting the best image imaginable onto film.

While &quot;creative-types&quot; may find his insistance on what can be done insulting to their vision, I think we can all agree that if you are going to break the rules, it is important to know them. If you read this book and study it, then you will KNOW the rules and UNDERSTAND when, why, and where you need to break them.

Reshooting exactly the same scene from the same POV 13 times is NOT useful coverage! The editor needs ways to cut around mistakes and build up scenes by mix and match to do this he needs well thought out shooting not endless repetitions.If everyone who wants to be a director would read and pay attention to this book film and video quality would improve immensely!While this book is an essential read for directors, DPs and cameramen; I would highly recommend it to gaffers, grip and sound guys."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"If you're like me and you've sifted through dozens of books on film technique that were about anything but, you can stop searching. &quot;The Five C's of Cinematography&quot; is not only well-written but virtually everything in it is essential to learning good film technique. Most authors of these types of books either don't completely understand the medium, aren't interested in sharing their wisdom or are just looking to make a quick buck.

It doesn't matter if you're a filmmaker, a cameraman, or even a still photographer this book is worth the read. Also, if you edit video in Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro and are pretty much clueless, the chapter on cutting will be of great value to you.This book is more about philosophy than any technical information about cameras or types of film.

Get to the point, Mascelli ! However, this broad-based and totally off-hand criticism of the entire book hasn't stopped me giving it five stars ! Why ? Because, overall the book is very well structured, and FULL of information. The style is part of his view of the world of film-making and his frequent trips round the houses take us to the many places that we need to visit in getting to know that world. I just wish that all the off-topic information had been broken down into separate chapters and presented as individual reading topics. But then it would be &quot;The 50 Cs&quot; and a very different book from Mascelli's ! No, I rate this book very highly as it is. I picked it up at a time when I couldn't even see a cut-on-action, never mind see why it was used, what the alternatives might have been, etc. I had previously read somewhere that &quot;the camera should depict the action, not become part of it&quot;, yet never found a book which taught this as a method. I hoped that an &quot;old-school&quot; book might do that, and the &quot;5 Cs&quot; doesn't disappoint. Through it, I've finally started to &quot;get&quot; what film-making is about and, as I'm sure another reviewer has said, I'll probably never look at films the same way again. Besides, if someone thinks they're interested in film-making, this book is a good test. If they can't make their way through Mascelli's Mountain of Words, they're never going to succeed in getting a film made ! On the other hand, I only read it because I was stuck on a train for long periods of time, so maybe something easier to read would be of value. To a prospective reader, I'd say that this book is invaluable. You may never make a film they way this book describes, but you WILL need to know why not ! Do what I did - read it, then read it again and make notes, lots of them !"},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"The Five C's of Cinematography is basically a rule book on the form of motion picture making as it relates to camera angles, movements and editing. This book is the \\"bible\\" or rule book of the techniques of film making, such as painting has composition rules itself. A true artist not only knows the rules, but understands the rules of why it is used. The Five C's does all that, it shows and explains the what therefores and hows. It even shows the wrongs in a clear fashion, which is amazing since this is a book of still images about a medium of moving images.The best artists knew the rules of their art, and either followed them or break them to get the effect they wanted. If one does not know the rules, one can not realize the effect they are creating by breaking the rules. That is why most modern artists of today seem muddled and unfocused and Picasso still evokes and moves one. Picasso knew the rules. This book will help one know the rules of film.The images and wording may be dated, even quaint, but once one looks past such superficial cosmetics, the information is a gold mine of a very large vein in information"},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"This is a classic book (1965) about camera rules in cinematography. You can learn in this book all about axis and 180-degree rule. A lot of photos makes easy to understand all. But this is not a book about direction techniques. If you are interested in camera techniques, you must read this book, but also you must read other books about direction, montage, script etc... This is indispensable but not enough.These books are very interesting about direction: \\"Film Directing Fundamentals\\" by Nicholas Proferes, \\"Cinematic Storytelling\\" by Jennifer Van Sijll and \\"Hichcock\\" by Francois Truffaut (an absolute classic). About Script I recommend: \\"The Writer's Journey\\" by Christopher Vogler, \\"The Art Of Dramatic Writing\\" by Lajos Egri, \\"The Anatomy Of Story\\" by John Truby and \\"Writing your screenplay\\" by Cynthia Whitcomb."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"When I was just starting out as an animation storyboard artist, this book was recommended as \\"THE BOOK\\" for learning the language of film storytelling. It is clear and well-organized--with no fluff or nonsense. The principles are timeless, and since it was written at the tail end of the Hollywood studio system, it does not fall into any of the bad filmmaking traps that started to pop up in the late sixties. The photo illustrations are perfectly-suited to communicate the important points of clear storytelling.In 1994 this book was long out of print, and I paid about $150 for a used copy...so be very happy that this is once again available, and at a reasonable price!"},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"I find it absurd and utterly ridiculous that some reviewer were disappointed of this book because it doesn't contain \\"cutting edge 21st century\\" imagery from the latest hollywood blockbusters. What those people would expect? That the book is filled with tons of star wars production shot? I'm glad that the pictures are B&W;, at least they don't distract the concentration.I cant say more on behalf of this book more that others didn't say before me. The book is great. A must have for everyone interested in cinematography. For those lacking \\"better\\" pictures I suggest the various comic books and the kind of \\"how star wars was made\\" type books."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"I believe a filmmaker should know the logistics of the film camera and it's movements so that the outcome of a Film will be greater than expected. Kurosawa, Hitchcock and a great many directors knew, which is why many of their films are enduring. Mascelli writes a book breaking down and defining how an audience percieves a movie as a whole through shots. As long as you know this you can take your film to new heights, like Tarantino... But the basics are essential and every director must know what she/he is getting when a cinematograoher shoots YOUR film. This book should be a part of any filmmakers collection, studied and mastered. Also great for the cinematographer who works with directors who can not put their film into technical terms, as referring to the camera."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"Hey!On the front cover of this book there's an \\"American Cinematographer\\" quote saying: \\"The 5 C's of Cinematography is one of the three most important books on cinematic technique ever published.\\" So, what about the others two?

I'll try another book."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"I first read this book in 1965 when it came out and I was a film student. It was the single most helpful book on filmmaking I came across (John Alton's &quot;Painting with Light&quot; is great also, on cinematography). This is the grammar book of the language of classical cinematic style. It sets out the rules used by generations of directors, cinematographers and editors for expressing drama, feelings and ideas. Here is the standard Hollywood style -- which audiences have become so used to that it virtually disappears. What's interesting to me is to break those rules, and this book gives you lots of places to begin. Essential."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"Extremely interesting book. First one I have ever read about cinematography techniques. I found many items discussed that are \\"common sense\\", so that that book is useful not only to those who are going to make movies, but also to those who watch them with more than casual interest. The book is full of practical advice about a wide range of topics such as how to avoid \\"jump cuts\\" -- transitions from shot-to-shot that may jar or disorient the viewer because, among other things, the point of view of the camera has changed in an \\"unexpected\\" way.I was impressed by Mascelli's understanding of the perceptions and cognitions of a movie viewer, and how a movie maker should accommodate these. For example, if an airplane is to fly from Los Angeles to New York, it should be shown on film as taking off from left to right, because most people instinctively associate the left side of the screen as representing a westerly direction and the right side of the screen representing an easterly direction, much as maps are oriented. Further, to avoid a jarring sensation, if the next shot is to show the airplane's pilot, he should be shown facing \\"east\\", the direction of flight established in the previous long shot, that is, facing toward (looking in the direction of) the right of the screen. Upon a little reflection, this all makes sense, but may not be immediately obvious. These are the kinds of practical insights he offers throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"The 5 C's of Cinematography cover camera angles, continuity, cutting, close-ups and composition. This book is an technical power-house that is clear, descriptive and easily understood to one who frequently watches movies and has a visual mind. It explains the psychology of the eye and how we are trained and use to watching movement and cuts. It promotes off the cuff method of filming as well as standard composition to not confuse and distract the audience. A must buy, this is the best film book on the market."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"I have recently read this masterpiece and I must say that it is difficult to watch a film the same way I did a month ago. I watch films on more visual terms, and I find the techniques diffrent camaramen use very interesting. The techniques that are disscussed in this book are very much in use in today's films, and it is impossible to not notice it"},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"If I could I'd give this 3 and half stars, but the sytem won't let me.At first I was very disappointed by this book, because much of the material seemed very basic to me. But as I got into the later chapters I realized there is a pretty good amount of information for not only cinematographers and camera operators, but also directors and editors. True, it is dated in terms of the writing style and photos (man are they funny), and the structure/organization of the book is more encyclopedic rather than like a how-to book (a complaint of a previous reviewer who clearly doesn't understand writing style vs bad writing). However, I think every film maker will find something useful. This book covers composition, framing, camera angles, and continuity techniques more than any other book out there. For that reason I think it is a solid addition to any film maker's library.The other two books I would add to it would be Kris Malciewicz' Cinematography (3rd edition) for all the technicals about lighting and gripology, and finally John Alton's Painting with light. (see my reviews of these books). This trio of books will give anyone a solid foundation in cinematography."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"Decades after its first printing, this is still a rock-solid primer for understanding the basics of cinematography. It could probably stand to be updated with some newer images (all the stuff that's in here looks quite dated), but Mascelli's techniques are still as useful today as they were when the book was first printed.My only real complaint is that it's not wire- or spiral-bound, so there's no way to set it down while you're setting up shots to actually go through the motions of what you're learning."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"... that filmmakers today should read!!! See, the audience isn't supposed to be AWARE of the camera, just like magicians aren't supposed to make you aware of how the trick is performed. This - of course, goes against the grain of the MTV school of filmmaking were the the camera appears to be mounted on a pneumatic drill, and the goal of the cinematographer is to make you dizzy by zooming in and out as rapidly as possible. The goal is to suspend disbelief, support the action - and, where possible, enhance with subtle visual metaphore on a level that truly works at the subconscious level. The best cinematography is when you're not aware of it consciously... a thankless job. This book is a roadmap of how to do that. Many cinematographers today are hotdogs; and the equivalent of hambone actors. Didn't read this book, obviously.In a sense, cinematography (like editing and direction) works best when you're not aware of it. How do you tell a bad actor? When you're aware of their acting. How do you tell bad cinematography? ...This book has become timeless and it deserved to. This along with the American Cinematographer Manual are the only two texts you need. I would read each 3 times apiece before I bought four other books on the subject."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this book. The pictures are dated, but the techniques are as up to date as ever. If you film you should have the 5 C's memorized and they will become second nature to you. This book is inexpensive enough that everyone should have it in their collection. After I read this book I thought maybe I should sell it, and then decided no, this is one of those classics worth keeping and is a handy reference. It's packed with lots of tib bits of information. Well worth the money, worth reading, and worth highlighting and worth it as a reference."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"Written more than forty years ago, you can only add to this book. The techniques discussed are classic, timeless, and undisputed. That which can be added to the book is a result of having a solid grasp of the book. In other words, break the rules with a purpose that works.Read the book then read it again, and again. If you are an experienced filmmaker, use it for reference and as a reminder. The book creates an awareness of what works, what doesn't, and why. A thorough understanding of the principles will allow you to side-step many pitfalls in pre-production, production, and post-production.Because of the amount of information presented, I think the book would work well as a curriculum textbook. Setting up the techniques in a lab/studio situation would be to the benefit of almost everyone entering the motion-picture/video field. Until then, get the book, read it, and heed it."},{"Title":"The Five C's of Cinematography: Motion Picture Filming Techniques","review":"There's no getting around the fact that sequences and shot selection make any motion picture or video work. But, rather than learn the basics and apply them, folks jump to jazzy stuff like helocopter shots or talking hardware spec's. This book talks about shots, sequences all in with a focus on what to shoot and how it cuts together.Basic techniques are directly applied in a practical fashion. Use it to get a solid grounding before getting stars in your eyes.Great for new cinematographers and news videographers"},{"Title":"Caldecott","review":"Robert Funt has written a few poignant poems in this volume, but most reflect a rye sense of humor and an almost slap-dash style that makes the reading easy, and the self-deprecating humor both accessible and touching.

It is a seminal work that belongs on any Cubanologist's bookshelf, and an essential text for anyone reading to prepare for a trip to the island. It is also an important work for those with only a passing interest in the specifics of Havana's built environment, but who are interested in urban history, architectural forms, state socialism, or Cuba's post-Soviet transition."},{"Title":"Havana, (Cuba): Two Faces of the Antillean Metropolis","review":"Joseph Scarpaci is a well-known expert on Cuba, especially in affairs dealing with urban planning and related subjects. Having studied with Dr. Scarpaci on a short academic trip to Cuba, I can personally testify to his expansive knowledge base. This book, a compilation of information dealing with the history and development of Havana, is a must-have for anyone interested in learning more about Havana, and Cuba overall. Though much of the book focuses on the history of the capital, those who are interested in learning about contemporary Cuba will find a wealth of information on why Cuba has developed the way it has. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five, is that the reader must be made aware that this is a scholarly work, so those accustomed to reading only fiction for pleasure may find the style a bit difficult. However, this is an outstanding piece of work that should be in the house of any person truly interested in discovering more about Cuba."},{"Title":"Divine Office (Divine Prayer)","review":"This is an abbreviated version of the _Divine Office_, the British version of the Liturgy of the Hours. In the US the one volume \\"short\\" version of the liturgy of the hours is called \\"Christian Prayer\\". CP is sliced and abridged out of the 4 volume official US translation. _Daily Prayer_ is the British equivalent to this. It has Morning and Evening prayer in a psalter, and separate psalters for Night prayer, an abbreviated Daytime prayer psalter, and just the psalter with no readings for the Office of Readings (No readings for Readings, hmmn. I'm too sleepy at 3AM for them anyway ;^). There is a proper of seasons and propers and commons of saints, doctors of the church and such. The book is medium hard to use, but you should know that these volumes are notoriously difficult for the uninitiated. US customers should know that this is not the official version of the Liturgy of the Hours for the US. If your reason for prayer is to pray along with the greater church, this volume is not approved by the US bishops. (It is approved in many other countries, however)The book is a nice size, a little smaller than the Pauline Christian Prayer version. I really like it.Now if I could just find an equivalent version in Latin... and get my Latin back up to speed to use it ;^) Peace."},{"Title":"Exploring Canada's Spectacular National Parks","review":"This book consists of essays, or rather travel notes, put together by a National Georgaphic team. They write about their impressions from travelling through Canada's national parks by boat, horse, or by foot. They write about everything they see, stories they are told by the natives, the weather, their findings in the forest, their guides, etc. The photographs in the book are as stunning as you would expect from National Geographic photographers. However, if you are planning to go to one of these parks, you would hardly find any useful information in this book. There are no maps, no info on activities, lodging, not even clear information how to get to the location where the beautiful pictures in the book were taken. This book is a good choice to read if you want are curious about Canada's national parks, but have no intention of going there."},{"Title":"Buggies, Blizzards, and Babies (Iowa Heritage Collection)","review":"Cora Frear Hawkins was born in Iowa in 1887. As the daughter of a rural doctor, Cora had the experience of travelling with her father on medical calls and assisting with his practice as she got older. This book is a memoir of those times with her father. It opens with a blizzard that he went out in just before she was born, and closes with his death more than forty years later. It is a slim volume and a quick, smooth read. The chapters are loosely grouped around subject areas such as the life of the wife of a doctor, the buggy and horses that the doctor used, and her period as an office assistant.I am delighted to see that the book has been reprinted. It is well-written enough to be of interest to general readers of all ages. In addition, it should be of specific interest to anyone interested in the history of women, pioneer medicine, or that particular time in US history. Cora herself inspired at least one book for younger readers, so if you are familiar with the book Cora Frear, this might be worth reading as well."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems 2 (Game Programming Gems (W/CD)) (Vol 2)","review":"Like the first volume, Game Programming Gems 2 features an exceptional collection of articles written by a knowledgeable group of authors, most of whom are well-known and respected in the area they write about. This series (the third volume is already underway, as are related books focusing on AI and design) isn't intended to be a complete guide to all aspects of game development, but rather, a resource you turn to when you need help with a specific problem. As such, the series truly shines, and this volume is a worthy follow up to the first.The articles, or gems, included in the book cover intermediate to advanced topics in the areas of general programming, mathematics, artificial intelligence, geometry management, graphics display, and audio programming, each edited by an expert in the field. Most of the gems assume that you have a fundamental knowledge of the issues related to the topic, and get to the point quickly. As a result, on average the gems are shorter than the previous volume. Both of these things could be viewed as either positives or negatives, depending on your experience level. Regardless, almost all of the gems are well written and relevant.Most game programming books these days come with CDs packed full of demos, source code, and other information supplementing the book. Unfortunately, the CD that comes with this book isn't one of those. It does have source code from most of the chapters, but there are very few demos and no extras (unless you count GLUT and the DX8 SDK, which I don't since you can easily get those elsewhere). However, I'd count the CD as only a minor disappointment, since the book itself is so good.If you're serious about game development, I'd highly recommend adding Gems 2 to your library. You'll definitely find things in it that you can use."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems 2 (Game Programming Gems (W/CD)) (Vol 2)","review":"I like this book a lot, though it isn't quite as good as the previous edition (partly because the first one was great)This book didn't have any real networking tips, which in this day and age seems a bit odd. Hopefully there will be a gems 3 and that will include some net stuff.It also had a few odd typos. Some of the gems were *very* short (1 or 2 pages), when it seemed like a slightly more detailed discussion would be nice.Other than those small problems, I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to any game programmers that want to pick up a few useful tips."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems 2 (Game Programming Gems (W/CD)) (Vol 2)","review":"You don't have to be programming a game to find the gems like the ones for rendering and geometry useful.To get a feel for the quality of the gems I looked at the gem on &quot;The Parallel Transport Frame&quot;. I'd encountered this problem myself when trying to get VRML extrusions to work properly. VRML extrusions use Frenet frames so fail when the curve has an inflection. I came up with the same solution as the one described in this gem, and I'm sure many others have reinvented this particular wheel. The gem accurately describes the problem and solution and if I'd had it while I was messing with VRML extrusions it would have saved me some trouble.Recommended."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems 2 (Game Programming Gems (W/CD)) (Vol 2)","review":"Game Programming Gems 2 is a collection of short articles detailing various aspects of computer game design. Personally, I found the first half of the book to be very helpful while the second half, on rendering and audio techniques, was too brief and lacked the depth to be of much use. However, the first half, covering general game programming technique and mathematics has proved very useful to me in my amateur game programming endavours.Pick up this book if you are looking to add to your reference collection however, due to the nature of the articles and due to the price, you might find yourself heading to the library to pick up this book.

I can still open it up, to this day, and learn something brand new.Gershom Scholem was a professor of Jewish mysticism at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem until his death in 1982. Among his works are 'Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism', 'The Messianic Idea in Judaism', 'Origins of the Kabbalah', 'Kabbalah', 'On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism', 'On the Mystical Shape of the Godhead', and 'Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah'. Every book is a treasure in and of itself. Mr. Scholem put the Kabbalah back on the 20th century map. His studies on the 'Sefer Yetzirah (Book of Creation)', 'The Bahir (Bright)', and 'The Zohar (Splendor)' show the brillance of this unique individual.The 'Kabbalah' is written in 3 parts. The 1st is the Kabbalah itself; from the beginings of mysticism up to modern times (including the disaster brought on by Sabbatai Sevi, that very nearly destroyed Judaism for 250 years afterwards). He also shows the Hasid's (the Ultra-Orthadox Jews) and how the Kabbalah and the Zohar influance their teachings and beliefs. He also shows why regular Orthadox Jews avoid the Kabbalah (calling it Jewish withcraft) and why they considear the Hasid's to be cultists of a sort (even though the Kabbalah WAS Orthadox Judaism for 300 years before the advent of Sabbatai Sevi - which Mr. Scholem painfully points out). He also shows the inept handling by the 'Christian Kabbalists' and occultists in general - neither group prepared to do the initial research that was needed. Both groups had different agendas and used the Kabbalah to further those particular goals.The 2nd part is chocked full of enough goodies to make you swear off dieting for good. The Zohar, the Shabbatean movement, the Frankists, demonology, gemaria (bible codes that change what the Torah says to something else entirly [the book 'The Bible Code' is an excellent example] to eventualy write a '6th Book of Moses' written entirly out of codes is the Kabbalists eventual goal), how to make a Golem, Thrown (merkabah) mysticism, and much much more.Lastly, it has the peaple and their histories that make this book such a delight to read. Azriel of Gerona, Moses Cordovero, Joseph Gikatilla, and many more. The 'Lion' and his 'Cubs' give their roar as well.If you have to buy one book on the Kabbalah, then this is the book to get. You will not be sorry in the least.Sincerly, Shawn W. Ooten"},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"The great historian/scholar of Kabbalah, Gershom Scholem, wrote a huge entry on Kabbalah to be used in an encyclopedia of Judaism. This was later published in book form--this is that book. It is NOT a good first-timer, entry-level book on Kabbalah. It IS a wonderful reference work on the subject--probably the best in existence. It's entries are voluminous, even exhaustive. He includes short biographies of major Kabbalists as well as chapters on the main concepts of Kabbalah, origins, etc. etc. etc. Kabbalah, by its very nature, is not a unified study or set of beliefs, but the thinking of many, varied mystics over centuries. Many of the ideas evolved, and like virtually all of Judaism, includes disagreements, antithetical arguments, and historical developments (see the Talmud or even, to a smaller extent, the Zohar). As Scholem stated elsewhere in reference to the Kabbalists, \\"Like all mystics, they were at once conservatives and radicals\\" in \\"The Messianic Idea in Judaism\\" Schocken Books NY 1971 page 48. Furthermore, as he stated in \\"Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism\\" (Schocken Books NY 1972) on page 229, \\"The study of mysticism is similar to the attempt to imagine the content of a shell whose core has never been seen by the scholar\\" quoted by Moshe Idel in \\"Kabbalah: New Perspectives\\" (Yale University Press New Haven, CT 1988) on page 37. Thus, while this book is a work of art (or at least of scholarship), is not a practitioner's manual. However, practicing Kabbalists would do well to absorb the important concepts, background, and context provided so well in this and other Scholem works. As Knowledge Management teaches us, you don't have knowledge without context, and knowledge is actionable, information is not."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"While working on my BA in Religious Studies at CSUF in '74 I took a course in 'Jewish Mysticism' taught by the distinguished and late Rabbi Joseph Kalir. Our one and only textbook for that class was Gershom Scholem's 'Kabbalah.'This is not an easy read by any means, not one of those recent releases that have become so popular in the last couple of years. One of those, 'Living Better Through Kabbalah' pieces of trash. This is the real thing. 'Kabbalah' will demand your time and attention to read and understand, but if you put in the supreme effort you will be rewarded with real knowledge and depth of what awaits for the true devotee. It's a book you'll keep in your library and refer back to over and over again because there's no way to remember so much.One of the essential texts on the subject. If you haven't read this, you aren't a kabbalist."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"I have learned a great deal from KABALLAH. It is a cross-section of the research of Herr Doktor Gershom Scholem. Each topic is given a concise explanation, including personalities and bibliographic references. When I first read this book, I found the explanations a bit terse. The density of information was overwhelming. Now, that I am more familiar with the work of Professor Scholem, I find this text to be an excellent review. If you are interested in the research of Professor Scholem or in the Kabbalah's historical development, this will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"This is really a great reference work on Kabbalah. You should read it through from cover to cover once, and then refer back to it from time to time while reading other books on Kabbalah as needed. I don't think there is another book which covers every period and teacher of Kabbalah from every period, even to the pre-medieval roots of Kabbalah in Old Testament times, as well as it's influences such as gnosticism and neoplatonism. How one relates to the other, etc. it's all in here. As other reviewers have noted, this is not a &quot;how to&quot; book, but a book for serious students of Kabbalah which you will always need to find other texts for studying Kabbalah."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"The book Kaballah by Gershom Scholem is certainly an extensive, and complete (to my knowledge) examination of the kaballah, however, it contains some major drawbacks that prevent it from recieving my full recommendation.As a high school junior doing an independent study on religion, I chose this book from the recommendations that said that it was a good overview, a good book for a beginner. I found, however, that this praise was highly misleading.The book is divided into sections: history, basic ideas, topics, and personalities. Each of these sections are subdivided into chapters, each a few pages long.Many of these chapters are interesting, but they lack full explaination of the ideas included. Often, there was just a list of facts and opposing viewpoints, and when i found a sentence that was interesting, Scholem would immediately move on to another source, another name, another viewpoint. Pages would go by before the point of the chapter could be discerned, and even then, was often revealed only vaguely. The hebrew transliterations were also difficult to navigate, for after the english translation was given once, it was as though the reader was simply expected to know it. The chapters often consisted of page after page of other books to look at, other authors to read.As a general overview for a beginner, Kaballah certainly does not qualify. I later learned that the book was written as an encyclopedia, a reference book for scholars. For someone who already had a knowledge of the Kaballah and its ideas, as well as a knowledge of hebrew, Kaballah is most likely a much more interesting and useful book to own. As for someone beginning their studies into this esoteric and mysterious branch of judaism, a more simple, fact based book would serve a much more useful purpose."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"Scholem originally intended much of the material in this book to be entries in an encyclopedia and anyone approaching this book without that knowledge may find it's organization confusing. However his detailed & scholarly (dare I say intellectual) analysis of Kabbalah's fascinating history and colorful characters is unparalleled. He digs deep into the similarities and contradictions between the different Kabbalistic traditions & teachers, citing an exhaustive list of references in the process. The research into this material is quite deep and I have yet to see another work which comes as close to an indepth analysis of Kabbalistic history & literature as this one does.Having said that, this book is NOT for the layperson. And by layperson I mean anyone not familiar with Judaism and the basic religious/spiritual Hebrew vocabulary. Despite the fact that this wasn't originally intended as a \\"book\\" per se, the writing is awkward at times even within the major chapters as he jumps from concept to concept with little transition. In order to really get an idea as to the full exposition of any one topic it is necessary to go to the index and refer back page by page as he does not organize material concisely or summarize anything.All in all, this is a MUST for anyone seriously interested in Kabbalah--I do pronounce that this book has probably and might continue to separate the wheat from the chaff as far as serious students of Hebrew mysticism & dabblers are concerned. Anyone who can read this book and understand it's contents has already put in a great deal of study into the topic and those who don't understand but get called into a further understanding through additional investigation can honestly call themselves students of Kabbalah if they so wish. Everyone else may only be armchair enthusiasts and that's OK too - this book is not for the dabbler but for the serious student."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"The late professor G. G. Scholem has penned the second best historical record on the mystery cult of the Pharisees. Dr. C. David Ginsburg by far did the best job in his published 1865 essay to the Philosophy and Literature Society of Liverpool entitled Kabbalah: Doctrines, Development and Literature."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"One of the greates books i ever read.So on point, so much information which will like to equal amount of research, A.e waite was thorough, he did an Excellent job in explanation; It opened my mind to so many other areas you would not believe. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"Sholem is so far the most rigorous historian of the jewish mysical mouvements.This book is an audacious attempt to give us a synthesis of a period of almost 2000 years, on all the different philosophical streams and popular beliefs that brought to the birth of the kabbalah. Describing how rich and influent it was in its speculative quest through out History, Sholem shows on the impact the kabbalah had on Science because of its approach of a \\"mathematical world\\".But Sholem denounces the other aspect of the kabbalah, the superstitions , the black magic,and even the white magic and other aspects that he classifies as tools in the hands of manipulators."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"Kabbalah by Gershom Scholem is not for the beginner. He traces the history and roots of Kabbalism and the Zohar. He was a professor of Jewish mysticism and writes as an academic. A beginner will be lost in the technical explanations. If you are familiar with Kabbalism, and want to understand the roots, history and how it has influenced everything from Freemasonry to Mormonism to mainstream Christianity, it is an excellent book. Gershom Scholem was the acknowledged authority on Kabbalism."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"If you are interested in Kabbalah's history and facts, definitions and biographies of the main figures that contributed to the evolution and development of Kabbalah - this book is for you.Although, if you are a member of one of the popular kabbalah organisation, you might be disappointed, since you would not find in it \\"slogans\\" of hope and motivation."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"I purhcased this book because I am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism. I have often heard references to the Kabbalah and I wanted to learn more about its contents. I am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the Kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.If I were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had I been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that Scholem discussed, I would have been fine. However, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by Scholem. There is simply too much jargon and Scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.If you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent. However, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of Jewish Mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"This book just proves that religion is something the world does not need. You can get the same effect of this book by reading a Dungeons and Dragons rule guide or listening to a Helloween song.Avoid."},{"Title":"KABBALAH","review":"If you are interested in Kabbala, it is best approached within the framework of a lifestyle observant of Jewish Law.As one reads Gershon Scholem's books the thoughtful reader will quickly realize that he does not believe what he is writing. His point of view is intellectual only and he did not in his lifetime practice.Anyone can take some of the principles of Kabbala and use them to get some pretty cool results. The unfortunate thing is that the earlier comment that you can get the same feelings from reading a dungeons and dragons book was absolutely true. The author of the Zoar, and the real kabalistic texts assume that the only people reading them would be Torah Observant Jews.For the Kabbala to be explored, even slightly, requires the same strict adherence to Torah that the early masters had. Anything less is folly. Yes you can have nice feelings that are real, but you can get those practicing tai chi, you can meditate deeply, but anyone can do that counting sheep.These people who say that this books and all others by Gershon Scholem are a waste of time are correct, but don't allow that to convince you that Kabbala is not of value. He did not know that he approached it in the wrong way, but you don't have to.If you are interested in learning Kabbala do not purchase this book."},{"Title":"Patio Escapes","review":"Judith Kahn has written a one of a kind restaurant guide for the person(s) looking for a chance to enjoy good food and a beautiful outdoor atmosphere.

If you live in the area or are planning a trip, this book will make a difference in your vacation. Mentioned are independent restaurants, hotels dining and wineries. Ms. Kahn shares the signiture dish, info on the wine list and what is different about each locale. Whether you are planning a daytime outing or spending a few nights in the area, you will find a &quot;Patio Escape&quot; to add to your enjoyment.

After reading The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination I was convinced that the Reformed position is the most Biblical. It lays the case for Calvinism before the reader in such clear language that he can not misunderstand what the Refomed position really teaches. It is very persuasive in refuting the arguments against predestination while laying a solid biblical foundation for it's teachings. Boettner is very thorough in his use of Scripture to support his arguments. Anyone wishing to understand Calvinism must read this book. Boettner's arguments are so powerful that they demand your assent. This book was life changing."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Anyone interested in the Reformed faith (or Calvinism) should start here. It is easy to read and suited for the layperson. The book is divided into six sections: In the first section he deals with terms and concepts related to predestination (e.g., the sovereignty of God, the providence of God, the foreknowledge of God, etc.). The first section is an excellent start-off point for the reader. The second section deals with the five points (or TULIP). Boettner does an excellent job explaining what each of the five points mean (and what it does NOT mean). The third section deals with common objections presented by non-Calvinists against the Calvinistic understanding of predestination. Boettner, again, does a fine job refuting the typical arguments of non-Calvinists. The fourth section deals with issues of salvation by grace, personal assurance, predestination in the physical world, etc. The fifth chapter deals with the practical importance of the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination. Finally, the sixth chapter deals with the history of Calvinism. The chapters are well written and makes a good case for the Calvinistic system. Boettner presents his arguments well and anticipants and responds to possible objections in each chapter. The only problem I have with this book is its postmillennial bias (this is especially evident in his final chapter on the history of Calvinism). This is the only downfall of the book. In order for Boettner to relieve the \\"harsher\\" aspects of predestination, he advocates the idea that in the end more people will be in heaven than in hell. Of course, we should let the Bible speak for itself and not try to sugar-coat it with hypotheses to \\"soften\\" difficult truths taught in the Bible. Another downfall of the book is its age. Many contemporary readers will find that some of the issues that Boettner brings up are obsolete. Overall, though, a good introductory level book on the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner's book explains clearly that God is 100% sovereign and accomplishes what He purposed BEFORE the world was made. People will allow God to be sovereign in everything but the affairs of man, especially in salvation. This book refutes point by point the arguments against the absolute sovereignty of God. This book clears up one of the main arguments of Arminians--that if God is the ultimate means by which ALL things happen, even bad things--this makes God the author of evil. This Arminian argument is swept away by Boettner's clear explanation concerning the absolute RIGHT that God has with HIS creatures to do as He decides. This leaves us totally in awe of God's holiness. We are reduced to humility and thankfulness for the grace that God exercised in our individuaL lives. EVERY christian should be required to read this book before entering any debate concerning God's dealings with sinful mankind. Boettner sets out explaining the doctrine and then in section III he takes on the obvious objections to the doctrine. Read this book first."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"After reading this book you will have a better understanding of what Calvinism is and what it is not. The book goes into not only a defense for it but also the practical aspects of Calvinism. From explaining each point of this doctrine to answering questions about predestination in it relationship to this doctrine. It goes to the subject of man's \\"Freewill\\" and God's foreknowledge. Everything you every wanted to know about Calvinism is in this book. It could very well be known as a systematic theology of Calvinism.Great study on the doctrines of Grace.\\"To God Alone Be The Glory\\" because of his amazing Grace"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"I read this book many years ago and have since re-read it several times. Each time I pick it up I discover new truths. This is simply because much of what Boettner writes is so concise that you tend to underappreciate the depths of his explanations on the first reading - he is that good! Boettner packs more into one paragraph than many authors are able to do with an entire chapter! Make no mistake, a second reading will be required to \\"get\\" many of these concepts, perhaps the most difficult in all of theology. I am certain that I still have not gotten everything to be gotten out of this fantastic book. Also of note are the sections that offer counter arguments to the typical Arminianistic or \\"free-will\\" objections. These are pretty good answers on the whole and I have used them successfully with the opposing campers -- very useful counterpoints. Here's a tip for you, if you think of this book as a good \\"college level\\" course in Calvinism, then consider picking up \\"Still Sovereign\\" edited by Schreiner and Ware, which would be at a \\"graduate\\" level. Both books are highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is the book that convinced me of the &quot;predestinatory&quot; claims of reformed doctrine. It is set out in a most logical way with an abundance of corresponding Scripture passages. If you are not convinced about the claims of Calvinism regarding predestination and the sovereignty of God, then this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is the book that has helped many to see that the Bible clearly teaches that God is good AND sovereign.Boettner graciously answers many questions about the Biblical doctrine of predestination. He shows that those who object to the doctrine cannot escape from its implications if they believe the Bible to be authoritative.He also shows that denying the Bible's teaching that God is sovereign greatly devalues the God of the Bible, and leaves us in a much worse position.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Dr. Boettner's book is one of the best works I have ever read on the doctrine of predestination from a Reformed perspective. The book is not a book that debates and ignores the issues but takes the reader directly to the Word of God as the source for its foundation.Whether you are a Calvinist or an Arminian, you would do yourself well to purchase this book and digest the meat found therein. The book, while covering a rather deep subject, remains quite easy to read and the content of Dr. Boettner's thoughts flow together easily.A great book!"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"\\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\\" is the most thorough and well argued explanation and defense of this doctrine I have ever read. It is based on scripture with lots of helpful quotes and extended explanations from some of the greatest theologians from Augustine forward to the early twentieth century. Boettner argues with the passion of a convert, but uses reason and sound analysis to present an excellent case. If you want to know what Reformed Christians and Presbyterians believe about God's sovereignty I highly recommend this book.One problem: Dr. Boettner is so gung-ho and excited about Reformed theology and Presbyterianism that to those who are not convinced some of this book comes across like a Calvinistic pep rally. If you are not a convinced Calvinist hear him out because there is a lot of good food for thought here."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is the most reasonable, thorough and concise explanations I have ever read on the topic of election and predestination. Though at times Boettner does tend to be a bit long winded and does also throw in a bit of his post-millennial views, this is probably one of the best works that any Calvinist (or even Arminian or Palagean) to read."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Loraine Boettner's 1932 book, \\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\\" is one of the finest pieces of Reformed literature that I have encountered.

I highly recommend its reading for those who are new to the faith and to long-time followers."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This book has a lot of interesting ideas. I believe that Calvinism is true because this book backs up all of its ideas with Scripture references,and if bible is true so is this book."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Before anyone gives me a hard time for that title I didn't invent it Charles Spurgeon said it in his book \\"In defense of Calvinism\\". This is a very good book on the subject of Reform theology and predestination. Though I am not a Calvinist because of it, but because of my own studies in the scriptures. My daughter came home from colledge and told me she was a Calvinist. I decided I would do a thourgh study and show her why she was wrong, of course first I had to find out exactly what Calvinism was. I did that then I started in Genesis and worked my way through the bible, I found not only could I not disprove the doctrine of Calvinism but must embrace it. This book is a very well presented explanation of this doctrine. I highly recomend it. I also highly recomend R. C. Sproul's book \\"What is Reform Theology?\\". Oh and to the contrary of one of the one star reviewers R. C. Sproul does not say God is the author of sin but he says the opposite. This book presents a true understanding of the scriptures. When I aproached this subject I did it with a disire to find the truth, if you do the same I believe you will come to the same conclusion I did."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Perhaps the most comprehensive modern work on one of the bible's most contoversial subjects. I read this book as a staunch anti Calvinist, anti predestinarian but I read it very prayerfully as I do all serious doctrinal books. And I came away a staunch believer in this BIBLICAL doctrine. And I became a bit appalled at myself and most of the modern church for misrepresenting it, failing to consider it, and understand it - what a disservice to truth.Since I read this i've read all Boettner's books - the millennium is his other greatest book. I now buy this book 4 or 5 at a time and give it to Christian friends. And have come away knowing that those who disregard and disbelieve this doctrine have gone to great strides to isogete, twist and ignore scripture's teaching and they do so at their own peril. The historical misrepresentation of this doctrine should be considered an affront to the church."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Armininism is the theology god of today.

And two leaders who sing the The Declaration of Independence in 1776 were Calvinist.But all the documents, history of Calvinism, and theological (Biblical) proof are true and well written it's logical and totally Biblical. The book state about the failure of John Arminius on his points about Salvation and a proven biblically Research that state that his doctrine is not Biblical and was rejected by Synod of Dort, \\"We are save not for our own strength nor for our cooperation with God if only by God Grace that we are save\\"."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"If the Doctrine of Predestination is true,and I believe it is,then human beings are nothing but mere preprogramed robots. Mankind has no free will. We were created to entertain an evil creator.We are nothing but toys to be used and abused and tossed into the trash,ie: Hell, much like a temper tantrum ridden two year would do. The fact that God has a right to do with us or to us what he pleases because he is God makes him no less evil.If God created ALL then that includes evil. God predestined some to salvation and the rest of humanity to damnation. Oh,but he loves us. For God so loved the world he arbitrarily chose to damn the majority of it.

However, when I go back to the scripture, the whole system seems to fall apart. The whole theme of Hebrews and much of 2 Peter deal with the apostasy of a believer(s)--not 'apparent apostasy or a scenario that could never really happen to a real believer'--but true bonifide apostasy!I could go on and on but I no longer see the point. For the Arminian view has truly won out in the arena of ideas. I have come to realize that 1) True Calvinist are rare and hard to find within Christendom and 2) they have become the theological Amish of the protestant world-fun to look at but never really seriously considered by the thinking world of the protestant faith."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This Book, I believe, is a great work concerning what Calvinism is and is not. It also has a wonderful section on the History of Calvinism, which does prove enlightening to those who accuse John Calvin about the burning of Severtus.

I was a confirmed Arminian before I read this book. This book is not all about the Doctrines of Predestination, but rather they are also about the Doctrines of Election, Total Depravity, The Nature of the New Birth, and the Power of the Holy Spirit to perservere. This book does a great job of not only presenting the doctrines in a well organized fashion, but is throughly Biblical and encounters and respectfully answers questions and criticisms, everything from &quot;The Perserverance of the Saints is antinominalism,&quot; to, &quot;It is in violation of man's free agency&quot;...all the sections regarding those objections are throughly answered.

This book is appoximately 400 pages and slightly less than half the book covers the biblical explanation of what the Five Points of Calvinism, while another significant portion of the book devotes an apologetic defense of this doctrine and debunks a lot of myths and misconceptions typically presented by opponents of this doctrine. Boettner also devotes the final portion of the book revealing the history of Calvinism from the time of the reformation up to the 20th century.The only thing that's slightly bothersome about this book is that it was written over 70 years ago, so some of the language used is a bit dated and the Bible verses given are presented in the old American Standard Version, which reads very similar to the King James Version. I used my own NIV Bible as a cross reference while reading this book.Overall, it's a classic and a must-have for anyone who desires to understand the truth of God's Sovereignty and Grace and man's total inability to come to God on his own for salvation."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This book is a phenomenal work. I would recommend it to anyone seeking more information on Calvinism. Boettner addresses the difficult issues with the doctrine very adeptly and provides the reader with a very solid understanding of the Biblical basis and practical implications of the doctrine.A must read for any reformed theologian/enthusiast and strongly recommended to opponents to the doctrine or those seeking more information on the reformed perspective to this Biblical teaching."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is a book about Calvinism written for those who don't really understand it, or have a limited understanding. He goes into great depth, but doesnt make the reader feel like they would need a Masters in Theology to know what he's talking about.Good exegessis of scripture, and fantastic answers to the objections most Calvinists face. I'm glad he didnt make a straw man out of Arminian doctrine, I think he gives a fair and honest representation of what Arminianism is.I'd give in 4.5 stars if I could.The only problem I had with the book is that it goes too far in saying or implyhing that God is the author of Sin.....not sure if I was just reading it wrong, but a couple of passages made me sit up and go back over what I'd just read. This has been a reaction of a lot of Calvinists who overstate the position of Calvin, but clearly he can't mean this as he quotes from the Westminster confession on Election.The grammar and style of writing can be a bit old, my edition is from the 1950's so thats gotta say something about it.Its still a great read after all these years, and a worthy addition to your Theology collection."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This Book, I believe, is a great work concerning what Calvinism is and is not.

At the time this was revealed to me, I was unaware that I was among His elect. It never ocurred to me to feel outrage, though I observed and still observe this emotion in people, particularly in people who claim to love God. The mere thought of shaking a fist in God's face frightened me beyond words to tell, so I couldn't imagine how anyone could not fall prostrate when confronted with the true attributes of the Creator? Now, years later, I understand that this outrage in people comes from a misunderstanding of who God really is. Boettner does an outstanding job of illuminating and explaining God's sovereignty. If you've ever been impressed with the divine importance of sharing God's incomparable ways with a friend who is searching, or if you yourself are serious about knowing God for who He truly is, pick up the Holy Bible, then pick up a copy of \\"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination.\\" While God's Word needs no accompaniment, Boettner's book is certainly something to be studied, if for no other reason than its important and biblically urgent reminder that there is no room for compromise when it comes to sharing Truth with those who would hear."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"As this work shows, Boettner was greatly influenced by the great Princeton theologians such as Warfield and Hodge. Both of these men were deep advocates of the system of theology known as Calvinism. Warfield believed that evangelicalism stands or falls with Calvinism, and Hodge wrote one of the great systematic treatments of Calvinism ever produced. To these efforts, Boettner adds this work which expounds on Calvinism generally, and the reformed doctrine of predestination specifically.The book is broken up into 5 sections - establishing the reality of predestination in Scripture, expounding on the 5 points of Calvinism, answering Arminian objections to Calvinism, and then looking at Calvinism in history and its meaning to the Christian life. Each section is good, with some being better than others. The section which responds to the Arminian objections to the doctrines of grace is the best section, and in particular, decimates objections against exertion and evangelism.Boettner's treatment of Calvinism in history is a bit dated, but still informative when taken up to the time when he wrote this book. In particular, Boettner eloquently demonstrates that Calvinism is a theology that while centered on the sovereignty and holiness of God, produces a level of human action that is unparalleled. This says a great deal not only about the viability of Calvinism, but also of the problematic nature of man-centered theologies like Arminianism which have actually failed to inspire the level of human action and world change that Calvinism can rightly lay claim to.The one weakness of the book is that while Boettner extensively quotes Scripture to establish his views, his exegesis is not as strong as it should be, and this is a disappointment. It was clear that Boettner was attempting to demonstrate that the clear, plain and repeated teachings of Scripture plainly support Calvinism in such a way that to take issue with these teachings requires rather elaborate and exotic (not to mention mostly erroneous) reinterpretations in order to get around them. While this is certainly true, it would nonetheless have been helpful had Boettner made a greater investment in Biblical exegesis.So while it's not perfect, it is nonetheless a mostly persuasive apology for Calvinism that continued the great tradition of old Princeton to demand a coherent theology that is faithful to Scripture and can refute the best arguments made against it."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"I was reading John Owen's book on limited atonement and this book at the same time. I finished this one in a few weeks. I'm still working on Owen's book. In other words, Boettner's book is a much easier read. Boettner's book does a good job of introducing the reformed doctrines. He starts with the biblical foundation of different aspects of the sovereignty of God, namely, providence and foreknowledge. In the next section he uses God's sovereignty as a springboard to explain each of the five points of Calvinism. He then addresses objections in the next section. Section IV is unnamed, but basically tries to balance out the distorted view of Calvinism that focusing of the five points gives. He then goes on to explain the practical importance of Calvinism and then gives a brief historical overview.The reason I didn't give the book five stars is many. The book is unabashedly supportive of Calvinism and the Presbyterian church in particular. He is not a thorough exegete like John Owen, so he gives more a general overview and does not get into the details of the arguments. I don't think he addresses the objections as thoroughly as he should. Another point, since I don't believe in Amillennialism so some of his arguments fall flat. The book paints Calvinism in history in broad strokes. He writes a nice, short summary of Calvin's life. He even has a short defense of Calvin for his part in the Servetus trial. However, his history of Calvinism makes Calvinism the driving force of the American Revolution and all that is good in the world. It may be so, but I don't think he proves his thesis and it may be impossible to prove it in a one small volume.In summary, the book is an excellent introduction to the Reformed faith. The writing is easy to read and the arguments are pretty easy to follow. He tries to be fair to his enemies and it is a very positive book. The history is the weakest part of the book, but even that has some good sections in it. This book may not convince a true Arminian, but it does present the doctrines in a clear manner. He helped me understand limited atonement better than anyone else, and I think he does a very good job with the other 4 points."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Whether you agree or not with reformed theology, this book is the Gold Standard for understanding the Five Points of Calvinism. Boettner is thorough, scholarly but very readable and never boring. He not only explains the Five Points but goes into the history of them and the effects that they have had on the world at large. This was the book that moved me from being a convinced Calvinist to a convicted one. There is plenty of Scripture to back up each and every one of his statements and arguments.Excellent book and a great reference tool."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"The truth of God is displayed by a true theologian, who realizes the most important category of truth is the nature of God. One's understanding of God is the single, most important, central element in spiritual experience.Martin Luther:'All things whatever arise from, and depend on the divine appointment: whereby it was foreordained who should receive the Word of Life and who should disbelieve it; who should be delivered in their sins and who should be hardened in them; who should be justified and who should be condemned.'John Calvin:'For they are not all created with a similar destiny; but eternal life is foreordained for some and eternal death for others. Every man, therefore, being created for these ends, we say he is predestined either for life or death.' 'God preordained, for His own glory, and the display of His attributes of mercy and justice, a part of the human race, without any merit of their own, to eternal salvation.'GOD HAS A PLAN: Chapter 3'Since the finite creation through its whole range exists as a medium through which God manifests His glory, and since it is absolutely dependent on Him, it of itself could originate no conditions which would limit or defeat the manifestation of that glory.' p 14'It is unthinkable that a God of infinite wisdom and power would create a world without a definite plan for that world. We cannot conceive of God bringing into existence a universe without a plan which would extend to all that would be done in that universe. If God...waited until some undetermined condition was or was not fulfilled, His decrees could be neither eternal nor immutable. We know, however, that He is incapable of mistake.' pp. 20-21 abridgedTHE SOVEREIGNTY OF GOD: Chapter 4'God has lost none of His power, and it is highly dishonoring to Him to suppose that He is struggling along with the human race doing the best He can, but unable to accomplish His purposes. Nothing can come to pass apart from His sovereign will; and far sooner the sun be stopped in its course than God be hindered in His will. By virtue of the fact that God has created every thing which exists, He is the absolute Owner and final Disposer of all that He has made. Amid all the apparent defeats and inconsistencies of life God actually moves on in undisturbed majesty. His omnipotence is as sure a guarantee that the course of the world will conform to His plan as is His holiness a guarantee that all His works will be right.' abridgedTHE PROVIDENCE OF GOD: Chapter 5'All things without exception, indeed, are disposed by Him, and His will is the ultimate account of all that occurs. Heaven and earth and all that is in them are the instruments through which He works His ends. Dr Warfield says, 'The writers rarely use such expressions as it rains; they instinctively speak of God sending rain.' p 31'But while the Bible repeatedly teaches that this providential control is universal, powerful, wise, and holy, it nowhere attempts to inform us how it is to be reconciled with man's free agency. All that we need to know is that God does govern His creatures and that His control over them is such that no violence is done to their natures.' p 38Boettner on Total Inability:'As human beings we know that an act of service rendered to us by someone who is at heart our enemy, does not merit our love and approbation. The Scripture statement that 'Without faith it is impossible to please God', finds it explanation in this: that faith is the foundation of all the other virtues.' p 69Boettner on the Remnant:'This is shown more plainly in Rom 11:2-5 where we read, 'God did not cast off His people whom He foreknew. Even so, then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.' p 100'The Scriptures represent Election as occurring in the past time, irrespective of merit, and altogether sovereign. Rom 9: 11,12. Arminian theology teaches that though a person does accept salvation, he may fall away again. They identify the time of salvation with the death of the believer, as if only then his salvation became certain. But it is always to the love of God that the Scriptures never weary of raising our eyes, and the biblical writers take special pains to give each believer assurance that from all eternity he has been the peculiar object of the divine choice.' pp. 95-96'Calvinists therefore hold that election precedes, and is not based upon any good works which the person does. Foreordination alone cannot rest on foreknowledge.' p 99"},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"Some people avoid labels for their beliefs and this includes Christians. They will particularly avoid labels for various understandings of Christian theology. But without labels, every time you want to explain your theological framework you need to launch into a lengthy discussion. But if you use terms (e.g. orthodox, liberal, reformed and evangelical) much can be conveyed immediately.The Reformed label for a particular understanding of Christian theology has seen a resurgence in recent decades. But exactly what is Reformed theology? Basically it is the understanding that God is sovereign in the salvation of man (i.e. every Christian was predestined to be a Christian long before they lived). And it is called Reformed because it was a key teaching of the Reformation. Of course the Reformers taught much more than predestination, but believing in God's complete sovereignty in salvation is essential if one wishes to call themselves Reformed.So what is entailed in the Reformed doctrine of predestination? Boettner's book is an old but helpful defense of the Reformed doctrine of Predestination. Initially in the book Boettner asserts key doctrines concerning God's planning, sovereignty, providence and foreknowledge. Then he moves on to teach the five points of Calvinism:(i) Total inability/depravity;(ii) Unconditional election;(iii) Limited atonement;(iv) Efficacious/Irresistible grace;(v) Perseverance of the saints.Then Boettner answers common objections against Reformed doctrine:(i) it is fatalism;(ii) it is illogical;(iii) it makes God the author of sin;(iv) it discourages motivation to exertion;(v) it represents God as unjustly partial;(vi) it is unfavourable to good morality;(vii) it precedes a sincere offer of the gospel;(viii) it contradicts the universalistic Scripture passages.Next Boettner teaches about other relevant issues including the harmony of Reformed doctrine with science and Islam. The book then closes with a quick review of Calvinism in church history.My only problem with the book is that it briefly promotes post-millennial eschatology and seems to be ignorant of Reformed Baptists.Nevertheless, if you are trying to understand what exactly is Reformed theology, Boettner's book is an excellent and convincing treatment of the subject."},{"Title":"The Reformed doctrine of predestination","review":"This is one of the best and most scholarly works on the Reformed faith one can read. Boettner is truly one of the modern Church's top theologians. This work should be in the library of every student of theology.

Boettner lays out the case for the doctrine and uses ample scripture and cogent reasoning to support it. Not only does Boettner cover predestination in particular, but he also deals with reformed theology in general; specifically he has a detailed discussion of the 5 points of Calvinism.If I were to criticize this book, I would have liked to have seen a fuller treatment of reformed theology. While the 5 points of the Calvinistic system are foundational, they do not cover the entire breadth of reformed theology.With all that said, I would like to list the topics that Boettner covers in this book:1) God's plan; sovereignty; providence; foreknowledge; authority of the scripture2) Five points of Calvinism : total inability; unconditional election; limited atonement; efficacious grace; perseverance of the saints3) Objections : fatalism; God the author of sin; discourages good works; God as respecter of persons; unfavorable to morality; precludes a sincere offer of the gospel; contradicts universalistic passages4) Salvation by grace; personal assurance; predestination for the physical world; comparison with Islam5) Practical importance of predestination6) Calvinism in historyAs you can see, a lot of ground is covered in this book.

The way the characters are many times spaced out and the way they act on their stupidity, mostly the way P.G. Wodehouse makes fun of characters. Pigs have wings, is about competition between two pigs for the fattest pig class. They try to steal each other's pig, and the Empress (the name of the hero's pig) has been the winner of this class for two years in a row. All this is tied with some knotted yet silly love relationships. But the way Wodehouse makes fun of it is so funny that you will laugh untill tears start pouring down."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"Wodehouse, master of words that he is, shows his wit to be in top form in this wonderfully funny story of Blandings castle. As usual, Lord Emsworth is a bit dazed and obsessing about his pig (now hoping that she'll win first in her division for the third year running at the local agricultural show) and the guests at Blandings are falling hopelessly in love with one another. This is a great book for both those new to Wodehouse and those who have enjoyed his other works. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"I originally acquired this book as a result of a minor bet between my aunt and myself. The bet I will not tell you, but I will asure all readers that it was clean and honourable (unlike my spelling). As I said in the title I said it was typical wodehouse. Boy1 meets girl1 and the fall in love, unfortunately a mishap occurs so girl1 goes and gets engaged to boy2 who is really in love with girl2 who used to be engaged to him, then girl3 falls in love with the totally unelegible. In an effort to make him elegible she attempts to find ways to supply cash for the BIG SCEME, which of course she doesn't suceed at, unfortunately, in the process she observes Boy3 (the inelegible) doing something that she believes is inappropriate and as an upshot, gets engaged to Boy1. The problem is then straightened out and Girl3 expresses dismay and tells the truth, much to dismay of boy3. But as always occurs in Wodehouse everyone eventually ends up with the right person. But mixed in with this plot is the enevitable Empress of Blandings, who is moved everywhere, and stolen and has at least one attempt to nobble her, but of course the nobbleing occurs to the wrong pig and Empress comes out as winner. And Gally gets into his usual strife."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"P.G. Wodehouse was the 20th century's answer to William Shakespeare reproduced as musical comedy. In Pigs Have Wings, Mr. Wodehouse produced one of his very best efforts.As usual, the themes involve a satire of romantic love, miscommunications between the sexes, the vapid interests of the titled class, and the silliness of people in general.As the book opens, Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth finds himself faced with a threat to the supremacy of his pig, Empress of Blandings, in the Fat Pigs class at the Shropshire Agricultural Show. Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Bart, of Matchingham Hall, had already hired away Clarence's pig handler, George Cyril Wellbeloved . . . and Clarence is sure that some new skullduggery will soon follow. As the story develops, we find that it's all too true. Soon both pig camps are doing their best to knobble the other man's pig. With everyone else having a bet on the outcome, many other people are soon engaged in trying to sabotage one pig or the other. It's the most pignapping fun caper you can imagine!In the background, we have all sorts of people who've become engaged to totally unsuitable people on the rebound from slights they feel from the one they really love. P.G. Wodehouse does a yeoman effort of returning all of those twisted loves to the proper party.

The way Baldwin writes about music is virtually unparallelled. In these short stories, he manages to stay clear of the sometimes excessive sentimentality that comes out in novels like Another Country. We sympathize with everyone, we see everyone's need for love, the intense loneliness of human experience, and the individual alienation and experience that results from societal divisions of race and sexuality. The first two stories contain the same characters from his famous first novel Go Tell it on The Mountain. The biblical imagery in these stories is not always pronounced as it may be in Go Tell..., but Baldwin's command of the bible show us the fear and the decadence that it exalts even when the allusions are abstract. The cup of trembling, the sight of the father's foot in the first story. Baldwin is a writer whom people have expected something out of and have been disappointed with because he does not fit into the desired mold of the black writer or the gay writer or even the american writer. He can be an objective political essayist or a sentimental dramatist, and here, he offers cold, somewhat detatched portraits of american lives which are among the best portraits of these people ever written. He puts the lives of marginal americans, from poor white rural southerners, to expatriates, and black urban displaced men and women, into the dramatic realm that hints of myth. His descriptions are riveting, his sexual honesty can be rude, exposing the reader to the America that exposed him."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"Each of the stories contained in this book deal frankly and honestly with the fear and agony associated with love, hate, prejudice and the suffering humans endure at the hands of their fellow man.

Other notable stories are \\"The Man Child\\", \\"Sonny's Blues\\" and \\"Previous Condition\\". This is a good place to start if you're just discovering James Baldwin. Also recommended are his novels, \\"Giovanni's Room\\", \\"Another Country\\" and \\"Tell Me How Long the Train's Been Gone\\"."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"I am slowly understanding why Mr. Baldwin elected to leave the United States for more than a decade in the 1940s and 1950s. He apparently is on record as saying that he needed to flee because his anger was going to destroy him if he did not seek a respite from American injustice.Upon reading this collection, I think I am really beginning to understand what must have been going through his mind. Read \\"Previous Condition\\" where a young African American man keeps being thrown out of hotels and denied jobs simply because of the color of his skin. There is nowhere he can go without meeting the hostile glances and conspiratorial whispers of people on the street simply because of his skin color. And there is a moment where it all came into focus for me, standing in the kitchen of his Jewish friend's Jules' apartment. And I quote:\\"Oh,\\" I cried, \\"I know you think I'm making it dramatic, that I'm paranoiac and just inventing trouble! Maybe I think so sometimes, how can I tell? You get so used to being hit you find you're always waiting for it. Oh, I know, you're Jewish, you get kicked around, too, but you can walk into a bar and nobody knows you're Jewish and if you go looking for job you'll get a better job than mine!\\" (78)It is deeply disturbing to think that a person has the suspicion and rage of the world cocked against their temple, but that was how it was (and still is). I have read much about the Civil Rights struggle and as a Jew myself, have listened to many stories from members of my family about prejudice but these stories, they uncover something. After seeing what happened in New Orleans with Katrina and listening to the empty discussions of \\"good schools\\", No Child Left Behind and test score mania, it opens your eyes to the fact that performance, optimism and opportunity are perceptions that, when absent, can ruin lives in ways that are hard to qualify.I highly recommend these stories but be prepared to become deeply uncomfortable because Baldwin had a powerful case to make about American hypocrisy and he makes it."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"A memorable book. It has been some years since I read this book but I still remember the impact it had on me, particularly the story about the deputy who remembers the day his parents took him to see a black man being publicly hanged. Powerful stuff and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"James Baldwin is known primarily for his essays and his first two novels (\\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\" and \\"Giovanni's Room\\"), but I often tell readers that the place to start is with his first story collection, \\"Going to Meet the Man.\\" Baldwin's short fiction is more straightforward and accessible than are his essays (which are indeed excellent); each of the eight stories presents a different aspect of Baldwin's worldview; and unlike his early novels, where racism is treated as one aspect in the lives of characters, several of these stories confront the \\"racial issue\\" full on.Baldwin's short fiction may be easier to read, but it does not avoid uncomfortable truths. In fact, some of Baldwin's most heated writing can be found in this volume, which was first published in 1965. It contains work written over a 20-year-period, including \\"Previous Condition,\\" the first piece of fiction he ever published (in Commentary Magazine in 1948). A fledgling actor is torn between the black world of Harlem (\\"perfectly in his element, in his place, as the saying goes\\") and the white neighborhoods downtown. He stays at a friend's apartment in lower Manhattan, but has to hide from the landlord and leave the building at odd hours to avoid being seen by the other residents (\\"Why don't you go uptown, where you belong?\\").Each of the other stories is unforgettable in its own way, but my two favorites open and close the volume. \\"The Rockpile\\" is an early (yet different) version of an episode in \\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\\"; two of Baldwin's strengths are his ability to capture the memories of youth and to present the complexities of family life. The incendiary title story that ends the volume depicts a white police officer whose racial attitudes were formed by a lynching he witnessed as a child. Baldwin pits the very real horror of the police brutality experienced by a young man who attempts to register to vote against the officer's wholly imagined fear of the oversexed black stereotype.This last story--indeed, much of Baldwin's later fiction--has been criticized (by biographer James Campbell, for example) for lacking \\"a neutrality which Baldwin was finding harder than ever to maintain\\" and an unwillingness to \\"concede that somewhere, somehow, this corrupted man might incorporate genuine goodness.\\" Such comments seem unfair on two counts: the actions of some racists, while \\"pitiable,\\" are still beyond redemption or \\"goodness,\\" and (more to the point) I don't agree that it's a storyteller's responsibility to make lemonade out of every lemon.So ignore the critics who argue that Baldwin's fiction lost its shine as he grew older and more cynical and less \\"neutral,\\" and pick up this excellent collection of stories. I think you'll find that their bluntness and honesty and gritty realism make up for whatever stylistic faults the critics might point to."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"A fabulous collection of short stories that have not really aged in spite of the forty years gone since they were first published.Sonny's Blues is a real gem because it shows three ways out of deprevation, out of the mental ghetto that grows in a real ghetto, like Harlem, out of desperation and dereliction.One can go upward in society, become a teacher, through hard studies, get married, raise a family. In one way, accept the American Dream and forget about the tragedy, or the nightmare. God Save the American Republic !One can get into music and into a completely different world of imagination, art, harmony, research, rhythm, melody, all that the world does not provide. That is the Blues, Jazz, the fairyland of OZ. Unluckily you have to go there and come back. God pity us, the terrified republic !And one can get into heroin, the fabulous horse of American history, the mythical horse of the Great Plains, the mystical horse of the Railroads, the heavenlike horse of Indians and Blacks. Forget all that and shoot your veins. He who sees his veins can see his pains !James Baldwin is a master in the field of transforming human pain into heavenly light by sharing it with our souls. It does not erase the pain. It just makes it luminous, the light of a new way to some hazardous future. But where danger is, rescue is ready too , as H&ouml;lderlin used to say.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"James Baldwin is one of the best authors, in my opinion. Everything he wrote scores a 5 star rating with me. His stories are well written, full of compassion and drama. He puts so much of himself in his stories that it's sad to read them. The first time I read a book by James Baldwin I was hooked. If you like books about man's general evilness to his fellowman and the sickness of religious fanatics you'll love James Baldwin."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"I have been, as is my wont when I get \\"hooked\\" on some writer, on something of a James Baldwin tear of late, reading or re-reading everything I can get my hands on. At the time of this review I have already looked at \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain\\", the play \\"Blues For Mr. Charlie\\", \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone\\", and \\"The Fire Next Time\\". Those works, well written and powerful reminded me of why I was crazy to read everything that Baldwin wrote when I was a kid. I do not recall then having read any short stories by Baldwin, at least none that were memorable like one of the stories, \\"Sonny's Blues\\", in this \\"Going To Meet The Man\\" compilation.Now great writers, and I hope at this point in our common American literary experiences no one need argue James Baldwin's place in the canon, sometimes are capable of writing both great novels and short stories. Baldwin seems to be in that category, although off of this selection it may be a bit premature to make that judgment because most of the material appears to have been \\"first drafts\\" of later, full novelistic treatments. For example, \\"The Morning, The Evening, So Soon\\", the subject matter of which is the fame of a expatriate black actor-singer who despite that fame is still subject to all the racial taunts and tensions of a stay-at-home performer. (I am writing this review just after the passing away of the pioneer black singer/actress/black liberation fighter, Lena Horne.) That subject gets fuller treatment in \\"Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone.\\"Other subjects that get a preliminary workout here are the deep religious experience of Baldwin's fundamentalist Protestant youth, \\"The Outing\\" that will get a full-blown treatment in \\"Go Tell It On The Mountain.\\" Of course, the subject of homosexuality, and bi-sexuality, are obliquely presented in several stories, Baldwin, along with Gore Vidal being something of American literary pioneers, if not honored as such at the time, on the subject. And of course, as with all of Baldwin serious work, we are treated to various manifestations of the ever present \\"race\\" question; interracial sex and marriage; degrees of blackness; white racism; black attitudes toward white racism; and the purposeful insularity of the white world in dealing, or nor dealing, with these questions, then and now.What you want to get this particular compilation for though, as I mentioned above, is for \\"Sonny's Blues\\". Now it is almost impossible to find any writer, any American writer at least, worth his or he salt who came of literary age in the 1950s who was not influenced, even if only around the edges, by \\"be-bop\\" jazz. Baldwin is no exception, although his race is not the only reason for that statement. The rhythm of the cool, abstract, high white note \\"be-bop jazz\\" that sent audiences into a frenzy of delight are a simple companion to the sparser, less lyrical literary beat of 1950's writing. Mailer, Kerouac, and most of the New York intellectual crew feasted, and feasted well, on that inner sound. But, nobody got it righter than James Baldwin in \\"Sonny's Blues.\\"What seemingly starts out as another one of Baldwin's epistles on, literally, brotherly love; that of two brothers, one, Sonny, several years younger than the other, who \\"grew up\\" in Harlem, grew away from each other by choice or circumstances,, reunited when now famed jazz pianist brother, Sonny, got caught up trying to reach that \\"high white note\\" via the \\"horse\\" drug connection that also has been associated with bop, turns into one of the best expositions of what jazz meant to the listener, and to the artist struggling to find his inner voice, that I have ever read.The last several pages, in counterpoint to the first several, are truly lyrical as Baldwin puts in words on the printed page what a struggle it was for Sonny, and his fellow band members in New York cafe society, to \\"make the gods listen.\\" And to make the heavens cry out for the high side of the human experience. You or I could try to write such lines for two hundred years and we could not get it right. Kudos, James."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"The first story I read in this was \\"Sonny's Blues\\" and I realized there was more to it than just a story- and that the blues is more than just b5ths but a greater understanding of life - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"Should be required reading for high school and college students.

In our hearts."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"'Going to Meet the Man' is a diverse collection of short stories which attempt to explain the psyche of young black American boys/men in the early 1950s. Yes, there is anger and frustration. But the author's excellent prose elevate the stories beyond stereotype. He is compassionate without making these characters into martyrs of white America.Of course many will argue these stories are badly dated. And true, America has moved on (generally for the better) since the early 1950s. But it would be unfortunate to overlook these stories for this reason. Baldwin captures the essence of where American society has come from, and we can all learn from history. I also feel it is unfortunate that nearly all the readers of \\"Going to Meet The Man' will be African-Americans, unlike myself (..who have the most to learn).Bottom line: terrific tidbits showing Baldwin's brilliance. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Going to meet the man","review":"&quot;blues for Sunny&quot;.. is a great work....

Ken Hamblin is unabashedly conservative, did you expect him to give liberals the kid glove treatment? Once again, Kirkus demonstrates its bias against anything and anyone conservative.

I can't believe how powerful and eye opening this book is. It has truley affected the way that I look at the world and most of all politics. Ken Hamblin has managed to reveal the truth behind the democrats and their movement for a socialist/borderline communist society. He explains how the ACLU is methodically tearing the United States apart under a guise for &quot;liberty.&quot; He exposes Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton for the racist hypocrites that will &quot;sell out their own mother for a buck.&quot;This is a must read for all High School students and every patriotic American that doesn't want his/her nation destroyed by the sick, manipulative, and twisted leftist regime.Plain Talk and Common Sense has opened my eyes and shook the liberal ground that I once walked upon.

Without any background, I thought it might be an interesting read...in other words, I expected some true discussions involving common sense.What I ended up getting were two general themes and convoluted logic bearing more similarity to nonsense than common sense:First is the idea that since Mr. Hamblin made it from poverty to the upper class, anyone else that can't make it just isn't trying hard enough. He basically states that society should not help anyone, because if they can't make it on their own....tough! Of course, he readily admits that he got his start as a result of Affirmative-Action, a program of which he now wants to dispose.So sadly, he responds to a woman working three jobs to make ends meet that she isn't trying hard enough or she'd make it out of her situation. He never once admits to the fact that not everyone gets the breaks and the opportunities that he got.Secondly, Mr. Hamblin seems to think that every ill in the world is the result of liberals. He even links liberals to issues that they have nothing to do with. Oh well, I guess he needs a scapegoat from somewhere.I read this book all the way through, only for one reason...it is a good reminder that we can't let our guard down for one minute against such arrogant ignorant right wingers as Hamblin. For this purpose, I highly recommend this book...it will scare the socks off of you."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I didn't read this book yet but I knew Jack back in the day when I referred to him as a Sh** Bird.

I spent a lot of time in the army,though none of it in active duty.Endless hours on rifle ranges,shooting at stationary targets,can only give one a vague impression of the dedication and inborn skill needed to perform at the level we see here.It doesn't surprise me in the least ,that it is only the rarest of individuals that can \\"make it\\".A few quotes get to the heart of the matter;\\"Once you hunt men,nothing else can compare.\\"\\"Shooting,in fact,is only 25 percent of what a sniper does.\\"\\"Every Marine is supposed to know how to shoot,and any fool can say,\\"Iwant to be a sniper,but fools are not who we want.Most candidatesflunk out,so only the best make it through a grueling course thatrequires as much brain as braun,because there is no such thing as astupid sniper.\\"\\"I was taught to get in,get close,kill quickly,and get out,withoutever being seen.\\"Not only do we get to see ihe inside world of a sniper,and one who was as good as they come,but also,get to travel right along side him and his team as they fight their way to Bagdad and even witness the capture of the city;including what really went on in the street as we all watched on TV as the statue of Saddam was toppled.When you see what Jack Coughlin was willing and able to do for his country,it was heartbreaking to see that his marriage was unable to stand it all.At least he still had his daughters and his personal strengths will stand by him for the rest of his life;and one can only thank and admire him for his services and wish him the best in the future.Gunnery Sgt.

Coughlin aint Carlos Hathcock."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Even I cannot explain why I read and even liked this book. Perhaps it is because I grew up around firearms and feel comfortable with them. But something tells me that it was more the need to know what it feels like to know that the firearm you hold in your hand has one job. Kill.To get inside the #1 sniper of the United States and see or learn what it must be like to take aim at someone whom you do not know, someone who has a mother who carried him/her to term, breastfed, laughed and nurtured whom you know seek to put a bullet in that persons heart or head is jaw dropping surreal. And something I think the American citizen needs to know!In my opinion most Americans don't give much thought to what their tax dollars are paying for in the military or sadly, the underpaid, men women we send off to far off lands to do our bidding and sadly killing. But men like Jack Coughlin do what most Americans couldn't do even if threatened face to face. It sounds so odd calling him a hero, but to me he is.

It does however have some excellent material concerning the war in Iraq, and the author's ideas on how effective \\"mobile\\" sniping teams can be in modern warfare.If you are looking for a reference work on sniping this is not the book, and others such as Out of Nowhere by Pegler and Sniper by Gilbert are better. If you have read these and are interested in how the use of snipers is evolving then I would definitely recommend giving Shooter a read.Originally I had rated this book low, but after rereading it I would change my rating to 5 stars.Tiger McKee"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I THINK THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK.

Imagine being allowed into the mind and soul of an alien killing machine on another planet and you will get a sense of what to expect here. It is indeed an unreal story that seems worlds away from you and I, and by now, probably to GYSGT Coughlin and Capt. Casey. The mental tactics GYSGT Coughlin developed are probably more important than the military tactics as it all starts with the individual and the mind; and the study is intriguing. The amazing thing is that he is not an alien killing machine but a Marine (undoubtably this distinction was lost on his opponents) and this happened on our planet. As opposed to the Devil's Guard (Elford), this book seemed to embelish little. Being GYSGT trained I thought I knew how valuable our Marines were, after this book, I will look upon them with greater pride. You need to read between the lines to gather all the gems though. \\"Outside the scope\\" you can see the value of his insight versus the media, the power of the mind, the mis-understanding of the the 'liberal' mind as to the human condition of warriors, and the power of values and family.

It surprised me how flowing the narrative was in this book, seeing as it was a biography,and autobiography at that. Shooter has none of the long drawn out side paths to the story, nor setting up one part of the characters life, then another. There is a bit of set-up in the form of the first chapter, and some side paths to the story, non longer then a page and most a single paragraph. The bulk of the story focuses on Gunnery Sgt. Coughlin's envelopment in the training and invasion of Iraq.There is the occasional cliche' and the book is as gung-ho as would be excepted from a Marine, but the smoothness of the storytelling and the Coughlin's clarity in retelling events far surprised those rather minor complaints.A quality book all around."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I have read Shooter 3 times, it is that kind of book.

This book is meant to draw in excitement and action, not necessarily the type of interpersonal drama that some others said they were hoping for. Basically what it's about is Jack's missions, sniper tactics and his progression of his military carreer. He sets the scenes for your perfectly, without too many tiresome details. (I don't need to know how rubbery the grip on the handle of the gun is.) This is clearly a guy's book, you won't find anything too excessive about love or feelings. As for the politics of it it's hardly a case of patting G.W.B. on the back, and being an autobio you can't really expect him to sugarcoat his feelings.If you want to read about action and tactics you'll love this, if you want to read about relationships and interpersonal dramas, go elseware.-J(P.S. If I had to compare Jack to another author, I'd say this resembles a Tom Clancy book with more action and less talk of details like - 'the rounds measured 7.65mm x 22', such intricacies grow tiresome.)"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"One of the better books about the Iraq conflict.

Thank you for your service to this great country."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Let's face it -- there are great authors and there are great warriors, but great author-warriors are few and far between. \\"Shooter\\" proves this point, even when the warrior has an author helping him to write the book. \\"Shooter\\" is about Gunnery Sergeant Jack Coughlin, a USMC sniper. That he is one of the best there is no doubt. Although his career spans further, we see Coughlin in Somalia and Iraq, not really stopping anywhere else in between (which is too bad). Nevertheless, Coughlin comes across as the outstanding Marine that he is, and the reader will agree with the assessment of one of Coughlin's superior officers who states, \\"I'm just glad [Couglin's] on our side.\\"\\"Shooter\\", however, gets mixed up on what it wants to be: an insightful, introspective look into the mind of a man who is, after all, a professional killer (among other things) or a look at the life of a Marine specialist on the front lines. In the end, Shooter fails to deliver enough of either, and that is disappointing. With regard to the \\"insight\\" part of the book, Coughlin dutifully tell us that he holds no illusions about what his job is and what that means, how he never feels good taking human life, and how sometimes his targets show up in his dreams. On the other hand, he spends an incredible amount of time in the book complaining about how he is being left behind from the action in Iraq, which is essentially him complaining about not having enough opportunities to go out and kill people. Coughlin doesn't go into enough detail about how his job affects him personally for the reader to really care about how the job might affect him personally. For example, Coughlin experiences marital troubles that are all too common in military families. But this area is treated in such a cursory manner that the reader is left to wonder what happened, e.g., was it the strain of being apart, did Coughlin's wife realize she was waking up next to a professional killer every morning, or what? The point is that we don't know and we don't really care because Coughlin never gives the reader enough to care about.Ordinarily, I wouldn't necessarily care about the lack of the touchy-feely stuff, as long as the book has some good, rip-roaring war stories to tell. And there are some good moments in \\"Shooter\\". Most of all, the reader will be amazed at how good this guy is at his job when he is allowed to do it and especially when he is allowed to do it in a manner that maximizes his talents. The unfortunate part of being a great sniper, however, is that there is very little drama involved in shooting people who are, for the most part, either too far away to shoot back at you or simply not aware that you are even there. Coughlin makes up for this by giving a good look at life on the front lines and some really cool insight into the technical part of being a sniper. I think this could have been maximized even more if the book had been entitled \\"Shooters\\", and it had been about the entire group of snipers Coughlin deployed with, instead of just being about him. In that way, some of the other characters could have been developed a little more and the action could have kept going a little more (read Robert Mason's \\"Chickenhawk\\" and you'll see what I mean). As it is, we learn much more about Coughlin's crusade to have snipers used in a much more active fashion on the battle field than we do about the people around him, and his crusade just isn't that interesting, plain and simple.Don't get me wrong -- this is a solid book, and I am thankful for Coughlin's service and for the fact that he is on our side. And I'm sure Coughlin has some wicked stories; I just wish he had shared a few more of them with us."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I have been a Marine sniper for Ten years and a sniper instructor for 3 of those years. I have never heard of this man until this book came out. Reading it only part of it do to my anger at this book being called a true story I must urge the reader to view it as pure fiction written by someone trying to self promote himself as something is not. No unit commander or Scout/Sniper team leader would allow these things to happen. They have no tactical value and would be down right fatal to someone who tried. There is no such thing as the lone sniper anymore in the Marine Corps we always work as a team of two at the very minimum. We live by simple rules always \\"ONE IS NONE, TWO IS ONE\\". With this as a base fundamental for a Marine Sniper and all other Snipers in the Service. Confirmed kills started in Vietnam and ended shortly after it was a way for commanders to verify what snipers were claiming, as in enemy killed, it required searching of each and every person you killed. As for a ranking system for snipers in the Marine Corps I have never heard of one. Snipers are viewed as a team never as individualsHogs in the Shadows: Combat Stories from Marine Snipers in Iraqyour team was successful never the individual. If you want to read TRUE stories about snipers in the Marine Corps read \\"Hogs in the Shadows\\" by Milo S. Afong. True stories told by Scout/Snipers To Scout/Snipers. To all of you who read this and believed it I am sorry but this would be a good work of fiction."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Make no mistake, I have great respect for Coughlin and his 20 years of service to Corps and country. I am a former Marine. I served with Hotel Company 2nd BN 5th Marines in Viet Nam, mainly in the Arizona Territory, Go Noi Island, and into the Que Son mountains around An Hoa.I bought this book with anticipation of an honest, no nonsense account of the opening of the Iraq war from the perspective of a senior enlisted Marine. Sadly, it was supremely disappointing on many levels.One should not automatically assume that having a story to tell makes you a writer. Like every other craft (including that of a sniper) it takes training, experience, and time to develop. Clearly, Mr. Coughlin is not a writer. His style was amatuerish, his use of language unnatural, and the overall focus missplaced. For this I also fault the editors and any others I assume were supporting his work. There is no mistaking that Mr. Coughlin thinks a lot of himself. After all, he single handedly saved \\"The Main\\" by killing one Iraqi machine gunner. He singlehandedly changed Marine Corp doctrine with his 'mobile sniper concepts'. (Perhaps he was not aware that Marine snipers ARE mobile and have been for some time. Helicopter insertions of snipers occured regularly in Viet Nam. He should read Hathcock's book.) After the first chapter I was bored and put off at how often he patted himself on the back. Who identified him as the Top Rated Sniper? He never explained (although he never let you forget!) Every Marine is a rifleman. A sniper is a highly trained rifleman. They performed a sepcialized task. However, if body count is the measure, then I fully believe that the average grunt Marine during the same period of time in that conflict had a higher 'count' than him. Too often he spoke of \\"the battles the 5th Marines were in\\" while he was back with the headquarters company. I would have liked to hear more about that. The book lacked this perspective and that of other Marines and could have benefitted from more documented facts about the fight. Again, I respect him as a Marine and for his achievements. I don't really fault him as much as I am disappointed. He should read \\"Fields of Fire\\" by James Webb to see how a first hand account of personal experiences in combat should be done.Semper Fi"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This is a very gripping book by a man who has a rather unusual job. The job he does is a job that when troops are deployed must be done. It is a job that we collectively as a country sanction. It is an interesting study of one man's mind as he is doing this job. Whether you are hawk or dove it is a book that should be read as it more about human psychology than it is about war.Of course by saying this I do not mean to say that the book is devoid of history as it is chock full of it.It is also not just about killing but about skill and what it means to be skilled at something.If you give this book a chance it will get you thinking.A very challenging and multileveled book that is not so easy to dismiss (as much as many would perhaps like). It is very much worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I was a Marine in 3/4 \\"Darkside\\" during OIF, and can testify to the truth. What Coughlin says in his book is total BOGUS. Granted some of the battles are true, but his \\"heroics\\" are over played. He was attached to the Headquarters & Service Co. doing his company gunny duties, unlike the \\"Rambo\\" that he is trying to portray himself. Yes he is a sniper and had some kills, but not to the extent he claims. If he had, then how did the rest of us kill Iraqis? There wouldn't have been any left. Also, this is a guy that never did the PFT because he had \\"knee\\" issues and never did company or battalion humps. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Go read \\"Darkside: The Road to Baghdad\\". That is the truth. As for the \\"Officer Bob\\" remarks, this was totally unwarranted and not true. As for his adoration of Lt. Casey, I mean- look at the picture of Casey and tell me where is the \\"linebacker\\" of a man? He was quite skinny the last time I saw him.

The best book I have read in years about the struggle to keep your mind on killing vice having to live with it. The book focuses primarily on the most recent war in Iraq, but opens with the author's experience in Somalia. I would have liked to have read more about the author's 20 years in the marine corps, but nevertheless, this was a great read. I particularly enjoyed the author's opinions regarding the differences between an urban environment, and a jungle environment. Also, his views on the evolution of the deployment of snipers was very interesting. Finally, this book was a good, first person account of war."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I have been in the Marine Corps for 9 years, 6 as a scout/sniper. This book made me sick. Scout/Sniper's o not act like this, there is no top-ranked marine sniper we have no awards. We no longer collect confirmed kills. To see someone make money off of lies like this is heart-breaking. The public will read this a think it is true and pass this fish story along. If it was sold as fiction its just another story but to claim these events happened this way is unjust to the real scout/snipers in combat. Read NO True Glory if you want fact. You can read about what real marines do."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I served with John (Jack) Coughlin in the Marines. When I first found out he was writing a book. I was anxious to get a copy, but once I started reading the book. I was very disappointed. It was full of lies and make believe stories; I was with India Company 3/ 4 the same time Jack was there. He was a Plt Sgt with 1st platoon and had no sniper duties. The reason he was left behind when 3/ 4 went to Okinawa is 100% BS. He was left behind as the main point of contact for the unit while they were overseas. He handle the Red Cross messages, the Key Wives and other rear party misc duties. To get a true version on what 3/ 4 did in Iraq you have to read McCoy's Marines: Dark side to Baghdad. Not once is Jack mention in the book as a Sniper or any of his kills."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":". . . While many of the reviewers present valid claims of self-aggrandizement and perhaps a less than noble lack of humility, I believe that they have missed the main point that the book was trying to present, which is that the classic sniper dogma, created in large part by the likes of venerable gunny Hathcock in jungle environment, is not relevant to today's fluid, often urbanized battlefields. While Coughlin does seem to do a fair amount of self-aggrandizing, we have to remember that most readers are civilians who are looking to experience, by proxy, the horror and grit of warfare. We have to remember that he has got to sell books, and that perhaps he was less successful at maintaining the balance between excitement and honor when writing his memoir.. . . . I believe that Coughlin's memoir lacks the humility present in \\"Marine Sniper\\" and the other Carlos Hathcock, Jr. biography(which is the characteristic that made me admire Hathcock even over his kill list or 1000yd shooting scores). An excellent example of this is on the back cover of \\"Shooter\\", where The first tagline is \\"the top rated marine sniper\\" and below, his editors choose to add a review quote about how he was one of those guys who didn't care about his number of kills, or scores. So, which is he, a guy who flaunts an unsubstatiated rating, or a guy who does not care about socres or kill counts?? Also, throughout the book, threre is an attempt on his part to play the role of the humble-hathcock, but rarely does he share any of his internal weaknesses, or mistakes that he must have experienced along the way.. . . . I still felt that it was an exciting, entertaining read for the average sniper buff but it is the undercurrent of strong war theory that deserves consideration by those of us who take war theory seriously.. . . Our military has really only supported the notion of the sniper as a valid, legitimate asset since Vietnam, with prior sniper utilization seen as dirty and undesirable; sniper schools hastily opened during a conflict and closed following the war's conclusion. The fact that our military still uses (in my opinion) a poorly chosen, trumped up version of a civilian hunting rifle (The Remington 700) instead of an improved, sniper-specific dedicated weapon design, indicates that there is still much room for development and creativity in sniper dogma, and that the professional sniper community needs to bring about change from the inside out if it wants to remain relevant.. . . The sniper's role is essential to the success of any campaign, and Coughlin's book addresses the concerns many in the sniper community voiced following the first Gulf Conflict (as illustrated in the film \\"Jarhead\\") about fast paced warfighting leaving traditionally utilized snipers behind in the dust. More importantly, he explains the early development of the mobile sniper concept, and his anecdotes from in theatre reinforce the efficacy and potential for the novel and creative deployment of sniper assets. While many consider Gunny Hathcock's ideas and methods as boilerplate, these folks forget that he developed his techniques as a creative response to his environment and the available equipment, and if he was alive today, I am sure that he would jump into the fray to defend the validity, and flexibility of the sniper and its essential, force-multiplying effects on the battlefield.. . . Those of us who have read the great military sniper classics hold a very high standard for our author/warriors to uphold, but a few final points need to be considered. Both of the Hathcock books were written towards the end of his life or following his death. He had decades with which to refine and consider his ideas of self and his actions. This is obvious due to his lack of \\"ho-rah\\", sabre rattling attitude. The other thing to consider is the role of the ghostwriter/biographer, whose level of involvement and common sense can vastly effect the tone and quality of the book.. . . In conclusion, if you can control your gag reflex and ignore the less than humble attitude, there are gems to be found about both about the events during the early days of the invasion as well as interesting elements of war theory. The greatest element is that we must be reminded that what is not loved is lost, and as our military continues to swing towards the un-manned and remote controlled war, we risk loosing not only our most useful forward recon and observation asset, but also the fantastic minds and creative nature of some of out best soldiers, our snipers."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This is a relatively straightforward book, and frankly I'm surprised by the reactions that it's garnered here on Amazon. The author is an unusual character, as snipers themselves tend to usually be odd characters in general. They're loners, and most regular soldiers can't shake the idea that a sniper is only a uniform away from a murderer. They also tend to be rather like subdrivers and fighter pilots: they have personalities that allow them to confront situations as if they can do almost anything. The author himself, towards the end of this book, says that anyone who doesn't think he can walk on water has no business being a sniper in the USMC. Since I agree with the author, I'm afraid I think criticisms of him as an egotist are wide of the mark: it's his nature.The book presents itself as an autobiography, but in reality it's a memoir of the first author's service in Iraq. The second author was an officer who served with him, often commanded him, and apparently helped with the writing. The third author is a ghostwriter who has dealt with military subjects in the past. Though there are three names on the front of the book credited as writers, the whole thing is told in the first person, from the point of view of Coughlin.The book mostly recounts the author's attempts to get into the fighting during the invasion of Iraq, when he was assigned as the gunnery sergeant of the Headquarters and Supply Company (which he refers to once as the \\"HotDog and Soda Company\\"). The author bridles at this assignment, believing that he'd best serve his country and unit by working as a sniper. He portrays his struggle to get into combat as basically an extended argument with a superior officer whom he refers to as \\"Officer Bob\\" and who he insists was an absolute jerk and incompetent during the whole of the war. There's some truth to the observation of one of the negative reviewers: Coughlin seems to do few if any of his duties in the H&S; company, instead devoting most of his time to being a sniper, which of course is someone else's job. The author covers this by insisting that the battalion commanding officer insisted that he (Coughlin) be on the front lines doing his sniping, and by recounting the damage he did when he was there.The book is strangely deficient in a few ways. For one thing, the author spends almost no time discussing the technical aspects of what he does: the guns they used, the ammunition, scopes, and such. He does tell about things like range cards and spotters, but at no point is there any real discussion of what a sniper is supposed to do. Instead, the author gives you a brief intro dealing with his experiences in Mogadishum, then the narrative switches to the States in the years before 9/11. Most of tbe book involves the fighting in Iraq. The main point the author makes is that on the modern battlefields that the USMC fights on, snipers can get much closer to the front, and while they shouldn't be stupid in exposing themselves, they can spend much less time on concealment and get down to the business of killing enemy officers and soldiers much more quickly than they had been able to in previous wars. Though the author doesn't say this out loud, much of this phenomenon is due to the fact that his wars were fought against 3rd World \\"armies\\" consisting of a bunch of half-trained guys with AK-47s and RPGs. Marksmanship doesn't seem to be a priority with them, it's volume of fire that counts. As a result, a few well-placed shots do a world of good.I generally enjoyed this book. I did feel it was a bit lacking in technical details. The author, interestingly, has been portrayed as an egotist by others on Amazon, and while I agree that he does spend a good deal of time telling you how effective he was on the battlefield, he also tells you how impressed he was with those around him on the battlefield. While he dislikes the one officer, he has a great deal of praise for three others (the battalion commander, the commander of the attached tank company, and the guy who's a coauthor of the book). He also recounts an incident where he upbraided a correspondent, only to discover the guy is a former Viet Nam-era Marine, and humbly recounts that he felt silly in the aftermath. Frankly, the guy doesn't come off as overblown to me, just rather frank in his opinions. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This is a fast moving story of one Marine during the ground war in Iraq and fall of Baghdad. Coughlin gives a little history on his early life and domestic troubles, but generally skips most of his military service except for the rush to Baghdad.Would have been a better book if he included more to explain why he considers himself \\"the top-ranked Marine sniper\\". As for the ground war in Iraq, he was definitely in the right place at the right time to witness some history (i.e. pulling down Saddam's statue).The book doesn't justify the title or cover page, but is is still a worthwhile, and fast paced, viewpoint of how the ground war progressed."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"A page-turner for sure.

Jack Coughlin's account of being a marine sniper. The publication is a very easy read and military lingo and thought is explained well. Most of all I like hearing about Lt.

The book is extremely informative about the inner workings and tactics of marine snipers in today's Marine Corps. In many ways the book is a fast paced read because the demand for the snipers to move quickly on the battlefield.I wish the author would have delved more into his family situation, but he decided not to tell that part of the story. I hate when women say \\"we need to talk,\\" those words are a real drag. I guess one drawback would be there is no real dramatic ending or climax but I imagine that helps display some of the mundane of conflict and the accuracy of the account. Officer Bob sounds like a tool, and even if that aspect is embilished a little bit, it helpfully points to some of the frustrations of combat. The author should have added a little more concerning his entire career as a U.S. Marine. The book is overall an easy and interesting read however. And while this is not one of the best accounts from the conflict in Iraq it is a valuable account and worthy of reading.

Despite the false start of the opening, where the author mentions his operational codename Gabriel and suggests that he wields the great angel's touch of death, he proves by the end of this tour of his adventures in the Iraq war to be a modest, funny and insightful soul who has much to say about the human experience of war. After compiling a distinguished record with something like sixty confirmed sniper kills (many at ranges of over 900 yards), he has laid down his sniper scope and has not shot a gun since returning from Iraq. The reasons why are implicit in this heartfelt tribute to his beloved Marine Corps and his detailed account of his role in transforming how snipers are used in battle in the age of asymmetric warfare.Highly HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Shooter is an excellent book, filled with plenty of real world action, but that is not the strength of it.

If you want to truly understand the combat environment, and not read a list of chronological events, or the distorted views of sideline observers, read Shooter."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Don't waste your time and money on this book. The statement on the dust jacket that this is \\"The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper\\" is a lie. This book is about Jack Coughlin, not Carlos Hathcock. Carlos, even though he is no longer with us, is the REAL top-ranked Marine sniper. Sadly, the book goes down hill from here.Snipers, like all other real special operations personnel, are quiet professionals who do not boast and brag about their duties. Coughlin tries to make the reader believe that if it were not for him and his daring exploits, the war would be lost. I get the impression that this guy has some serious self-esteem problems and tries to compensate for them by loudly beating the drum of macho self-importance. His ego would not fit into a C-5 cargo plane.It's easy to see why Marines would be insulted by this book. Coughlin downplays their enormous contributions and sacrifices and makes them appear less than able. The Marines get in trouble and call upon their guardian angel to save them. What crap. Making matters worse is that this book seems to have been written at a 6th or 7th grade level.If you want a good book about the war, read \\"Darkside:The Road to Baghdad.\\" If you want an outstanding book about a Marine sniper, read \\"Marine Sniper,\\" the story of Carlos Hathcock.I do not wish to suggest that this book has no redeeming value.

Considering the basis of this autobiography is for popular consumption, the author doesn't go much into detailed or technical points of his profession, but glosses them over while providing enough depth to maintain the atmosphere of authenticity in his story.Throughout this book, I was always struck by the grit and the realism of the situations presented by the author. The rewards, and costs of being a Marine sniper in a combat situation are palpable, and left an impression with me. As a sniper, they are always aware of the humanity of their targets, who are usually unaware of the fact that they are being targetted from afar, so they have no warning their lives are about to end. It's quite telling when the author admits to being visited by ghosts at night, and I hope that frequency decreases with time.One of the most important issues the author raises in his autobiography, is the needed change in doctrine for USMC snipers in the modern urban environment. The old tactics are too slow for a rapidly changing urban environment, and snipers can be an effective suppression tool as described in depth by the author.Overall, I highly recommend this book, mainly for the pure entertainment value of the story presented, but also, as a highly informative source on the fluid nature of warfare in the present conflict in Iraq."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"\\"The most dangerous animal in the world is a Marine and his rifle,\\" and Jack Coughlin was arguably the most dangerous Marine in Iraq. Shouldering Marine Sniper duties along with his role as company Gunny, SHOOTER reveals Coughlin to have been the ultimate multitasking killing machine in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Coughlin and his fellow Third Battalion Fourth Marine (The BULL) brothers smashed their way north from Kuwait into the heart of downtown Bagdad, leaving a trail of dead Iraqi soldiers in their wake. SHOOTER takes you for the ride. SHOOTER records the deadly game of war, but goes far deeper to reveal the quiet internal workings of the Marine Sniper. Coughlin's exceptional skills with a Marine Sniper Rifle are matched by his uncommon courage and innovative bent. Most notable among Coughlin's personal characteristics is his ability to discipline himself as only a Marine can do. SHOOTER chronicles both the kills and the potentially devastating emotional baggage that might come with them. For Marines who have \\"seen the elephant,\\" reading SHOOTER flies as straight (parabola noted) and true as a dialed-in 200 meter head shot. I spent a year with in Vietnam from 4 February 1968 until 14 January, 1969.

Now I know why - it's really not an easy thing to do. This is the story of Gunnery Sgt. Jack Coughlin, a veteran sniper for the Marines, and Capt. Casey Kuhlman, also a marine. Think about what a sniper does. Apart from being an expert marksman, this job cannot be easy, for many reasons, and this book explains why. Coughlin tells a touching story of his father's work ethic, which he in turn learned, his own passion for baseball, how he was nearly blinded by a sharp stone thrown by neighborhood kids, and how he joined the Marines at nineteen where he discovered he was a great marksman despite never having used a gun before.

Reviews of the book seem about equally divided.The point of this post is to remind all of you out there of the following rules: First, when you refer to a member of the United States Marine Corp as a Marine, always capitalize the M.Second, we are not soldiers, though we are sometimes referred to as Soldiers of the Sea. Soldiers are in the US Army, perhaps the finest Army the world has ever seen. Marines are in the Marine Corp and prefer the term Marine, Trooper, or Grunt, not soldier. Third Marines have the longest marksmanship training of any of the services. This skill may seem somewhat academic in the era of modern warfare, but I can assure you it has impressed the living hell out of anyone that has ever faced the Marines in battle. It was the German's in WWI that gave the Marines the nickname Devil Dog, for the Marines habit of picking off unwary Germans from 700 yards away.This is no way meant to disparage the marksmanship of the other military services.

An interesting prospective from a career Marine sniper. What was troubling to me was his total disrepect and distain for the officers and superiors appointed over him. He is extremely critical of the Officer Corps, and goes out of his way to point out his distain for them. He is even critical and condescending to those on his own team serving with him. In one instance, one his his team members makes a kill near the Baghdad Airport, and the author's comment was \\"...if he got one, I could have gotten ten, not because of a vast difference in out shooting skills, but because I had more experience in finding targets.\\" The author gives the impression that he is vastly superior to those in authority over him and with many of those serving with him. I have the greatest respect for the Marine Corps and the Sniper Corps, but was very disappointed with the author's attitude regarding military disipline. I think if General Tommy Franks knew of this guy's attitude, he would have been put on the 1st plane heading west with a General Discharge in his pocket.

Basically, it's a walk through the author's experience in the second Gulf War as a Marine Sniper. I don't particularly think it paints him in glory, and actually found some of his insubordination and whining when things weren't going his way borderline appauling. In places it's as if he's tried to humanize himself by talking about his reaction to certain events and his home life, though the latter gets at best a thin treatment. The writing itself is somewhat forced at times and the language occassionally getting stilted. In general, it was an OK read at best, and even then only if you've got an interest in snipers. I'm not an avid reader of the genre, but I have to figure there are better books of this sort out there."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This was simply an okay book. There are so many other books I have read for perspective on the war that are more interesting and more informative. Although I did learn a little, I feel simply that it was just another military book nothing special.The writer definitely is extremely confident and I can't judge whether it is confidence or that he is egotistical. Since I'm not a Marine and since I didn't serve with him he very well might be as good as he thinks he is. Of course if you read other reviews about this book you'll see some people don't think he's so hot or that this story is very true. I tend to think with all the Marines he's come across during his career more people would have reviewed this book and written about how wonderful he is. So I'm kind of leaning towards him being egotistical.I do believe that a screwball like Officer Bob can exist. There's idiots in every profession. I don't believe this book gives you that good of an insight into a Marine. Coughlin just doesn't seem that deep. So if you haven't read many military books go read Generation Kill, Thunder Run, or A Table in the Presence. If you've read everything about this war so far, then might has well read this one. It won't take too much of your time."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I got this book hoping for an eye into the mind and heart and process of the \\"shooter\\", and I sort of got that. But I have to say, his writing style is SO bad that I just could not finish the book. Though some of his stories were interesting, he really is not a writer, nor a story teller. Maybe someone else will be better at getting the story across, this guy was not the one. I applaud his efforts though, and I wonder why the publisher ever released it."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I would first, like to make a point about the title, that I picked for my review. Some people, might possibly find it offensive. But if you were watching a motion picture, or a TV program, that had Jack as one of the main characters, and his comrades referred to him in that exalted way, you would take it in stride. Imagine Jack, as the young sniper in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". With that being said, let's continue with the review. I felt this was an excellent book, and one of the things that appealed to me, as a U.S. Veteran, is that Jack and his co-writers, wrote in the \\"language\\", that is truly spoken between men, not only in war, but in training for war. Another thing that I really liked, was the fact, that as bad as Jack wanted to be a sniper, he then had even higher goals. He had the desire, to not just be the best sniper, but he had the drive and vision, to try to improve the entire operating procedure of snipers. The battlefield, was not the same as in World War II. A couple of earlier Marine marksmen, Hathcock and Mawhinney, showed in Viet Nam, \\"that snipers could be much more aggressive and effective by getting out of their holes and going on the hunt.\\" I know what Jack meant, when he describes the anguish, of not only keeping classified missions to yourself, but also, dealing with the uncontrollable memories of death you've created, that reverberate in your dreams, that you can't discuss with anyone, including your wife. Jack says: \\"If I awoke suddenly in the middle of the night, with a start so violent, that it shook the bed, Kim knew not to question why or what was going on in my head. She was careful not to startle me with a sudden touch.\\" This passage, sent chills up and down my spine, since in my own life, twenty years after I was out of the service, I was a single father, who always wanted my young son to wake me, before he left for school, and give me a kiss. He got scared, at the way I would wake up, swinging and yelling, about things I never told anyone. We then used a procedure, where he would come into my bedroom, tap my shoulder, and then run to the doorway, and after I got back to normal, I would give him a hug and kiss goodbye. I would like to give one last comparison of Jack's stature, especially, for the benefit of people that weren't in the military. I was awarded the \\"Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, (SAEMR) with an M-16. Comparing that, to what Jack did, is like you comparing your two-year-old son's, hitting a wiffle ball, off a plastic tee, to the accomplishments of Babe Ruth. There are three things I'm happy for, after reading this book: 1) That Jack was on our side. 2) That Jack got home alive. 3) That Jack and his cohorts wrote this book. God Bless America!P.S. The 2007 movie with the same name, has absolutely nothing to do with this book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"How this book became a NY Times best seller is a mystery to me. It is an exciting tale about an uncomplicated man who excels as a sniper in the U.S. Marine Corp. His combat skills are considerable, as is his bravery and marksmanship. Although the author takes a number of stabs at explaining his feelings at killing the enemy, his explanations seem to go nowhere. He feels sorry he has to kill them, but they are the enemy. If he doesn't kill them, they will kill his mates. That is the essence of warfare, of course, but somehow Gunnery Sgt. Coughlin's explanation fall flat for me.There is an elephant in the room that the author misses entirely. A sniper's job has always been tainted by the lack of sportsmanship of shooting an unsuspecting enemy. Sniping is the farthest removed from fighting with swords, where combatants look each other in the eye as they try to kill each other. Theoretically, this is no different than a pilot who drops bombs that kill people he never sees. And yet snipers call themselves \\"warriors.\\" As expert and as useful as they undoubtedly are, somehow that title doesn't quite fit.This book is filled with sniper tradecraft, and will be appreciated most by those who enjoyed Inside Delta Force : The Story of America's Elite .Counterterrorist Unit -- by Eric Haneyand, and Delta Force: The Army's Elite Counterterrorist Unit -- by Charlie A. Beckwith."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Shooter is an excellent book, filled with plenty of real world action, but that is not the strength of it. Shooter puts you into the mind of the sniper, as you attempt to understand the conflict of emotion a sniper endures. When reading through the book, you often have to stop, and remind yourself, that this book is written by real people describing actual events, not some fiction tale typed up by someone who hasn't \\"been there\\". If you want to truly understand the combat environment, and not read a list of chronological events, or the distorted views of sideline observers, read Shooter."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"A very touching piece by a man who clearly loves himself and his country.

This is not a warrior who wanted to share his story with the world to ease the burden of killing men who were fighting for their beliefs, even if those beliefs where not the same as his.Jack was a soldier and sniper who saw \\"the dumbest man in all of Iraq\\" in the first day of battle. The Iraqi fighter was not dumb to Jack because he watched him do something truly stupid, like load bullets into his AK47 backwards. This fighter was \\"the dumbest man in Iraq\\" because he was 1/2 mile away and felt secure and concealed enough behind a thick bush to attack from that position (remember that these soldiers are fighting based on experience and not from years of hardcore training like our Marines). Jack took this son/grandson/cousin/fathers/brother/friends/Iraqi soldier's life from his family. I honestly believe that the Iraqi fighter should have been killed because he was attacking our countrymen. However, I would respect Jack a little more if he treated a man that was so destitute in his beliefs he was brave enough to attack an entire force of American soldier, with a little more grace and respect. Instead, Jack takes credit for his cold bore 1000 meter (hahaha...oh but his rifle was already zeroed into the EXACT, no kidding he says it in the book, distance of the target haha) shot that saved an ENTIRE BATTALIONS MAIN COMMUNICATIONS HUBS from the ONE GUY ONLY PACKING AN AK47.Sorry for the brief ramble, but this book is filled with complete ego. I am ex-military and have been hunting and shooting for 17 of my 25 years on this earth and I have more respect for the deer/elk/beer/mtn. lions that I harvest than Jack has for the soldiers he has killed in battle. Through the book I was trying to tell myself that a sniper has to have an inflated confidence in themselves, but this was ridiculous!By the time I finished I thought of Jack as a supply and backline soldier who wanted to try to convince SOMEONE that he was good at his job as a sniper because he couldn't convince the Marines. It seemed that he killed not only because it was his job, but because he enjoyed it as well.~Cam"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"best book ever the perphaps only book i read because i want toooBEST BOOKwho ever says it not GOOD IS WRONG"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I can't believe the author can believe it himself - while I'm sure at least a full 1% of this book happened the way described, I wish I had paid only 1% of the purchase price - I still would have overpaid"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Its going on the 4th day and my damn book hasn't arrived to the door step yet.

Is this a man who is a killer or a soldier. A soldier serves his country and friends, a killer serves himself and kills for self-gratification. This man is the latter. If you want to kill in a war zone,it is easy, it doesn't take skill. It does however take skill to fulfill your mission, your duties to your men whilst ensuring that no life is taken needlessly. This man only takes life, and I wonder how much was necessary. Did he really feel remorse for shooting civvies or does he feel that is just the right thing to say.

I was impressed by a number of things: most importantly, Mr. Coughlin's professionalism and his superb dedication to the seriousness of his \\"job.\\" (He has not touched a weapon for 2 years and has never before, or since his sniper work had an interest in the \\"recreational\\" nature of guns.) At least in his professional role he has been the Supreme Realist: Dispassionate, objective, intelligent, self-critical as appropriate, yet still with a pronounced touch of humanity for humans he must \\"eliminate.\\" As a front-line psychotherapist I consider Reality as a preeminent factor in helping people deal with their personal-emotional and external worlds. In his professional role Mr. Coughlin would be my finest exemplar. On the face of it, again, in his professional role, Mr. C. was \\"a man for all seasons.\\" I hope hr reads this commentary. And I would urge others to read his book not just for its excitement but most importantly for its modeling of how to adapt to the Realities of a very, very difficult world.

The only bad thing I can say about it is that I wished that it were longer because I was hungry for more after I finished it.Coughlin is the real deal. He has been in two theatres of operation: Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom. He is highly decorated and has numerous confirmed kills. If you want to find out what it was like for him, buy his book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title. As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times. This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw. Alas it is not. The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting. The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus. Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's \\"One Bullet Away.\\" Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else. He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial. His attempts to convey a \\"human side\\" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived. This is a great contrast to the character development in \\"One Bullet.\\" There is no connection between author and reader in \\"Shooter.\\" Coughlin does not develop the role players either. In \\"One Bullet\\" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men. Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles. The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle. He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting. This can be found elsewhere.Overall this book was a great disappointment. If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper. He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This is a great story. Jack Coughlin is a great Marine and a great sniper. The book is written with a real cocky, type-a personality kind of tone. It doesn't come off all that bad, but you have to get used to it. It's written as if Jack Coughlin were standing in front of you, and talking at you. This is a good buy if you like military books. I got it for free from a co-worker, so the price was right and I wasn't out anything even if it sucked...which it didn't."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Jack Coughlin and company did a great job at writing the reader into the story, so that you are watching over Jack's shoulder in combat during the rush into Baghdad. Additionally, Coughlin's idea of a mobile sniper unit is unique to this book and satisfying to see the process unfold.Other reviewers say this book is not worthy of highest praise because it lacks eloquence and Pulitzer-caliber prose. To that, I would say that any title covering military matters should be nothing more than simple, concise, and accurately gritty. \\"Shooter\\" has all of these qualities. Anything more or less would either dilute or glorify the nature of war--both of which are unwarranted and undervalue the sacrifices made by those that fight for us.What would have taken this book from \\"very good\\" to an \\"epic\\" would be to cover more than the war in Iraq. Coughlin gave several hints of his past skirmishes, and it would have been immensely interesting to see his Marine sniper career solidify over time."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This book has some characteristics of \\"Blackhawk Down\\", it is still riveting and hard to put down.

There are also several typos and words in the wrong places, at least in the kindle version. Overall it wasn't bad. I still respect all the men and women who serve in the military."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I too like non-fiction and am a fan of first person military accounts. I opted for the unabridged audiobook version read by Dick Hill who did an excellent job.Coughlin's story is an interesting one that covers much of the roller coaster of life, career, and battlefiend events and decisions. Overall, I found the book enjoyable.With many authors, there are things that can become bothersome,such as formulaic stories, inconsistent timelines, missing information, and statements of fact that are obviously in error. This last category occurs throughout the book which is bothersome because it is set off by Coughlin's insistence on repeatedly stating how good he is, how shooting comes so easily to him, etc., but especially how well he knows his craft. He may know his craft, but the statements in error and inaccurate descriptions certainly made me question as to whether or not other information in the book not familiar to me is accurate or not.Probably the first thing that I really noticed that indicated that the information Coughlin was going to provide wasn't going to be realistic was his claims that he was so good and knew his craft so well that he knew what was going to happen even before he pulled the trigger. Really? Then I don't know why the Marine's top sniper pulled the trigger knowing that he was going to miss, but that must have been the case since he did miss shots and make poor shots. I would be inclined to think that if he know how the shot was going to turn out and that the outcome wasn't good, that he would not take a bad shot. This shortcoming was countered by him stating that even when he missed, then he knew why he missed. Based on examples from the book, that wasn't the case at all.One example later in the book was of the only combatant that ever survived being shot by him and was shot by him twice. That is a big claim that there is only one given that as Coughlin noted that during battle, he and other snipers undoubtedly shot a lot people but could never verify the kill. So there likely others that survived being shot by him. So there was a combatant spotted running. Coughlin noted that there were formulas for computing the shot given the speed and distance of the moving target that give a minumum accuracy of 90%. I believe the accuracy estimate is a maximum, not a minimum. So Coughlin shoots at the runner who doesn't go down and shoots a second time and he does go down. Coughlin is embarrassed and can't believe he missed. Later, he is called to check out a prisoner \\"who looks like he has been shot by a sniper.\\" I have no idea how such a determination would have been made. The prisoner had been shot twice, once through the arm and once through the chest with a through and through from back to front...hardly diagnostic of being shot by a sniper. So he made the first shot which was not what he expected (so much for knowing what happens before he pulls the trigger) and a second shot that was good, but was far from fatal, missing all the vital organs despite good placement.Initially and repeated through the book is Coughlin's descriptions of what he sees through his \\"powerful 10x Unertl scope.\\" 10x is certainly much more powerful than just going with iron sights, but Coughlin's descriptions of people and things nearly 1000 yards distant being brought in so close with the sight that he feels he could reach out and touch them with his hand is just amazing. By \\"amazing,\\" I mean \\"silly.\\" It is really amazing when he talks about the amount of detail that he can see, down to subtle facial expressions and grooming. He does correctly note that seeing a person at 1000 yards through a 10x scope makes them appear as they would at 100 yards with no scope. So Coughlin must have amazingly long arms if he can reach out and touch something 100 yards away with his hand and his eyesight is awfully good as well, maybe too good.Throughout the book are descriptions of bullet impacts that are right out of Hollywood, with claims of bodies being thrown about by the impacts of singular shots. The physics behind the descriptions indicates the descriptions are less than accurate. As an expert in his craft, it would be expected that Coughlin would separate the difference between what the bullet impact can actually do versus what is produced from the body's reaction to impact. Coughlin's descriptions make it sound like the bullets performed much like their Hollywood counterparts.In different parts of the book, Coughlin notes human biometric averages that he supposed used to help make his shots. He stated that the height of the average man is 72\\". That isn't even the height of the average Marine, average US male, or average Iraqi male. There are only few places in the world where where the average height of a male is 72\\" or more, but over the majority of the planet, the average is less, often many inches less.In another spot, Coughlin discusses making a shot at nearly 1000 yards with his rifle that with its special ammo, will hold groups of 1\\" or less at 100 yards which means 10\\" or less at 1000. Okay, no problem there, but then he notes that such accuracy should be fine for head shots at 1000 yards because the diameter of the average human head is 12\\" which is an amazingly stupid statement. The diameter of a basketball is only about 9.5\\" and I can't think of too many people with heads significantly larger than a basketball. Depending on the direction of viewing, the human head ranges from abtou 6\\" (front view) to 9\\" (side view), on average (US). There is some variability, of course, but Coughlin would be hard pressed to find anybody with a head the size he described as an average.Beyond these unfortunate embellishments and errors of fact, the story flows well enough and the descriptions of events and what led up to them is quite interesting as are the emotional descriptions that accompany them. If you are a war buff you will likely enjoy this book quite a bit, but it helps if you don't actually pay attention to the details."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Yeah. Perhaps a bit of water under the bridge by this time but not a bad book. Interesting. As reviewer 'Mike' says there are no good shooters who can write. So the book makes a couple of good points - some good officers out there - maybe officer training works? Officer Bob's lurk in all the dark places of our lives - and get unjustly rewarded! What sticks out in this book is someone lurking far in the background - the wife. What an unholy b--ch. How any woman can dump a guy who is out there risking his life for her and her country? The 3rd party in this triangle is not much better. Sure many (most?) marriages fail, but sort them out before going on active duty or give it another try afterwards. They were in love once. Remember?

Reading it not only made me proud of the dedicated men who go to war on our behalf, but also showed me that the noble warrior ethic is alive and well today. These Marines are heirs to the proud warrior traditions of the Round Table, the Japanese Samurai and the Spartans -- men who live by the Spartan dictum: \\"Come home with your shield or on it.\\" \\"Shooter\\" has given me new insights into the war in Iraq, the dedication of our people fighting it, and the sheer professionalism of someone who, for 20 years, had one of the most unusual jobs on earth."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I was in the Corps 30 years ago. My last duty was in SD MCRD, and we didn't train recruits to tell a CO to F off. Is that new? I would probably have agreed with him in most the incidents he writes. Especially in situations with the butterbar. Still, in my day, that would have been a dangerous pass time. Especially for a lifer. who wants to retire a Gunny.Anyway, this book is no great recount of sniper activity, like that of Hathcock. Its hard to top keeping a platoon pinned down for 24 hours. Maybe it's because he wasn't let loose for a few years in a stagnant war. So he had to make the best with the targets he had. Still it reads on and on like the drone that it is. I see target, I shoot target..repeat. Tell LT to F off..repeat. The best part of the entire book was the Somalia chapter. With all the service this man had to retell, he simply made the mistake of thinking volume of kills would be more interesting than a few really interesting missions. If you ever read this Jack, I appreciate your service to this country, but you need to forget you wrote this and start over. Tell us about the whole 15 or so years you bopped around the planet shooting people. I gave it a second star for not boring us with boot camp stories.

Coughlin was the top Marine sniper, and he carried the sniper's role to a new level--a mobile, up-front weapon--in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The story is wonderfully well told. I haven't had a more satisfying combat read since Ed Rasimus's \\"When Thunder Rolled\\". A great book about an outstanding warrior (no matter who's responsible for the prose: the gunnery sergeant, his lieutenant, or their ghost writer). Get it and read it! -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"\\"Shooter\\" is a must read for anyone interested in people. Once started, this is a book that cannot be put down. It takes you behind the job of sniper and introduces you to the person that must do that job. I am not a war person and do not like violence but once into the book, it is a page turner that kept me totally involved in Jack's outlook and ideology of protecting the troops and making our world safer. The author keeps the action moving at the same time as he personalizes a sniper and the mind set of his job. He makes Jack a real person and makes you want him to be successful at this job. It is not a job for just anyone .... it takes a special type of person. The history of Somalia and Mogadishu brought the reader forward into the Iraq situation and the necessity for changing old patterns. This is a current history lesson with actions that we can all identify with. This is a book for anyone that enjoys action, personalities and behind the scenes background and it keeps your attention throughout. The banter between the soldiers makes them real and you are constantly rooting for them to be successful in each mission. I strongly recommend this to anyone.

I have to wonder whether the book was even edited. Furthermore, while the first person account makes it easy to describe the action without too much skill, it also does a terrible job of concealing the arrogant, didactic tone of the author. In parts this is almost unbearable - I alternately had to push on through paragraphs of lecturing and incredibly corny portions that reminded me of a low-budget made-for-TV-movie.SOME QUESTIONABLE CONTENTSome portions made me wonder how much of the history was being re-written because the author seemed just a bit too prescient in some places and too willing to paint a rosy picture if it bolstered his \\"We were the absolute best\\" premise. One also has to wonder how he got away with cussing out his superior officers (including Colonels) so often - after all he was a Gunnery Sgt.In spite of these major lapses, it's important to separate his commentary and opinions from what he actually accomplished. (Obviously this is review is not a criticism of his accomplishments and sacrifices, which were great and laudable.) Coughlin contributed a great deal to Operation Iraqi Freedom and the book is worth reading if you're interested in a sniper's perspective of that conflict, which I haven't found elsewhere. But there is very little information about his previous deployments - he describes action in Mogadishu but skips over all other operations.There are a few other nagging issues, which are forgivable, but if you decide to buy this one, don't think you're getting a great book - this book has as many problematic paragraphs as it does riveting ones.Bottom line: Only for those obsessed with snipers - otherwise there are much better personal accounts of the war."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"While the title suggests it is an autobiography the majority of the book is concerned with the authors time in Iraq during the campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein.The author was an experienced sniper with previous combat experience before going to Iraq. What comes through clearly is the very aggressive attitude of the Marine Corp and the author's desire to participate in the fighting. This is counter-pointed by an incident late in the campaign which obviously left a deep impression on the author and highlights the difficulties of modern fighting and trying to prevent civilian casualties.What also comes through clearly are the problems of trying to maintain a family life and being in an elite military unit. These problems led to the author's marriage breaking down and to his decision to leave the Marine Corp. He also details some of the frustrations he found serving with some people who are less than professional and his disgust at one person in particular being rewarded for his service was another reason for leaving the Corps.All in all, an intersting book with insight at what motivates a sniper but I would have liked to see more about the author's life other than in Iraq."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Jack takes us along on special sniper operations few have ventured, let alone write about. An entertaining read from a guy with a dirty job; one professional who saved a lot of American lives in the heat of battle.

Semper Fi!"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I loved this Book. I have read other reviews from individuals that didn't take away as much as I did. It's very easy to say that a book doesn't encompass all the potential of an individuals account. I find that every source of compelling material can always be evaluated in another context. However, you have to be aware that the context of the author is not that of regular civilians. The relation of an individual's feelings are very hard for a person who has been conditioned to control every part of his being in order to maximize the efficiency of his task. Then again, you also have to remember that the author is a Marine. Which means that he isn't about to gripe and moan about anything.It was well stated that the objective of the book was to understand a world that is rarely seen by the unincorporated individual and to get a projected understanding of the mental and emotional constitution of a man willing to change his accord to accomplish a strenuous task that is essential to the accomplishment of the mission and his ability to live with psychological effects of having the highest proficiency of this task.As a Soldier I think this book is great. It allows the observer to understand one of the most demanding military occupations and visualize the scope of their responsibility and their dedication to accomplishment of a mission that is in no way easy to negotiate. It also allows the observer to understand that the individual still requires a sense of humanity that they must cope with in order to continue living as person.

What I liked about the book is how the men describe their journey after 9/11 going to Kuwait and eventually Iraq. One critisizm is that the author comes acrossed as arrogant and full of himself at times detailing his skill and his performance. Davis also frequently describes how he berates and cusses out various superior officers in the book in a Marcinko-esque fashion, but all of this does not detract from his accomplishments.I like the details given by the author(s) about where they had been and events that they had seen, in particular the chapter about Somolia.

Instead the Marine snipers in Shooter have all the braggadocio and bluster of fighter pilots but fighter pilots set out just to kill another airplane. They are almost surprised when they discover a real live person's face in the cockpit looking back at them. Snipers really earn their braggadocio because their kills are up close and personal. Even at 800 yards, with those scopes, they see clearly the person they are killing.Snipers traditionally have fallen out of favor with the US military between wars because it was considered vaguely unsporting or unfair to pop an unsuspecting target a half mile behind their lines. But during every American war, snipers have been brought back because they are so damn effective. They are effective not just in the number of kills but psychologically too. Is there no place safe? Fact is, in the kind of war we have now, there is no safe place FOR ANYONE. You might get it from a homicide bomber in Cleveland and a terrorist in Iraqi might get it wandering alone a half mile away from the front.I couldn't put down this book! This book gives a rare close up look at our tough, volunteer, military. A military that is made up of professional killers. The author really tries to be super tough and make it clear he is good at and enjoys his work . . . but, in spite of him and in spite of his best efforts some mushy humanity slips comes through when telling about the one who got away or the animals caught in the crossfire locked in a corral or in his last chapter.I like and respect this guy!

If there is anyone I wouldn't want within 20 kliks, it's Jarhead's Anthony Swofford. Shooter is to the point, graphic, well structured and riveting. The tale of the sniper hasn't been as well told since Henderson's story of Carlos Hathcock.I found one curious statement which surely was a typo. Referring to a position eight stories above the target, Coughlin says \\"Shooting from such an angle makes a bullet hit BELOW the point of aim . . .\\" Even an amateur shooter knows that shooting at an angle EITHER uphill or downhill makes the bullet hit ABOVE the target. It's all in the vectors.Buy it, read it, ignore that one little typo."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"It is often difficult to know how to thank those in the Armed Forces who ut their lives on the line. It is a difficult career path, to say the least, as evidenced by the mortality rates and the divorce rate of almost 87% of those who serve.This book is enlightening and informative from several aspects. First, was the way the role of sniper has changed from the Viet Nam War. In Carlos Hathcock's eye-opening book about that era in warfare, the sniper was a loner, sometimes staking his quarry for hours and days at a time. Recoiled in deep grass, and sometimes laying still beyond all endurance, the sniper would wait until the exact right moment to pull the trigger and asassinate the enemy.The Iraqi War Sniper is a different, evolved warrior. This is a fast paced, urban warrior. The targets and kills often need to be sighted and eliminated within minutes and sometimes seconds. The equipment and gear is more technologically superior, and perhaps most evolved, is that the sniper is now part of a plattoon, working with others, and saving the lives and behinds of fellow marines. This comes with a cost, as the casualties of his fellow marines, often rest on the conscience of his psyche.The second point of interest is the backdrop of the Iraqi war. Much has been written in the popular media about the crusade to liberate Iraq of Suddam Hussein, yet this is an insider's view of the war, the Iraqi people, and the events leading to the liberation.There are some unforgettable passages in Jack Coughlin's story. Such as when he is so exhausted after a horrific day of shooting that he lays down on his back and falls dead asleep during an intense firefight, and sleeps almost ten hours. And when he returns home a hero, yet feels only the ice cold indifference from his wife, who promptly tells him their marriage is over.This was a fast paced, well told, and interesting read. I would recommend it to anyone who has the stomach to ponder what war is really like."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This account is well written and details the everyday feelings of anticipation and sometimes frustration encountered in a tough job.

Having the discipline to anticipate logistical needs, still conduct yourself admirably, and stay out of harms way is all about this book. Take down bad boys at 400 - 1000 yards means the bullet hits before you ever hear the rifle sound. Laser target ranging takes much guess out of it.

Unfortunately, the writing lacks the impact of Carlos Hathcock's book about being a sniper."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Reading all the praise below, I had to double check to make sure I was reviewing the correct book. As an avid reader of military non-fiction, I found this to be among the worst I have read. Coughlin takes great pains to declare that he took no joy in his job, yet the book is peppered with with cliche'd macho phrases and terms, like \\"smoke-check\\" (used over and OVER again) and \\"invincible gunslinger persona\\". I actually laughed out loud a few times at the ridiculous ways that Coughlin refers to himself. The relentless back-talking to superior officers is also a pretty hackneyed feature of this work. And then there is the story, which is really just a loosely assembled account of some events that happened during the initial push to Baghdad. The author's poor command of prose couldn't even make that interesting in and of itself. By the end of the book I suspected that the author was really trying to convince himself, not the reader, that he wasn't getting off on every kill he logged. If you like reading arrogant, self-praising accounts that make use of every military cliche' ever penned, look no further. If you appreciate writing quality, humility, interesting content, and a believable author, seek elsewhere."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"He tries to hard to inflate himself. It is quite obvious that he is trying to promote himself as the new Carlos Hathcock. A legend in his own mind, Coughlin's claims have been the subject of much scrutiny within the Sniper community (which I was a part of). I was in 7th Marines in Iraq at the same time and stayed around the Marine Corps for a few years afterwards. We never heard of him until his book came out. There are better books on Iraq out there that save you the self promotion \\"look at me\\" attitude. I appreciate those of my brothers who served and continue to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan who don't feel the need to exploit the Marine Corps for their own monetary gain."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Having read both books about Gunnery Sgt. Hathcock I was impressed not only with his technical abilities but also his modesty,humility,leadership and devotion to the Corps.I can sum up Coughlin's technical abilities as possibly being equal to Hathcock's but there the comparison ends. To me, what clearly came across in this book,is Coughlin's attitude of being a \\"legend in his own mind\\". He seems more concerned with looking bad in front of his fellow Marines while at the same time, beating the drum for the mystique(his in particular)of the scout/sniper.He takes many cheap shots at \\"Officer Bob\\" and takes exception to his being awarded a commendation medal and a bump up promotion.Obviously, higher ranking officers must have thought differently than Coughlin regarding \\"Bob's\\" abilities including Coughlin's own CO(McCoy)who could haved disapproved both awards."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"It is not often that I find a historical non-fiction book of the military variety that I can read in one sitting. This book reads like a fictional page-turner although it is a real life account. The authors give you a great mix of historical fact and personal storytelling - delving deep into the thoughts and actions of lesser known heroes of the war. I have served in OIF, and this book brought me right back to the dusty roads of Iraq, although these gentlemen experienced first hand some of the most historical events of the race to Baghdad. It is refreshing to read accounts not written by officials and high ranking officers - giving you the down in the dirt perspective of one of the most important current events of our times. I highly recommend this book to anyone regardless of your military \\"expertise\\" level!"},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Seriously? Let's pat ourselves on the back a little more, shall we? I really wish I'd read the reviews on this book before blowing the money on it. As a sniper in the U.S. Army, I've read almost every book on snipers, and this rates as the WORST on my shelf. It was a complete waste of money. I have never wanted to tell an \\"author\\" (if you could possibly call him that) how badly I hated their book until I read this drivel. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, in fact, it should be taken off the shelves. For all of us professional snipers in the sniper community, there's always one or two of these guys who want to glamorize their little insignificant roles they may (or may not) have played in the big picture. Coughlin gives us REAL snipers a bad name with this book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"First off, let me say that if purchased at a discount, borrowed, or checked out, this book is a quick and interesting read. I'm a slow reader and read it cover to cover in only a few nights.But the reality of this book is that there are some glaring and massive problems. The book could have literally been about 1/3 the number of pages and not missed a single thing. It was either very poorly written or targeted towards someone of a middle school reading level. I can't even begin to count the number of times the same core points were repeated over and over and over. By the time I finished the book, all I could think was \\"if I never here the word \\"killer\\" again, I'll die happy. Yes, Mr. Coughlin, we get it - you're a killer. We get that you're a bad ass shot. We get that you and the team were putting on the war faces. We get that you and Casey were close. We get it. We got it the first 10 times, and we don't need to hear it again. The book reads quick enough that I don't need a reminder of what the core moral issue was that you opened up with 5 pages before. And 5 pages after. And 5 pages after that...And there's a difference between acknowledging your own skill and and pointing out that that confidence is a necessary part of the job. But GOOD LORD does this guy have an ego. I've yet to read ANY military book where the main character/subject was this hung up on himself.What was likely a very interesting story, a story rich with details for those of us who weren't on the ground during the invasion of Iraq was masked by a near constant patting on the back. There was no history of the snipers to speak of. There was very little depth to the personal story, and there was a near gloss over any higher level discussion of what's happening with the tactics that Coughlin apparently came up with. Heck, we spend most of the book wondering what's going on with the wife back home and we get less than a single page of explaination.Overall a fairly dissapointing book based on a concept that had mass potential. It's like the author was trying to write his own life story without actually telling us much about his life. To recap, we get a tiny amount of history (either personal or professional or general sniper related), we get a quick retelling of the events in more of a timeline fashion for the invasion of Iraq, and we get absolutely zero follow-up about what, if anything, Coughlin started with the urban sniper concept... all wrapped in a layer of ego so thick, it's difficult to focus on the actual story. And I'll not even mention the numerous typos and grammatical problems.If you're into the sniper stuff, and you can get this book for cheap, pick it up... just be prepared for the fact that this is a pretty low quality book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Understanding that Coughlin is not a writer OR proofreader, I'm very pleased that I borrowed rather than purchased this book. Some of the facts in dispute would be: Not knowing that shooting downhill without compensating causes the target to be struck higher not lower. Any \\"sniper\\" would know this. A sniper with a weapon short of an artillery piece does not engage a tank as described. At very short range, with the class of rifle used, one does not see the impact of the bullet, the recoil won't allow this. Of course in this instance we may be reading about his overreached confidence in knowing where the bullet should have struck. He claims to have \\"seen\\" the bullet strike 1/4\\"? away from his aiming point. How then does someone receive his bullets twice and live to tell about it? And what of his, of a sudden, interest in keeping this bullet magnet alive? And what of his \\"unsure of a positive target so let's shoot it anyway\\" attitude? How about the condescension showed to most if not all officers but his acceptance and coddling and admiration for the FNG officer? His ego is appalling. 1/2 star or less. If the man acted the way it was presented in the book, he is a disgrace to the uniform. If the book was written poorly by the ghostwriter solely, he should have fired the ghostwriter rather than accepting this drivel."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This book is full of contradictions and tales. It well known among Marine Sniper Instructors that the author isnt listed on any of the graduation roles at Camp Pendleton,Camp Lejeune or Quantico. .The self proclaimed title of top rated sniper is joke and insult to the sniper comunity and the Marine Snipers that have done far more and been awarded for there acts to include the Silver Star. Dont waste your time or money on this book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I understand Jack Coughlin is a military man, and maybe he did not have that much help with the writing of the novel, and this shows. The book reads too easily and although it does have its insights into the mind of a professional killer, and the minor struggles of living with killing people from afar, it's too straightforward. The guilt he did show during one incident involving killing civilians in incoming cars was described ineffectively. The writing ultimately fails to give the reader any true feelings on how it is to actually be in Iraq. The discomforts, the adrenaline, seem to all be inadequately described and fudged over. And Jack Coughlin's ego is at times through the roof, with tidbits of info thrown in to suggest he could have always gotten more kills if it wasn't for so and so. SHOOTER basically reads like this: I ran over to the top of the next building, set my rifle down, and shot one guy in the chest, and another in the head from 400 and 800 yards. Btw, the commanding officer is an idiot and I am the best soldier EVER! And Repeat... throughout the entire book. I may sound cynical, but this was because I paid almost 30 bucks for a book that I thought would be a great read and lend greater insight into the Iraq war, which it did not. If you want a great book about the same general storyline, (the initial spearhead into Iraq after 9/11) read GENERATION KILL, by Evan Wright, which I read prior to SHOOTER. Wright, a Rollingstones writer, describes similar scenarios, but with greater zest, professionalism and actually gets the experiences of war through to the reader."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"There are too many good alternatives to bother with this selection. I have nothing against the author, I'm sure he's a patriot and a good sniper, but he's certainly no storyteller. I read quite a bit of military history, and I've found several current titles that are real winners. Not this one.The author (Jack Coughlin) is a chest-thumping braggart, who comes off like that kid in 8th grade who told everyone how great he was (and everyone wished he would just shut up). Coughlin tells us over and over what a macho tough guy he is, and how good he is, and how insubordinate he was to his superiors, and how indispensible he was, blah, blah. It might appeal to some 13 year olds, but not a mature reader.The only reason I finished the book is because the details of action were interesting (not to be confused with \\"well-written), and it was a quick read. I do recommend \\"Not a Good Day to Die,\\" by Sean Naylor and \\"One Bullet Away,\\" by Nathaniel Fick. Both are well-written and interesting. \\"One Bullet Away\\" is particularly good. It figures, he's a Dartmouth grad."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"As a former Marine I couldn't wait to read this book, hoping it would be the next classic, perhaps on par with 'Marine Sniper' by Charles W. Henderson. I'm sad to say that I found 'Shooter' to be quite disappointing. I applaud Jack Coughlin's bravery and skill but found the writing to be awful. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This book is easy to read and easy to follow. You don't have to work to understand the story or the message. I find that refreashing. My husband and I both read the book, and found it interesting to hear a first hand story of a man whose work is to be a sniper. I recommed this book to anyone who loves biographical works or true stories. For the man of the house, it has the action, guns, war stories, etc., but women should not pass up the chance to read this book."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"The author/sniper seems to enjoy shooting Iraqis a little too much. Of course, shooting enemies is one of his duties, and he has a right to feel good about doing it well. But the book overflows with cocky statements like \\"I considered the ill-trained, poorly led soldiers of Iraq to be hamburger in my scope, practically begging me to kill them, and I was more than ready to grant that wish.\\" Still, if you can tolerate the author's apparent machisimo and arrogance, and his constant whining every time his superiors order him to do any job that does not involve shooting, you will get a little piece of action-packed history from the perspective of a person who lived it."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"If you start from a 0 rating, then I had to give this book 3 stars right away because this author is someone who has done what very few people have done. His description of the moments before killing an Iraqui soldier is mesmerizing. The rest of the book fails however. its written with a third grade style of writing. The author's sense of defiance towards Colonel Bob, his platoon leader does not convey any true rebellion in the writing style. His description of the comradarie between his fellow soldiers is not heartfelt. If the whole book was about scouting, sighting and scoping enemy targets, then this book would have generatyed a 4 or 5 rating."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"First of Jack Coughlin was never a sniper. While he may have been a fine marine that's up for debate if he has to lie about what he did to sell books.The book is full on inconsistency's and tactical errors that would most likely get you killed.

It is another one of many coming out of this conflict. But if you're specifically looking for information about todays shooters, a.k.a. snipers, this isn't going to be very gratifying. I have no doubt that Gunny Coughlin is a great sniper, or that being a Marine deployed today takes a toll of families. However, the book falls short of delivering to the reader what a sniper's job is about, or what his role has been in other wars. Why is his job so important in this war? How he is deployed? I came away from this book knowing no more than I did when I picked it up and began reading; technology has improved accuracy at long range. So what? About half way through the book, one wonders if the fact that it's written by a sniper is more coincidental, than informative. It is, however, a good, one man historical account of the thrust into Iraq."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"Very large apologies to everyone.

Which of course it didn't and neither did Sadam Hussein or anyone else in Iraq. It amazes me that the author has the balls to imply that there was a connection. And that just about sets the tone of the whole book - Americans being the good guys and doing all they can to avoid harming the innocent, and the Iraqis being evil terrorist.The actions scenes are boring and I felt no emotional connection with the author. Most of the book is spent going on about setting up his pet project, which seem like a good idea, but the narrative has more clich&eacute;s than a Kevin Costner film. The upshot is Jack Coughin may have had an interesting career, but it doesn't come across in his book. He's no writer, and he should have used a qualified ghost writer or let a journalist write it for him. His loyalty to the bankrupt unofficial line from the Republican party, and his simplistic take on the war goes along way to undermine any credibility the book could have had."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I expected much more from this book. I didn't expect the author to preach semi-liberal views and disrespect our leaders like Donald Rumsfeld. Several times throughout the book he second-guesses Rumsfeld and basically openly disses him, which to me is not proper for a military officer.Another one of his ideologies that blew me away was \\"Fight fair when outnumbered eight to one? F(expletive) that.\\" (p 68 He almost pays tribute to the current insurgency who seem to have thrown all the rules of war out the window. Carlos Hathcock seemed to have more integrity with regards to the honor of war. And as Rush says, \\"Only liberals fight dirty\\".The last straw was how he whined about his own failure as a father. Now I know a lot of liberals don't exactly support Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but come on folks. Coughlin left his kids time and time again during their most impressionable ages in order to pursue his career and his 'adventures'. That is fine if you are single. But once you have kids you need to raise them right. And he even writes about deciding to have his second child after he knew his marriage was going downhill. Those poor kids have to live with that reality, a distant, absent father during their most important years. That type of parenting frequently leads to pushing the kids towards homosexuality.I expected todays soldiers to be more mature and see the importance of family values. The days of pursueing self-glory and narcissistic excitement should be left to the dead-end liberals, not soldiers.The only time he seemed to stray from his subtle liberal political agenda was when he rightly linked Sadaam and Iraq to the brutal attacks on 9/11: \\"My personal viewpoint had only hardened since the terrible attacks of 9/11 ... I considered Iraq a logical target\\".

It seems most folks either loved it or hated it. The book doesn't have a lot of surprises but, all in all, it is a good read.The biggest shortcoming of the book is really editorial, not the stories themselves. As others noted, some topics were introduced, but not covered in sufficient detail, and there was a little too much lurching in the transitions between personal/biographical, familial, technical, historical, and philosophical topics. However, those transitions were not nearly as bad as the lurches inTrigger Men. The problem with books like these is they can get too Clancey-esqe in both depth and breadth very quickly if one sets out to make a comprehensive, authoritative work. Sure, we'd all like to have a little more technical descriptions of the equipment used. But I don't want to read a 500 page tome, either. It also seemed to me the personal side of the story in the closing of the book was rushed and ended too abruptly. But you can't have it all, and only a very, very good editor (John Weisman is one of my favorites) can bring a golden balance of all those separate levels of information into a harmonious, fast-moving story."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"A very well written day to day in the life of a sniper in combat.."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"This is a great story but the authors seem to have cobbled it together a bit.

I groaned at the bravado of the opening sentence. I had thought that snipers were self-effacing, quiet, unassuming types, not chest beaters like these guys, but who knows? I had anticipated a rapid narrative but around page 80 boredom set in, and then I ran across this chapter-opening sentence: \\"There's nothing like a good war to get your adrenaline pumping.\\" Or a good cigar. \\"And giant butterflies were bumping around in my stomach.\\" Who edits these books at St. Martin's, a monkey? I read that last sentence while waiting in line at the DMV, and I stepped out of line and dumped the book in the trash.

See \\"Boyd, The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War\\" by Robert Coram, Chapter Twenty Eight \\"Semper Fi\\".

In this book Marine sniper Coughlin gives a great deal of answers....and shows the question cannot really be answered, just dealt with. We've really only been in one war that we started...the Revolutionary War. All others have been \\"responses\\" to threats.....and therein lies the trouble. Many Americans don't want to respond, or think we respond too much or too little. It is up to men like Coughlin to do our dirty work....just as cops must deal with drunks and molesters.In this book I learned that the Marines are taught to kill....not to decide on what is a battlefield or what is not...once they're there...that's it. Coughlin must decide for himself, if the threat is a real one or not....and he does so with intelligence, training, and responsibiity. His personal reactions, and emotional battles with his \\"job\\" are a microcosm of the experience of all big countries....when and how does a civilized society kill its enemies, and who are they?The book doesn't, and really cannot, answer these questons. What it does do, is give an insight into the dedication and integrity of the Marines through the experience of one man. It also gives a first person account of the Iraq war, which is lacking by the coverage of the highly filtered \\"news media\\" who refuse to respect men like Coughlin, and choose to see him rather as a pawn of a political game, which he clearly is not. The book helps us separate the man from the military operation....too often we are taught to trash vets like those from Vietnam who were not responsible for the decision making...only for doing their job with dedication and whatever honor they could retrieve from the situation.This book tosses all of these issues out there....but leaves you with a respect for the military men who must deal with threats....and the discussion then turns again on what is a threat....we will always wrestle with these problems as a culture and as a nation, and must always hold in the highest esteem those who risk their lives to allow us the comfort and luxury to discuss these issues. In many Third World countries, there is no opportunity to discuss these issues...."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"I was a conscientious objector during the Korean war, and before that I went to military school. Now I practice the martial arts as well as write books in psychology. Jack has written a good book revealing what it is like to take your profession seriously. He kills for a living. As long as the world is the way it is and there is armed violence and countries and groups fighting each other, then there is the need for warriors. Jack Coughlin has courage, not just to be in battle, but also to reveal himself. He kills for his country, which means for the rest of us. I have never killed anybody so I don't know the actual experience. But I do know that if you commit to do something, really do it to the best of your ability. Jack kills professionally for a good cause. He reveals to us the attitudes that go with pulling the trigger these days. This makes him honest. What his critics maybe don't get, is that if you are going to kill people and do your job well, then maybe you have to have the ego that is revealed to us in this book. He's strong. He's not passive regarding superiors. He makes known his displeasure at incompetent officers. Why? Because he and his men are online in battle where they can easily get wiped out according to the goofs of others. He is intelligent. An intelligent soldier always has a hard time with stupid officers put in command of him. I know this much from military school.Jack Coughlin has to live with the thought of having killed a lot of people, and doing it for the rest of us. He has to try and live a normal life. Yes, it is terrible that soldiers have to die in battle, the enemy or ours. I am against violent wars and for alternatives to solving conflicts. But I do not desert the guys who kill for the rest of us. This is an exciting read just because Jack Coughlin shows us what the guy who pulls the trigger is like. This is something I chose not to do with my life, but I respect him for revealing what it is like to be a professional killer, and all he has to deal with. He reveals a lot more of the inner workings of a committed and skilled soldier than any of the characters in Band of Brothers, in which the guys there don't seem to have much in the way of personalities. The more you reveal about yourself the more you involve us in what your life is like. Yes, it raises all the ethical questions. Who is responsible ultimately for creating armies of soldiers whose job it is to kill because of politicians' decisions? Show me the inner workings of a politician now, the guys who make the decisions that make Jack Coughlin and other warriors kill. Take it to the Big Boys. Let's get real with all members of society.

Being a sniper and writing a book are two separate things - and the publisher could have done a much better job keeping the author focused and editing the manuscript.

Coming from a Military rich family, I enjoyed the book even though my Great Uncle, Who was part of the 506th and despsised the Atlantic theatre marines, taught me to think Army before the corps. However I needed to do a project for my AP US history course and this book hit the spot when it came to the Iraq conflict. In response to other comments about how Sgt. Coughlin was a cold blooded killer, I would like to say that somebody has to do the Job and I think that the Gunny didn't enjoy it, but he was good at what he did and he saved alot of Marines during his tour of duty. The Book takes you to the Roof tops of Africa to the Back of a Humvee and into the idea of the 21st century Mobile Sniper Team idea. It is certainly an easy read but keeps you interested and never dissapoints."},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"The no less than three credited authors of this book should have looked for a fourth because the three of them together couldn't make this book interesting, much less engrossing. In fact, they likely should have written a fictional account. Although the occasional chapter appears to be building toward a climax, the climax never comes because, as a non-fiction autobiography, the climax never actually happened. What we get instead are snippets of narrative loosely held together by their common subject - Gunnery Sergeant Jack Coughlin, USMC-Ret.Worse, in several instances, the book comes off as one of the fractured fairy tales common to enlisted soldiers everywhere. For instance, early on, Jack relates how he \\"won a full athletic scholarship to a major university\\". However, he never tells us what university, although in other places in the book he relates the actual names of schools attended by his wife and a fellow Marine. In another instance, he speaks of being complimented by a foreign observer who \\"wore the badges of a special operations unit that I knew well\\". And what unit would that be and why doesn't he tell us? He also talks of Marines being the \\"first regular American combat unit to enter Afghanistan\\" (following 9-11) but in the same paragraph correctly states that both U.S. Army Special Forces and elements of the 10th Mountain Division were in Afghanistan before the Marines arrived (ostensibly but inaccurately \\"from five aircraft carriers parked in the Arabian Sea.\\")What is most bothersome is that he never delves into the science of being a sniper. Rather, he pats his own back for originating the idea of sniping from a HUMVEE in the open vice from a well-prepared hide site. Considering that his weapon significantly out-ranged the enemy, I'm not sure this could be called an evolution in sniper tactics.Although a quick and very light read, \\"Shooter\\" can't compare to Charles Henderson's \\"Marine Sniper\\" (regarding sniper legend Carlos Hathcock) or even \\"One Shot, One Kill\\" (a history of U.S. snipers) by Charles Sasser and Craig Roberts.

Coughlin goes on to bad mouth his superiors, injecting the most bombastic disrespect of superior officers I have ever noted, especially in print. I do give him credit for his rifle skills. He claims the eyesight of an eagle, describing facial expressions of targeted individuals at distances that test the imagination.As a recognized marksman myself, with both pistol and rifle, I understand the logistical and proficiency challenges Coughlin describes.Personally, I would never want to be assigned to either his platoon, company or as his \\"Buddy\\" on a sniper patrol.As an H&S; Support Company Gunny he would have a tremendous workload, especially when on the move in a combat situation.Keeping the Battalion supplied with ammo, food, personnel, deploying critical resources and backfilling for casualties in such a volatile situation would test any Gunny.I have a hard time seeing Gunny Coughlin having time to jump into sniper roles, arguing with superior officers about deployment of resources; with his own personal goals and objectives being in direct conflict with those of the Battalion Commander. That same Battalion Commandeer who is in fact leading and managing the entire Strategic, Tactical and Logistical efforts of a Marine Combat Battalion on the move during wartime.Perhaps Coughlins problem with Officer \\"Bob\\" may be directly related to Officer Bob's attempt to provide professional level support to the goals and objectives of the Marine Corps, his superiors and the men of his command; tasking Gunny Coughlin to make that his priority instead of attempting to play rambo.No Mr. Coughlin; it's a stretch to buy it the way you report it.I have shared this book with Marines; I had to do that before I wrote this review.As an Army sergeant I sought input from others for balance and accuracy. I was not alone in my observations.I suspect you will make a few bucks on the first edition; the American people love the United States Marine Corps.The cover artwork alone will sell books.You may possibly make a few dollars on a paperback release, if there is one.I recommend the now MR Coughlin do a little soul searching before he attempts another book on the Marine Corps.As for potential readers or buyers of Shooter, check it out at the library before you plunk down cash for the hardcover version.I do not take any pleasure writing this review.You see, I have Marines in my immediate family.This kind of \\"Story Telling\\" does not serve them well.\\""},{"Title":"Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper","review":"The book is a fairly quick read, if you can wade through the neverending pumped up ego of this guy. \\"A guy on my team got one kill there...I would have gotten 10...\\" Many more statements like that throughout.Interesting review here from someone here claiming they were in the 3/4 and Coughlin was not involved in the hottest action in Iraq.

What a ride! Anyhow, the purpose of this review...I had the pleasure of working with both Force Recon, and the Scout Snipers during the run-up to the Yugoslavia implosion while assigned to the 26 MEU/SOC (Marine Expeditionary Unit - Special Operations Capable) in 1993, and found them to be near genius in their skills and abilities. Having that experience gave me a little more insight into how \\"they are wired.\\" Actually, they are like really good jocks, they literally ooze testosterone and swager. They also think that most rules don't apply to them, and generally get much more leeway than other jarheads.But, I don't have a problem with that. What they do is absolutely necessary, and there aren't many Marines with the drive and abilities to do this. Some folks I think are just a little jealous and envious of the neat things that these guys get to do. But, they don't think of the hard work and dedication required. Frankly, 95 percent of the Marines wouldn't be able to hack it. But, then it isn't everyone's cup of tea.I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but for a few errors, that the Gunny and the Skipper should have had editorial control over. Several times he refers to a clip in his .50 sniper rifle. Well, every Marine is taught that only the M1 Garand had a clip, all others have a MAGAZINE. Trivial? Yes, but a Marine of Jack Coughlin's \\"caliber\\" wouldn't make that mistake. Several times he talks about \\"soldiers\\". Well, no Marine I ever worked with wanted or would tolerate being called a soldier.Lastly, regarding how he spoke to the Army Colonel in Mogadishu, well, I have to throw the B.S. flag on that one. First of all, although they are high strung, 0311s in the Marine Corps have a strong sense of military discipline, and joint environments (more than one branch of service working together) are even more sensitive to these types of breaches.

The author spends too much time on the details of the mission, which I understand is of utmost interest to some folks, but at the end of the day, a book, a good book needs to have an engaging story, which this book doesn't have. It's more technically oriented, which is understandable because the author's own personality is more geared to the technical and not personal (as he readily admits in the book).3.

Nelson Bridwell and smoothly drawn characters by Curt Swan and Vince Colletta. This issue is no exception.Page one we get a modest summation of Superman himself: \\"with powers to rival that of the gods and majesty as great as the mightiest emperors...comes another action-packed adventure of Superman!\\" Oh boy.The Super Cigars (initial caps, natch) come from a couple of mutant kids from another planet who want to reward our favorite Metropolis editor from the Daily Planet in \\"helping us mutants escape the influence of that madman Calixto!\\" (as explained in Superman 265 - ed.) [I always loved how the DC editors would plug their other comics.]The switch is made, the cigars are in Perry's office. Meanwhile Clark is making the Supes to Clark switch and is running down the hall and runs into a pretty secretary, who says he has the grace of a gorilla. Oh brother.Perry goes on a plane with Clark to go to where Perry will get a Pulitzer Prize. Sounds cool. Unfortunately during the flight, the pilots faint and the plane begins to crash. This is a job for Superman. However, Perry puffing on his cigars gives him super strength and flight and he handles it himself.Throughout most of the tale, Supes and Perry are trying to figure out the extent of these powers. When Perry can't quite stop one super villain (OOF!), he leaves it up to a professional. After the adventure is over, he takes the last cigar and puts it in his safe. I'm not sure if we ever heard about this last super cigar or not. Cute story.The second story takes place after the events of Neal Adams' Green Lantern 86, when Speedy, Green Arrow's side-kick, was shooting heroin. This was edgy for its time and though was DC Comics heroic effort to speak against drug addiction, the Comics Code Authority would not put its seal of approval on it. But I digress.In this second story, Speedy has hung up his bow and arrow and though estranged from his partner, helps in capturing a gang of smugglers who are putting expensive equipment inside drums and such and smuggling them for later resale. Why no one would spot this though is beyond me.Anyway, after Arrow takes a fake fall, Speedy (Rob) and Arrow find the gang and mop them up nicely. Sadly, they're still not reconciled and go their separate ways. A bit of a downer story, and lots of Sixties slang don't make this the best of the two tales.Pick this collectible up!

Paige Turner (yes, that is really her name), secretary at Darling Detective magazine, is determined to write an investigative story that will propel her into the ranks of magazine writer. Then young model Babs Comstock is found murdered. Paige finds Babs' photo in the Darling Detective files. Using the photographer's mark on the back of the photo as her first clue, Paige starts investigating. But as she follows up clue after clue she keeps running into Detective Sergeant Dan Street, who is also Darling Detective police advisor. He threatens to tell her boss of her extracurricular sleuthing if she does not quit the case. Does this stop our spunky young lady? Of course not! Her investigation leads her to Union Square, Times Square, Hell's Kitchen, Schrafft's, & the Copacabana among other places. But she has serious doubts about her abilities to continue her investigation after gang members attack her, the Mob ransacks her apartment, and a very angry old friend of Babs stalks her. Bolstered by her beatnik neighbor, Abby, Paige perseveres, shares her information with handsome Dan Street, and walks right into a situation that threatens her very life. Murderers Prefer Blondes is a gossipy and chatty little mystery. You can't help but cheer on this charming sleuth especially when she has her own self-doubts. And the name-dropping throughout the story will keep you smiling.Also recommended: Nancy Martin's Blackbird Sisters series, Jill Churchill's Lily & Robert Brewster series"},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"The year is 1954, and twenty-eight-year-old Paige Turner is trying to make her mark on the male-dominated literary world at \\"Daring Detective\\" magazine. Unfortunately, she can't get her gruff boss to allow her to do much more than clip the newspaper, make coffee, and edit her co-workers stories. So, when Paige comes across the murder of twenty-four-year-old Babs Comstock, a beauty who was strangled with a Hopalong Cassidy jump rope, she decides that now is her chance to break one of the biggest stories of the year. Now, armed with nothing more than a pen, a good pair of high heels, and a blonde wig, Paige has hit the New York City pavement, and is uncovering more secrets about the lives of the rich and famous than she ever thought existed. Now she just has to figure out which one of her suspects did the dirty deed, before the murderer decides that it's time to kill a brunette. A brunette with perfect grammar, and a funny name.Amanda Matetsky is one of the best new authors to hit the mystery scene in years. I determined this when I read MURDER IS A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND - the second book in the series, which I read first - and have only come to realize it more, upon completing MUDERERS PREFER BLONDES. Paige Turner is an exciting female protagonist, whose nose for news, and amateur sleuthing skills make her an appealing character; while the set-up of 1950's New York makes for a charming backdrop to the tale, complete with nostalgia speckled in every corner. An on-the-edge-of-your-seat page turner that will leave you hungry for more.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"I read the second in the series before this one, and I think the second was a bit better, but I was not disappointed at all with this one.Korean War widow Paige Turner (and yes, people comment on her name, particularly since she works for a real crime stories magazine) lives in 1954 or so in Greenwich Village (NYC). Although she wants to be a writer for the magazine, she is stuck being underpaid and undervalued because she's a woman. She decides to write a story for the magazine and then they'll be able to see how talented she is. So when a woman she has met briefly is murdered, Paige goes to work trying to find out enough about the crime to write a story about it.Needless to say, she's busy investigating the case in no time at all, which puts her at some peril from a variety of people, including but not limited to the murderer.WHat I liked best was the sense of time and place, but the endearing characters are a close second. You really feel like you're right there and that these are people you know (Paige has a beatnik neighbor Abby who is her sounding board and able helper, not to mention offering her refuge when it gets too dangerous for Paige to be alone in her apartment).This is probably a woman's mystery (is that a fault?) because it really does describe a world where women's choices (but only if she was single) were limited to nurse, secretary, or teacher. I look forward to reading more in the series."},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"I loved this book. It is a delightful mystery, with a bit of romance thrown in. The protagonist, Paige Turner, is an irresistable character... irreverent, but likeable, and FUNNY.

Two and a half years later, his widow Paige is living in a small duplex apartment on Delancey Street working as an editorial assistant for Daring Detective magazine. Paige's real goal is to be a staff writer and create true crime stories but in 1954 women were regarded as capable of only being office help.When Babs Costock's murdered body is found in Woolworth's and her picture is run in the newspapers, Paige recognizes her as a woman who came to the magazine's office in the hopes of getting a job modeling for the cover. Paige thinks she's found the story that can get her a promotion so she starts investigating the victim's life. She learns the down side of a case of her own life is threatened more than once by various characters who want her to stop snooping.The first Paige Turner mystery is a real page-turner. Anyone who has lived in New York City in the fifties will realize that the author has captured the essence of the time and place. The protagonist is a gutsy and strong willed woman who refuses to let the male dominated power elite keep her down or stop her from getting what she wants. MURDERERS PREFER BLONDES is a delightful historical amateur sleuth tale that is very atmospheric and plays up the nostalgia angle.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"It's 1954 and Paige Turner, a young widow, is working at Daring Detective magazine.

Paige is a wonderful heroine, tough when she needs to be but also human with human emotions and fears. Amanda doesn't try to turn her into a superhero. 1954 was a different time and I imagine that not much was said about sexual harrassment in the work place still I found myself hoping that she would at least give those two bozos that she works with a piece of her mind.

I usually didn't like to read until I started reading the Paige Turner Series. I found this book while shopping with a few of my girlfriends. This book is helarious, and kind of pulls the reader into the story. I loved it. When my little sister--who hates to read unless she has to--picked up this book from my shelf, and read it, she loved it (I thought she was a lost cause). After she was done with it, she read the next book in the series, and now both of us can't wait until the next one is released!"},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"If you read the two Paige Turner mysteries, I suggest reading this book first and then Murder is a Girl's Best Friend; that's the order they were written in.These are great mysteries set in the 1950's with a feisty young woman writer for a detective magazine trying to solve murders herself. Mercilessly teased by her male co-workers because of her name, Paige Turner takes matters into her own hands and tells her stories in humorous and detailed ways. She has strong character and will plunge ahead in her wild schemes even though she's usually terrified. The thoughts that go through her mind are so charmingly appropriate.The disappointing aspects of these books are the inappropriate uses of the Lord's name, occasional swearing, and Paige's oversexed best friend, Abby. Abby is a cool character except for her 'loose' ways. Nonetheless, the books keep you very interested and you can't help but to fall in love with Paige."},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"An easy fun read for when you don't want to think too much.

One day when she calls in sick and the coffee doesn't get made (well, duh, she's not there!), they don't know what to do. Paige takes a lot of ribbing from her co-workers about her name. She is looking for that one story that she can investigate and write, hoping that it will be published in the magazine.One day while she is clipping articles from the local papers for her boss, she spies a story that grabs her interest. She recognizes the picture of Babs Comstock, but not the name, on a story. Babs was strangled with a Hopalong Cassidy jump rope. Babs had had high hopes for the big screen. She had been trying to get modeling jobs, thus her picture had come across Paige's desk some time ago.Paige decides to begin looking into Babs' life and try to determine who could have killed her and why.She interacts with Detective Dan Street who is running the investigation. She is surprised to find she is very attracted to him. Paige is a widow. He is divorced. Her friend Abby keeps encouraging her, but Paige is quite leery.Paige soon finds that Babs (really Wanda Wingate) was involved in some unsavory activities. Paige also finds herself in some dangerous situations. She ends up on the roof of her building, with very little clothing on, hiding out during one of those situations.This is such a terrific book. It is the first I have ever read by this author, but it won't be the last! I can't wait to read the second book in this series.Paige and Abby are great friends. They are very well written characters and interact wonderfully. The author has really captured the time period as well. I found it difficult seeing Paige treated so terribly at work, but then I had to keep reminding myself that's what it was like back then.The story moves along at a fairly good pace and the setting is described very well.

Unfortunately, her name causes her colleagues no end of hilarity. She is the only female on the staff of a detective magazine and is regarded as little more than the office drudge. One of her routine tasks is to file the clippings of newspaper articles relating to crime stories. While engaged in this task one day, she comes across a photograph of a murder victim whom she recognizes: a woman, slightly down on her luck, who recently visited the office in the hope of picking up some modeling work. Paige feels a certain affinity with the victim and decides to try to find her murderer. Paige also decides that she will write an account of her efforts in a bid to secure a writing job on the magazine.Amanda Matetsky's first Paige Turner mystery is an excellent cozy mystery. Our heroine narrates the story in the first person in an informal, self-deprecating style, and the descriptive prose is nicely evocative of the setting and social standards of the time (1954 New York). The story moves at a good clip as Paige takes her first steps in amateur sleuthing, getting herself into various scrapes along the way including run-ins with the local mob representative. There's a hint of a romantic subplot, but this doesn't get in the way of the mystery and comedy elements. As cozy mysteries go, this is one of the better examples of the genre and it certainly makes for captivating reading."},{"Title":"Murderers Prefer Blondes","review":"This book was absolutely amazing.

Amanda Matetsky's new series, starring &quot;Paige Turner&quot; (groan...), set in New York 1954, is THAT good!Amanda Matetsky does a wonderfully job of turning back the hands of time and taking us back to an era where women were just on the brink of being independent. This story is filled with &quot;little white gloves, Hopalong Cassidy, lunch counters at Woolworth's, the automat, and the BMT.&quot; All the references of the mid-1950's... A time when Paige is expected to make coffee for her male co-workers at &quot;Daring Detective&quot; magazine as she fends off their passes. A time when she must secretly plot to get published because she is a woman. (It always amazes me how far women have come in such a short time!)When a beautiful blonde model is murdered, Paige almost feels as though the victim is telling her to solve her murder - so that she can bring justice to Babs Comstock and get published as well.I LOVED this book. The concept was so original and the plot was refreshingly creative. The characters of Paige Turner, Dan Street and best friend, Abby are just terrific! I felt as though the author kept Paige totally in character with the times of the 1950's as ALL women were pretty much &quot;the little woman&quot; in those days. I love how Paige earns the respect of Dect. Dan Street for her intellectual and deductive aptitude in this mystery.I can't wait to see how these characters evolve.

In typical Ferengi fashion, they only visit those who have lost money."},{"Title":"Overruling Democracy","review":"In 2000, the US Supreme Court ruled in Bush v. Gore, \\"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States ...\\" 125 nations' constitutions explicitly guarantee all citizens the right to vote; 15 don't, including the USA and Saudi Arabia.In 2000, Al Gore won 500,000 more votes than Bush, but lost in the electoral college. Raskin therefore proposes abolishing the electoral college, since it contradicts the will of the people. He urges direct national majority rule for presidential elections.The Court called off a state's counting of ballots in a presidential election, for the first time in US history, choosing the president. Of 100 million votes cast in 2000, 4-6 million were never counted.It had earlier found, \\"The Equal Protection Clause does not protect the right of all citizens to vote, but rather the right of all qualified citizens to vote\\", robbing all 570,000 Washingtonians of the right to vote in congressional elections. Also, 1.4 million freed ex-offenders are unjustly disenfranchised, most for life. The Court cannot disqualify, for example, women or blacks, but it can, it would seem, disqualify all women and all men, or all blacks and all whites.3.8 million US citizens living in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and Guam cannot vote in presidential or congressional elections. In all Latin America, only Puerto Rico has not even the pretence of democracy.As US Justice Brennan said in Texas v. Johnson, which upheld the right of dissenters to burn the US flag as a protest, \\"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.\\"No government official can prescribe what is orthodox in politics, religion or any other matter of opinion. In a democracy, public opinion should control authority, not vice versa.The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no right to education The Constitution should say that all children have the right to an equal public education for democratic citizenship.The Court upholds the suppression of all political parties but the Republicans and the Democrats. It upholds laws that discriminate against third parties by keeping their candidates off the ballot, out of debates and off the media.It lets the Commission on Presidential Debates govern the corporation-funded two-party debates on the public airwaves. This is a private corporation set up by the Republicans and Democrats, comprising five Republicans and five Democrats. Corporate subsidies to pay for these two-candidate debates are illegal business contributions to the two candidates.Raskin writes, \\"Today, the property rights of corporations are far more powerful than the political rights of the people.\\" Currently, US employers interfere grossly in workplace decisions about unionisation. But employers should have no right to intervene in sovereign democratic elections among employees.The corporate ideology is that the private corporate sector is the realm of freedom and public power the realm of tyranny. But laissez ain't fair. Corporations want to be private with respect to profit, accountability and decision-making, but public with respect to risk and loss.If the state is indeed the enemy of freedom, then libertarians should be anarchists. Libertarians deny that public power can serve the cause of freedom, yet they want a strong state - public power - to enforce the rights of private and corporate property.The corporation is a subordinate body with no constitutional standing outside of the individual rights of the people involved in it. It is not a democratic citizen, and should have no political rights under the Constitution.In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act which banned corporate contributions in federal election campaigns. Yet Enron's directors famously put $6 million into election campaigns to promote \`de-regulation', that is, to buy themselves freedom from democratic accountability. Shareholders invest their money in companies for economic reasons, not to have others put it to partisan political uses. Individual executives and directors can spend their own money, but should not be allowed to use corporate treasury money as well. No corporation should have the right to spend money in any elections.Raskin opposes private funding of election campaigns, but this doesn't mean that the public should be made to fund election campaigns. The American people already give hundreds of millions of their tax dollars in public subsidies to Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Parties are voluntary bodies: if they can't raise the cash they want, this just proves that they are unpopular, it does not mean that we should therefore all be made to fund them!Raskin sums up that the Supreme Court opposes democracy, promotes political exclusion and social injustice.

Some essays are preaching to the converted- that is, they are unlikely to persuade anybody to the right of Raskin. But there are some essays I really liked.I especially liked Chapters 5 and 6 (in which Raskin shows how government has impaired democracy by keeping third parties off the ballot and out of debates, and criticizes judicial deference to the two-party duopoly) and Chapter 9 (in which he criticizes attempts to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag-burning, pointing out (a) that an anti-desecration law might actually encourage people to burn flags to get publicity, and (b) that an anti-desceration law that allows nonpolitical destruction of used flags but outlaws flag burning by political extremists is essentially thought control, in that it would prohibit flag burning only by people with political messages to convey).Other chapters are much more touchy-feely. For example, in Chapter 7, Raskin defends school busing on the grounds that racially integrated schools make society more \\"democratic\\"- but parents hardly feel like part of a democracy if unelected judges are telling their children where to go to school. Raskin proposes an amendment providing: \\"All children in the United States have a right to receive an equal public education for democratic citizenship.\\" But the uncertainty of the concept of \\"equality\\" would give judges carte blanche to dictate virtually any concievable policy.\\"Democracy\\" is a vague concept; some people see democracy as majority rule, others see democracy as at least partially about liberty or equality. On issues dealing purely with the former, Raskin's book is excellent. On issues dealing with possible conflicts between these meanings of democracy, Raskin understandably has more difficulty."},{"Title":"Overruling Democracy","review":"This book is extremely useful ammunition for all of us who argue with smug right-wingers.

He appears to be very normal, friendly and very pleasant. However, he also claims to be from the planet K-PAX. Fact or fantasy?prot loves traveling in space (faster than the speed of light), has a great sense of humor and feels that Earth's produce alone is &quot;worth the trip.&quot; On K-PAX there's no crime, no laws and no lawyers. There are no schools or government. There is no formal structure of &quot;family&quot; like we know it. The inhabitants of K-PAX work when it's needed, eat and sleep when it's needed and educated themselves when it is needed. prot will be returning to his home soon and can take only one other with him.The other patients at the hospital love prot and seem to be improving because of his presence and advice - and all want to be the one return to K-PAX. Dr. Brewer can only conclude that prot suffers from multiple personality disorder. However he can't explain the acurate detail of prot's vast intergalactic knowledge.K-PAX isn't just a story of psychiatry. It is a story that questions and challenges human nature.

If you are tired, lay down and take a nap, if you are hungry eat, no one will ask you to pay for anything, because on K-PAX there is no currency. It is Nirvana, as prot describes it. It is no wonder why most everyone who speaks with prot wants to return to paradise with him. He is in a mental institution under the care of Dr. Gene Brewer. Gene does not believe for a moment that prot is an alien. However everything he says about his home planet is investigated (to the best of human ability) and found to be true.

Thank you, Dr. Brewer!"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Simply engaging. Many will find this title after hearing or seeing Kevin Spacey's starring in the motion picture. What makes this science fiction successful is that we're drawn to the storyline immediately when we pick up and read the first few pages. Seems somewhat straightforward: a man named Prot who claims to be visiting Earth from another planet named K-Pax. What's more is that as audience (readers), we are drawn to buy either truth - whether Prot is nothing more than a psycho, or to believe and be convinced that he does come from K-Pax, and in the awe of the team of scientists who devoted years to study the orbits of the constellation Lyra, Prot simply sketches the night sky as observed from K-Pax - or, to summarize, Prot knows everything about the newly discovered star system.

It's a pretty good mix of Oliver Sacks style psychoanalysis and sci-fi. It maintains the 'what-if' basis of storyline for much of the book, but towards the end I feld a lot of the suspense had vanished.The film adds a few scenes from K-Pax II, and is, to be honest, a good version of the book. In fact, the book doesn't really offer anything extra over the film, which is a shame.A word of warning though - the books go downhill considerably after this one."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"I have to say that I found this novel extremely catching, and I quite enjoy it. I found it so dynamic, switching stories all the time, from Brewer's own business to his children's and of course to prot's, who is the connector for the whole book. I strongly recommend it to everyone that wants to spend a good time reading, and guessing what's the truth behind prot's thoughts. I'm really looking forward to seeing the movie, as I've been told is a good one also (although we all know that when comparing films and the books they come from, films always lose)If you are doubting, do read it and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"You can read this book very quickly due to the fact that its style is rather simple and understandable - but then: the story is very interesting as well. It is questionable if this novel is an SF novel at all as advertised. But, nevertheless, it uses a key feature of many SF stories: contrast. Everything, code of values, customs, lifestyle etc that seems so normal to us here on Earth is the exact opposite on K-PAX. The generally accepted on Earth is impossible on the - imaginary? - planet K-PAX and vice versa. So we see ourselves in a mirror. But the well-meaning know-all of a psychiatrist who tells the story does not. This is why his belief in human values very often turns into a lame and weak defensive argumentation, and he himself is the mirror that shows us the defects of our bourgeois society, with his family and their troubles as a most effective and a demonstrative background. But the author never leaves the path of humor, he never moralizes, never points at us in an insulting way. And this is what makes this book interesting, revealing and amusing at the same time."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only one worse is its sequel. Why did I read them then? Because I saw the movie and was dissatisfied with the ambiguous ending. My husband and I both wanted to know whether \\"prot\\" was or wasn't an alien. Otherwise, I'd have never subjected myself to such pulpy drivel. This is awful. The author can't maintain a consistent direction. He doesn't appear to have any idea where the story is going, he just writes it as it pops into his head. He has done a pathetic job researching mental illness, and he creates unrealistic sub-characters and situations. Why this book was made into a movie, I'll never know, but to the credit of the filmmakers, they did a much better job telling the story. Definitely a case where the film is far better (though not great) than the book."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"THIS BOOK DESTROYS THE LAST BOGEY MAN.BYELIZABETH HensleyAs a devout Trekker I read this book and saw the movie without any fear of the alien, but terrified of the psychiatrist! I expected him to be a cold scary manipulator who would take advantage of this naive and gentle alien while he had him under hypnosis! Instead, praise be, he HELPED him! I left the movie afraid of neither of the two, \\" aliens.\\" They keep comparing it to \\"One Flew Over the Coo Coo's nest, but how I wish I had read THIS book instead of that one when I was a depressed teenager! This is a kinder gentler book. This book is bout an incredible freindship between three very special beings. If Norman Rockwell built a mental hospital, this one would be it. Dignity is preserved and differences celebrated for both patients and, surprise! The doctor!The only thing I do not like about Prot's character is his atheism. It is highly illogical in light of the Anthropic Principle, the near death studies, the recent double blind, and in some cases (tripple blind!) studies being done showing the effectiveness of prayer, and the Gaia hypothesis. Teilhard DeChardin, etc. Eco-niches don't stay empty, not even THAT eco- niche.Rather Prot is an alien, or one persona in a very troubled human suffering from multiple personality disorder is irrelevant. Robert and Prot are friends for sure who stick with each other through thick and thin, and then along comes a new friend, Dr. Brewer who is able to help them both! Prot's touching, deeply moving attempt to help his human friend and find help on a world that is completely alien to him, almost moved me to tears. When the tragedy happened Prot is forced to take control of their mutual body, survive for four and half years on a world he can just barely tolerate, but he would do anything to save Robert including traveling light years and light years. The book goes a tiny bit more than the movie into how Prot spent that time, trying to survive and begging Robert to speak to him. By the time Prot is picked up by the police, he is starving, frusterated, lonely, angry with humanity and darn good and ready for professional help. He senses the doctor can be trusted, but can he get the doctor to trust him? Him, an alien?But \\"Gene Gene Gene\\" is up to the challenge. Together they try to help Robert.In science fiction fan writing, a story where you write yourself into the plot is known as a Mary Lou story. This series is the best Mary Lou story ever written!

It is preachy, contains unnecessary asides and is altogether un-interesting and uncreative. The makers of the movie, on the other hand, took the book's concept and created a wonderfully engrossing and powerful story. Thank you Hollywood for creating a terrific movie out of a poorly written book."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"My opinion of this book vacillated a bit as I was reading. The beginning was fascinating, but by the middle it seemed a bit too sentimental and the cures for the mental patients too simplistic (sort of like a science fiction version of &quot;Patch Adams&quot;...but then, maybe prot is right and humans tend to make these things too complicated.) At the end, however, the author threw a curve-ball so clever that he can be easily forgiven for any earlier sentimentality. I've never read, nor heard of another story where the alien who is treated like a person with a mental disorder actually turns out to BE a person with a mental disorder! And yet, there was a note of ambiguity at the end...the author's message wasn't, &quot;Sorry, there's no such place as K-PAX, and don't you all feel silly for believing in it?&quot; It was something more complex (and less cynical) than that. It was about hope."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"K-Pax is, in all honesty, one of the worst books I have read. I don't just mean worst in terms of pulp-fiction, in this case it is simply the Gene Brewer's inability to create something that will engage with his audience. Sadly he has chosen to write a sequel to it which probably means another printer somewhere has to waste their precious ink in producing what will most likely be another 200 pages of egotistical, indoctrinating drivel. Amazingly, this book has made it as a high-profile film starring Kevin Spacey, in this case I hope the director murders the story line and comes up with something interesting.K-Pax is a novel based on a series of interviews in a psychiatric hospital with a patient calling himself 'polt' who claims to come from the planet K-Pax. Personally I wish he had stayed there. As the interviews progress it becomes more and more apparent that 'polt' is a mentally disturbed individual who suffers from either a multiple identity or is suppressing something horrendous that has occurred in the past. In the course of these interviews, the author bullies, patronises and tries to trick the subject into revealing his true character whilst lulling the audience into the false belief that something worthwhile may be about to happen in the end. As it happens there is not so much a happy ending as an uncertain finale to this novel, more of a relief than anything else but we are still left with the continuous moralising and social comment that is made even more irritating when it is surrounded by another 210 sheets of trashy, badly thought out, inadequately expressed writing.I'm guessing that the writer intended this to be some sort of satire since if there was a serious moral point lurking in the depths of his writing then he either forgot all about it and replaced it with some Freudian psychology for good measure or I'd given up with it by that time. Unfortunately this is the type of book that someone is either going to love or hate and I suspect I may be in the minority of those who didn't like it. I received this book free as part of a book-shop offer and I'm surprised they didn't pay those who took it up to remove it from their bookshelves as there is no way it would have sold otherwise. Avoid this at all costs, I don't intend to even contemplate how bad the sequel is, it was horrendous enough wasting 2hrs 30mins of my existence reading the first."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"COULDA BEEN A CONTENDER (BUT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE)...COULDA BEEN A NOVEL (BUT PETERED OUT)...COULDA BEEN A WORTHWHILE READ (BUT HIT ITS HIGH POINT EARLY AND WENT NOWHERE THEREAFTER...)NICE WRITING BUT PLOT WAS UNFINISHED OR POORLY THOUGHT-OUT.I CONSIDER MYSELF A SUCKER FOR THIS GENRE BUT SUGGEST YOU AVOID THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ENJOY BEING LET-DOWN AND LEFT UNFULFILLED!TO THE AUTHOR....KEEP TRYING, YOU'LL GET THERE. JUST NOT THIS TIME."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Not being a major science fiction buff, this wasn't number one on my list of books to read. But after my 17 year old son read it and said it was &quot;really great&quot;, I picked it up and stayed up till 5 am to finish it. And I had to admit it was not only a well-written and totally engaging mystery about a man who may or may not be an alien from another plant - but also one of the more thought-provoking books I've read in months. Even reluctant readers should enjoy this one!One minor quibble and it isn't the author's fault - the book has been made into a move and before reading this book, I'd seen the media blitz on televison and movie trailers for the movie, featuring Kevin Spacey as alien Prot. So I couldn't read the book without envisioning Spacey as Prot. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I prefer to use my imagination to picture characters. Other than that, I found this to be a wonderful book."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Is this a story about a psychiatrist and therapy or a story about an extra-terrestial being that comes to Earth? No matter which interpretation you choose, this book is gripping. I have had the pleasure of reading Gene Brewer's sequel to K-PAX in manuscript form and it is even better and more fascinating than this one. So far, no publisher wants to print it. If you want to read it, contact the publisher of K-PAX and tell them you want to read it. Maybe if enough of us do this, his sequel will see the light of day. You won't regret it, I promise you."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"The back of the book suggests a combination of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,&quot; as well as mentioning &quot;Starman&quot; (i guess because Jeff Bridges is in the movie). Well, yeah, you could say it has some of the elements that made those books great. Or you could say the author just took the ideas in a few good books and mashed them together into something resembling a new story. Problem is, Gene Brewer is no Ken Kesey, and he sure ain't no Robert Heinlein.First, the &quot;sublime utopian outsider shows us the faults of our species&quot; shtick. Alright, there are some interesting descriptions of an unstuctured-and-therefore-free society in this book (think Anarchism for Dummies), and they're worth pondering, but it doesn't get deep enough into these ideas to be very convincing. And, overall, prot, the alien/mental patient comes off more glib and arrogant than sublimely super-evolved, as we are told to think he is. The character is supposed to show, as did Heinlein's &quot;Stranger,&quot; the ideal we as a species can aspire to. He doesn't succeed.Now, the &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; parallel. K-PAX doesn't accomplish what that book did either, which was to make us feel a great fondness for a large group of very dysfunctional people. Could anyone who read Kesey's masterpiece confuse, say, Chief Broom with Billy Ba-ba-ba-babbit? But, with K-PAX, the group of patients in the hospital where most of the action takes place, are an anoymous group of crazies. One of the plotlines is how prot goes about &quot;curing&quot; many of the patients of their respective neuroses. But we never see how this happens exactly, and when we see the patients improving, we feel little emotional reaction. The trouble is that our narrator, prot's psychiatrist, doesn't really seem to care about any of the characters, so neither do we. His emotional detachment, which we're supposed to see as his defining flaw, causes us to be detached as well, which is a shame.And, the ending. Well, obviously all through the book we're supposed to be drawn in by our own curiosity about whether he really is a being from another world, or simply a kind man whose own reality has become too painful to reckon with any longer. While the author's resolution of this (it's never as simple as it seems) is a creative one, it's still filtered through our clinical and unimaginative narrator, and so, to me, the climax ultimately disappoints.This could have been a great, if not entirely original, book. Maybe the author didn't give the story enough time to mature fully. Better character development, for example, would have gone a long way. Or maybe Gene Brewer (the author, not the character - what was that about?) just didn't have the muscle to carry off the task he set out for himself."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This is a wonderful little book - it is relatively short, insightful, witty, and best of all gives us a unique insight to the fascinating subjects of mental health and interstellar travel. The story is simple enough - the main character prot (no capitalisations except for other planets!) claims to be from the planet K-Pax, but is he simply a mentally traumatised man called Robert? This is a very clever book which has you thinking yes and no to both of these questions as you read along.Another very clever plot devise is that the author writes in the first person, and refers to himself as the psychiatrist who is treating prot/Robert. This is done with such skill and candour that you can almost get drawn into thinking that this is a true case study of a doctor who is relating the story of his most fascinating subject. It is very, very clever.Finally, it is also very uplifting. Some of prot's observations and advice to his fellow psychiatric inmates changes their lives almost exclusively for the better - somewhat simplisticly sure, but hey, this is a novel for entertainment, and here it hits the mark very well.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This book offers a very cool way of looking at our culture as a human being (among many other factors). I read it in one sitting, as it reads very easy. A nice afternoon read for all those philosophy majors out there."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Again prot - like in the first book - shows our society and its defects in a merciless mirror. This civilization is doomed because man is an egoistic - therefore destructive - being: he destroys his environment, kills animals and his own kind alike (in wars, in personal conflicts), and as a social being he rather wants to hurt others than live in peace with them, or he is simply indifferent; as a consequence he will destroy if not EARTH, but at least his own kind. This is why the \\"normal\\" people should be locked up in psychiatrist institutes, not the people that are now locked up in there, because they were broken by this world and society and reduced to vegetables and autists. I rate this novel a five star novel, not because I agree with its general message in its absolute, or better, radical meaning. But as in the first book the author - or is it prot? - does not try to teach us. He manages to describe the confrontation of ideas and concepts of life (or survival?) in a very humorous way. This makes it easy for us to think about our social and individual defects, and we do not adopt a radical anti-position. Because in some of his statements prot is right after all."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"One of My favorites. An easy, nevertheless enjoyable read that i could not put down. Its subject was not so much SF but more along the lines of psychiatry. Being interested in the subject myself, I enjoyed how Gene Brewer blended accurate and interesting information along with a fun and creative story. Despite the simplicity of the novel, I loved it and was dissapointed when it was over. It had humor and sadness and everything else that a good novel requires."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This book has so much more detail and sub-plots than the movie, and the characterisation is amazing. I would recommend, however, to see the movie first, if you're going to, since otherwise it will just annoy the heck out of you. The book is a mix of genres, and therefore hard to define, but it contains a good amount of humour and angst. If you like that kind of mix, go and read it!"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"K-PAX is as realistic as they come. Not only does Gene Brewer use his own name, but his wife's as well, and he writes this story with a very realistic feel to it. Its almost as if you are in the room with him as he questions prot about himself.prot is a young- mid twenties man who insists that he is from another planet. He is checked into MPI, where Dr. Brewer trys to find out who he really is. There, prot begins to have a positive influence on the other patients, who begin to get better as their are exposed to prot.But soon Dr. Brewer finds that prot is not alone. Deep in his mind, he has another entity, hiding from a tragety that he cannot face. Together, Brewer and prot, along with the help of a journalist, they must find this man before prot leaves for K-PAX.This man is Robert Porter, a small town man who lost his wife and child. Brewer must find him before prot's influence leaves.I thought that this was a very good and fast read. Brewer creates some very beleivable characters, including prot and the entire ward, and it is easy to become attached to them. The plot was good as well, with a sense of urgency as the deadline for prot's return approaches. Then Robert, who we don't see. Brewer does a good job of pulling him out and finding out who he is, along with the Journalist.A great read! There is a sequel, which is 'On a Beam of Light'"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Now, I did see the movie first, and that's what interested me in the novel. I applaud the movie for making a very good adaptation of the book. Much of the dialogue is exactly the same, though some plot points are slightly different for practical purposes (for instance, Dr. Brewer is older and prot is younger in the novel than in the movie.)This book is a great story, a complete original. It was a very good look at psychiatric hospitals and conditions. Not only this, but it was funny. I would even call it hillarious, if you like prot's dry sense of humor and frequent use of cliche phrases. It had me laughing out loud one second and seriously thinking the next. I would deffinately recommend this novel, the movie, and the novel's sequel."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"Simply engaging.

For something fiction to be that believable is truly amazing in my eyes.

Like a &quot;Fly in Amber&quot; by Diana Gabaldon, it explores that ideal, yet impossible quest to accept/forgive humans for their humanness.

Where can I get the sequel?"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"\\"K-PAX\\" by Gene Brewer is a manipulative and shallow book utterly devoid of surprise, characterization or interest. Although \\"K-PAX\\" takes on the guise of a psychological mystery, the only real mystery in evidence is how any publisher could see this novel as anything more than the heartless rip-off it is. Reviewers have dutifully compared Brewer's first book to Ken Kesey's \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\\" But the similarity is skin-deep; while Kesey's novel is a classic and genuinely provocative exploration of good vs. evil, Brewer's is an affected and vacuous retelling that simply substitutes a man who may or may not be an extraterrestrial for Kesey's enduring hero. Even Brewer's alien twist bombs horribly: I didn't care if the main character, \\"prot,\\" was an interstellar tourist or not; I just wanted to finish the book so I could move on to more promising titles (thankfully, \\"K-PAX\\" is a short read).

Interesting story.CONS: Somewhat predictable, mis-marketed as sf.BOTTOM LINE: An enjoyable book I would gladly recommendBRIEF SYNOPSIS: A psychiatrist gets a new patient who claims to be a visitor from the planet K-PAX.Alien visitor or mental patient? The truth is not revealed until the very end, so the book is mainly about the relationship between doctor and patient on present-day Earth. So, it's a stretch to call this science fiction just because a psychiatric patient claims to be from another planet. Although the patient/visitor named &quot;prot&quot; (rhymes with goat - no capitals, please!) can describe the planet with vivid detail, it's mainly a general fiction book.Classification aside, it's a quick and fun read! The book cover contains a quote calling it a &quot;mixture of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Starman.&quot; However, it's more of a mixture between Cuckoo and Field of Dreams. The story is mostly set in a psychiatric ward like Cuckoo and contains the &quot;emotional healing&quot; aspects of Field of Dreams. Alien or psycho? That's missing the point!The story moves briskly...always a good thing. This book could have easily been padded with another 100-200 pages, but thankfully, it's just the right length (228 pp) for the story it contains. The writing style is clear, detailed and always interesting. With the clarity of writing, it's obvious that much of the psychiatrist's family life is based on Brewer's own experience; sure enough, Brewer's website reveals some personal details that mirror those of his characters.I do fear that the current sequel and forthcoming 3rd book might be stretching a good premise too far, but, overall, K-PAX is a really good novel."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"+++++This book (first published in 1995) by Gene Brewer consists of sixteen chapters (or \\"sessions\\") and, as well, has a prologue, epilogue, and even a short glossary. It is a novel that is very easy to read and that held my interest right to the end.The story is about a man who claims to come from the utopian world called K-pax (a planet \\"about seven thosand light years [away and] in...the constellation Lyra\\"). This man is the prot-agonist of this story and calls himself \\"Prot\\" (pronounced pr-OAT) meaning (on his world) \\"sojourner\\" or traveler.Eventually, Prot ends up in a mental institution and the psychiatrist who treats him is Dr. Gene Brewer. (Notice that the doctor has the same name as the author.) The entire book is mainly about the interaction between Prot and Dr. Brewer.When reading this novel, you'll find that Prot has wit, humor, and much knowledge (especially in sciences like astronomy and physics and in philosophy). Dr. Brewer finds Prot quite rational and he later says, \\"I had never experienced a case like this, one for which I couldn't seem to find any handle.\\"Dr. Brewer asks his astronomy friends to formulate astronomical questions for Prot. Prot answers all these questions (despite the fact that these answers were known only by a few eminent space scientists). As well, Prot demonstrates certain otherworldly abilities. Thus, both Dr. Brewer and the reader don't know whether Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or a traumatized human suffering from \\"hysterical amnesia and delusion.\\"Prot has a positive influence on all people he meets especially on Dr. Brewer, his family, and other patients in the institution. This gives the novel a certain warmth and charm. Also, the author Brewer, through his character Prot, offers interesting social commentary. My favorite is in the form of questions: \\"Is [K-pax] any duller than on Earth? Whose inhabitants spend most of their lives trying to get laid, watching sitcoms on television, and grunting for money?\\" Through his character of Dr. Brewer, the author reveals and explains certain psychological concepts.Suspense is created when Prot tells Dr. Brewer that he must eventually return to K-pax. As well, even though all the other patients want to go with him to his utopian world, he promises that only one can come with him. As the announced date of his \\"departure\\" approaches, the question asked by Dr. Brewer and his staff is as follows: \\"What will happen when this day arrives?\\" As well, the other patients wonder whom Prot will choose to go with him.By the end of the book, most but not all of the questions posed throughout the novel are answered. In other words, the novel ends on an ambiguous note. (However, some readers may not find the ending ambiguous.) In fact, the last sentence of this novel is by Dr. Brewer and reads: \\"And sometimes at night I go out and look up at the sky, toward the constellation Lyra, and I wonder...\\"Note that this novel is the first in a trilogy. The next novel is entitled \\"K-PAX II: On a Beam of Light\\" and the last is entitled \\"K-Pax III: The Worlds of Prot.\\"Finally, the 2001 movie entitled \\"K-PAX\\" is good but not as detailed as the novel. You don't have to read the book first in order to understand the movie. However, if you want to understand the finer nuances of the movie, I recommend reading the novel first.In conclusion, this is a fascinating novel that will hold your attention to the end. Dr. Brewer states that Prot's story \\"taught me about myself.\\" I believe that Prot's story will also teach the reader about himself/herself!+++++"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"I picked this book up and read it in one day, at two sittings. It's an intriguing novel done as a psychiatric case study of the main character, &quot;prot&quot;, a homeless man who believes himself to be from the planet K-PAX. The story is a voyage of discovery into prot's character and a social commentary on the ills of our time. Although there are touches of sadness, the overall quality of the book is optimism. I didn't find it as compelling as the other reviewers, although it was certainly enjoyable and well done. I don't see this as a must-read for sci-fi fans at all--it isn't by any means a science fiction novel. Rather, for those of you interested in the human condition and in people; for those of you willing to take a touch of magical realism with your reality, this will be a good read."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This a GREAT book. Author Gene Brewer has written this book under such an odd premise; a psychological case study. The story is told from the perspective of the psychologist, Dr. Gene Brewer. The author and main character have the same name. . . I don't know what that's all about. (maybe like how Tony Danza, always plays a \\"Tony\\")Well, I have to be honest. I saw the movie first. So, I know that I had a predetermined thought of what was going to happen. So in turn, having seen the film, I thought the book started off very cold. The psychologist, Dr. Brewer, is looking at the character \\"prot\\" (rhymes with goat), as delusional. Now, I understand that is how any psychologist would see this. But, nonetheless, it seemed very cold. The &quot;cold&quot; soon subsided and the novel turned around. There were wonderful descriptions of all of the characters. Dr. Brewer's family, prot, and patients in the hospital were are brilliantly detailed. The interactions between prot and his fellow patients were just wonderful. I won't go any further into the story or the characters, I don't want to spoil anything at all, especially if you haven't seen the film.Now, I am by no means a quick reader. It took me about a week to get halfway through this book. But the halfway point is where the book really gets good. After I hit halfway, it took me a whole two hours to finish the rest. I could not put it down. The story had an intensity, perhaps even an urgency that was just infectious. I ate, did laundry, and smoked without putting the book down in that last two hours. It is probably one of the best books I have read. I am looking forward to reading the sequel.epc"},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"I was first introduced to K-PAX when I saw the movie as few years ago.

I can't tell if this is a Science Fiction novel of a medical thriller.All I know is that I could not put his book down, and I would have to give it my strongest recommendation."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"When a friend first recommended this book to me, I was a bit apprehensive at what I deemed was a typical alien conspiracy book. Admittedly, the first couple of chapters are kind of dull, but gene brewer soon gets over a rough start to develop an enthralling and thought-provoking storyThe structure of the book is its strength. The book is essentially little more than a collection of the transcripts of psychiatric seesions dr. brewer has had with \\"prot\\". However, within this simple framework, brewer manages to flesh out characters, family, suspense and plot.At the start, its easy to believe that prot is really the alien he claims to be, with his unusual ways and encyclopeadic knowledge of the universe. However, the introduction of an investigative journalist serves to strengthen the case for prpt being a human with a terrible past. the book becomes extremely interesting as prot's fascinatingly charming character and mysterious background are systematically developed. the other mental patients also provide fitting emotional accompaniment to showcase prot's mysterious waysThis book is an intriguing and enjoyable read thanks to brewer's clever character interactions and witty humour that serve to uplift an already scintillating exploration of the world of two very different men."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"This is a novel in the vein of an Oliver Sacks book, and it has a similar ending: happy, for some. The story involves a mental patient who calls himself \\"prot\\" (no capitals) and claims to have come to Earth from the planet K-PAX.Dr. Gene Brewer spends the duration of the book trying, through intensive questioning sessions, to find out who prot really is. Why is \\"prot\\" here? Is he psychotic, is he multiple personality?Meanwhile, prot is bringing his brand of sunshine to the hospital. Normally aloof patients are now enrapt, listening to every word out of prot's mouth. And they all finally have hope, but for the wrong reason: they think prot is going to take one of them back to K-PAX with him.And K-PAX is certainly described by prot as an idyllic setting. No crime, no hunger, they don't eat meat; none of the things that make Earth hard to live on.To say much more would be too much, so I'll just say that this is a gripping read. Brewer's narrative style is easy and quick, and I was always wanting to get back to the story (it also works as a mystery, but it is definitely NOT--despite the cover--science-fiction, although psychology students may find other aspects of interest). In addition, since the narrator has the name of the author, it lends the air of reality, as if this were a true case study.I'm not sure if I would want to read the purported sequels--that's stretching an idea too far--but this book is wonderful as a stand-alone story, and a good one."},{"Title":"K-Pax","review":"&quot;prot&quot; is a patient at Manhattan Psychiatric Institute. Gene Brewer is his psychiatrist. But &quot;prot&quot; is remarkably well-adjusted, displays no obvious symptoms, and gets along famously with staff and fellow patients. Only one thing--he has a delusion (?) that he is a visitor from a planet named K-Pax--a utopian world with no crime, no violence, no need for laws or government.Prot is the doctor's most fascinating case. But what exactly is the diagnosis? Is he really a space alien? Delusional? Split personality? And is he really going to depart for K-Pax on a date certain, as he insists? Can Dr. Brewer break through his defenses and find what makes him tick? And if he can, should he? You will just have to read the book to find the answers.This is one of those novels looking back to the time when psychiatrists actually spent hours talking to their patients, when quirky patients with odd hang-ups spent months or years languishing in psychiatric hospitals, and when it really seemed to matter what the &quot;underlying cause&quot; of a patient's malady might be. Those days are long gone, but the concept lingers on as a cultural myth. So this novel is part of a grand tradition. In this mythic tradition, the patients are often not sick at all, indeed they may have greater wisdom than those who treat them. So it is with &quot;K-Pax&quot; where the enigmatic prot is remarkably helpful to his fellow patients and even staff, in a way the busy psychiatrist can't begin to emulate.Author Brewer's writing is pedestrian but readable. He has obviously read a lot about psychiatric matters, though his knowledge is clearly second-hand. The story drags a bit, but it raises interesting questions and is worth reading. If you are a fan of those mythic psychiatrists and their mythic hospitals, well, this book might be for you. Reviewed by Louis N.

I had no idea where the author was going, which was very refreshing. Lots of books I can almost tell you the ending, but with Gene Brewer's K-PAX, I had no idea. Being a psychologist myself, reading this book felt like a case study. I had to tell myself several times throughout the book that this is not real, just fiction.

The stories are so touching to the heart that I found myself teary eyed over the pasta sauce. This beautiful book should be in everyone's cook library, and it can hold it's place in any other library as well. Bravo Mr. Schiavelli for another great installment of Sicilian cuisine and culture.I highly recommend this book. 5 stars in my book."},{"Title":"Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa","review":"Every once in a while a book comes along that doesn't try to be dark and mysterious, or technical and scientific, or highfalutin in any way. Instead this book simply wants to tell some pleasant stories. Many Beautiful Things is a book that does just this, it shares great stories (and recipes) in a simple, yet unforgettable way.In his new book, Vincent Schiavelli takes us along on his journey to Polizzi Generosa, a quaint Sicilian town. Along the way, we witness the natural beauty of Polizzi; meet its people, who find joy and happiness in the simple lives they lead; and taste Polizzi's exquisite culinary creations (don't worry, Mr. Schiavelli gives you the recipes for them all)!Although Mr. Schiavelli has successfully taken on many roles as an actor, in Many Beautiful Things, he takes on a role in which he is equally successful - that of a masterful writer. Schiavelli brings to life the landscape, people, and food of Polizzi through vivid images that seem to come more from the strokes of an artist's brush than from an author's pen.&quot;...[S]emolina bread toasted in the wood-burning pizza oven and topped with the ripest chopped tomatoes mixed with fragrant fresh basil, and drizzled with local extra-virgin olive oil&quot; makes a dish that is, basically, a typical &quot;bruschetta&quot; seem worthy of being displayed next to the Mona Lisa in the Louvre!Those unfamiliar with Polizzi Generosa need only to read Schiavelli's words to understand what an incredible place it is; &quot;Before us lay a mountain pasture, dotted with olive trees ...The room filled with clean, cold mountain air. It was scented with wild fennel, and bay laurel, and earth - rich, fertile earth.&quot;Reading Many Beautiful Things seems to transport you to a different world where the only things important in life are helath, friends and family, and a good spread of food. This book is filled exactly with what the title says, &quot;many beautiful things!&quot; There is one problem, however, that you may have with this book after reading it - you won't know whether to hop a flight to Sicily or fire up the stove! Thanks Vincent for showing us &quot;many beautiful things!&quot;"},{"Title":"Many Beautiful Things: Stories and Recipes from Polizzi Generosa","review":"I happened to pick this book up while needing something to read on a traveling layover. I instantly recognized the name of the author and the size of the volume promised to add little to the weight of my baggage, so I chose it over the hundreds of other cookbooks at the out of town Barnes and Noble I happened to find in my travels.In the back of my mind was the opinion that this was an exercise in exploitation of the actor's fame in movies and on the stage. Although Vincent Schiavelli has had relatively minor roles, they were in some major films such as \`Amadeus' and \`One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and a major TV show, \`Taxi'. The blurbs on the back cover from Martin Scorsese and Danny DeVito did nothing to change this prejudice. But here was also a blurb from Alice Waters. Not exactly your typical show business paison. Rather, a culinary heavyweight of the first Water (sic). The watercolor painting on the cover also enchanted me. Not exactly the sort of thing used by Patti LaBelle or Al Roker on their tie-in culinary efforts.The first thing which gave the lie to my prejudice was the fact that the bio at the inside bottom of the dust jacket briefly mentions that Schiavelli is an actor and goes on to focus more on the fact that this is the fifth book he has written, all apparently on Sicilian / culinary topics.This book is very much about both food and Sicily, specifically a small hilltop town in north central Sicily named Polizzi Generosa. The book opens with the story of the town's rather odd name. The town was founded in Roman times and the full name came to be in the thirteenth century. Read the book for all the spicy details. The relevance of the town to the author is that Schiavelli's family came from this town and some distant relatives still live there.It took less than two pages to be hooked on the story in the book that provides a framework for the recipes. I often judge cookbooks by how interested I am in making the recipes after reading them. A comparable \`gut level' criterion for non-cookbooks is how interested I am in reading other books by the same author. Schiavelli made me very interested in reading his earlier books. Unlike most other culinary memoir writers, Schiavelli also succeeded in my wanting to make the recipes in his book. Most of the recipes are absurdly simple and certainly inexpensive to make. The potato gratin recipe, for example, has immediately become my recipe of choice for this dish, avoiding all the headaches of dealing with curdling dairy products by replacing it with olive oil. This is Sicily, after all.Not leaving things at that, Schiavelli adds significant value to the book by including a supplementary table of contents which list all recipes by category, since the primary table of contents is ordered more to events in the author's visits to Polizzi Generosa than to things culinary. The categories are Antipasti, First Courses (usually pasta), Second Courses (usually protein), One Course Meals (pastas with hearty ragu, for example), Side Dishes (conturni), desserts, and liquers.The book is a true gem at a list price of $27. Given a reasonable discount, the book is a real treat.

Raised in the bush by the old people of his tribe, Banjo Clarke learned to live off the land and to survive as his people had for centuries. As he grew to manhood, he found himself caught between two cultures, his and the white man's. As the years passed the Australian regional government seized more aboriginal land and many natives were forced to seek work from whites that viewed them as lazy blacks.Despite this Banjo grew into a remarkable man who years later became a preserver of his native culture and wisdom. Over the years, he helped many people and opened his house to troubled youth of all races and cultures. He became philosopher, teacher, spiritual advisor, and foster father to generations of people who left his company the better for having known him.Camilla Chance, the author, who recorded Banjo's life is mentioned often in his narrative as an admired friend who understood and respected the aboriginal way of life. At the end of Banjo's narrative, Chance in turn describes how they met and their friendship throughout the years. She tells of going to the Framlingham Aboriginal Settlement with other members of the Bahai Faith. Chance also speaks about her faith and how it is in accordance with aboriginal principles. We learn of the deep and abiding friendship Banjo had with Chance and her family and his spiritual connection to her son David.I thought Banjo's narrative interesting. It reminded me of the old storytellers of my own Caribbean culture. I enjoyed reading it and found Banjo's perception of his world to be Zen like. He did not seek to control and change his environment only to live in it with respect.At the back of the book there are other brief essays and poems by members of Banjo's family and some of his friends. All this adds to the quality of the work and helps to make this man real to people who are not familiar with Aboriginal or Australian culture. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys learning about other cultures and places, or students of nature both in the broad and narrow sense."},{"Title":"Wisdom Man","review":"Author, Camilla Chance, writes about an Aboriginal elder, Banjo Clarke.

She is from the family of exclusive English Aristocracy and Banjo was a humble Elder of the Aboriginal people. There are no accidents it seems because these two were destined to meet and they developed a friendship that lasted for over 25 years. I loved this book because it truly gave me a sense of Aboriginal life and culture because Banjo spoke honestly and directly from the heart.

I thought. There must be a lot of good white people around, and we hardly met them before! Where did they come from? Grown-ups and children with open hearts.Camilla's little ones loved me being with them. Young David was just starting to walk, and he'd keep walking out of the door wanting me to follow him. He'd lead me straight to the woodpile, where I made a stool for him. I also made a tree house for him and Ruth. He liked doing things and helping me.A lot of my friends came to see me while I was at Camilla's, Aboriginals who had lived a heartbreaking life trying to cope in the white man's world. Camilla invited them in and showed them her trust. She left the house open for them if she had to go out for the day.All these events inspired me to want to write a book. I reckoned that the way the high-society people shared with me would tell something to the world about equality, and having love for people from different races. I reckon if people knew about true Aboriginal qualities - so similar to the Baha'i beliefs - then this would help the world do things from the heart. I think for people to learn about Aboriginality might even be the saving of the world.I asked Camilla to help me write my book and she agreed. Twenty-five years later, we have been still working out every thing I want to say.\\"Banjo Clarke said it best in this quote which appears on the back cover of the book, \\"Life should be looked upon as a sacred thing, to be handled carefully. If something terrible happens, you stop for a while and have a think, and then you work around the next big problem coming up. Like water around a rock. And you still help people when you can, even your worst enemy.\\"As I indicated previously the beauty of this book is that when you read about Banjo Clarke you will be reading his words, his thoughts and connecting to his heart. You will have a greater understanding of the Aboriginal way which is to embrace all life.To learn more about Camilla Chance and Wisdom Man Banjo Clarke visit the Wisdom Man Book site and listen to the onlinewithandrea interview with Author Camilla Chance.Andrea R.

Somehow, you feel that Banjo Clarke is one of those 'wise teachers' who walk the earth at different times in human history, calling us to our true purpose and to our true selves. A mortal man nonetheless, a spiritual wise man of the Kirrae Whurrong tribe of Australia who battled hunger and racism in the Depression, who worked as a boxer and built roads amid the bombs of WWII, among many other things in order to survive, and who fought against his own demon, alcoholism, who witnessed many tragedies within his own family and among his people - despite these many difficulties, his deep and proud Aboriginal roots, attachment to the land and beautiful spirituality, strengthened by his Baha'i beliefs, safeguarded his pure heart and his tremendous capacity for love. Camilla Chance records Banjo Clarke's memories, profound teachings and great hope for the future with reverence and deep respect, unfolding a fascinating account of this committed environmentalist and authentic humanitarian whose life touched so many from all walks of life and all races. Banjo Clarke's spiritual nature is so advanced it makes me think that if we only use only 15% of our brainpower, we use even less of our spiritual power - that power borne of pure love that is so sorely needed to bring about a safe and thriving world. This book is riveting and sometimes too heartbreaking to read, but has so much to teach us, particularly here in the Western world. Banjo Clarke is someone who dares us to bring the sacred into our lives, something that we all carry within us but all too often ignore. In a world where we desecrate and plunder the earth with thoughtless and greedy abandon, where religion divides people rather than unites them as it is meant to do, and where universal compassion and empathy take second and even third place to a materialist world culture, Banjo's message is all the more urgent and important for us to hear today. I recommend this very moving and fascinating book wholeheartedly!"},{"Title":"Wisdom Man","review":"Camilla Chance met Aboriginal people in 1975 in Warrnambool, Victoria in Southern Australia. The Aboriginal population there was high, but they were good at disappearing. Being from the other end of the social spectrum, she could more easily have been among their adversaries. But instead, she became a friend, got jobs for them, bailed them out of jail and did everything she could to become an ally.When she was accepted as Aboriginal in spirit, a 27-year period of writing down their philosophy, as expressed by the head of one family, Banjo Clarke, led to the book \\"Wisdom Man\\".Camilla receives no money for the published work, but travels the world disseminating Banjo's ideas, because she saw firsthand that indigenous people who are true to their old laws are, in many ways, living the closest to how we all need to live now for our planet to survive."},{"Title":"Wisdom Man","review":"When I received this book years back I read a chapter and then set it on my book shelf.

On the surface the cause was clear and just. The Greeks were fighting to emancipate the Hellenic spirit that spawned our own highly vaunted political and ideological traditions. The Ottoman Empire was gasping its last breath as it enforced its strangle hold on our noble race of founding fathers. At any rate, this was the rhetoric that inspired the Philhellenic movement in Western Europe that saw the most idealistic intellectuals of the early 19th century, most notably Lord Byron himself, go to Greece and fight the good fight against the Turks.What they found when they got there was a Balkan War that makes the recent war in the former Yugoslavia seem tame, with atrocities being committed with equal fury on both sides. At the same time we see the absurd levels that the gentlemen, many of them veterans of the Napoleonic Wars, went to, to assert their ridiculous notions of heroic honor. As the Greeks and Turks fought a ruthless war, many of the European volunteers strutted about as if they were involved in a ritual theater devised strictly to reveal the nobility of their spirits. Thus we get the great clash of Greeks versus Turks and the various visions of war at odds with each other. A great cynicism was the result of the Philhellenic movement and this book tells the story with thorough research and fairness. St. Clair's writing, always historical in tone, at times, soars to poetry. This book should be in print. It's a great and important history."},{"Title":"That Greece Might Still be Free: Philhellenes in the War of Independence","review":"Published in 1972 by Oxford this is a well-researched work by a historian intent on demystifying the Greek Revolution. In this he succeeds in painting a tedious, painful account of the volunteers. Unfortunately the work downplays and ignores the role that ideology, national identity, spirituality, heroics had in the philhellenic formation of modern Greece. His bleak account is much too one sided and the academic narrative withers under the weight of his own narrow perspective.According to St Clair, the philhellenes, European volunteers in the Greek Revolution were ineffective, prone to deadly infighting, falling prey to \\"Greek\\" starvation and disease (my Dickens what was London like in 1821?), brought poor equipment (pistols, swords and ceremonial dress), and suffered from the betrayal and general incompetence of the Greeks they came to aid. Additionally the Philhellenes (including Byron) were led there by false promises and false propaganda created by other misguided philhellenes.Got it? St Clair tells us the war was won by accident at Navarino in any case and the long campaigns against Ibrahim Pasha and years of fighting attrition and slaughter by both sides was basically pointless.St Clair explains how the Greeks adopted the European Philhellene notion of \\"regeneration,\\" Regeneration being the notion of the connection of the modern and the ancient Greeks. By renaming streets after ancient historians and tearing down mosques we gather from St Clair that the modern Greeks are being silly. According to St Clair and consistent with his general perspective, \\"The Acropolis of Athens was stripped of everything and rendered a lifeless desert.\\"The book is a serious scholarly work however, one of a handful that broadly document events and personalities of the Greek War. Much of the book explores the relationship of the Great powers and their interest in the outcome. The author does present a wide array of facts (even with his sniping about diseases or Greek backwardness) and is evenhanded or even sympathetic to a few philhellenes, Thomas Gordon is spared (the fact that he settled in Argos is mentioned as an inconvenient fact) and the Bostonian Samuel Howe's philanthropic work is praised. However the author is intent on casting the struggle and the work of the philhellenes as a \\"cruel disappointment.\\" Modern Greece with all of its faults is a testament to the alternative point of view, namely that Greece remains free and its cultural legacy informs us all in part due to the sacrifice and mythologizing of the Philhellenes."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"Where are all the reviews? Come on, people! This is a great book! It is the best popular book I've ever read on the biology of the origin of life. It starts out with a historical survey of the efforts to deal with this problem. When I first picked up the book, I thought this section was only in there to pad out the page count. But I was dead wrong. Not only is the writing style lively and entertaining (without being too cute), but the authors show how an understanding of the historical development of the effort helps to understand where the science of this problem is today. You know how they stay that God is in the details? Well, it is actually in the nitty-gritty details in this section of the book that makes this historical introduction valuable.Anyone interested in the problem of the origin of life knows about Stanley Miller's experiments of sending electric sparks through a mixture of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor and how they produced an incredibly complex mixture of organic compounds, including many of the amino acids of life. But never have I read such a detailed description of the experiments. I usually gloss over descriptions of Miller's experiments, mainly as it turns out because the descriptions are boring without knowledge of the details. But the authors of this book show how extremely interesting the details of these experiments actually were and why they were so important, even though it turned out that Miller's assumptions of the composition of the primitive atmosphere were wrong. This level of detail sets the tone for the entire book, which really delves into the details. Non-specialists are bound to come away with a deeper understanding of the problems involved in understanding the origin of life, even if they've read the popular books by Christian De Duve, Thomas Gold, and John Maynard Smith.After presenting the historical background, the authors first take a bottom up, then a top down approach to the problem. The bottom up approach examines various likely scenarios that have been developed of how a basic chemical soup could have given rise to metabolism and heredity. The top down approach looks at life as it is today and tries to work the problem backwards. This is an especially interesting section of the book and points out the importance of symbiosis and the probable rampant exchange of hereditary material in the very early history of life. The \\"tree\\" of life it turns out is not a well-organized tree at the bottom, but a complex network where diverse, unrelated organisms freely exchanged hereditary material. I found it very interesting that this notion was in this book already, since it was only a few months ago that an article on this theory appeared in Scientific American. This book is VERY up to date.Before reading this book, I was persuaded that Gold's theories of the origin of life were very likely true, that it really formed deep within the mantle. But after reading this book, I am no longer convinced. Read the book, and you will see for yourself that it is much more likely that it would take a planet subject to widely varying tides and extreme climactic changes to provide the opportunities for the evolution of life. Conditions in the mantle are the exact opposite of all these exciting happenings on the surface. Similar reasoning leads the authors to speculate that the probability of life evolving on the moons of those Jupiter-sized planets surrounding nearby stars that have been discovered in recent years might be very high, since the climactic swings and tidal forces caused by the large gas parent planets would be extreme. Yes, the book ends up in a wonderful final chapter speculating on the probability of life evolving on other planets. At first I had the same thoughts I first had about the beginning of the book, that this last chapter was just fluff. But soon I was utterly riveted by their argument. A fascinating, entertaining, and extremely enlightening book."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"I read a lot of material on the origin of life. Having run across Jeffery Bada's writings in some books, as well as on his web page, in the peer-reviewed journal \`Science', and in popular science journals such as \`The Sciences', I regarded Bada as an honest scientist: one who presents an even-handed accounting of material and evidence. I have always found his fairness and willingness to express his skepticism to be quite refreshing, especially since the topic of the origin of life can have major philosophical and religious ramifications (many scientists present only the positive evidences, hide the conflicting evidences, and do their utmost to shove their materialistic philosophy down the reader's throats). Bada holds firmly to a purely-natural origin of life, but he does not allow his worldview to bias his work - he is true to scientific evidences foremost. I expected the same from him when I heard of his book. When I read \\"The Spark of Life\\", I was not disappointed. Bada - and apparently the lead author, Christopher Wills, as well - present the reader with an honest coverage of the details, along the lines of, \\"According to this theory, ..., but keep in mind that....\\". As another reviewer noted, the authors present the reader with both sides of the argument and allow the reader to come to his or her own conclusion: the authors do not insist on telling you what you must think. For their maintenance of integrity in what can be a rather volatile subject, I commend the authors and \\"award\\" them 5 stars.But the praise does not end there. They provide an up-to-date, broad, introductory coverage of the OOL field. If you know nothing about it at all, you can sit down and read the book and understand almost every sentence, and when you have completed reading the book, you will be up to speed on almost all aspects. This is probably the best introductory book on the origin of life I have read to date. Again, worthy of 5 stars.However, note that the book is at the introductory level. It is written in everyday language and does not delve into the confusing and overwhelming complexities of organic chemistry or molecular cell biology. Those who have already read \\"The Molecular Origins of Life: Assembling Pieces of the Puzzle\\" will not find anywhere near the level of detail in \\"The Spark of Life\\" as they did in \\"The Molecular Origins of Life\\": I would recommend this book to those readers only if they found the other book \\"over their heads\\", or too-narrowly focussed. But this does not detract from \\"The Spark of Life\\" at all. It was not aimed at the research scientist as the other book was.Finally, I would like to briefly address an error the authors make. On page 109, they mistakenly mention cytosine instead of thymine. This would be a major blunder under normal circumstances, but it is absolutely trivial in the book. Why? Because the mistake is isolated: it affects only two sentences out of the entire book - no other sentence anywhere in the book is based on, or references, this oversight. While writing, an author's neurons apparently got crossed temporarily and wrote the wrong word: something the author obviously realized was wrong after the book went to press. This had to be an honest mistake - not a sign of ignorance. Again, it in no way detracts from the book's integrity."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"I have noticed that some biologists have a kind of arrogance about chemistry. &quot;I don't have to know the chemistry!&quot; To a certain extent, it's true that in some branches of biology you can have a very productive career without ever really knowing the chemical details that underlie the biology you're working on. However, a poor grasp of chemistry can also lead you to fall on your face in an embarrassing way, and that's what happens at one point (at least!) in &quot;Spark of Life.&quot;Authors who get the chemistry right in writing about the origin of life can extend previous theories in interesting ways. Christian de Duve, the Nobel Prize winner who wrote &quot;Vital Dust&quot; does exactly that, presenting the idea that protein-based life preceded an RNA takeover. The current enthusiasm for an RNA world as the original form of life on Earth is mostly being promulgated by people who don't really understand how nucleotides behave. As I said before, this includes a lot of biologists. Robert Shapiro's books (he gets it right, too) explain clearly how totally unlikely it is to have rich concentrations of RNA nucleotides lying around in puddles waiting to combine into nascent RNA polymers. On the other hand, this is a very likely thing to happen in cells that are using ATP and other triphosphates for energy storage. There they are, it's easy to polymerize them.Getting the chemistry right doesn't guarantee you'll get the theory right -- Michael Behe gets the chemistry right, as well. But getting the chemistry wrong can lead down the path of error. I think if Lynn Margulis really understood the difference between Diphytanyl ethers and fatty acid bilayers, she'd see that Archaea are wildly different from &quot;regular&quot; Eubacteria.OK, so this is a review of &quot;Spark of Life.&quot; What Wills and Bada did that made me lose all confidence in their knowledge of primordial soup is this. There are four &quot;bases&quot; used in RNA -- Uracil, =Cytosine=, Adenine, and Guanine. Any undergraduate taking Biochem or MolBio knows this. But Wills and Bada and their editors and readers apparently do not. Thus the statement on page 109:&quot;Another example is cytosine, an essential nucleobase of DNA. ... cytosine is unstable and decomposes quickly. It may not be a coincidence that RNA, which probably appeared before DNA, uses the more stable molecule uracil instead of cytosine.&quot;Now, this isn't a typo, or a &quot;word-o.&quot; There is nothing in the biochemistry of RNA that corresponds to the paragraph above. RNA uses both Uracil and Cytosine. Thymine is used in DNA rather than Uracil -- but the issue is not stability but information. Thymine has an extra methyl which allows it to be distinguished from the Uracil produced when Cytosine inevitably breaks down. So, I am supposed to learn about the primordial soup from people who can't remember what RNA is made of??There are other irritations as well. The use of &quot;Darwin&quot; to personify selective processes is juvenile, precious, and off-putting. An example from page 112-3:&quot;organic molecules ... awaited the firm hand of Darwin, who would decide which of them would 'live' or 'die'.&quot;I can't see who would enjoy this book. I read avidly about the origin of life but how can I believe Wills and Bada have any grip on this material given their chemical howler?? I am basically amazed at the positive reviews the book has received so far. I don't find it useful at all."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"Religions have had the previous privilege of holding factual their own details of creation, but as humankind has witnessed throughout history, science has continually answered questions to nature's capricious riddles (lighting was always thought to be a sign from the gods until rationale and logic explained fundamental laws with no vengeful motives). Science has recently been given enough information to begin to treat the origins of life as what I ironically consider, the Holy Grail.As an avid reader of books concerning the origins of life, a common thread for most of them is a biased account of the scientist's or writer's ideas. Although this is an acceptable format, it is a somewhat ingenuous approach considering the depth to the question asked. In Wills and Bada's 'The Spark of Life,' the journey into this question is taken from a strict factual account. Analogous to a court case, the majority of the book deals with the facts at hand. This is very good to know to any reader who wants to make up their own mind. The book also does an extremely good job in discussing the pieces of the puzzle that are missing. No scientist is going to deny the fact that there is a lot more that is unknown than known, but that is what makes this nascent field so interesting.Wills and Bada present fascinating details of past and present ideas, the people involved and their scientific travels. Some ideas reconfirmed, some thrown out and others still awaiting future research. Some of the old ideas may sound ridiculous to today's reader such as martian canals, moon creatures, to name a few, but the book does a great job in trying to put the reader in the minds of a society where no remote satellites existed, few facts were at hand and imaginations ran wild. The book also spends a lot of time discussing the recent ideas and brings forth the problems and solutions they provide. As an aside, no &quot;lunar bat-men&quot; were ever found, but Wills and Bada ease your mind by relaying that a dedicated woman's group from Massachusetts were very eager to contact them so they could be converted to Christianity.The book also delves into how today's scientific group is tackling the origins question. Some are involved with working from the bottom-up digging up what is known about the construction of DNA, RNA, proteins, etc. and the other group trying to work from the top-down, dissecting the genetic code in trying to find fundamental roots to the genetic tree. The interesting details of what is being uncovered is discussed and the book does a good job in trying not to make it unaccessible to the non-chemist but also provides excellent resources to anyone with some education in the field. Anyone who is interested in this field should begin with this book as the majority of others branch off from it.As a side note, I was very fortunate to have schooled with Dr. Jeffrey Bada at the Scripp's Institution of Oceanography and had the opportunity to do summer research in his laboratory. My high praise for this book comes, not only from the content, but also from knowing one of the men behind the book. Dr. Bada truly loves his work and it is refreshing to know that the research is coming from dedicated scientists such as him."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"This is a good popular book on the current hypotheses of how the first complex molecules may have combined to form the fundamental structures of early replicating systems.

Forbing"},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"In 260 pages of excellent science writing, Christopher Wills and Jeffrey Bada summarize many studies related to the origin of life and how evolution impacts us today. Big questions are treated clearly, such as \\"Where did life on earth come from?\\" A chapter is devoted to early concepts about the possibility of \\"Spontaneous Generation\\" and how early microscopists tried to determine whether or not there was spontaneous generation of life from nonliving matter. The Russian scientist Alekandr Oparin, and others, reasoned that simple chemicals could be combined, in a flask, and activated by an electrical spark to produce amino acids, necessary for the beginning of life. In some of his studies Oparin found fatty substances that aggregated as \\"coacervates\\" which were colloidal gels that somewhat resembled protoplasm of living cells. The idea of life originating from the \\"Primordial soup\\" took hold and the Darwinian evolution started the progression to more complex life forms. There is a chapter on the conditions of the earth at its beginning. For example, Australian rocks 3.5 billion years old were found to contain worm-like fossils. Up to date discussions include the formation of early nucleic acids and how they evolved into more complex forms necessary for life as we know it. Early life forms are discussed along with the possibility that similar life on other planets and galaxies might exist. The crystal clear and fun writing in this book takes us to the year 2000, and gets us ready for new adventures."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"Wills and Bada's book provides a good balance between scientific detail and readability, compared to most books on the origin of life. The answers presented for some of the main questions regarding the origin of life, such as where life first arose, are presented with some bias towards the authors' opinions. However, the authors usually mention other solutions currently being entertained by the scientific community, and provide their reasons for preferring a particular solution. In this way, Wills and Bada's book is less speculative and, in my opinion, more scientifically credible than some other books on the same topic that are too focused on one particular scenario for the origin of life, without citing alternative solutions or justifying their reasons for preferring a particular solution. Having read a good number of books on the origin of life, I would rate this book as one of the best for providing a solid introduction to the scientific search for the origin of life, particularly for those readers that are comfortable with technical terms that are about the level encountered in freshman year college science courses."},{"Title":"The Spark of Life: Darwin and the Primeval Soup","review":"The issue of life's origins has long been troubling to scientists and lay observers alike. When Charles Darwin wrote to Joseph Hooker that life likely formed in \\"some warm little pond\\" from elemental chemicals, he set in motion years of study by countless researchers. The question hinged on what was necessary to initiate \\"the spark of life\\". Wills and Bada recount much of the work done to explain that obscure beginning. For them, the pivotal event is the famous Miller-Urey experiment of the 1950s. First hailed as a, perhaps \\"the\\", major breakthrough, it was challenged and suffered from more updated information. The authors revive the original concept, enlarging it to restore its validity. The means they use to achieve this is two-pronged: an investigation of life from \\"the bottom up\\" matched by another from \\"the top down\\".Wills and Bada clearly wish to update the reading public in what has transpired in \\"origins of life\\" research since Stanley Miller zapped his own \\"little pond\\" in a sealed flask. They acknowledge the objections later researchers posed about Earth's early environment. They also confront the scenarios offered by Graham Cairns Smith and Gunter Wachtershauser. The former suggested organic compounds might \\"learn\\" replication from clay crystals, while the latter suggested the energy transfer methods associated with iron pyrites would support metabolic paths prior to the formation of cells. Wachtershauser's mechanism, they admit, works admirably in the environment of sea-floor vents, which were almost certainly present on the early Earth. Yet, attractive as both suggestions are, the authors find updated versions of the original Miller-Urey more convincing.The issue is, of course, Darwin's evolution by natural selection. How early in life's beginnings could \\"selection\\" begin its winnowing process? Building up molecules that will ultimately establish life-sustaining forms is unsatisfactory. In order to function, selection must have replication and variation in place. The replication means sustained patterns of one form, while variation suggests many types of forms allowing selection to take place in a stable environment. That, insist the authors, means something like a gene must have been established reasonably early in life. Since a gene's task is the production of proteins which accelerate the process, there must have been a feedback loop system in action. For some, this structure suggests an early form of RNA, leading to what they call \\"the RNA world\\". The authors contend that RNA, even in simple form, is still too complex and fragile a molecule to have survived Earth's harsh conditions. Instead, they propose what they deem a \\"Peptide Nucleic Acid\\" or \\"PNA\\". Not suffering RNA's delicate nature, PNA in various forms could find havens in tidal pools, tenaciously bound to rocks and forming oily films as protection against desiccating sunlight. Thus Darwin's \\"warm little pond\\" finds vindication 150 years later, buttressed by Miller and Urey's experiment and better understanding of biochemical processes.All this may sound like intimidating reading. It's far from that. The authors have gone to some effort to keep the language in this work clear and explicit. They build their case carefully, leaving the reader in no doubt of their intention and the significance of their points. They provide reasonably expressed counters to other proposals, carefully explaining the reasons for their own objections to earlier hypotheses. Beyond these considerations, they also discuss the possibilities of extra-terrestrial life, particularly that on Mars and satellites of the giant planets, Jupiter and Saturn. To enhance this discussion, a number of William Hartmann's paintings are included. They are lovely, but add little to the discussion. Other illustrative material is more cogent to the theme. One might also wish that the authors had found a synonym for \\"primeval soup\\". I lost count of the number of times it's used. The book is a worthwhile read, but isn't the final answer on the questions of life's origins.

Without warning, Venture returns, crash landing at the Space Center with only its catatonic Captain onboard, bringing with it the mystery of its whereabouts for the past 10 years. Where has it been? Where is the rest of its crew? Why is it still intact? And why the hell is it covered in skin?A story like this obviously hinges on a willing suspension of disbelief, something that itself hinges on the sincerity and believability of the characters, and it is there where Ellis shines, with Colleen Doran's emotive artwork and Dave Stewart's muted coloring bringing his exuberant story to vivid life. The primary characters - the Astronaut Corps veteran, the whiz-kid scientist, the depressed psychiatrist, and the traumatized Captain - are all one step removed from Armageddon clich&eacute;s, but it's a significant step, the difference being the obvious fondness Ellis has for the subject matter, a palpable sincerity that graces every single panel and accentuates the emotional crescendo of its uplifting conclusion."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Warren Ellis's story presents the reader with an intriguing mystery, while at the same time showing how the space shuttle Venture's return to Earth literally restores the lives of the three scientists tasked with explaining its decade-long absence.

This is a multi-layered tale that combines the best elements of its influences, creating a unified whole which is positive and uplifting.While a few extra pages wouldn't have gone amiss, the three leads are strong characters fully-realised by the narrative. We see something of their past, and we come to know their dreams. We like these people because they are not superhuman. They're normal, down-to-earth types whose heads just happen to be in the stars - just like us. The story is aimed at the dreamers who look up at the night sky in wonder; who shed a tear at the Challenger and Columbia disasters; and those who look at the face of the full moon and see themselves reflected...A graphic novel does not exist with words alone, and in Colleen Doran's art we find perhaps the book's greatest strength. Colleen uses a style which is largely experimental for her, full of stark contrasts, and while it is not totally successful it does suit the story extremely well. The story-telling is exceptional, and the characters are brought to life with graceful body language that is unique in every case. You can tell who the characters are just by the way they hold themselves within the panels (restless dreamer Terry Marx, introverted loner Anna Bracken), and that is a rarity in comics. We are treated to stunning full-page renditions of some of the wonders the Venture experienced on its travels, and the double-page spread of the shuttle's violent return to Earth is superb.A word of praise too must go to Dave Stewart's subtle colouring which really brings the world imagined by Warren and Colleen to life - a brighter palette would have destroyed the illusion. It is a perfect compliment to the muted watercolours of Colleen's painted cover: an image which conveys in a single illustration the full sweep of human endeavour in space.In his introduction Warren expresses his frustrations over the slow progress of mankind in space. ORBITER is his answer to those who would prefer that the exploration stop; who would cut funding; who would give machines tasks that ought to be done by people. We - mankind- have a restless thirst for knowledge, and a need to seek answers from what we see around us. Warren and Colleen believe that we will find the ultimate answers in space, and so that is where we must go.After reading this book, you'll know they're right."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"There are many who believe that the space program is just an unexciting shadow of its former glory with all missions merely reaching low orbit and a few remotes sent further. Ellis takes it a little further and has the whole manned program shut down completely.The time is the near future and the manned space program has been completely shut down since a shuttle just disappeared ten years earlier. But suddenly the shuttle returns to Kennedy.The return of the shuttle sets off a cavalcade of action as teams are quickly assembled to discover just what happened and what it means. One team is checking out the shuttle and how it is operating. One is checking out where it has been. The third team is looking into the one crew member to return; the pilot. This will not be easy as the shuttle seems to be covered in skin, the pilot is near catatonic, and there is evidence that it landed on Mars.This is a story of a world where the doors to space travel ravel and exploration have been closed. Now a new enthusiasm is sparked and the reader is taken on a wonderful ride of discovery as the teams delve into the possibilities. Ellis handles the techno-jargon (it's not babble) very well. The excitement the engineer feels as research progresses is almost tangible. He races through ideas an possibilities in a very believable manner. The other team's actions follow similarly-believable lines. In the end the reader is left with one simple thought: I want more!"},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"It's the near future, a decade after the end of manned U.S. Space Shuttle flights, which was the result of the disappearance of the shuttle VENTURE from its orbit. But now VENTURE is back, landing at Kennedy (and taking out a few score squatters in the process) with only John Cost, the pilot-commander, aboard. The quickly cobbled-together team of experts are driving themselves nuts trying to figure out where the shuttle has been, and how, and why. Ellis's story beautifully captures the excitement of weird physics and makes an emotional case for the continuation of manned space flight, and Doran's strightforward drawing style is a perfect match for the prose. The irony, of course, is that between the completion of the book and its publication, we lost COLUMBIA on its landing approach -- an event which especially chills the heart of every proponent of manned space exploration because the cry has again been raised for robots to take the place of humans in space. Ellis and Doran know we must never allow that to happen."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"I liked the way their personal lives are revealed as the entire story unfolded. There's enough weird and scientifically intriguing concepts to satisfy the sci-fi reader in me. But lest you mistake this book as purely Science Fiction, I'd say it's really about human hopes, dreams and the drive for self-discovery. How I felt about reading this: The story started off weird (in a nice Sci-Fi weird sort of way), there's suspense, then discovery, and finally a hint of something wondrous in the end."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Having read the specialty April 23rd release edition, I can say ORBITER was a joy!The fluid and informed writing worked hand in hand with the subtle and dramatic art to bring the story to enthralling life, by turns mysterious (where did that shuttle go, and for 10 years?), horrific (what happens when it does return, and the strange bio technology), and awe inspiring (finding out what happened in those 10 years, and oh that ending!).As the pages turned, it became ever clearer that this is a work of passion for these creators, that they loved the subject matter, and it shone through the interesting ensemble of characters as they peeled away the layers on enigma and faced the big ideas revealed. This is a dream of the future reclaimed. I strongly recommend ORBITER, especially to space enthusiasts and fans of mysteries and sense-of-wonder stories.My only complaint, like with all good stories, is it leaves you wanting more. I hope to see author Warren Ellis and artist Colleen Doran working together again and exploring even further into a speculative future!"},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Writer Warren Ellis is a space program true believer, a kid who grew up when America flew to the moon, and fervently wishes we'd go much, much farther. This is his love letter to manned space flight - a moody, detailed, futuristic fairy tale about the return of America's final space shuttle, the Venture, which vanished off the radar during a regular flight, never to return. This event essentially ended the space program and when the book begins, Kennedy Space Center has (improbably) devolved into an immense, squalid homeless camp -- the incoming prodigal shuttle squishes innumerable shabby inhabitants. Then the military takes over and assembles a Scooby Gang made of misfits left over from the old space program of a decade earlier, and one manic, anarchistic young propulsion expert.The mood of the story is evocative, but there are problems, largely due, I think, to its being caught in the confines of DC's Vertigo universe, which means there must be gratuitous, gosh-heck messing with our minds and nose-thumbing towards authority, etc, as well as a touch of graphic violence. Indeed, the one out-of-place plot point is that the lone astronaut who returns from the void inexplicably attacks and mutilates a soldier who enters the returned mystery ship, but then becomes entirely docile and sympathetic -- his violent behavior is never explained or addressed. Other than that, though, this is a captivating story, with some interesting dips into theoretical physics. The story rushes to a halt, though -- a little more finesse at the end would have been nice, but all in all this is a good read for those of us who are into the whole \\"boldly go where no one has gone before\\" mentality. Worth checking out!"},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Contrary to a few reviews here, Warren Ellis' Orbiter is a wonderful and powerful story that amazingly weaves both science fact and Ellis' typical mad ideas with his love of the wonder that is outer space. Taking place in a future that may be all too posible, the missing space shuttle Venture returns to what remains of the Kennedy Space Center after vanishing in space ten years earlier. All of the crew is missing, except for the captain of the ship who appears to have not aged a day, while the shuttle itself is covered in some kind of organic matter resembling skin. As the mystery of what happened to the crew and just where has the Venture been deepens, Ellis throws one idea after the other at the reader, and even though his characterizations of the characters featured in Orbiter aren't the best that the celebrated scribe has done, they are only part of his much grander scheme. The art by Colleen Doran with assists from Dave Stewart is incredibly cinematic, and some of the best to be seen in the comic business today. All in all, Warren Ellis' tribute to where we should be strikes pure gold, and although there will be plenty that may be disappointed with Orbiter, make no mistake that this is one of the smartest and most human tales in recent comic memory."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"This is a book about dreams, ideas and high concepts. Too bad it's not about story and characters.The premise is a great one, and along with the absolutly fantastic cover art it hooked me on the book instantly: 10 years after it vanished from orbit, the Space Shuttle Venture returns to Earth in a firey crash. All but 1 of the crew are missing, the ship is covered in strange material, and it shows signs of having landed on Mars.Done. I'm there.Except that's about it. The rest of the story is a gathering of scientists who all had their dreams crushed when the manned space program was cancelled after the disapperance of the shuttle 10 years prior. They interview the remaining crew member, disect the strange technology of the shuttle, and try to piece together where it was for the past 10 years.Most of the book plays out like a NASA CSI episode, with crew members finding strange readings, relating it to theoretical physics, and then finding some other strange reading.There are some early signs of conflict with the military, but the scientists just brush them aside when the plot requires it. Most of the second half is narrated exposition, explanining where the shuttle went & how, and then the book ends with a moment that is supposed to be inspiring, but plays out poorly as it felt rushed and inconsequential.The art is great when it is depicting decrepit buildings, outer space vistas and odd technology. Not so much with the people. The characters have expressions that are exaggerated almost to the point of cartoonish proportions. Dave Stewart's colors are really the star of the book, bringing a life to the art that is stunning in every scene.There are so many great ideas, and great moments in this book, I just wish it was better. But in the end it really plays out like a kind of \\"thinking out loud\\" about space exploration."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"The most interesting part of this graphic novel is interpreting Warren Ellis' motives in writing it. Orbiter is politically charged; Ellis wrote it in response to the 2003 Columbia disaster and the ending of the shuttle program, from which NASA has still not recovered.Orbiter raises many interesting questions about the cost of astronauts' physical and mental health and the space program in general. Are we meant to go to space? Are there other forms of life? Orbiter manages to spin space opera, politics, and an intriguing mystery all into one 100 something page book.It's rare to find good hard science fiction, especially in graphic novel form, and Warren Ellis has accomplished it here. He may have sacrificed a bit of character development, but the core story is all that matters if you ask me.For anyone interested, discussion questions for Orbiter are posted on my graphic novel book club blog, ALD Graphic Novels (found on Blogspot). Any comments/answers would be greatly appreciated."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"I have anticipated this book for a long time.It was worth the wait. It absorbed me as I devoured it in under an hour.If you've ever gazed at the night sky with longing... If you cried when Columbia exploded... If you've ever dreamed of what might be out there, then this book belongs on your shelf.Colleen Doran's artwork forms a gritty, \`waking up from history' world around Warren Ellis' well-researched, sharp-witted words. If you are a fan of either Doran or Ellis, \\"Orbiter\\" will not disappoint you.I'd say more, but I wouldn't want to spoil this story for anyone. You just have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"The best thing about Orbiter is Warren Ellis' impassioned forward. I have doubts about the space program, myself. I believe in pure science and exploration, but I can't help but wonder what we might be able to do with that money on the earth's surface, when so many people are so impoverished. Still, Ellis' arguments catch my imagination, and I hope we can afford both.The story itself... well, it's a lesser work. Hard-SF speculation about gravity drives and relativity isn't my cup of tea, though Doran and Stewart do an admirable job of infusing the panels with inspiration and momentum. I feel like the living-spaceship concept has been done too many times for the extended treatment of it here. There wasn't much of a plot or a resolution. As always, Ellis gives us some lovely moments and some great lines, but it didn't add up this time. Stunning cover."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"I always pass on DC's harcover graphic novels, because the softcover will never be far behind. While waiting for the SC of Warren Ellis and Colleen Doran's ORBITER, I head time after time how it was a wonderful and uplifting story that would bring a tear to your eye. I can't agree with that. ORBITER strikes me as nothing more than a gung-ho highly-theoretical technogeekfest on the level of Jurassic Park, Twister, or The Core. I wouldn't be surprised if this were optioned for a movie, as it fits the formula so well. And please, let's forget about how the release of this graphic novel coincided with the Columbia disaster and judge it for what it is.Due to the disappearance of the shuttle Venture 10 years ago, manned spaceflight is at a standstill. Then, Venture returns, heavily modified, showing signs of having undergone a space/time warp, and containing only the pilot. A team of experts is quickly assembled to find out what happened, and they are so cookie-cutter, it's amazing. The team consists of a typical fast-talking, tough-as-nails Colonel who goes for the bottom line and doesn't have time for all the scientific mumbo-jumbo; a brilliant young theroetical physicist (aren't they all) who is a goofball but with a can-do attitude; a former astronaut who dreams of a return to the stars (and who's going through a well-timed divorce in order to drive this point home); and a psychologist who does... not much, except serve as a mouthpiece for Ellis' main point.The technobabble is overwhelming (I'm not even sure if Ellis understands what he's writing about), and the ease with which the mystery is solved, and its casual acceptance by the team, leads to a happy blockbuster-movie conclusion that didn't do anything for me. In fact, I find it quite annoying that the team is able to solve so much of the mystery on its own, proceeding successfully along lines of tenuous logic. Warren Ellis is capable of exceptional work (Planetary, Global Freqency), but ORBITER reads like a formulaic screenplay for a Michael Crichton film."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"I'm sure I will get \\"this review didn't help me\\" comments but this tpb sucks. I usually like Warren Ellis but this book was so slow and boring and had no real punch. No aliens, nada. Thank God I got it cheap here. It was probably sold so cheap because it sucked. Anyway, don't waste your money on this. Totally slow & boring reading."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"&quot;But we cannot remain children&quot; Ellis concludes his atrocious foreword (Feb.2003) with the idea of space exploration as an &quot;adult&quot;, a &quot;grown up&quot; humanity feat. Doesn't it sound a bit too military? Please call in Spider J. to drop by and give Ellis his brain and his legendary clairvoyance back. W.E. writes that space manned exploration is something we should keep doing, not forget, not watch from a distance as tv kids. Ellis is so naive about what is real life crewed space exploration. Humanity goes to Antartica... What does it do? Does it *explore*? After the first space high (yes we are going up), please prepare the next gen planet for the human induced lung cancer."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Orbiter is beautiful to look at. Apart from that, it is both a homage to the space program, and the brave men and women who become astronauts, and a critiscim of the weakness, lack of vision, and cowardice of those currently running the place. Not to mention a big of anger directed at the same thing as well.A shuttle mission has gone missing, and returns in a very alien state, with a pilot that is very changed, insane, and perhaps now alien himself."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"The story captures the passion and some magic decently well. The dirty look of the artwork really lent it a unique feel. But there were quick cuts where key scenes were given short treatment, likely on purpose, which I felt let the story down. Some parts of the story makes no sense mostly the end bits. I kept thinking where is security?!The end scene finally tied it all together and made the story somewhat worth reading, but unfortunately there appears to be no sequel or series planned. This book explored so little of the characters where it seemed it was just the setup to a big series that would reveal all of the characters, but it appears to be standalone.I still liked it, but it could have benefited from a sequel."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"As always, Ellis spins a fair tale. Coupled with Doran's very capable artwork, this gets the Orbiter series off to a more than decent start. The premise resonates: ten years back, a space shuttle mission went wrong - the shuttle just vanished. No debris, no shuttle, nothing. Now it's back, with no explanation. The shuttle has changed, though, as has the sole survivor. Instead of explanations, we have even more questions, like what changed them? And into what? The last pages of this collection tantalize the reader with the prospect of finding out.The creators dedicated this book to the memory of the Columbia's crew, who died pursuing the grandest dream that humankind has dreamt. To tell the truth, that chokes me up a little. But, as I read this, the last shuttle is now on its last mission. The shuttle program has ended. That kind of chokes me up, too. As a comic, I find this well done but ordinary. As a tribute, though, it proves that the space program has touched many more people than ever were able to be a direct part of it.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"As a hard sci-fi reader (Benford, Forward, Clarke) I wanted to find a graphic novel on this line, or at least near this line. Well, I found Orbiter. This is definitely one of the best graphic novel (including all the genres) I've ever read. Its highly recommended for reader who likes sci-fi stories based on real, or at least, nearly real physics. This is a novel that takes your imagination to a fantastic tour of wonder."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"In a world where one too many shuttle expeditions to space have gone wrong, the only explorations into space are now made in unmanned shuttles while the astronauts and other humans are left on Earth. Then suddenly an old shuttle comes hurtling back into the atmosphere containing a sole survivor - a man who should have died years ago. Even stranger he's been to Mars, something his shuttle didn't have the capability of doing. Even stranger still it seems he's been beyond our galaxy... but how?&#34;Orbiter&#34; is probably my least favourite Warren Ellis book. I say this because it's the only book of his I haven't been able to finish, despite only being 100 pages long. First off the story isn't very clear. Humans now live in shanty towns but its unclear why. How is this level of poverty associated with space travel?Secondly, I didn't care about the story of the &#34;Orbiter&#34; returning. Maybe this is because I recently read a far superior Ellis space story &#34;Ocean&#34; but this one seemed quite dull. The &#34;mystery&#34; which I didn't find out about was probably some alien who attached himself to the shuttle and thus made it travel great distances far beyond a shuttle's capabilities.Thirdly, most of the story takes place in the drab, dirty area of a derelict Cape Canaveral. Not exactly visually appealing. This isn't a slight against Colleen Doran who does a decent illustrating job, but all of that grey and brown amid junk and debris doesn't exactly lift up the sub-par script.Fourthly, a lot of pseudo-scientific nonsense takes up the majority of the text. It's unreadable and uninteresting, especially when Ellis tries to attach some of his humour at the end of lots of exposition. It doesn't work.I can see why this book is out of print as it's far from the high standards I associate with the excellent books Warren Ellis has written previously. For Ellis or comic fans looking for a good sci-fi read I'd direct them to &#34;Ocean&#34; and &#34;Ministry of Space&#34;.

Neat idea, but I would have liked a bit more characterization."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Some spoilers in this review so tread lightly.The graphic novel opens on a scene depicting the Kennedy Space Center ten years after the space program ended in mysterious tragedy. The entire K.S.C. and the surrounding environs of Merritt island are a Favela-esq slum populated by extremely overweight people dressed in freakish clothing (including, I kid you not, a native american wearing a Davey Crockett jacket, moccasins, and headdress) and speak in an extremely crude, almost cockney speak. Within ten pages though the Venture arrives to kill as many of these people as possible in a holocaust of fire and crushing wheels.I will get back to this cheerful opener.The comic's forward is a very lengthy essay on how much Warren Ellis's life was shaped by the space program. He speaks at great length on how much of a apace nerd he is and the comic is crammed with loads of Orbiter jargon, launch procedure, orbital maneuvering descriptions, and theoretical physics. Yet for as much talk as Ellis throws down and how much he pays homage to the Columbia disaster and manned space flight it just doesn't add up. It's clear from reading this comic that neither Warren Ellis or Colleen Doran have ever been to the K.S.C.Back to the intro, it fails on many levels. First, the comic never explains why thousands of Wal-Mart hobos are living in a slum. Did the market collapse? Is this some kind of Mad Max future? Merritt Island is an isolated Air Force Base and one of the largest nature preserves In Florida. So I guess the world is so messed up that all of America is one giant slum where everyone defecates on each other and screams \\"arse! arse! arse!\\". Seriously, you could erase all of the people in the comic intro, superimpose all the street people in Transmet, and not notice the difference.Second, the Venture arrives in a fireball, landing on what I assume the two mile runway at Kennedy the shuttle uses. This landing incinerates everyone and crushes thousands in a bloody mess that cakes the Venture in blood. Oddly, you don't see the Wal-Mart hobos for the rest of the comic so I guess we know why they were there. They are merely fodder for a gratuitously violent scene where the reader can sit back and enjoy their deaths with detached, inhuman glee. What a great way to set the mood for an uplifting story of human spaceflight!Finally, by the end though we find out the magic improbability bias drive that powers the shuttle can effortlessly levitate the shuttle from the ground to high orbit. The shuttle can also easily land the same way, no friction, no radiation, as smooth as glass. So I guess the shuttle's pilot at the beginning of the comic hated the hobos too. Basically, the first 10 pages of the comic are worthless. It establishes nothing, it lays down no groundwork for the rest of the novel, and its just full of pointless vulgarity and violence. Given the hype put into this comic by other reviews this intro is as far from the spirit of the comic as if they just stapled 2-3 chapters of Preacher to the beginning of Orbiter.The rest of the comic just extends some of these meaningless themes. Every military person acts like a violent jerk to everyone, but are ignored completely by the plot when necessary, the psychiatrist has this non stop cheerleader face as she performs cutting edge techniques such as \\"Asking questions\\" and \\"Telling people to pretend they are somewhere else\\". The Black flight engineer has some kind of pseudo backstory with an ex-husband that takes the form of a 2-page phone conversation, then she is pretty much abandoned by the plot until the end. Then there is the annoying mad-scientist propulsion expert who is basically Jim Carrey. Seriously, he spends the whole comic standing in extreme posses and screaming about SCIENCE!!! I half-expected his final explanation about the alien engine to take the form of bending over and talking out of his ass.I dunno, I really enjoy Warren Ellis' previous works but this is just one terrible disappointment. I wish he spent more time on the ending. As far as the mystery goes, I am more intrigued into the reasons why the characters and world backstory is so stupid than the whole alien mystery. I don't think that is a good sign."},{"Title":"Orbiter","review":"Warren Ellis's Orbiter is a graphic novel that hopes to reignite America's imagination with the space program. Though it is an interesting premise and setup, the story is ultimately predictable and more boyhood fantasy than hard science fiction.Ten years after the Space Shuttle Venture vanished from orbit, the space program is dead and buried. But, when the Venture mysteriously reappears and comes in for a landing, there is a scramble to determine what happened to it and where it has been. A team is assembled of flawed experts, all with some connection or another with the failed space program and a stake in determining what has happened and what it means for mankind - they expect for the positive of course.With the orbiter returning covered in skin and the inside stuffed with living tissue, and evidence of the Venture having landed on Mars, and only one of its crew returning - near catatonic - the team constructs a myriad of scenarios to explain the unexplainable.

The disease is bad enough, but it has far-reaching effects on many parts of the body. Those who suffer with it are condemned to a very complicated way of life they'd never voluntarily choose. Friends, family and loved ones are affected by it too.Melanie Apel deftly guides the reader to an understanding of many facets of CF: biological, emotional, psychological and social. Her point of view as insider/outsider/guide is successful and she has both empathy and knowledge based on her experience and training. She's employed a good voice for the target audience, too--it's direct and doesn't sidestep issues, there are lots of real-life stories, and when she explains the science end of things she doesn't talk down to readers or become too overwhelmingly complicated.The last part of the book is necessarily sad--most with the disease eventually succumb to it, but the book ends on a hopeful and courageous note. If it had been around when I was a teenager, I would have wanted to read it. I'm glad it's around now that I'm an adult. I learned a lot."},{"Title":"Cystic Fibrosis: The Ultimate Teen Guide (It Happened to Me)","review":"Although the book goes under the heading of being a \\"The Ultimate Teen Guide,\\" for teenagers with cystic fibrosis, I think that is much to confining a categorization. This is a book that EVERYONE involved with cystic fibrosis should read. Children probably should not read it until their teen years, but parents should read it long before their child reaches the teen years. Doctors and nurses should read it in their student years. Extended family members - grandparents, aunts and uncles - should read it so they really learn what cystic fibrosis is all about. I think parents of children with cystic fibrosis sort of insulate their families from knowing what cystic fibrosis is really about and this book explains it in a vividly accurate but extremely readable manner. Parents of children with cystic fibrosis would do well to buy more than one copy, wrap them up and give them to the rest of their family. I wish we had something like this when we needed it instead of just a few pamphlets and folders."},{"Title":"Cystic Fibrosis: The Ultimate Teen Guide (It Happened to Me)","review":"Definately a book that family members should read.

At the beginning of each chapter there is some information about the flowers in the designs. The book includes many well-detailed projects,(for example: a clock,sampler,cushion,greeting cards,tablecloth,...). There is a photograph for each end result. One can also adapt the designs to use in one's own projects. The floral designs are beautifully simple and not time consuming to stitch, the colors are very life-like. The thread charts include DMC, Anchor and Madeira. Though the design charts are in black &amp; white they are real easy to follow. I hesitate a lot before I order a book with no review, but I'm glad I ordered this one."},{"Title":"Flowers in Cross Stitch (The cross stitch collection)","review":"With better charts I would have given this book 5 stars, but the charts for the larger designs are very small and not easy to read.

Even individual estates are placed on maps, when convenient.Seamlessly, from one map to another you can trace any route, find any name, and look into the neighboring area.The map by map directory provides further insight into the sources of information, variant ancient names and modern place names (if any),Obviously there's no such a thing as a telescope/microscope. You have to know what you are looking for, because details can sometimes shield the big picture. You need to know the original spelling of a name, or some variant. This book is invaluable when looking for names and places that are nowhere else printed in a map, at least a map that covers an area that places them in context.Now, what else could be useful?Basically, I would have liked three things:- an 'inverse' gazetteer or 'name dictionary'. Look for modern place names and find ancient equivalents.To look for a modern name is difficult. The book is not intended for this. You have to use the search engine in Acrobat, which means that you have to be using a computer. And scroll though the results. There is no straightforward way. So, a 'Modern Names Gazetteer' with ancient equivalents is something I'd like to have. Could a database fulfill this purpose? PDF formats do not allow data management, but the editor must have the data. Someone will provide this.- a different altitude color-coded scaleAs for the altitude color-coded tints, to my taste, there is at least a brown shade too many. The tinted scale is such, that some maps look a little brownish, because everything above 1000 feet has that background color. Of course, there are contour lines, but you have to look at them and read the numbers. Coding is not very useful in such a situation. Printed names over brown background are not easily readable.- a heavy paper o plastic loose-leaf with the Map KeyThe Map Key appears only on map 1, on the reverse side of the page, a good idea since the maps are not clogged with repetitive information and space is used for the essential purpose. But then you have to return to it for a reference. Thence, either it will wear out or hopefully you will remember usual references. Not for the casual reader. I've already photocopied it.Overall, an outstanding achievement.

I haven't been this excited about a reference book for several years."},{"Title":"Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World (with Map-by-Map Directory on CD-ROM)","review":"I bought this Atlas and cross checked its geography with common known things in the geography of Switzerland. Its geography is a mixture of modern and ancient items. The maps resemble nigher the ancient geography nor the modern one. E.g.:- The Sihl-lake is maped: But it is a modern dammed lake build in the 1930ies.- The W&auml;gitaler-lake is maped: But it is a moder dammed lake finished 1924.- The course of the river Linth is the going to the Walensee, thus showing its path after the Linth river control (1807-23).- The ~1550 with rubble of the Linth filled up lake of Tuggen is missing.- The Aare is shown before the correction of the Jura waters (1868-78) but:- The River Kander is shown in its modern path of 1714 after the correction of the Kander flowing into the lake of Thun.- The Lac de la Gruy&egrave;re is present while being dammed 1944-48.- The path of the roman road over the Kunkels bypass is missing.- The place CCAA (modern Cologne, Germany) is placed westwards of is real position.This are things that show that the authors of this atlas never took any look into a swiss map or secondary-level schoolbook.

A more useful attempt would be to include all the time periods a site was inhabited, starting with the Neolithic and ending in Byzantine times. This would not be too difficult to do for sites in Greece, but maybe it would be tough to do for other countries. It is okay to include just Classical sites, but include all the periods of occupation.It is not entirely clear what the purpose of this book is. It is already out-of-date.

They could very possibly win two or three National Championships in a row.USC's last two recruiting classes were ranked number one in America, and the 2004 crop is thought to be the best in history. Not since the 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers has a team entered the season with so many highlights. Therein lies the problem.USC is the hottest ticket in America's hottest town, the toast of Hollywood, the biggest thing in a media hothouse. They set the all-time USC attendance record in 2003 and will likely break that in 2004.Based upon history, one is increasingly impressed with USC. Five years ago, a Top 25 listing of the Greatest College Football Programs of All-Time would have shown USC to have slipped. However, in light of their National Championship last year and favored status to repeat this year, Troy is now back to its second place status, poised to assault Notre Dame for the top spot in the next 10 to 15 years.Long dynasties are hard to come by in college football, but SC has a long history of doing just that. It is for this reason, combined with the glow of being Notre Dame's biggest rival, its great inter-city tradition with UCLA, and a history that goes back farther than almost any program (Michigan and Notre Dame are the only schools that go back as far and are still powers) that Southern California is not just second all-time in football but first among all athletic programs (and first by a wide margin in baseball).The Greatest College Football Team in history is generally considered to be John McKay's 1972 Trojans. In addition, SC claims the best single-season team in the 1920s (1928) and '30s (1931). They are considered the best team of the decade of the 1930s, 1960s, 1970s, and now the 2000s.Further proof of SC's ability to maintain a tradition is their consistency. The top dynasty period in history was the John McKay/John Robinson era lasting from the early 1960s until the 1980s. The Howard Jones \\"Thundering Herd\\" teams of the 1920s and '30s also ranks highly. Among the best three-year periods ever, none is better than SC's run from 1972-74. Among 5/6-year periods, consider three of Troy's eras (1967-72, the best of anybody, followed by 1974-79 and 1928-32).The best 10/15-year period? USC from 1967 to 1979, but that is not all. Also ranked is the period 1962-72 and 1928-39. Among great long-term dynasties (20/25 years), nobody beats Southern California from 1962-81, when they won five National Championships and four Heisman Trophies. The Trojans easily have the most professionals, the most first round draft picks, the most Hall of Famers, the most Pro Bowlers and the most All-Americans. They are, undisputably, a football factory. The empirical evidence cannot be argued against.On top of all this, USC counts the most Major League baseball players, the most baseball Hall of Famers, the most All-Stars and various dominant players. Despite not being known for basketball, a disproportianate number of Trojans from the 1940s and '50s are considered hoops pioneers. The \\"triangle offense\\" was invented at SC, and such stalwarts as Bill Sharman, Alex Hannum and Tex Winter played together before induction in Springfield. USC also boasts the most Olympians, the most Olympic champions, and if they had been a country in 1976, they would have placed third in total medals at the Montreal Games."},{"Title":"The Rifle Book","review":"Guns nuts everywhere should own a copy of this book.

The story just pulls you in and keeps you wondering how will it end. \\"The Christ Trial\\" reads like one big stage production that you are unknowingly participating in. No, you won't find yourself on the witness stand answering questions about Jesus being the Son of God. But you'll definitely have to come up with a truthful answer to yourself about your own belief or disbelief in Christ.This little book found me as I was walking by a second hand store with books out front for $1.00. After a most entertaining and thought-provoking read I must say I got away with the steal of the year. The book is peopled with characters both biblical and modern, that bring so much of ourselves to the trial of Christ. The fact that Jesus is on trial and being charged with \\"Fraud\\" sets the stage for a riveting trial. If you come across the book, know that it was meant for you to read and re-evaluate your own belief system. Are you trying to live your life in a way that is in line with the teachings of your religion?This book can change you! I took away one star just because I was thrown off by a few characters in the story that didn't seem to move the plot along. But then again, maybe I'll discover they're purpose while thinking over the story. It was that deep and impressive.Excerpt from page 128:The clerk rose to face the prisoner. \\"Are you Jesus of Nazareth?\\"Father O'Connell inclined his head. \\"I am,\\" he said quietly.\\"You are charged with fraud - in that, being an ordinary man, you deliberately led others to believe you enjoyed some special relationship with Almighty God, specifically, that you were his only Son.\\" The clerk looked up at him. \\"How do you plead?

This book is largely a cookbook type of book although that is not the way in which it is presented.If you need to learn technology by slowly building on different commercial services and your own examples, this book could be your ticket. If you are enough of a beginner that passing an array in and then out of a web service requires two explanations (which is then built with an example on passing a structure and then calling a service from a service), this is your kind of book.Let's be frank. A web service is an interface to software, generally remote, that uses SOAP as its transport. This is an oversimplification, but an understanding of web services as interfaces would go much farther than a bunch of examples passing different data types or a plethora of examples of using commercial services (google, amazon, etc.).To be fair, there is some good introductory material of what goes on behind the scenes (XML intro, etc.), but it is completely overshadowed by the author's personal mental musings.

I would read it every time my parents took me to the library. A great children's book."},{"Title":"Human Paleobiology (Cambridge Studies in Biological and Evolutionary Anthropology)","review":"Human Paleobiology by Robert Eckhardt addresses the conundrum affecting the study of human evolution: as more data become available, the less clear becomes our understanding of mankind?s past. Dr. Eckhardt skillfully points out that this needn?t be the case if paleobiologists grasp certain fundamental concepts. These include, among others, an understanding of intra-population variability, the impact of small progressive changes on the overall rate of change in a character, and the difference between a population?s phenotypic profile and it?s genotypic structure. Eckhardt meticulously demonstrates how taking these factors into account makes the fossil record less puzzling, particularly as new data are obtained. One cannot help but be impressed by Eckhardt?s breadth and depth of knowledge.Although disdaining colorful theories, Eckhardt?s writing style is certainly not drab. Drawing on examples from areas as diverse as the stock market to the humor of James Thurber, Human Paleobiology makes for a particularly good read. Which is not to say that it is an easy read. Scientists like myself who are outside the field of evolutionary biology may find the sections on primates as well as the inventory of the fossil record a bit protracted. Additionally, the complexity of the material covered cries out for the inclusion of a glossary.Some readers may consider Eckhardt too contentious. Personally I enjoyed the author?s pugilistic precision in KO?ing fallacious nostrums. While Eckhardt doesn?t pull any punches his rational and equitable arguments are always blows above the belt. Personally I can?t wait until the nascent fields of genomics and bioinformatics start to generate copious amounts of information, requiring a second edition of Human Paleobiology. When that occurs no doubt Eckhardt will once again come out swinging.Human Paleobiology is indeed evolutionary (pun intended) in that it represents a progression from prosaic thinking to scientific inquiry in the study of Man?s past. Above all Eckhardt demands that one thinks rather than emotes."},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary","review":"I bought this book at a used bookstore. First of all, the quality of the book itself was surprising. I have a small library of Japanese books, and this is just what I have been looking for. It can be used as a dictionary, of course, but it can also be studied from too. It is very to the point without the need to second guess the book. By having example sentences with proper usage for each word, it presents the actual usage of the language as a by-product of explaining the actual words. This is what makes this book so special to me. And as far as the first reviewer's comment about not even having the word violence, he MUST be missing a page. To quote:violence n. the use of strong physical force, etc.1. hageshi-sa (adj(i)) stem of hageshii vehement + suf. sa (ness)extreme intensity of force or strength, either physical or emotional (vehemence, intensity, passion)example sentence2. bo[okoo - an action involving strong physical force intended to harm or injure (fig. rape), outrage, attack, assault)bo[oryoku - strong physical force used to arbitrarily carry out one's intentions (brute force)example sentenceI have never seen a book like this before.

The words you will need are in there, it also gives you examples how to use them, which is critical, because Japanese use the same words for many different things, and to know how to use it correstly can be difficult.

Although the vocabulary listed is quite simple, the definitions and usage examples are some of the most extensive I've seen.

If you're looking for sheer number of listed words though, try Kodansha's Furigana E-J/J-E dictionary...it's GREAT too! This dict. has an attractive presentation and overall a solid buy for beginners. Ganbatte yo!"},{"Title":"Kodansha's Basic English-Japanese Dictionary","review":"I think this is the only dictionary of its type available....It is an excellent resourse regarding for using words in context. It contains both Roman and Japanese script types and adequate examples for each entry. That is the way a really good foreign language dictionary presents data. In addition there are word lists pertaining to specific fields such as medical words (but very basic) and science. One of my favorite features about the book is the word list in Japanese at the back that will help you if you need to look up a word in Japanese and find a meaning. However, I am far from being satisfied with it. For me it falls short for the following reasons: (1) When you buy a dictionary you want something that will give you the words you need when you need them. If you buy this thinking you have all you need, then you're going to be in for a disappointment. It just doesn't contain enough regularly used words. I have gone to this dictionary so many times to look something up just to find that is is not included. For example, the word &quot;violence&quot; is not included. That is not a lollapalooza of a word, is it? But it's not there. I know you have to be selective when writing a &quot;basic&quot; dictionary, but it means that you need another dictionary with you as well if you are a serious student of the language in any way. Secondly, and this is tied in with the first point, considering that it doesn't contain a lot of words, the price (especially if you buy it in Japan) is rather steep. I think it is a bit like a &quot;toy&quot; dictionary. If Kodansha were to go all the way and produce a comprehensive dictionary in this style, then you would really have something!!!"},{"Title":"America's Longest War","review":"So far I rate this book 5 stars.

Nightmares and lack of creative energy have drawn him back in the hopes of getting closure to his loss. From a room at the local bed and breakfast, Russ hopes to write an opera based on Jules Verne's TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.As his heart heals, Russ finds love and friendship in the town of evening. His creative energies recaptured, he begins satisfying work on his opera, the echoes of the music in head matching the mystical elements created of sun, sea, and secrets. For soon he learns of the town's secret, an empire hidden under the hill that will change his world.Author David Herter combines contemporary fantasy with a literary form of story telling to pen a haunting, lyrical tale in EVENING'S EMPIRE. The echoes and subtle nuances drawn from literature and music result a surreal sense of the unexpected that subtly draws the reader into a tale as odd in the telling as in the content. Yet the rhythms and interweavings are almost magical in their allure, making it impossible to put the book down. At once riveting and bizarre, readers will find their imaginations taking flight with EVENING'S EMPIRE. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Evening's Empire","review":"If you have read the other reviews you already know that \\"Evening's Empire\\" has a disappointing end. There is a masterful slow, chilling buildup of tension, which in the last chapters is inexplicably diffused without a real closure or resolution.If it was any other book, it would have mattered more.This book is unique in that it evokes not only pictures, but sounds. The hero, Russel Kent, is a composer, a synesthete who perceives all sound as color. He is comissioned to write an opera based on Jules Verne's \\"2000 leagues under the sea\\"; he composes sketches of music haunted by dreams of death and memory. Kent's opera is born in front of our eyes out of the dark secrets of the sea and the fear that lives in small towns on the coast; it is born out of storms and tremors of the earth. It speaks of drowning, and of people who walk under the water, of strange cities abandoned yet active under the pressure of water and ground. It is the music dreams are made of, and nightmares. I know very little about musical theory; yet this book was for me a unique experience of music in greens, blues and greys.I found most of the fantasy elements in this book redundant, added as if an afterthought to the plot. The written musical pieces never come together as a complete oeuvre, and neither does the book. The opera project is put on hold. Only some of the score is written.In real life, I guess, we rarely hear about such abandoned projects, even if they are works of genius. Herter lets us listen to Kent's unfinished masterpiece. It may sound strange, but I hope that in Herter's imaginary world, the project is someday completed. I wish I could see this opera performed; I guess I'll console myself with Reimann's Lear."},{"Title":"Evening's Empire","review":"Needing closure by burying the specter of his wife who accidentally fell off the cliffs near Empire, Oregon, Russell Kent returns to the village with plans to compose an opera focusing on Jules Verne's Captain Nemo.

Russell finds a thirst to learn the undisclosed as he starts questioning anything and everything for everyday occurrences here in Empire seem slightly off center or eccentric.This is a strong fantasy suspense thriller that builds the tension to extremely high levels as readers accompany the hero with a need to know the truth. The story line is loaded with action and filled with an assortment of characters that manage to make the everyday appear eerie. However, the climax feels abrupt as a series of inexplicable disclosures with few or no real clues occur in a very short stretch as if a page limit barrier was hit. Still, David Herter displays his talent to keep the thrill at its acme and the need to know even higher in this powerful fantasy suspense tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Evening's Empire","review":"If you want to write a best-selling fantasy novel, you should probably nota) make the protagonist a modern classical composer struggling to write an opera based on 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.b) make the villains the owners and operators of a cheese factory.c) wait for over a hundred pages before introducing the first hint of supernatural phenomena.d) leave the fate of many of the secondary characters unresolved.This novel is encumbered by all of these obstacles. It starts very slowly, and concentrates on character more than your typical fantasy novel. Personally, I enjoyed it immensely. As for the ending, the ending of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea leaves the fate of several characters hanging, just like the ending to Evening's Empire. There is an important difference, in that in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea there is no possible way for our heroes to find out what happened next, whereas in Evening's Empire the presumption is that the characters will discover what happened in a few months. Somehow, this makes the ending much more unsatisfying. Unfortunately, Herter seemed to miss this distinction."},{"Title":"Evening's Empire","review":"Russell Kent had been commissioned to write an opera based on Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea. He traveled to the Oregon coast, a town called Evening. A year before, Russ had lost his wife, Anna, in Evening. She had fallen to her death from a cliff, a freak accident. In Evening Russ planned to face his past ghosts and create the opera. What he found was a chance at love anew by the owner of the local B&B;, Megan Sumner.The town of Evening had a secret. Something everyone kept quiet about and secretly worked on, unknown by the rest of the world. Quietly, the population of Evening hid a fantastic secret in a cavern beneath the town and only referred to as \\"downstairs\\". After many decades of work, and several deaths, the secret was about to be revealed!This story seemed to flow as smoothly as mellow music. A small bit of curiosities to begin with, followed by a constant undercurrent of tension. The story kept me guessing as to what the big secret was. Even as my imagination ran wild, I never came close to the truth. David Herter has masterfully created a novel that will keep its readers on the edge of their seats! Recommended!"},{"Title":"Evening's Empire","review":"I bought this book based on the wonderful reviews of Herter's first novel, Ceres Storm. That novel is described on the dust jacket of Evening's Empire as \\"a stripped-down thrill ride some 10,000 years in the future.\\" It's hard to believe this book could have been written by the author of a stripped-down thrill ride. The plot meanders slowly. The main characters don't reveal much of themselves. (Russell has lost his wife and does not know when to seek medical attention. He struck me as kinda dumb in that regard. Megan has also suffered a loss and does not know when to get out of town. She struck me as kinda dumb in that regard.) There is much uncertainty about what may really be happening, but not a lot of actual tension. The plot feels contrived. The \\"bad guys\\" seem a lot more like a PTA gone wrong than a dangerous cult.Finally, as a fan of Charles de Lint and a reader of Gene Wolfe, I think it is unfair to compare Evening's Empire to the generally high level of their work. Herter has not gotten there yet. Not recommended as a fantasy novel or as straight fiction."},{"Title":"A Taste Of Fire (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Antonie Ramirez is an orphaned white woman raised by a legendary mexican bandit, Juan Ramirez.

For one thing, how could a girl of nine, so quickly dismiss her family's death and turn to Juan as her new father? She was not a baby. She knew how to speak English, so why did she develop that thick Mexican accent?Royal was so wishy-washey that he almost made me sick.

The chapters are informative, yet to the point, opinionated, and, dare I say, actually funny! King gives bibliographic references to most case studies, in case you'd like to chase down the details behind a certain cultural resource management decision, but it is also the perfect, readable beginner's guide to the history and development of CRM law.The one critique I have is that it may be time to do an update of the book to reflect the ways that CRM law has changed since 1998. However, the fundamental concepts and laws are still the same, and the book remains the best on the subject.

To appease her grandmother and kill time, she looks into the issue in HiHo, Texas, where she meets various townsfolk and the beautiful district attorney, Janice Reed.Until Andi finds some surprising new evidence, Janice is unwilling to help with the investigation. In the meantime, the two relationship-wary women begin to feel a new pull toward each other. This new love begins to develop until Andi and Janice suddenly find themselves on opposite sides in the quest to prove a man's innocence.Like all of Jones' books, this one is well-written.

It should go without saying, then, that this work should be made available in an up-to-date and scholarly translation.Unfortunately, this is what Routledge has refused to do. Not only does this \\"new\\" edition maintain all of the known mistakes and inconsistencies of the original translation (most of which were not corrected when the translation was revised twenty years ago), but it also introduces literally dozens of type-setting errors. In addition to all of the obvious mistakes in punctuation and spelling (e.g., \\"intelfection\\" on p. xx; \\"in a world\\" instead of \\"in a word\\" on p. 129; \\"deralizes\\" for \\"derealizes\\" on p. 140; \\"writes\\" for \\"writers,\\" p. 163; \\"Rinswanger\\" for \\"Binswanger,\\" note 6, p. 185, and the list goes on and on), you will also encounter such lovely gems as \\"Bergson's inferiority\\" (instead of \\"interiority\\", p. 67) and \\"adduction\\" transformed into \\"abduction\\" -- when distinguishing between the two is precisely the point of Merleau-Ponty's discussion (p. 243). In short, an already flawed translation has now been bungled into a bloody mess. If you are reading this book for the first time, you would be well-advised to check the used bookstores for a copy of the earlier edition. If you are trying to use this text with students, lots of luck to you!It is also worth mentioning that Routledge has again failed to include a translation of Merleau-Ponty's original table of contents in this edition, so that many English readers are still unaware that he provided a detailed outline of the entire text to guide the reader. A translation by Daniel Guerriere is available in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 10, no. 1 (1979) - although, of course, the page numbers no longer correspond to this \\"new\\" edition."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"Well, not narrowly on the philosophy of mind; that'd be an analytic-biased description (and one that leaves out all the things such people may extraneous and annoying in this book).The field of philosophy of mind in Anglophone philosophy has all but ignored Merleau-Ponty's work, much to its disadvantage. Connectionism and dynamic systems theory as applied to the mental are seen as a \\"new\\" development, but the Gestalt psychologists and Merleau-Ponty had very much the same ideas long before. And a bunch of other ones, which to Anglophone ears may sound like they're from that other planet which lies across the Channel, but which deserve to be taken seriously.Warning: this book is HARD to read, all the more so because of cultural differences between analytic and continental philosophers. The translation is also not very good; if you can read French, go for the original. It helps to read other work ABOUT Merleau-Ponty; M.C. Dillon's \\"Merleau-Ponty's Ontology\\" is the best book I've found in this regard.Also, I think it's better to first read the following two things before tackling the book: (a) M-P's \\"The Primacy of Perception\\" (the lecture, collected in the book of the same name) for a shorter summary of his goals with the book; (b) the first chapter (and maybe the second, too) of his first book The Structure of Behavior, which discusses in great detail Merleau-Ponty's understanding of Gestalt Psychology (M-P actually refers the reader to this material repeatedly in the first few chapters of the Phenomenology of Perception)."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"This book can be part of an excellent upper-division course for undergraduates on the method of philosophical description called phenomenology. Particularly in Merleau-Ponty's description of the lived body and of our intersubjective relations there lies such inspiring attention to our own experience that both myself and my students are often left breathless. This book is both philosophy and poetry, and both aspects of this book are clear and well-researched.Contrary to the unfounded views of one reviewer, I would argue WITH Merleau-Ponty (who says as much in several key places, including his essay \\"The Philosopher and His Shadow\\") that Merleau-Ponty's work here is simply an extension of Edmund Husserl's work. Thus, the book fits in nicely after a discussion of some of Husserl's _Cartesian Meditations_ (found in Donn Welton's _Essential Husserl_). Students have also found Merleau-Ponty to be compatible with de Beauvoir and Sartre (both of whom he knew and wrote for and to), Heidegger, and Derrida.In my most recent course, I have used John Russon's compelling book _Human Experience_ first as a way to show some of the phenomenological themes in Merleau-Ponty's book before getting the students to hunker down and try to pull apart Husserl (who is quite difficult) and then Merleau-Ponty (who is a kind of reward for doing the rigorous discipline of reading Husserl). All in all, this is a book that will surely motivate some students towards graduate school work in Continental philosophy."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"While reading this book you get a sense of a man truly on the verge of profound truth. It's a difficult read (the section on time alone will make you wonder if the book is written in English) yet it's importance is still being discovered. More grounded in science than Sartre or Heidegger, MP's work is that of a supremely disciplined thinker, one who builds a case and sees it through a series of arguments supported by actual evidence. (although the evidence is from studies done 50 years ago, it's impressive how much his work still holds up in the face of current cognitive science research)I have two complaints with the book. One is the translation. While I'm sure MP is a difficult read in any language, the sentence structure is nearly incomprehensible at times. It's hard for me to believe that the best, most accurate translation would leave it so awkward. My second problem is the index. If you ever want to find anything in the book after you read it I suggest you dogear it because the index is a cruel joke."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"As someone with almost equally strong backgrounds in neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy I can only applaud M-P's wide-ranging curiosity and knowledge and his refusal to be limited by the artificial boundaries of academic disciplines. His discussion of the phenomenology of perception draws its data and conclusions from many areas--as long as they had something to offer in illuminating and analyzing this important area.In this regard, I am reminded of the great but insufficiently appreciated philosopher, Samuel Alexander, in his major work, Space, Time, and Deity. Alexander was similarly eclectic, and moved back and forth between deduction, induction, historical argument, and between science and philosophy, without any sense of discontinuity whatever. In other words, he was willing to use whatever worked.But getting back to M-P, this book stands alone in it's thoroughgoing approach to the phenomenology of perception and in its determination to ground such analysis in the ordinary data of everyday life--much as G.E. Moore attempted to ground his metaphysics in very ordinary, everyday facts. M-P is to be commended for a similar approach and his work is probably the greatest of all of these."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"\\"What is phenomenology? It may seem strange that this question has still to be asked half a century after the first works of Husserl\\" So says Merleau-Ponty in the opening pages of \`Phenomenology of Perception,' perhaps the major work of phenomenology after \`Being and Time.' Merleau-Ponty sought, rather brilliantly, to redirect attention to the human body as the locus of our being-in-the-world for phenomenological inquiry. Unfortunately, I am convinced that Merleau-Ponty's efforts to turn the results of his phenomenology into an ethics and a politics are less impressive and important than Heidegger's breathtakingly brilliant attempt to use phenomenology as a means to fundamental ontology. Still, one has to admire Merleau-Ponty's command over biology and the natural sciences. His descriptions of visual illusions and phantom limbs are by now established classics of the field. However, many of his examples are needlessly extensive and dense. Less committed readers should turn to the final chapters of the book, where the majority of his philosophy can be found.As a side note, Routledge has produced an edition here that is positively replete with typos. Surprising for such a reputable publisher. Most readers will find the carelessness on their behalf extremely irritating."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"This is an impossible book to review. The magnitude of what Merleau-Ponty takes on and accomplishes in this work is simply astounding. This is truly one of the most brilliant works of philosophy ever written.Phenomenology of Perception is first and foremost, as the title suggests, a detailed and extremely sophisticated phenomenological analysis of perception. This might seem like a highly technical topic which would only be of interest to specialists working within this very specific field. Nothing could be further from the truth. The implications of Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception extend to every single problem and field of philosophy.Though Merleau-Ponty is primarily interested in a phenomenology of perceptual experience one must never forget that for Merleau-Ponty perception is a part of the living dialectic of the organism (a conclusion Merleau-Ponty reached in The Structure of Behavior). A large part of the book is, therefore, taken up with a phenomenological account of the lived body. Merleau-Ponty critiques mechanistic physiology and classical psychology and attempts to provide a precise phenomenological description of the body's motility, spatiality, sexuality and speech. The lived body provides the foundation for Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological analses (in this work at least) of our relations with things and other selves. The lived body usurps the place that was held by the transcendental Ego in Edmund Husserl's phenomenology.The fact that Merleau-Ponty takes the lived body as the center of analysis, instead of a transcendental Ego, means that there is a positive place for science and scientific experiments in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the lived body and perception relies a great deal on case studies of various pathologies effecting motility, spatiality, body image, and perception. Merleau-Ponty cannot simply attempt, as Husserl does, to trace back our acts of consciousness to a self-evident cogito. The experience of patients who experience a phantom limb, for example, provides universal insights and illuminations relevant to the phenomenology of the lived body and perception which would be inaccessible (at least for most of us) if we were simply to engage in a Husserlian reduction on our own experience. The scientific study of these pathologies provides a positive ground for Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology while for Husserl they would have merely been a hindrance or an unnecessary detour. Merleau-Ponty finds clues to healthy or \\"normal\\" perception by studying pathological perception (just as Freud finds clues to the functioning of the healthy psyche through his examination of the pathological which would have remained otherwise inaccessible). Of all the phenomenologists Merleau-Ponty had the most thorough and sophisticated understanding of the sciences that were relevant to his chosen problem and it shows on every page of this work.So far my review has focused on the narrow, and more technical aspects of this work. Merleau-Ponty believes, however, that his existential phenomenology of the lived body provides a ground from which to attack the perennial problems of philosophy (problems relating to time, freedom, being, history, and truth to name just a few). Philosophy tends to work itself into insoluble difficulties by taking an objective, God's eye view of problems. We ask, for example, what is the nature of time? Or, are human beings free? And in our attempts to answer these questions we adopt an objective viewpoint which precludes their ever being solved. Objective thought leads to insoluble antinomies. Merleau-Ponty believes that these problems can be solved, or at least clarified, if we instead begin from the point of view of the lived body. Rather then asking: what is time? He will ask: how is time lived? Or: how does time appear to us? what are its various modalities? what is the temporality of the lived body? Rather then ask: are human beings, as part of the objective world, free? He will attempt to provide a phenomenological description of freedom (and in doing so he provides a brilliant critique of Sartre's notion of freedom). Merleau-Ponty also attempts to elucidate the genesis of \\"eternal truths\\" (or what have been taken as eternal truths. 'Eternal' being a modality of temporality for Merleau-Ponty) and in so doing he provides the possibility of elucidating the relation between logos and Being a problem that goes all the way back to Plato and his notion of the Forms and participation.In my opinion the most enduring aspect of Merleau-Ponty's work is his utter destruction of the ontology of res extensa and res cogitans which has its origins in Descartes. This project begins with The Structure of Behavior and culminates in The Visible and the Invisible but the Phenomenology of Perception is an important intermediate point between the two. Descartes has been a perennial punching back for Continental and post-modern philosophers, despite the giant debt that many of them (especially phenomenologists) owe to Descartes. Merleau-Ponty's critiques of Descartes are some of the most brilliant and substantive largely because Merleau-Ponty understood Descartes's philosophy with the depth of a true scholar. Descartes famously proclaimed that it was the soul that sees and not the eyes thereby replacing, in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, actual perception with the thought of perception. The Phenomenology of Perception provides a sustained and brilliant critique of Descartes on this point and in so doing transforms our understanding of the subject.I have provided merely the barest outline of a few of the themes of this work. Ultimately no summary could do this work justice. There is an enlightening insight on every page of this work which is rare for philosophy books (even really good ones). No one who is seriously interested in philosophy can afford to miss this work, although, I should point out that it would be ideal to have at least some familiarity with phenomenology, and the work of Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger in particular, before trying to read this work. This is not an easy book and without that background it would be close to impossible to understand.P.S. A number of reviewers have pointed to the existence of typos and other typographical errors in the text. There are quite a few typos in the text but there was never a time when any of them got in the way of understanding what was being said. So do not let a few typos stand in your way. It would be a shame to let such minor problems stand in the way of reading one of the most brilliant and important works of philosophy ever written!P.S.S. For anyone who is interested in helpful secondaries on Merleau-Ponty which will make the reading of this work more intelligible here is a list of the works I have found helpful. It is incomplete but should be a start:Merleau-Ponty's Philosophy (Studies in Continental Thought)by Lawrence Hass,Merleau-Ponty's Ontology, 2nd Editionby M.C. Dillon,Phenomenology Of Merleau Ponty: A Search For The Limits Of Consciousness (Series In Continental Thought)by Gary Madison,Merleau-Ponty's Philosophy of Nature (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)by Ted Toadvine, andThe Being of the Phenomenon: Merleau-Ponty's Ontology (Studies in Continental Thought)by Renaud Barbaras. All of these books are truly excellent and I have listed them (roughly) in order of difficulty. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"Merleau-Ponty's masterpiece is really an exquisite piece of writing. I know from an excellent source that there is a new translation coming soon. The French to English translation was done by a French professor, not a philosopher so some of M-P's subtle nuances are lost. Then again, so much is lost in translation anyway. Anyway you slice it, though, it is an excellent read and I recommend it full-heartedly."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"This book is a beautiful bridge for those who still adhere to the cartesian gap theory. seating the phenomenal experience of man in and through 'body'...Merleau-Ponty opens the narrow lens of 'mental' perception to include 'the human'. An important work for our evolutionary reach forward."},{"Title":"Phenomenology of Perception (Routledge Classics)","review":"This is a great work of philosophy that I highly recommend. However, do not by any means buy this Routledge edition. The pages of my copy began to fall out the first day I started reading it.

It's also an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"I have been quite disappointed with this book. I expected some more depth in getting across what it felt like, and was really like to live in America in the 17th century. Its ver superficial. Another very annoying aspect is that when the author quotes something to back up his points its just another modern writer.I would of expected sources from the timeframe of the history, not just another author's commentary. It comes across to me like something a college student could put together.I expected to read this book and have a real sense of what it would of been like.Its just not a very good book. I had never heard of Mr. Hawke and there was no \\"About the Author\\" page in my copy. So when I looked him up on the internet I was quite shocked that he is a professor emeritus. While reading the book I pictured a thirty year old amature historian as the author."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"Came just as described and worked out perfectly. Great save on cash and great seller."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"The only genuine problem with this excellent book is that it does not compare favorably with some of the other books in this series. For instance, if one turns to this after reading Schlereth's amazing VICTORIAN AMERICA, one is scaled down the book seems in comparison. This is not the fault of author David Hawke. The problem is the paucity of details in everyday life in 17th century America compared to the late 19th. Unfortunately for Hawke, the life of Americans in the 17th century was rudimentary and, of necessity, simple. What makes VICTORIAN AMERICA such a delight is the almost overwhelmingly amount of delicious detail.Nonetheless, life in 17th century colonial America is apt to be less familiar to most readers than that of late 19th century America, and this book performs an enormous service in providing a concise, well-written overview of what that life was like. Hawke is especially good at exploding various myths that have evolved over the years concerning colonial life. Unlike the later volumes in the series, Hawke deals, by dint of necessity, of the larger historical situation.Some of the topics that Hawke takes up include the structure of towns and villages, the nature of farms and the crops grown, houses and the types of objects found within them, the health of the settlers and treatment of illness, social stratification, indentured servitude and slavery, relations with Native Americans, and various superstitions. If the book was somewhat less exhilarating than some of the later books in the series, it nonetheless is quite informative. I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to learn more about the nuts and bolts of colonial life."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"This is a good book that I found suprisingly detailed with pertinant facts that gave me a better understanding of the culture, religion, family beliefs and social way of life in early Colonial America between 1500 to 1750 (before the Revolutionary War). The author does an excellent job in emphasizing the importance of the different Christian religious sects in the colonies and how importantly they influenced the personal and social structure in colonial life. Life on the farm, in the town or villiage is studied as well as the important tools, crafts, clothing that were used. Not only is the influence of England stated in this work but that of Holland and other European powers of the time mentioned as well. This is a great book to get to understand what society and indvidual lives were like prior to the American Revolution. Overall a very interesting read!"},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"One of my hobbies is recreating colonial life. I am a historical reenactor, and part of my passion for the hobby is recreating the lifestyle lived long ago as closely as possible. This book helped me immensely. I was able to understand how women especially passed their time and to pick up ways in which to create my character to her greatest potential. So many times while reading books about colonial Americans, women are virtually left out - I know they did something - but what was that something? This book helped me understand what their daily lives were all about."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"This book is a must for anyone who wants to achieve a greater understanding of day-to-day life in 17th century America with a few hours of enjoyable reading. Hawke largely avoids the in-depth treatment of weightier political, social, and religious issues that bog down most such histories, and instead focuses on giving the reader a palpable impression of what it was like simply to be alive. It's not all farm implements and spinning wheels, either. The author skillfully uses anecdotes to covey the impact of bigger issues like industry and economics, transportation, warfare, morals and manners, etc. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"I read this book during my sophomore year of college, and it has forever stayed in my memory as the most entertaining history book I've ever read. What's so wonderful is that its concern is the texture of everyday life (duh! :=), rather than dates and names. Truly interesting."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"This is a great book for the ordinary reader who would enjoy a chance to learn a bit more about the history of our country. With 176 pages of written text, it can't provide an extremely in- depth description of colonial life, but it does give an excellent overview of the 17th century in America with a surprising amount of detail. The writing style is engaging and not at all difficult, so the book is easy to finish off in a few days. I would recommend it!"},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"Not only is Hawke's book informative and concise, this book is \\"a good read.\\" Many books examining an early time in a place often turn out to read like lists (if they're short) or textbooks (if they're long). Great for the first-time student, a comfort read for the layman, and a great reference with many nuggets of information that could be new (or examined differently)for the scholar of Early Colonial America. A rare book that really does have something for everybody."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"I read this book after readingThe Reshaping of Everyday Life: 1790-1840 (Everyday Life in America)andHome Life in Colonial Days.

As Fernand Braudel, like Deetz, reminds us to comprehend it we must 'strip ourselves in imagination of all the surroundings of our own lives.' The journey backward, he adds 'is a journey to another planet, another human universe.\\"And this author really hits a home run showing how different life was and giving us a full understanding of the frame of mind of people then, and what was going on in history and around them and all that created them; a super dramaturgy of the times."},{"Title":"Everyday Life in Early America","review":"My husband and I have bought an 18th century home in New Hampshire that we will be restoring starting soon.

Now you don't give up much (if anything), and gain a lot in the process. If you're new to the laptop game, getting a copy of Anywhere Computing with Laptops - Making Mobile Easier by Harold Davis might help you exploit your new toy a bit more...Contents:Part 1 - Mobile Computing Quick Start: Understanding Intel Centrino Mobile Technology; Buying a Mobile Computer; Configuring Your Mobile ComputerPart 2 - Getting the Most From Your Mobile Computer: Software That Makes the Most of Mobile Computing; Taking Digital Pictures from Your Laptop; Using Your Mobile Computer As a Telephone; Let Your Laptop Entertain You - Streaming Media, Gaming, and MorePart 3 - Mobile Computing On The Road: Entering a World Without Wires; Finding Hotspots; Working with National Wi-Fi NetworksPart 4 - Your Own Wireless Network: Networking Without Wires; Buying a Wi-Fi Access Point or Router; Setting Up Your Access Point; Configuring Your Wi-Fi Network; Advanced Access Point Configuration; Adding Wi-Fi Antennas to Your NetworkPart 5 - Securing Your Computer and Network: Protecting Your Mobile Wi-Fi Computer; Securing Your Wi-Fi NetworkPart 6 - Appendixes: Wireless Standards; Where the Hotspots Are; Intel Centrino Mobile Technology Platform; Glossary; IndexGiven the right audience, this book is pretty good. It caters to the person who is a first-time laptop buyer (or owner) and doesn't quite understand the things necessary to start connecting to the internet sans cat-5 cable or modem. Davis does a good job showing how a laptop with Intel Centrino technology and Windows XP can connect to hotspots and allow you to access the 'net anywhere. Some of the material (like gaming, streaming media, internet telephony) isn't solely the domain of laptops, but it's worth covering to let the newbie know that everything they do on their desktop machine can also be done on their laptop.The only thing I found a little annoying after awhile was the constant reference to \\"Intel Centrino\\". He's making the assumption that you have Centrino technology, so information on wireless cards and such is pretty light. Since wi-fi is built-in with Centrino, there's not much need to cover wi-fi cards. From the perspective of focus, it's an OK decision to do so. But Centrino is pushed really hard, and I almost felt like the book should have been sent to me from Intel, not Que. The newbie might think that if it's not a Centrino processor, it's no good. In reality, it's all a matter of trade-offs. I just bought a new laptop, and I don't spend hours on the road or in planes. Therefore, battery life (a Centrino plus) isn't that important. CPU processor power is, so I got a Pentium 4 3.33 GHz. Reading this book, it'd almost appear that I made a mistake, when it's really just a matter of what's important to the user.So... if you're a new laptop user or owner who is using Windows XP and a Centrino processor, this book was written for you. If you've been around laptops for awhile, you'll probably already know most of the material..."},{"Title":"Science fiction oddities (Berkley medallion)","review":"The title of this anthology says it all. _Science Fiction Oddities_ (1966), edited by Groff Conklin consists of nineteen off-trail and mostly comical pieces. Eighteen of them were published in science fiction magazines between 1951 and 1964. One was originally published in the anthology.One story, \\"Callahan and the Wheelies,\\" was accompanied by a marvelous magazine cover by Ed Emshwiller. None of the other stories were cover stories. Sometimes the author of the story got his name on the cover. But not always. In the case of the Isaac Asimov tale, the _title_ of the story made the cover-- but not the name of the author.In short, most of these stories are not stories that _by themselves_ would sell an issue of a magazine. But they are pieces that are likely to stick in a reader's mind. At least somewhat: \\"Oh, yeah, remember the one about the Venusian Alice and the carrots?... Or the one about the accidental painting and the slippery moment?... Or the mad friend, the wives, and the Mexican calabash? Now, what were the _names_ of those doozies?\\"The stories are: Alan Arkin's \\"People Soup\\" (_Galaxy_, 1958), Isaac Asimov's \\"What is This Thing Called Love?\\" (as \\"Playboy and the Slime God,\\" _Amazing_, 1961), Stephen Barr's \\"Callahan and the Wheelies\\" (_Fantasy and Science Fiction_, 1960), R. Bretnor's \\"Mrs. Poppledore's Id\\" (_F&SF;_, 1952), Avram Davidson and Sidney Klein's \\"The Teeth of Despair\\" (_F&SF;_, 1961), H.F. Ellis's \\"Space-Crime Continuum\\" (_F&SF;_, 1954), Charles L. Harness's \\"The Chessplayers\\" (_F&SF;_, 1953), R.A. Lafferty's \\"What's the Name of That Town?\\" (_Galaxy_, 1964), Fritz Leiber's \\"Rump-Titty-Titty-Tum-TAH-Tee\\" (_F&SF;_, 1958), Robert Lory's \\"Rundown\\" (_If_, 1963), Edward Mackin's \\"The Trouble with H.A.R.R.I.\\" (_Authentic Science Fiction_, 1959), Gerard E. Neyroud's \\"The Terran-Venusian War of 1979\\" (_F&SF;_, 1959), Alan E. Nourse's \\"The Coffin Cure\\" (_Galaxy_, 1951), John Novotny's \\"On Camera\\" (_F&SF;_, 1956), John R. Pierce's \\"See No Evil\\" (_Science Fiction Oddities_, 1966), and Frederik Pohl's \\"Punch\\" (_Playboy_, 1961; _F&SF;_, 1963).Yes, the lead story is by Alan Arkin the actor. In fact, he made a short movie based on this tale starring his two sons. (One of them, Adam, went on to other things.) The original tale features a brother and sister and shows in a deadpan way the mad science that kids can conduct.The Barr, the Marks, and the Nourse also feature mad-- well, eccentric-- inventors whose creations get out of control. I particularly enjoyed \\"Callahan and the Wheelies,\\" which deserves more reprintings than it has recieved.The Edmondson tale does not feature a mad scientist, but it does feature a mad friend. Like the other stories in this series of tales, it weaves this way and that until a lot of loose ends that you never even noticed get pulled together into a snapper at the end.One of the best known stories in this anthology is the Leiber tale, a spoof on modern art, subliminal messages, advertising, and fads. It features a number of eccentric intellectuals-- but of a more humanistic bent. You may laugh. But be honest, now. Wouldn't you like to spend a lazy afternoon in Simon Grue's studio, listening to jazz, and thinking deep thoughts-- or perhaps none at all?The Asimov and the Bretnor are two comical treatments of love-- but very different in their orientations. One is biological, and one is psychoanalytical. In one, prudery saves the Earth. In the other, a psychiatrist meets his match in a formidable woman.The Nathan and the Neyroud appeared in the same issue of _F&SF;_ and are both about Venus. The Nathan is a play; the Neyroud is a mock history. Neither represents the scientific view of Venus today, but What the Hell. Both are fun.The Harness, the Lory (his first published story), the Mackin, and the Pohl are about some strange creatures and creations. I particularly liked the Harness (about a chess playing rat) and the Pohl, with its sardonic bite at the end.The Davidson/Klein, the Novotny, and the Pierce are satires on television or Hollywood. The Davidson/Klein is a touch on the grim side, while the Novotny and the Pierce are lighter pieces. I have read stories by authors like Christopher Anvil that used the same basic idea as Novotny's \\"On Camera\\". But none of the others were as funny.The Ellis is a veddy British spoof of science fictional detection. And the Lafferty... Well, the Lafferty is about some people and a machine who are looking for something. But they don't know what it is, and they don't even know if it is. But there might be a hole somewhere that is either too full or not quite full enough. It is Lafferty at his maddest and his funniest.In a brief introduction to the anthology, Conklin states that he intended to assemble a number of science fiction pieces that would entertain. I believe that he succeeded."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"Interlinear Scriptures are very useful tools to have when involved in meticulous Bible study. Alfred Marshall's interlinear is one of several available, and is of very high quality. Marshall uses the so-called &quot;Critical text.&quot; Other interlinears likewise use it, such as Paul McReynolds' and Brown/Comfort's. Interlinears that use the so-called &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; include Green's interlinear and George Berry's. An interlinear that uses the so-called &quot;Majority text&quot; is the Farstad/Hodges interlinear. Since none of these various texts can verifiably be labelled &quot;identical&quot; with the original autographa, all three textual versions represent the best texts offered by the various shades of textual criticism (textual criticism: the manner in which an original document, either no longer extant or not currently available, can be deduced via literary techniques from the information that is available). The three texts mentioned flow from different literary schools of thought, and all are of great value. The interlinear tranlsations of these Greek texts provide you with the best available literal english translations of the New Testament. A few nincompoops think that the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; IS identical to the inspired autographa, and hence they hate anyone not exclusively using it (see the one-star reviewer below as an example of such wit). Ignore those folks and their conspiracies. Marshall's translation is very reliable, his textual choice is as adequate as the other two available texts, and Marshall does a good job attempting to convey Greek verb tenses into English. I recommend it highly, as well as the others listed."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"This book is great if you want to learn New Testament Greek, or if you simply want to see the literal translation of the original texts and compare them with the NASB and NIV. You'll see how the NASB tends to be quite literal, and you'll also see why the original makers of the NIV had such a hard time trying to convey the meaning without sacrificing too much to make it into decent English. You'll also see things that you won't see in many English versions (such as &quot;agape&quot; versus &quot;phileo&quot; in John 21:15-17, and how the word &quot;the&quot; is used with proper nouns, unlike English). It explains idioms or indicates word order in addition to the literal translation if it's not clear.Even if you're merely interested in doing word studies and want to know the original Greek words used in certain Scriptures, this book is good. This book does not include a lexicon, so if there is another book out there that has the original text *and* some kind of lexicon in one, then you might consider that."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"Note that the NASB in this edition is not the NASB Update - i.e. the NASB 95. Rather it is the older NASB edition that contains &quot;thees&quot; and &quot;thous&quot;. Which is fine if that's what you want."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"Ignore the remarks by &quot;lharris&quot; below. His/her comments that Alfred Marshall is not a Greek scholar and that he is/was in cahoots with Zondervan to promote the NIV translation is ... nonsense. Marshall's interlinear was done in 1958, long before the NIV was in development. Read the preface/introduction.That said, this is a good choice in interlinears, as it gives you a formal equivalence (NASB) and a dynamic equivalence (NIV) translation to compare with the interlinear, to see how different translation approaches render the Greek text. Personally, I don't use an interlinear much, as I can read NT Greek, but I recommend this to those who want an interlinear."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"I bought this Interlinear because I like having the Greek Text along with the NASB (formal equivalence) and NIV (dynamic equivalence). My only complaint is that the font size is just too small for me to be able to read for any length of time. So, unless you have excellent eye-sight, I would go with another interlinear. But other than that one fault, this is an excellent interlinear in every way."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"This wonderful book incorporates my two favorite Bible translations, the NASB for its clear literal correspondence, and the NIV for its lucid dynamic equivalence, with easy to read and understand literal translations of the Greek text right under the texts translated (interlinear). It is remarkably easy to use, easy to read, and easy to understand. If it was a little smaller and had a nice leather cover, I'd probably carry it around with me all the time! A really great, invaluable resource for Bible study for anyone - and you don't have to learn the whole New Testament Greek language!"},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"I have heard from many sources that the NASB is the best translation of the original Greek, but have never studied Greek myself. This fascinating word-for-word translation is paired side-by-side with the NASB and the NIV for a very interesting study that can give new meaning to many familiar New Testament passages. Great for use in Bible studies, personal study, and classroom use, as well as following along with sermons and other messages.This would also be an excellent resource for anyone learning Greek, as each word has an individual English translation beneath it.I highly recommend this text."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"I've been using Marshall's NASB-NIV Greek interlinear NT for about two years now, and I've been fairly pleased with it. (Note: I am not a pastor, but rather a layperson serious about Bible study.)Pros: This is a helpful resource that goes beyond the absolutely stellar Zondervan NIV and NASB Exhaustive Concordances in that it doesn't just give you access to the root form of a verb, but rather the actual form as represented in the now slightly outdated Nestle-Aland 21st edition critical text. The verse numbers are easy to see, and the running interlinear literal translation is very useful. Using this has further solidified my adherence to the NASB95 over the NIV.Cons: There are a few downsides to this work. (1)There ought to be a new version with the updated N-A Gk NT. (2) The font size is quite small. (3) There is no attached lexicon or Greek concordance. (4) There is no parsing guide or designation of voice, tense, or mood.I'd recommend Brian McReynolds' Greek Word-study interlinear with the NRSV in the side column. It has larger print, an excellent concordance, and I believe it also has a dictionary. Spiros Zodhiates also makes a similar NT published by AMG, but it's based on the Textus Receptus and KJV, which isn't as accurate to the original manuscripts."},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"I've been waiting for a resource like this that compares the 2 translations I most often use!

It is important for the student and future worker in the field to understand where and what our Bible comes from. By exploring the Greek language that makes up our New Testament, what those words meant to the listener and reader then, and then what it means to us now, we in the field of study will find a true beautiful treasure! When we come to the Bible we come with only a little bit of knowledge toward the richness of God's eternal word in Scripture. From the study of Hebrew and how it is used in the Old Testament and then when we bridge this into the study of Greek and how it is used in the New Testament, we find such passion. The Greek has intricate points for us to understand, such as how beautiful, say, the unique use of literary and linguistic construction for the Gospel of John in comparison to, say, the same factors in studying the letters of Paul or the Letter to Hebrews. The only problem I would think of or could think of is that it would be a nice thing to have a commentary to bridge the meaning and workings of the Greek into practical understandings of how it is worked out in speaking to us via the NASB and the NIV. Still, I highly recommend this for any and every Seminary student. I know that I will use this Bible for a long time to come. And I hope that you do too!"},{"Title":"Interlinear NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English, The","review":"The layout is good. Seems a bit bulky for only the New Testament.

By relating the Greek words to their NASB and the NIV- my favorite translations- I find I am able to gain a clearer insight into the passages I study.The other reviewers may be accurate, but to me, their criticisms are not relevant.

I read though it three times before I became a Christian in the winter of 1986.Later, I purchased Alfred Marshall's NASB-NIV Parallel New Testament in Greek and English: with Interlinear Translation. It has the Greek text with word-for-word English translation in the middle column, the NASB in the left-hand column and the NIV on the right. The text is very small for all three translations and the Greek text, so only get this book if you have good vision.That said, this book enabled me to easily compare the NASB and the NIV with Marshall's word-for-word translation. Comparing the texts, the NIV was proving to be less than reliable while the NASB matched up with Marshall's translation rather nicely. So I switched to the NASB as my primary Bible.Later, I would become convinced that the Textus Receptus and more so the Majority Text was more reliable than the \\"Critical Text\\" used in Marshall's interlinear. So I switched to the NKJV for my primary Bible. Much later, I translated my ownAnalytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament: Third Edition(ALT) and now mainly use it.But still, for a study of the Critical Text, this volume is useful.

When Sarah Merritts' father dies, she travels to Deadwood, Dakota for two reasons, firstly to locate her sister Addie,who, she believes, is working as a domestic in a boarding house, and secondly, to set up a newspaper with her fathers' old printing press. She soon finds Addie who is working as a prostitute, a\\"soiled dove\\" as the local townspeople call them, and also falls foul of the local Marshall, Noah Campbell, who throws her in jail. The chemistry between Sarah and Noah is immediate but manifests itself as animosity for a few months until they sort out their feelings. Addies' old beau is summoned to town by Sarah, to whisk her away from her sordid occupation and, eventually, after a lot of misunderstandings and soul searching, harmony develops, along with the raw town which begins to become domesticated. It's not my usual genre of reading but was an enjoyable, light change and great fun, as I could visualise each scene with the appropriate actors from the 50's in the roles, and even hear Doris Days' voice singing \\"The Deadwood Stage\\"."},{"Title":"Forgiving","review":"&quot;Forgiving&quot; was certainly not my favorite book, but it was still an entertaining one.

Sarah is plain and unused to all of the attention, but eventually settles in and forms a friendship with the marshal of the town...the Big and Burly Noah Campbell.As time passes, their friendship turns into something more, but they face many obstacles on their road to happiness. &quot;Forgiving&quot; was a long book.

She defies the local law enforcement and is strong, independent, and defined. As a character, she is an individual...an actual person. But as time goes by and you are taken further and further into the romance between Sarah and Noah, something happens along the way and you lose any idea you ever had of what Sarah Meritt was. She's no longer an individual; she loses her definition. The same thing happens with Noah. As for the story of Addie/Eve, Sarah's prostitute sister, it starts off well, but declines until Addie becomes a domesticated little housewife and her prime goal in life is to make curtains. You'll find more excitement in the first two chapters of the book than you will in the last two-hundred pages.

The argument is thoroughly convincing and the discussions are illuminating again and again. The author demonstrates that the notion of \\"the primitive\\" in Freud and in later psychoanalytic discourse is pervasive, significant and disturbing. The corresponding others (unconscious, neurotic, racial, colonized, criminal, religious, and the feminine) haunt Freud's social/historical, metapsychological, and clinical works. For example, many of the characteristics that Freud attributed to the female other (passivity; submissiveness; narcissism; masochism; lack of intellectual, moral and rational development; excessive emotional ambivalence; and difficult or restricted sexuality-p. 107) were also seen to apply to the other \\"primitives.\\" In addition to discussions of Freud's works such as Totem and Taboo and Moses and Monotheism, there are important historical treatments of the language of the primitive in colonial, racial and anthropological discourses that impacted Freud as well as a variety of areas of European thought overall. Still, the author finds that the Freudian legacy is complex. He both made the primitive a universal feature of every person's psyche and reinforced European stereotypes about particular others. Certainly the need to renarrate Freud's insights is forcefully advanced.

Aswynn's approach to the runes is a well balanced blend of experience, intuition, and impeccable scholarship. She does much more than give divinatory meanings of the runes: She also describes their uses in practical magick and as keys to the Mysteries. One of the most intriguing aspects of this book is Aswynn's discussion of the intimate relationship between the runes and Northern Germanic mythology. Refreshingly, Aswynn also pays a good deal of attention to female archetypes in the runes and the mythology, and she does this on a basis of sound research and reasoning. Further highlights are her analysis of the Nine Worlds of Nordic mythology and her original rune layouts for divination.

The interesting thing about this novel is that it sticks with you after reading it. In case you don't know, it was turned into the film, Dead Ringers, which featured Jeremy Irons. Dead Ringers has an entirely different focus than the novel, for obvious reasons, but the film is as equally successful. Both the novel and the film should be checked-out by horror fans; both are unjustifiably forgotten and overlooked. I'm not sure if three or four stars is the right rating, but it's a good book, regardless; try to find it at your library or used book store, and read it. It's one of the better horror novels I've ever read, although a different type of horror is explored."},{"Title":"Twins","review":"Although it inspired the film by David Cronenberg, &quot;Twins&quot; is a much more graphic and intense work than its cinematic counterpart.

The book seeks to develop emotional truth rather than focus on factual evidence, therefore making it fictional. I would love to know how many people were interviewed who later rescinded consent... As a book which takes place in New York City of the sixties and seventies, it also makes the story of the twins an interesting counterpoint to the \\"life\\" of New York City of that era- a once promising spot gone to seed and desperation, reflected in many passages describing the danger of New York in that time. I actually had a better time reading the book than seeing the film \\"Dead Ringers\\"- not to knock that film, as a longtime Cronenberg fan, I appreciate it being Cronenbergized and wouldn't want it any other way. But the book makes me feel like a learned a little more about both the true story of what transpired and also a bit more about the psychology of the incident.

The world picture it paints is finely detailed and entirely believable; and taken together with Phineas Redux it comprises the most nuanced exercise in character development I've ever seen in English fiction.Trollope's London is thickly populated with memorable characters, but two women stand out in particular: Lady Laura Standish and Marie Max Goesler. Both are gifted, charming, and in love with the eponymous hero -- a handsome (but poor and socially inconsequential) Irish barrister who finds himself swept up into the world of parliamentary politics.Without giving away too much, Lady Laura becomes a kind of study thwarted passion. She is riveting; a sad, tragic figure but one the reader never stops caring about. Trollope considered her to be the best character in the novel, and one of his finest literary achievements. Phineas proposes marriage to Lady Laura, and she rejects him, pledging herself instead to a rich man she does not love. This rejection happens quite early in Phineas Finn, but it haunts the characters through both Phineas novels like original sin and propels the entire plot.About Madame Max I feel I can't safely say too much without spoiling everything, but she is, to my mind, utterly captivating and the actual best character in the books. The scene in which she seduces the Old Duke by allowing him to catch a glimpse of her perfectly turned ankle is the best written seduction scene I've ever had the pleasure to read anywhere. One doesn't usually think of Trollope as a steamy sort of writer, but this is certainly very very erotic stuff.Another reviewer states that many feel the conclusion of Phineas Finn to be rather weak. Perhaps. But Trollope says that Phineas Finn and Phineas Redux should be understood to comprise but a single narrative. I suspect that many readers who've had the patience to read through both novels will agree with me in stating that the conclusion to the latter novel is probably the most gratifying they have ever read, but it wouldn't be so had the first novel ended in any other way."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"At the heart of Trollope's Phineas Finn lies quite a unique (and perhaps presciently postmodern) notion of politics. However, to get at this theory, we readers must wade through the immense amount of exposition that typifies Trollope's writing. We must patiently and assiduously gather plot details from the frequent and plentiful parlor chat, table talk, and other various and sundry gossip that Trollope uses to advance what is an otherwise exceedingly meager plot. Nevertheless, such exposition, which moves at a pace roughly equivalent to that of continental drift, rewards the reader with quite a keen insight into mid-nineteenth century British politics and its relationship to the reality of human nature.Perhaps the easiest way to approach the political critique at the heart of this novel is by defining the operative assumptions underlying representative politics in general. In theory, representative government is intended to grant the citizenry a say in legislative process, albeit indirectly. A particular representative is supposed to vote on a piece of proposed legislation in such a way that reflects the greater concerns of his constituency. Prior to the events of Phineas Finn, British representative government is grappling with the issue of whom to extend the franchise based on the criteria of real wealth, property, region of origin, etc. One thus gets the sense that the presence of such exclusionary criteria betrays a rather Platonic distaste for general democracy on the part of the parliament ministers. Thus, in creating a system of barriers or gateways between the public at large and the legislative apparatus, the governing body reduces the potential for an anarchic clamor of myriad and wide-ranging interests on the part of the citizenry, which could potentially derail the legislative process altogether. As a result a properly civic-minded representative may always act for the good of his constituency by exercising his judgment, regardless of whether or not his vote conflicts with his constituents' desires. In other words, built into this system of government is the elitist conviction that the governed may be at times too unruly to exercise its franchise prudently. Therefore, by withholding the franchise from those deemed too ignorant to vote wisely (a determination based on various socioeconomic considerations), and by inserting elected officials between the enfranchised and the legislative apparatus itself, government achieves a normative regularity.However, with the implementation of such a system of governments also come opportunities to exploit and abuse the system. A certain aphorism-- which I attribute to Michel Foucault, though I am not entirely certain that it is indeed his-- comes to mind: \\"a system is defined by what escapes it.\\" In other words, because a system results from the desire to perpetuate the plane of consistency from which it emerges, the system must necessarily exclude that which is inconsistent with its purpose. Therefore, around any system arises a margin of excluded possibilities and potentialities; however, those dedicated to the system seek to refine it in such a way as to increase its power to envelop and re-absorb that which it had originally pushed to its margins. Thus any system exists in a state of perpetual refinement because it aims to absorb back into itself that which has escaped it into the margins.Into such a system steps the young and callow Phineas Finn, a man who is indeed marginal in that he is Irish and a commoner, and it is that position of marginality which the system seeks to incorporate into itself. However, one must understand that the system does not incorporate into itself those who dwell at its margins in order to empower them. Rather, it seeks to neutralize the threateningly unregulated marginality that individuals like Phineas Finn represent by bringing them into its regulatory, normalizing regime, and as we shall soon see, this is precisely what almost happens to Phineas.With the above in mind, one may ask if whether there is any real benefit to entering such a system, if it is indeed essentially neutralizing and normalizing. I answer provisionally that the system into which Phineas enters, i.e., British Parliament, conceals its regulatory, homogenizing and neutralizing essence beneath a seductive veneer of power and celebrity, and it is this veneer to which Phineas succumbs. That is, it seems that at first a government office offers one the ability to satisfy one's desires, because it is a forum policymaking that also generates a cult of celebrity, and I need not explain the advantages of being a celebrity. Therefore, although we may initially think Phineas one lucky devil, we soon discover that Phineas's various political adventures are characterized by the necessity of forsaking that which he desires. For example, Phineas must abandon his desire for Lady Laura Standish because he cannot satisfy Lady Laura's own political ambitions, and later his political indebtedness to Lord Brantford forces him to abandon of his desire for Violet Effingham, with whom Lord Chiltern is in love. In fact, Phineas soon discovers that posturing, longwinded orations and cloakroom alliances epitomize politics more than any deep desire to get things done.Mr. Kennedy, on the other hand, is quite a virtuous consummate politician, because he is devoted to carrying out every administrative detail that accompanies government office. In truth though, he is really nothing more than a particularly diligent paper pusher. But, however propitious his demeanor is to the endless administrative duties he must carry out, Trollope nevertheless portrays him as a dry, sober, and nearly humorless. Furthermore, Trollope also portrays Mr. Kennedy a sort of gentle but effective disciplinarian in his married life. Thus we may conclude that political success requires the abnegation, or at least the endless deferral, of one's true desires, and that the most successful politician is one who can most effectively subordinate his desire to the workings of government. Therefore, the system seduces Phineas and his peers with a promise of power that it never delivers, and furthermore the system steals one's position of resistance from him via assimilation into a normalizing regime.Thus we have arrived at the essence of Trollope's political critique: that the British system of representative government is not dedicated to progress, but to stasis. The government preserves and extends the influence of the status quo through a subtle and complex array of practices: e.g., needlessly repetition of proposed legislature, stupifyingly long-winded filibusters, etc. These practices thus result in a perpetual deferral of desire on the part of plebeian, politician and rising young man alike."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"A great novel, can't believe it's so old it came free on kindle.&#34; Free&#34; was not the best part, the story was.

Still, this is the third installment in the so-called Pallister series focusing on the political dimensions of his age, in contrast to the Barchester series which dealt with ecclesiastical issues. I love Trollope's style of writing, which seems effortless. He applies his dry wit and keen sense of observation to provide a free-flowing form of prose.Now about the novel... The title refers to the main protagonist, Phineas Finn, a young Irishman who arrives in London to make his way in the world. Torn between the security of possibly receiving regular income via the legal profession and his passion for politics, he opts for the latter. The plot develops from there, charting our hero's progress through the ranks of the British Parliament (yes, back then the Irish sent MPs to Westminster, which I didn't realize). The reader invariably gets a behind-the-scenes look at the political machinery of the day, and a vivid portrait of how a parliamentary system actually functions in practice. Some of the main issues at the time of Trollope's writing, namely the landmark Reform Act debate, are also intertwined with the story. Of course, as an American I had never heard of these issues before (nor the Tenant Rights debate, etc), but the issues of meaningful popular representation, voiced loudly by a Mr. Turnbull, and \\"justice for the little guy\\", championed by a Mr. Bunce, inevitably struck a deep chord.But don't be fooled into thinking this is for political junkies only. Far from it. Arguably, the novel is more focused on Phineas' (unsuccessful) romantic pursuits. I won't reveal details here, but this underlying thread is what fills our hero with such easily recognized humanity. His dreams and plans in the personal sphere are at the forefront as often as his political developments. Moreover, like all Trollope's works, you get a sense of the social conventions and peculiarities of the period. To take one example: You're reminded of how far women have come as you commiserate with even the strongest of female characters, like a certain Lady Laura (her personal mistakes adide, the laws were shockingly skewed against women's rights in general, and i the matrimonial realm in particular).

I wholeheartly recommend the entire series, as it will open an unknown world to the modern reader."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"I am about halfway through Phineas Finn, and I'm finding it slow going. Phineas Finn is a handsome, charming, young Irishman, son of a physician and educated to be a lawyer. The local pols select him to run as an MP on the Liberal ticket and he wins. To his father's annoyance, he sets off for London to fill his seat in the House of Commons, an unsalaried position. Unfortunately, the book contains none of the colorful detail about the inner workings of Parliament that Trollope summons to enliven the internal dynamics of the Church of England in the Barchester Chronicles. A significant reform bill is under debate, the substance of which has not yet been delineated, and, I suspect, will not be (at one point, the extension of suffrage to working people seems to be part of it, but this is not its principal intent). More memorable than the parliamentarians are some of the women characters, particularly Lady Laura Standish, an intelligent and complex young socialite, who hopes to influence the political process through her social connections (although she has no interest in the vote). Also intriguing are Lady Laura's friend, Violet Effingham; Lord Chiltern, her dissolute brother; and Robert Kennedy, her straitlaced husband."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Anthony Trollope, a personal favorite Victorian author, can be very hit or miss. This shouldn't come as a surprise--the author has written as many novels as Shakespeare wrote plays. One does though crack the spine of a new Trollope with a bit of trepidation. They are, after all, always a minimum 500 pages.Phineas Phinn, I am happy to say is very much a success. Trollope nicely balances the political and personal scenes, fictionalizing passage of 1867 Reform Bill among Britain's ruling class. Phinn grows from callow, wide-eyed youth to loyal dilettante to independent adult in nicely developed stages that travel from the House of Commons to the houses of England's ruling class. Along the way, Phineas's attachment to a number of woman (some might think an awfully large number) is considered.Here, and with the scenes of Parliament Trollope is at his very best. The character of Lady Laura--bright and intelligent but reduced in circumstances rings particularly true--as she navigates the limited options afforded to women of her class in 19th century society. The mysterious Madame Max and self-destructive in-fighting among Liberals is also well done and realistically portrayed.There are scenes and characters which seem redundant--this is not one of Trollope's works like He Knew He Was Right, or The Way We Live Now, that stands apart in his oeuvre. However, Phineas Finn is one of the author's better efforts and most definitely worth a leisurely read."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Anthony Trollope (1815-82)wrote two famous series during his long career of a novelist in which he wrote over 50 long Victorian novels. Phineas Finn is the second novel in the Palliser series of political novels. The other hefty three-decker novels in this series include: Can You Forgive Her?; The Eustace Diamonds; Phineas Redux; The Prime Minister and The Duke's Children.Phineas Finn is one of the best books in the series. It deals with the parliamentary career and loves of handsome Phineas Finn an Irishmen who becomes elected to the British parliament at the young age of 25. This is a good novel to learn how politics was played by skilled players in the Victorian age. Trollope wanted to be elected to parliament but was defeated in his one bid for office. His Palliser series is popular even today with politicians such as former British Prime Minister John Major.Some readers will find the political chapters boring. The best part of the book is the examination of Finn's romantic entanglements. There are four women characters of importance:1. Mary Flood Jones-The Irish lass smitten with the dashing and amiable Finn who waits for him during his five year tenure in the halls of Westminster. She is a virgin, lovely and a good friend of Phineas' sister Barbara. Mary comes across as naive and no match in the mental department for such erudite and worldy ladies as Laura Kennedy and Marie Goesler.2. Lady Laura Standish Kennedy-One of Trollope's most well drawn and complicated women. Laura loves Phineas but rejects him due to her family's need for money. She weds Frank Kennedy who is colder than an Artic cucumber and as stiff as a board. She later divorces Kennedy and flees to Dresden. Laura supports Finn in his political career carrying a torch for the Irish lad throughout the book's many pages.3. Violet Effingham is loved by Lord Chilton the brother of Laura Kennedy. Chilton is a man with a tawdry past of gambling, drinking and carousing. Violet is attracted to him as well as Phineas. The two men fight a duel over her love. Whom will she choose?4. Madame Max Goesler is an Austrian widow who is wealthy and wise. She counsels Phineas on his life and career while also being madly in love with him. Trollope loved his heroines and relishes the dark beauty of this Austrian lady.Who will Finn marry? What will be his fate in politics? Many of these questions are answered in this 700 tome while others are not resolved until Phineas Redux in which Finn returns from Ireland to resume his political career in London.Phineas Finn published in 1868 is worth rereading and will provide countless hours of entertainment and wisdom for diligently patient readers."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Anthony Trollope takes his time in developing his characters, oft times repeats himself, and moves the story along slowly. It is a typical victorian novel in tone and style that appeals to readers who can't get enough of Thomas Hardy-like novels. Although you can't put Trollope in the same company with Hardy, you still learn much in the societal ways of the era that each imparts with his own style.I enjoy novels that paint pictures and transport you to another era. I take my time reading them as I imagine the author took in writing them. As the Phinneas Finn story unfolds, you begin to understand the context of the times and how that has been passed on to present times. Each evening, as I read aloud to my wife and daughter, we find ourselves entertained as well as enriched."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"I notified the seller and he issued a credit.

It is not. It begins on page 335. I wouldn't trust anything from this publisher."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"PHINEAS FINN is a book of many virtues and one unfortunate flaw. The flaw lies in the ending, of which I can say nothing here without giving away a bit of the plot. Let me just say that the ending is a bit of a &quot;tack on.&quot; Trollope himself confessed in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY that he botched the ending, and explains that when he decided to write a second novel starring Phineas Finn, he awkwardly had to correct the mistakes he made in the ending of the previous book.The virtues of the book lie in part in its presentation of the social complexities of the British upper class in 1860s. While a political history of the period could explain the various ins and outs of the major pieces of legislation dealt with at the time, Trollope shows us how many individuals at the time actually felt about these issues from the inside. In this way, Trollope performs a service that no historian ever could. Virtually all the major political figures of the time, from Gladstone to Disraeli appear under thinly veiled aliases.But the true heart of the book is Trollope's great characters. I absolutely love Jane Austen. She is one of my two or three favorite writers. But sometimes I find the enormous propriety of her characters to be a tad tiring. In these way her characters, as magnificent as they otherwise might be, sometimes seem a little less than fully human. Trollope's characters, on the other hand, often fail to act with complete propriety. They do improper things, and feel improper emotions. Our hero falls in love with one woman, then another, feels attraction to another, and falls in love with yet another, and in general fails in his role as a great romantic hero. A woman marries someone she doesn't love, yet retains feelings for another, and suffers from the threat of a bad marriage. Another woman is attracted to two men, and must decide which. Two close friends love the same woman. I find all this emotional complexity to be extremely compelling.Trollope's most compelling and interesting characters are nearly all female. In the book, Lord Chiltern seems cardboardish and unbelievable, the title character likable but not terribly vivid. But whenever Lady Laura, or Madame Goesler, or Violet Effingham take the stage, the novel comes to life. This is not unique to this novel. In nearly all his books, Trollope's most compelling characters are female.If we could give half stars, I would give this one four and a half stars because of the weak ending. But I will stick with five rather than four, partly because the rest of the book easily makes up for the weakish ending, and one can view the excellent PHINEAS REDUX as the real ending of the novel. Either way, I heartily recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Recently, a personal tragedy resulted in a rare hiatus in my reading. In attempting to return to normal, I found the only author that suited (and soothed) me was Anthony Trollope. As an English major at Dartmouth, I never encountered his works, and none were on the required reading list; yet now, there are few writers who can \\"embed\\" me in their world so easily as Trollope.This is the second of the Palliser series of six novels, the first of which was CAN YOU FORGIVE HER? Although it is not a prerequisite to understanding PHINEAS FINN, I recommend that readers start at the beginning, so that they have some idea of British parliamentary politics in the mid 19th century and the characters of Plantagenet Palliser, his wife Lady Glencora and their circle.To begin with, there was at that time no monetary recompense for being a member of the House of Commons. The assumption was that: (1) the member was independently wealthy or (2) the member had a day job which paid his bills. This becomes an overriding issue in the novel.Enter Phineas Finn, an engaging Irishman, who gives up the practice of law to run for an Irish seat in the House -- much to the consternation of his friends and relatives who worry how he is to make ends meet. He joins in with a group of Liberal politicians centered around Lord Beresford and his beautiful daughter, Lady Laura Standish. No sooner does Phineas get up the courage to propose to her than he finds he has been beaten to the punch by a wealthy Scottish member, who happens to be a dour and rigid Presbyterian.Next he targets Violet Effingham, who has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lord Chiltern, the brother of Lady Laura. In targeting Violet, Phineas runs up against the choleric Chiltern, whose \\"red hair is no lie,\\" to quote one of my favorite lines in THE QUIET MAN. The two actually fight a duel across the Channel on a Belgian beach with no serious injory to either party. But Violet makes up her mind for Lord Chiltern, and Phineas is out in the cold again.As Phineas eventually makes it into the Treasury, which does carry some salary, he meets a beautiful wealthy Jewess named Mme Max Goesler, who has some feelings for him. Unfortunately, he had fallen under the tutelage of Mr. Monk, another Liberal politican who runs up against the prevailing political winds in the house. Not only does Phineas become a victim for his principles, but the Liberals are voted out; and Phineas is out of a job and flat broke.He returns to Ireland, marries an old childhood sweetheart, and gets a sinecure position in Cork as the Tories busily redraw the political map under Disraeli (called Daubeny in the novel).In addition to being a charmer -- though a bit feckless at times -- Phineas finds himself liked wherever he goes. Mind you, not enough to nab a beautiful, wealthy wife -- but there is a sequel to come called PHINEAS REDUX, which I am reading now, in which Phineas makes a comeback in his old haunts.As in all of my favorite Trollope novels, there are the obligatory fox hunting scenes, including one in which Phineas helps save Lord Chiltern, whose horse rolls over on him. He even saves the life of Mr Kennedy, Lady Laura's husband, by driving away some muggers. There is something sunny about the title character, and this quality shines throughout the novel.Anthony Trollope wrote some 47 novels: This one is one of the best, and will certainly make for an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"The chances are that \\"Phineas Finn\\" will not be the first or the second or even the third Trollope novel that you read. Several Barsetshire novels and \\"The Way We Live Now\\" are likely to get pride of place. This is probably fair enough. But that fact says more about the merits of the other books than of any defect in \\"Phineas Finn.\\" It isn't perfect, but it is a very satisfying novel, indeed - perhaps the best \\"political\\" novel since Disraeli's \\"Sybil,\\" It is \\"political,\\" that is, not in the sense that it tackles big issues, as \\"Sybil\\" does - \\"Phineas Finn\\" gives a once-over to voting rights, tenant rights and the Irish but it's all somewhat perfunctory. No: it is \\"political\\" in the sense that it is about the lives and fortunes of a public man, and of those who offer help or hindrance on the way.The core elements of the plot are fairly familiar: callow youth sets out to conquer the world and finds out that it's trickier than it looks. Impetuous young woman enters into marriage full of high hopes only to find out that she is stuck with a bad deal. But then, you don't read Shakespeare for plot. I wouldn't say that Trollope is Shakespeare. Still, it is impressive how much by way of character and situation both writes can milk out of a structure that is almost haphazard.Other commentators have also noted that the ending to \\"Phineas Finn\\" is weak, but I don't see that as a crippling vice: I'm hard put to think of a really good novel whose ending is not weak.One of the many notable facts about the cast of characters is its great range: we have the home folk in Ireland. We have a marvelous portrait of Finn's landlord, the law-copyist, and his employer, the successful barrister - in each case, along with their wives. We have a narrow-minded country squire and a feckless young playboy. And we have a sketch, brief and incomplete but still convincing, of the grandest peer in the realm.Aside from the sheer breadth of reach, the other thing to be said about the cast is the extraordinary range of interesting women. Phineas, devil that he may be, catches the fancy of at least one back home in Ireland and three more in London. Trollope is often good with women and here in particular he shows remarkable sympathy and comprehension of what they are up against. And not least of the three is, of course, the remarkable Madame Max Goesler, who is surely in contention for recognition as the most remarkable Trollope character at all-for a lady named Max with a touch of a moustache, she is a Victorian sexpot.It would be fun to read this in comparison with Henry Adams' \\"Democracy\\" another novel of politics in more or less the same period, though on another continent. Meantime, I'm clearing time to read the rest of Trollope's \\"political\\" novels, in the hope that he maintains the high standard that he has set here."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"I find it hard to explain my fondness for Trollope to my friends - one of them, an ex-English major, makes gagging sounds when I talk about my love for long, Victorian novels. I guess you have to have patience, and like long, drawn-out books that can take months to read (I do.) I didn't love Phineas Finn in the same way that I loved Barchester Towers - a book I wished never ended - but it's still enjoyable. One hallmark of Trollope's style is to make long digressions into the lives of characters - some of them not central to the book- but that is what makes him interesting to me. Phineas Finn is nominally about the rise to power and the fall from power in Parliament of a young Irishman. It also concerns his search for &quot;love&quot; (or at least a woman who will marry him), and it goes into the travails of several of the female characters. The one part that American readers may have difficulty with is the details of Parliament and how it works - I was very confused by it. But, all in all, I enjoyed the book. For me, reading Trollope is like looking into a very detailed snowglobe - there's a whole little world going on there that you can just sit back and watch. Trollope sometimes speaks directly to the &quot;dear Reader&quot;, which may put some off, but which I find charming. He also has a very subtle humor that shows up in his comments about certain of the characters."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Phineas Finn, the hero (if he can be called that), is a young Irishman who gets elected to Parliament at the age of 25 and enjoys a spectacular rise, although he lacks money, title, and social position. His assets are extreme good looks, sincerity, a modest but confident charm, and lots of luck.The most interesting parts of the plot deal with his relationships with 4 women: little Mary Flood Jones, his childhood sweetheart back in Ireland; Lady Laura Standish Kennedy, who takes a special interest in the new MP and helps to further his career; Violet Effingham, as rich as she is beautiful; and Mme. Marie Max Goesler, a very wealthy widow, beautiful, intelligent, and very interesting (my personal favorite). Phineas proposes to 3 of these women and receives a direct proposal from the other.The portions of the plot dealing with parliamentary business may be a bit mystifying to those who know little about the British governmental system or Victorian history, but this is a good place to add to your education. Some consider &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; to be the most tedious of the Palliser series; however, I found it fascinating throughout."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"Graham Greene writes in one of his novels of a troubled person who relaxes from work-related stress by reading Anthony Trollope on the weekends. Why? Nothing happens. The writing is peaceful, serene, and very proper.&quot;Phineas Finn&quot; is the second volume in the famous &quot;Palliser&quot; series, and it is a typical Anthony Trollope novel. Trollope's style is so refined and polished that one really doesn't mind reading a 700+ page book just to learn of the commonplace events that serve the purpose of plot and character development in his novels. This book will not give one any great insight into the human mind or soul, but it will entertain with its delightful description of Victorian manners and morals. As seems typical of many 19th century English novels the triumvirate of love, marriage, and money drives the main events of the story. The mating dance of love is primly and at times ironically portrayed as it plays out in drawing rooms, dinner parties, and visits to country estates. Phineas Finn, upon completing his education, is offered the opportunity to run for Parliament, and gets elected. Considerable space in the novel is dedicated to the nuts and bolts of 19th century British politics (a possible drawback for contemporary American readers). Members of the House of Commons serve their districts without compensation. Phineas, alas, is not wealthy. This lack of personal wealth is the catalyst for many of Phineas' subsequent actions. Phineas embarks on a search for love, a suitable wife, and financial means. He is drawn to several women. Mary Flood Jones, Lady Laura Standish, Violet Effingham, and Madame Marie Goesler at different times engage his romantic interest. The most interesting of these women is Marie Goesler, an independently minded widow of means. She is German, her late husband was Austrian, and many of the stuffy Victorian rules about a woman's proper place don't suit her personality. As this is only the second volume of the Palliser series, we will see more of Madame Goesler. She has already enchanted the Duke of Omnium, an elderly nobleman who is Plantagenet Palliser's uncle. Palliser and his wife, Lady Glencora, are the main characters of the series, but only play a minor role in this book.&quot;Phineas Finn&quot; has the delighful charm of a fine old painting or a piece of carefully preserved antique china. It's light weight, but entertaining. It charms with its grace. The pace is leisurely. Reading this novel is an escape in time to another world. A world apart from cell phones, cable TV, and all the rest of noisy modern life. One can quietly relax while dozing in the twilight of this peaceful book."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"All merits of the novel itself aside (and I did enjoy it very much), this edition seems to have been cobbled together either hastily or carelessly. It was full of errors in punctuation and spelling (including inconsistent spelling of characters' names) which I can hardly believe are the author's. It was a disappointment to me, especially given the fine tradition of the Everyman Library.Also, the notes on the text, as is unfortunately so common, give away major plot points. I would strongly advise anyone reading for pleasure rather than scholarship skip the notes, or read them only once you've finished the book.That said, Phineas Finn was a wonderful read. I began Trollope with Can You Forgive Her?, and while I did like it, I liked Phineas so much more. Unlike many male novelists of the period (especially those who were, as Trollope, embraced at the time), he demonstrates a sympathy for and understanding of the difficult choices presented to the women of his time, and does not shrink from presenting women who are intelligent, complex, and quite at home in the political world of London. Lady Laura Standish, Miss Violet Effingham, and Madame Max Goesler might each have been the heroines of their own novels--indeed, their complexities and the depths of their emotional and political lives throw Phineas's own lack of depth and complexity into relief. And by that I don't mean that Trollope nodded while writing his hero, but that he rather deftly endowed him with indifferent qualities as compared to the women his life.I wouldn't give away the ending of the novel, but I confess I was a little disappointed in Phineas's final choice. Trollope was, after all, a Victorian gentleman, and perhaps he must be forgiven for wrapping up his hero's adventures in what seemed to me rather a prosaic way. I have yet to read Phineas Redux, and perhaps that sequel may redeem Mr. Finn yet."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.

The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen..."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"This is possibly Trollope's most political novel (admittedly I have read only about 10% of his output). It deals with the mechanisms of British parliament in the 1860s: elections, rival parties, instable governments, cabinets, coalitions, whips, jockeying for places on the bench... And Reform!And yet, this is a surprisingly un-political world insofar as most processes are people-oriented, not issue-oriented. The parties fight bitter feuds over nearly nothing, their basic positions are nearly identical, their leaders and speakers attack each other in deeply personal ways, but they fraternize privately. (It is not so in the US, says Trollope. There the leaders of parties really mean what they say when they abuse each other.)Despite all the muddling through, and the lack of vision and material differences, some things did get done in the time: the Reform Bill, which is the key topic of the novel, did pass after all, enlarging the electorate. However the opposition might have passed just about the identical bill...It had a sub-item, or rather it didn't include the popularly demanded \`ballot', a rule which would have prescribed secret voting in parliament. This issue was hot enough to cause demonstrations and arrests. That's as heated as Trollopian politics have become in my reading experience. Dickens for sure was less shy about mixing with the masses.We follow the parliamentary career of a nave young MP from Ireland. Phineas Finn is one of the main characters of the Palliser novels, which follow British politics over the 1860s and 70s. Real life leaders seem to be recognizable under pseudonyms (like Gladstone or Disraeli), but most politicians are \`characters'.Finn has career aims as well as romantic ambitions. His problem is: he has no money. Also, he is honest, which reduces access routes. His strengths: looks, charm, a nice personality, an oratory gift... Finn is setting his sight on some unreachable amorous targets and has to admit defeat, but career wise, he succeeds better than expected. His mind is rather split about things. What comes easily can't be of much value. When he is at home in Ireland, he is quite a different person than among his mentors and foes in London. His career, which seemed on a safe trajectory, stalls when personal issues interfere with matters of political protection and alliance. He turns Irish again (to be resurrected from the Irish bogs in a later Palliser novel).A group of strong upper class women provide a background of suffragette talk. Despite all the grand talk though, the dominating subject of personal interest is \`who marries whom?' Upper class women marry reasonably. That's the ultimate situation; in the meantime, as one of the ladies says: danger and dangerous men are always more attractive than safety and safe men. In the end, reason generally dominates. Money makes the world go round, even among rich people. However happiness is not guaranteed. The danger loving lady settles for decency and money, and learns to regrets it.What makes Trollope worth reading today? He knew his world and his people. He was a sharp observer of vanities and ambitions. Though institutions and social mores have changed over these nearly 150 years, basic psychology has not. For me his books are amusing and informative. His politics are rather tame and his existential concerns are not given to high drama.His political world is oddly insular. References to places outside the UK are minimal. A young playboy had adventures in Paris, as it should be. The queen still asks her husband's teacher for advice, in Germany, years after Albert's death. A military supply scandal is investigated; it involves potted peas from Holstein. A populist leader is admiring whatever is done in the US (odd, in 1866?). Phineas becomes Undersecretary for the colonies and works on a Canadian railways project.Not much internationalism, is it? Civil War in America, power struggles in Central Europe between Prussia and Austria, an upcoming war between France and Prussia, the mutiny in India just 10 years past... These don't signify, as Trollope likes to express it.At least one of the smart young rich ladies knows: the real issue of the decade, and one that the politicians don't even talk about, is the need to furnish the navy with iron ships."},{"Title":"Phineas Finn: The Irish Member (The Palliser Novels, #2)(Library Edition)","review":"This is one of Trollope's more politically minded novels, but one that's no less enthralling for that focus. As others have noted, it revolves around the rapid ascendency of Phineas Finn, an Irish country doctor's son whose life is transformed when he wins a seat in Parliament. How Phineas deals with his sudden change in circumstances (or doesn't quite), and whether or not his moral fiber will begin to unravel accounts for the bulk of the story. Some wonderful new characters are introduced, including Madame Max Goesler, a charming widow of dubious provenance, and the Kennedys, a rather passionate, unbalanced couple with distinctly different opinions of our hero. It's all presented with tremendous style, humor and insight (this is Trollope, after all), and makes for delightful reading. Most importantly, it's a set-up for \\"Phineas Redux,\\" which is, in my opinion, one of the greatest literary entertainments ever produced. So, by all means, dig in. If you haven't read Trollope before, this is the perfect place to start; if you have, and enjoy his writing, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Rock Solid Kids: Giving Children A Biblical Foundation for Life","review":"This book is an excellent study exclaiming the need to give children a Biblical foundation.

What about a bother?Maybe you already work with kids but you find yourself preparing for your time with them getting shorter and shorter. This is a tell discussed in the book that even as a full time childrens pastor of 15+ years I found myself challenging to think through."},{"Title":"Rock Solid Kids: Giving Children A Biblical Foundation for Life","review":"This was an interesting book provided to me by my Minister to Children. It is written by a recognized authority on children's ministry and offers perspective and insight on the place and purpose of children's ministry in the local church.The author does a good job laying out the case for prioritizing children's ministry as ministry...not only as an open door for church growth or as a childcare service for parents. He articulates the primacy of parental/household instruction for children and the role of the church to augment that training, equip both parents and children, and complement the parents as primary instructors of children.The premises discussed by the author are somewhat counter-cultural in the church today. Rather than embracing the church as another \\"service provider,\\" the author points to the biblical mandate of the home as the primary discipleship environment for children. At the same time, he recognizes that many parents are or feel inadequate for the task and points to the responsibility of the \\"community/church\\" to provide equipping for parents and children alike. Discipling children and and discipling parents to disciple children are both necessary components of a local church's ministry.Beyond the philosophical groundwork provided...the final chapters contain some very practical instruction as it relates to the subject of evangelizing children. This seems CRITICAL to me...especially in our contemporary society where there is an elevation of a \\"value\\" of allowing children to make their own decisions about God. While every child MUST personally choose a relationship with Christ, this does not negate the responsibility or opportunity to present truth and equip a child to make an informed decision. To fail to do so...almost certainly sets a child up for great failure. It also displays an arrogance on the part of the witness in displaying a practical belief that the witness knows better than the commands of Scripture.If children are most open and receptive to biblical truth at a younger age, why is focus on child evangelism not a primary concern for the church?Theologically speaking, as a pastor, the premise of the book is sound and the goal of the author is righteous. While the author's prior experiences certainly influence his chosen methodology, the scope of the book is not focused on a particular \\"how\\" of ministry per se...but a \\"why.\\"Personally, I would recommend this book to pastors and church leaders seeking to understand the \\"what\\" and \\"why\\" of children's ministry. I would also recommend it as a \\"supplement\\" to parents who were seeking to become better stewards of the trust God has given them in instructing their children. I am \\"richer\\" for having read the book."},{"Title":"Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea","review":"Morgan's study focuses on important concepts within the history of Christianity in Colonial New England. What were the requirements for belonging to the church? And related to this, who could be baptized and receive the Lord's Supper? Morgan supplies the answers to these questions in a readable style. Further, for the most part, he reflects on these questions in terms of what the Puritans themselves believed. In short, this is a book that anyone interested in the history of Christianity in Colonial America, especially Calvinist-oriented Christianity, will want to read."},{"Title":"Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea","review":"Instead of trying to cover the totality of Puritan experience, the author focuses on a few crucial topics. What motivated the Puritans? What were they trying to accomplish? He illuminates the differences between the different branches of Puritanism: Separatists (the Pilgrims), who believed that each and every church should stand alone; Congregationalists (the majority of those who settled the rest of Massachusetts and formed the Massachusetts Bay Colony), who believed in a loose affiliation of churches, and Presbyterians, who wanted a rigid church hierarchy. He also illustrates how the beliefs and practices of each group evolved over time. If you want to really understand some of our most famous ancestors, this relatively slender volume is a must read."},{"Title":"Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea","review":"TITLE: Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan IdeaAnyone wishing to understand the founding Puritans of Massachusetts should not miss this classic."},{"Title":"Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea","review":"It was a present so dont know but it came on time. Its an old book so hard to find"},{"Title":"Visible Saints: The History of a Puritan Idea","review":"In just a few bold strokes, Morgan manages to outline how American Puritanism is embedded in English Puritanism and how, nonetheless, it also differs. Some readers may consider this difference as progress, others may not. But it is well, decades after this book first came out, to remember the embedding. Americans studying the Puritans (and the Pilgrims, for that matter) are far too prone to view the subsequent American Revolution as the magnetic pole organizing all phenomena. Morgan's book helps one see this is anachronistic."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"If the only Bach you know is &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;, forget what you think you think you know about the author. This book, Bach's first, is something entirely different. It's a classic in the tradition of great flight books like &quot;Fate is the Hunter&quot; and &quot;Night Flight&quot;Written when Bach was an Air National Guard pilot, &quot;Stranger to the Ground&quot; takes you along for what is in essence a very humdrum and ordinary flight as he ferries an F86 from Germany to England. It's fairly uneventful; he passes through a storm, but he's well equipped to handle it. He even claims that the F86 is so easy to fly, anyone could handle it in level flight.What makes it special is Bach's narration- how he conveys the wonder of it all, and finds the magic in the simple act of flying, and the excitement of those small moments, like finding the coast, sighting the airfield and landing the plane.If you're not one who finds wonder in the simple act of flight, you may wonder why anyone would read this book. But if you're the type who looks up whenever an aircraft passes overhead, or who always takes the window seat on an airliner, or you're a pilot yourself, this is one of the finest books ever written on what it means to fly."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"I first bought &quot;Stranger To The Ground&quot; at it's second printing during the early 1970s. I don't remember why -- Bach was not yet popular as the author of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; or &quot;There's No Such Place As Far Away.&quot; Maybe it was the cover illustration of the silver F-84F Thunderstreak Bach flew over Europe as part of the Air National Guard during the Berlin Crisis. I always was a sucker for a good looking airplane. Whatever it was, I soon realized this was no ordinary tale and that Bach was no ordinary writer. Years [and hundreds of books and authors] later, I feel the same. My copy of &quot;Stranger&quot; is worn and dog-eared [I've just purchased a new one here at Amazon.com]. I've read it to my kids and they've asked me to read it to them again. I've picked it up, time and time again, from the same shelf that holds his other marvelous books, and paged through it, captivated all over again. I sometimes wonder how many great pilots are flying, right now, solely because they read this book when they were still too young to drive. I'll bet they thank Richard Bach every time their gear lifts off the tarmac."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"This is one of the best &quot;anorack books&quot; ever written, a descriptive masterpiece of what its like to fly a fighter bomber alone on a cold night. Its obsessively detailed, and its the detail that gives the account its power.Richard Bach's much vaunted 'philosophy' is almost totally absent; instead we have the musings of a lonely, thoughtful, slightly anxious young man who may have to go to war in a few weeks. For its time (around the Cuban missile crisis?) its an astonishingly mature, liberal persective on his present and the future. Indeed, one wonders how well 2nd Lt Bach, a part-time Air Guard pilot, fitted into the professional military.By the 1970s much of Bach's work had become pretentious and shallow, the flying had been replaced by levitation and seagull parables. But as his first book, &quot;Stranger to the Ground&quot; is earnest, brave and painfully honest. If you like aircraft and flying, or like reading about them, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"In 1961 the world was about to go to war over a simple, but deadly game of nuclear bluff. The Russians were about to sign a seperate peace treaty with East Germany. So? Well, since the U.S., Brits, France and the Russians were all allies aftrer WWII, they could not unilaterally do that! In the new cold war era however, the Russians, trying to secure their idiological communist empire, perhaps as a buffer to any future invasions from the West, had taken their sector of Berlin...and East Germany, and made it their own...and to prove it they were going to sign a seperate peace without their allies. So, we called their bluff...and within 24 days of notification in the late summer of 1961, thousands of Guardsmen and allied military were activated and put muzzle to muzzle with the Russians and other Easter Block countries with a deadline of January 1, 1962 for the Russians to blink or unleash the dogs of war. Luckily for all of us, they blinked. I was with the 113th TFS from Indiana that flew the Atlantic in F-84Fs and opened Chambley Field in France. We flew the same skies, missions, and aircraft and lousey weather as Richard. We had mixed emotions about the opportunity to fly and test our aircraft for real, but apprehension about leaving our civilian jobs, homes and families to face an potential enemy that only a few years before had been our ally. We all worried through the cold winter night before the deadline, with a one way flight plan and realization that there would be no field left for us to return to if the baloon went up...and, perhaps no world as we knew it either. I think the world learned a lesson from that experience...more need to read about it...and we must never forget. Richard's detailed and flowing discription of the aircraft, arena, bases, missions, and joy of flight stimulating and nostalgic. Whenever I want to relive that little known and appreciated bookmark in history and the personal feeling of the experience, I reread Stranger...it is like an old friend...it also introduced me to a life of adventure, philosophy, mysticism and awe as a fan of this unique writer...he was, and still is an inspiration for my continuing journey of understanding of life, relationships, self examination and love of aviation. He is every-airman, but relates life better than any-man. Bravo Bach!"},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"Richard Bach's first book came to my attention when it was reviewed in the WALL STREET JOURNAL at first publication. I re-read it often. As a pilot with time in current fighters, I was stunned by the clarity and power of his depictions of flight. But one need not be a pilot to enjoy this work because it always remains 'grounded' (in the sense of structure and ideas, not literally).STRANGER got me for a core reason not often discussed with respect to flying; the book meets this criterion resoundingly: it is totally honest. Why does this matter? Because flying, especially complex modern airplanes (the F-84F is not an easy airplane), is fundamentally an honest trade. Make a mistake or be unlucky and you may die suddenly."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"This book is a very haunting allegory about Richard Bach's ordeal with his own mortality. Deals with facing death, the great unknown, and all the fears and anxieties that go along with topics we prefer not to think about.

I was such an accurate presentation of the world of high performance military flying that, in later years, as an Air Force Instructor Pilot, I gave each of my students a copy as they graduated and earned their wings. It is what Tom Wolfe's &quot;Right Stuff&quot; tries to be, but, since Wolfe has never actually been there, could never achieve. I now have a young friend just embarking on his flying career and I'm purchasing a copy for him. I've just re-read my highlighted, dog-eared copy and found it as fresh and vital as the first time I read it as a 2nd Lt.

It was written several years before \\"Jonathan\\" and is less mystical and more (dare I say it) grounded than Bach's later work. It is also one of the best \\"airplane books\\" ever written. I read the book in junior high school and it was a major factor in my joining the Air Force. I spent 25 years flying jet fighters and I like this book even more now than I did 45 years ago. The descriptions of flying and Air Force life ring true in a way few other \\"airplane books\\" manage. Bach also brings his unique insight to the subject, getting us to see things through new eyes. If you like airplanes, if you like Bach, if you like a good tale, if you like inspiring reading - read this book."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"This is &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; before Thomas Wolfe ever had the idea. Told through the eyes of a pilot flying an F-84 across Europe, the book is a gripping treatise on one man's love of flight. From detailed stories of dropping practice bombs on the range, to gripping tales of flying through thunderstorms, to the unique bond that develops between man and inanimate machine, Bach tells the story as only someone who has lived the life can. A timeless look inside the life of a fighter pilot, and an engaging look through the unique prism that Richard Bach brings to flying"},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"Only when you have flown a fast jet solo on a dark and treacherous night do you truly understand the wisdom of Bach's Strangers to the Ground. for you were forever changed.

Normally, I love details in books, but this was so obviously too much of a good thing. The details distracted me from the plot, making Stranger to the Ground not a joy to read, but a struggle. However, this book gave me a very clear view into the world of flying, and as detailed as the words were, they WERE well-written. For me, this book was boring, but I suppose anyone that has ever piloted a plane will find the author's words poetic and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"I read this book several times when I was a USAF pilot training student in the late 80's.

The atmosphere (no pun intended) is described extremely well. We are fortunate to have this book, written by a pilot who is also an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"This captivating work follows the 90 minute mission of a Cold War fighter pilot on a 90 minute night courier flight across Europe. The pilot shares his hand movements and eye/ear/nose observations in great detail. He explains how his machine works. He also shares the workings inside his mind during the solitude of this flight. His love for his aircraft, details about the machine and flying it, his thoughts about his job, world politics, the beauty of the night sky, and so on. A weather threat looms. He is having radio problems. Beautifully written.Bach has had near death episodes in flight. He shares masterfully. In fact, he will have one on this flight . . . at which time you will share the cockpit with him in heart pounding expectation.A great book about people, flight, and the beauty and solitude of the high sky."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"Bach brings a very philosophical and contemplating setting, as a lone pilot flies his (in today's terms) pretty old-fashioned fighter jet across Europe's poor weather at night. The flight is technically somewhat uneventful, but as you can almost join the author-pilot thoughts as they move & swirl, it becomes a very intimate flight. Bach really mastered the art of putting a train of thoughts into words."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"Among pilots, Stranger To The Ground is almost universally acclaimed as the author's best. Bach captures the lonely essence of flying complex aircraft in difficult weather. The author not only has the ability to capture the essence of flight but also to bring it to the page.Like Clancey's Hunt For Red October, this first book has a more polished and carefully nurtured feel. This is not to say that his later books are not wonderful, but rather that this is a classic.The book is a reminder of the early days of the Kennedy administration as the superpowers danced on the brink of nuclear war. In order to discourage any Russian thrust into Western Europe Kennedy dispatched additional Air Force fighter groups into some of the toughest flying condiditons in any part of the world that people care to fight over. By today's standards these were fast but primitive flying machines which achieved speed by burning fuel. When the fuel was gone there were no tankers so it was land or crash.The enduring appeal of this book is shown in the dwindling number of hardbacks on the market at increasing prices. I have read it three times over the years and found increased enjoyment from each.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"I'm undergoing training to be a fighter pilot and this is one book which I really felt great while reading. It was almost as if it's happening with me!"},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"The story was originally a cross country flight across the United States, but somehow it just didn't work. When Reserve Lt. Bach's Air Guard squadron was called up and sent to patrol the airways along the newly-constructed Berlin Wall, the story was rewritten in a bachelor officers' quarters in Chaumont, France. It was a breakthrough story of its time, far more honest a representation of jet fighter flying than you saw in the movies, where the pilots always had their visors up, so you could see the actor's eyes!"},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"As a line driver myself, Bach has perfectly summarized the life of a Reserve Air Guard pilot. It also summarizes the magic of flying, and it's beauty. It also tackles themes of life, flight, decisions, and philosophy excellently. Additionally, it shows just how dangerous that era of flight/Cold War was. The F-84 was truly a bad bird for both the air and ground crews. Only an exceptional, and lucky pilot could have survived this seemingly simple night courier mission. One of the classics of aviation writing. Should be required reading for anyone who considers a military aviation career."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"Experience a night flight with Richard Bach and share his thoughts and experiences.

True, this book is about flight and a man alone with his airplane on a night flight, but the story is really about relationships and trust. This is no macho book on fighter jets, but a man's reflection on many aspects of life as he flies through the night. He expresses amazing talent at bringing the plane to life, almost a living thing. As the flight progresses, the reader feels a part of the flight, a part of the pilot's life.As the pilot shares experiences and feelings, readers will identify with their own feelings and experiences. This book is not a one-read book, but an experience to be relived periodically. Truely, a marvelous writing. Although always quicksand to compare books, I see similarities with \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\", another book that is not about the title, but about deeper meanings."},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","review":"I really enjoy this book, that is why I bought it.

Noteven is an odd little mouse...different from his brothers and sisters. After being left alone by his family, Noteven decides that it is his fate to become caretaker of the house. Being that the house is not occupied by anyone, it's easy to maintain, although Noteven is a very particular mouse. Sometime around Christmas, a family arrives at the house and the quiet neat little house becomes loud and messy. Noteven continues to clean the house but it is a bit harder for him with the humans around. While Noteven wishes that the family would notice that he was there, he realizes that they are humans after all and probably not ready to admit that a mouse is taking care of their house. One night after his chores are done, Noteven returns to his hole and discovers that the sock he had been using for his bed was missing. Disappointed, he tries to get some sleep anyway. He can't sleep, however, because the family is making too much noise. Noteven decides to find out what all the noise is about and sneaks from his hole to the living room where the family is singing and laughing. As Noteven is counting the people and the stockings hung by the chimney, he discovers there is an extra stocking. Could it be his? If you can find this book I reccomend it highly. I bought this story when it was published in 1982 and my oldest child was 4. He is now 22 and my youngest is 14. We all still enjoy reading and hearing the story of Noteven. It's a Christmas Eve tradition in our home. Make this heart-warming story part of your holiday tradition."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Let me mention that I have read all books from this author. My valuable time does not allow for so many reviews so this one will have to do: All her books are highly repetitive. Within themselves as well as among each other. The story she tries to sell is rather short: aliens control the world by means of time travel. This information she channels from her future self. So far so good BUT she and/or her future self are awfull editors and even worse writers. And you stumble upon logical flaws in about each and every one of her assumptions. The book is full of them btw., nothing is even remotely proven but has to be believed. Please, dear aliens, if you exist travel into the past and erase these books, maybe by means of a time paradox I will get the mnoey I wasted back in my bank account. How can this book get so many positive reviews? easy: check the reviewers names against the authors fan club (easily visible in the discussion board she maintains). And how comes it has so few bad ones? Amazon deletes them - they did it with THREE of mine and numerous others I have seen here a year before. Why? That remains Amazon's secret - BUT if you want to know more about this google \\"amazon censors book reviews\\" and be surprised.-- added August 2008: BUT thanx to the WAYBACK MACHINE at archive.org I managed to retrieve my ORIGINAL REVIEW - you gonna love this one! (unless you belong to the mentally convoluted lot who make up the followers of this author)It took me quite some time to write and I am happy to have recovered it, here goes:-----------------------------------------------------------------May you live in interesting times - the old chinese curse is certainly true for all of us today. Many observations Mrs. Knight makes are somewhat true BUT -and this is the crux of the matter- as good as ALL deductions she makes from those observations are not just DEAD wrong, they indicate a psychological and medical condition I am not allowed to put in writing because Amazon staff would consider it name-calling.What would you call me if I tried to convice you that our motor-vehicles are alien controlled by means of advanced implants in the steering mechanism? Crazy? I guess I could make a case of it from observing the irrate behavior of todays traffic and the many accidents.However, if I make a case that aliens control every aspect of our life by means of time travel and are out to eat me (and you) or drink our blood or suck your fear energy like we would suck an energy drink - I'll have to ask: is that mental condition even covered by medicare? Mrs. Knight's husband, a university-level physicist, has never heard of Occam's razor (Occam's razor states that the explanation of any phenomenon should make as few assumptions as possible) or forgotten to apply it to his wifes mental proceedings.I am not kidding you, all this is from her books: She proposes that 4th dimensional aliens have controlled us by means of time travel since ages. They are 100.000 years technically ahead of us and have started the big wars and killed numerous politicians and other high ranking personel not doing their bidding. They have taken an average of 10% of dead soldiers from the battelfields, revived or cloned them and these serve now as slaves in huge underground facilities. They also abduct people on a regular basis.It seems there is a growing number of people who have forgotten how to use their higher brain functions. A frightening lot fall for this crap and discuss it in earnest at their signs-of-the-times website forum.As with all people who suffer from similar medical conditions (watch the good movie \\"a beautiful mind\\" for more info on that subject) proof to the opposite is simply ignored and if presented in a way so it can not be ignored will be deleted from perception (and as in my case also physically from their discussion board).But don't take my word for it - check it for yourself before you waste money on the books. Sign on to their board and e.g. ask: \\"Why would these aliens with time travel capability be able to kill the Kennedys but not the author who ostensibly gives all their dark secrets away, has a stable address, no secret service bodyguards and is probably even listed in the phone directory?\\"If her scanario where true the books would simply not exist.If you read her books you'll find numerous examples of deeply flawed logic - although it is logic she is always calling to the rescue (btw: no need to read more than 1 or 2 books - all are highly repetitious in content).In closing I cite one more example. There has been discovery of a substance named ORMUS in 1989 by one David Hudson. Mrs. Knight claims this substance is used to facilitate mind control over those who take it by means of flashing lights (strobes) mounted e.g. on police cars and ambulances. This substance is told to be highly dangerous (likened to arsenic) and the guy who found it is part of a government coverup and alien mind control etc. Now this is all good and fine EXCEPT it is proven fact (and this is not denied by her) that Hudson has been driven to bancrupcy by the government in trying to exploit his patents on ORMUS, suffered a heart attack and is not lecturing any more since then. At the same time ORMUS exists in abundance and could be harvested very cheaply. A 100.000 years advanced race should not have problems selling it like vitamin C to us. But only a very few even know about this substance and take it. And as the HAARP project (she says) will ALSO facilitate total mind control over us isnt that a bit of an overkill? And what makes this argument really bad is that according to Mrs. Knight in order to taste good to the bad guys you have to submit WILLINGLY to being lunch (free will and such). Wouldnt that mean mindcontrol spoils their food supplies? Not to mention that eating their revived 100.000 slave ex-soldiers should somewhat be easier to facilitate - or why not fly some of us off to a distant planet and open a human cattle ranch there?If you start digging into the discrepancies and horrendous and hideous contradictions in her books you dont have to be a physicist to see the bull. But it sells well. So living nicely in the french countryside with few job opening suited for an old american housewife isnt easy I guess. Under these circumstances it certainly has its advantages if you can be an author. She should have sold it as science fiction though."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Okay, I will admit that this book is well researched and raises some interesting points. However, reading it is like slogging your way through the muck. I had college physics books that were easier to read.

It makes her sound too much like a whacked out conspiracy theory nut case and, IMO, might stop people from reading further. I would strongly recommend that the reader skip that part."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I'll admit that I WOULD HAVE loved this book -- when I was 15. As an adult I am much more willing to work for the answers instead of throwing myself behind any ol good 'story'. However much Ms. Knight-Jadczk says she wants her readers to have an open mind... you can't tell from this book. Just when you think you have finally hit a good part that actually talks about something other than the author's \\"future self\\" conversations - she gives you one paragraph of something you can research and back to outer/inner/other space. The History of Laura's world is very interesting - to her - but not so much to me. I'll give it 2 stars because there are tidbits here and there that are interesting and useful, but there is nothing in here that is not available elsewhere. And you can find it without the pain of reading this book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"this book, and others by the author, are a fascinating study in self-delusional psychosis.

Her attempts at using scientific explanation are laughable at best. She poorly understands the concepts she is attempting to illustrate. They might appear on the up and up to your casual observer, but put them in front of any person who is well educated and they would laugh and point out strings of errors and inconsistencies. I know I did. She has no grasp of basic biology, chemistry, or even probability. She also bases her conclusions (wild hollow speculations) in the best science of ten years ago, some of which has been proven wrong. If you are a poorly educated conspiracy theorist who loves UFO's and interdimensional beings such as the Cassiopeans then this might be for you. If you are capable of rational deduction and analytical thought and have a grasp of modern scientific concepts, you will be sorely disappointed.Who are the Cassiopeans you ask? Apparently she contacted these interdimensioanl beings after a two year \\"study\\" into superluminal communication where they revealed this information to her. She says modern physics can provide no practical explanation of this type of communication, the one point in the book where she may be right. She needs to be looking into modern psychiatry. They could explain the majority of her writing. She claims to have studied psychology, chemistry, biology and history for decades, yet admits she has no degrees. Then she tell us that if you try to apply scientific thingking to her writing you will fail because you are blinded by it. So critical analysis and reason will never allow you to understand wht she has learned from the Cassiopeans? OK!The entire crux of her argument is that both science and religion have failed, so only by taking the best of these and creating her new type of super thinking can you understand the truth. Anyone who doesn't believe her is not on the right level. They need to practice her form of new age superluminal communication with the interdimensional beings to understand, or they are inferior thinkers. Sorry, but I'll stick with the most brilliant minds to have ever graced the planet instead of relying on this one woman to tell me what the Cassipoeans are saying.This woman is completely and totally insane. Don't believe the other UFO/Cassiopean cult member, conspiracy theorists on this review page who are trying to tell you that the CIA, space aliens and interdimensional beings are running an internet smear campaign against her.

This book is completely devoid of integrity (she talks to aliens but they seem to beat around the bush and try to be as vague as possible) and extremely repetitive. To be frank the book is total nonsense and I regret getting it. There are much better options out there to help you in your search for a more honest accurate version of history. But if you like people that tell grandiose lies and insult your intelligence then look no further. Like I said, watch her on YouTube before buying."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I bought this book without checking this person out first. What a mistake. As it turns out she is a known CULT leader and has much info out about her ideas not being founded on real facts. Her work is based on her infering that things are connected, not proving anything. Her ideas are manufactured silliness , not supported, and in many cases proved outright lies. Not history, not real, just imagined and hastily put together. Please just do your research before you make the mistake of buying this . There should be a warning somewhere !!!!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Mrs. Knight-Jadzyck, advertises her book as \\"a controversy that's been going on since the days of Cain and Abel\\", then she throws the bible out of the window as mostly myth. Her summation of Abram & Sarah's late-in life birth of Isaac and Isaac and Rebekah's late-in life birth of Jacob & Esau as basis for the same \\"myth\\". As a Bible reader and her mention of Cain and Abel's origin of conspiracy and me knowing that Cain and Abel are fraternal twins of Adam and Satan from the original sin of the Garden of Eden, I was highly disappointed. For your enlihgtened discovery that there were more labyrinth's around the ancient world I say \\"So?\\",it doesn't seem to drop much more than a trickle in the bucket of the grand scheme of history.The most worthless 700+ pages I've ever read, can I get my wasted time back?"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This could very well be one of the most important works of the century. Mrs. Knight-Jadczyk leaves no stone unturned in her search for the Truth behind our reality, our existence and our potential. Science and mysticism are joined in this extraordinary work, which uncovers the truth about our history and religions, unveiling in the process the path to the Great Work of alchemy, the true Holy Grail. This comprehensive encyclopedia of truth is a must read for all those with a taste for the objective."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Human culture it seems, has the amazing capacity to record unimaginably ancient technologies and science. This book answered for me the mystery concerning the persisting existence of myth, and may have touched upon its lost importance to Humanity. These pages may have revealed for the first time in this format, elements of a secret knowledge desperately needed by Mankind today. Important knowledge preserved in archetypal imagery and stories, which after millennia may have been finally decoded."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Laura Knight-Jadczyk put an enormous effort to bring this well researched and soul saving information to the rest of us. I never regret the decision to buy this book because I find it priceless after reading every piece of it. It reveals who pulls the strings of our reality and how it is being accomplished through our history and for what purposes. Facts that are presented are often too hard to accept for certain weak-minded people because it hurts to know that you are living in lie and they find it easier to go back to sleep. For every other seeker who wants to KNOW and UNDERSTAND how and why this is vital."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This is not your average esoteric book, reading this one is a journey and a process for your consciousness. There is so much information and food for thought that for every re-read you find something new. The careful reader will notice different layers of information, not everything is spelled out. Because, as I see it, one of the main ideas of the author is to kick start your own thinking and deduction process and slowly \\"heat the crucible\\" . I've read it twice and I intend to read it again. Who knows what I'll find this time. This is not an easy read, but dealing with the biggest questions of life isn't an easy task and there are no short cuts if you want to get to the bottom of things. Can't recommend this one enough!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"The Secret History of The World is an extensive book, 1000 pages of a breathtaking writing that covers several millennium of History.Numerous topics are thoroughly investigated : genetics, alchemy, linguistics, History (of course), myths and symbolism, lost civilizations, UFOs, astronomy...Despite the variety of the addressed topics, Laura Knight-Jadczyk connects the dots with a rare perspicacity and brings together convergent perspectives to finally deliver an extremely consistent and convincing History of Humanity.In conclusion this books brings together essential topics that are usually dealt apart while the numerous references help the reader to check the consistency of the proposed ideas and broaden his own knowledge base.The Secret History of the World is a big book, its level of objectivity might make you feel uncomfortable in your previous paradigms, and the depth of the overall analysis is just breathtaking. It is a unique book that will definitely and fundamentally change the way you see the world.I can only highly recommend The Secret History of the World to any reader who genuinely wants to know and understand our true History (beyond revisions, dogmas, taboos, prejudices and disinformation).I give 5 stars to this book without one single hesitation."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Secret History of the World by Laura Knight-Jadczyk, should be used as a text book in our schools.

At last, I could make sense of our hidden and mysterious past and disheartening present. Knight-Jadczyk deftly weaves the fascinating threads of subjects either too hot to handle or too deep for others to dissect and delivers an epic work of amazing research and insight. If you are too inculcated in your precious beliefs, this book is not for you. However, if you are a seeker of truth and knowledge, you will have found an unbelievable and satisfying work."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"One of the most enjoyable aspects of reading The Secret History is the sheer pleasure of reading as the author connects the dots, and me -- the reader -- connecting the dots myself.

One has to look deep within in order to find the answers to these questions, and i believe this book will help you on that most important journey.

By taking an objective look at the Earth, It's history, culture, Science and people LKJ has produced an much needed view of rationality and common sense on the collective self-destructive lunacy that seems to have enveloped the 21st Century. She not only expands the reader's horizons and encourages \`out-of-the-box' ways of viewing the tragedy that is unfolding on what was once eden. You will finish the book with a far greater understanding of mans purpose on this planet and practical tools to make the most of what little time we actually have left to reverse the seeds of destruction that were sown long ago. An inspirational text from cover to cover and no other book I have read gives a more detailed analysis the truth that has been hidden from us in vales of distractions purposefully created and abused to keep us in our slumber. A truly invaluable resource for those of us who really care about humanity and have long harbored thoughts that, \`something just isn't right with the world'.

If you are even remotely interested in any of these subjects, do yourself a favour. Read this book. Mrs. Knight-Jadczyk gets right to the meat of the matter, cutting away all the frivolous banter that fills space in most books on these subjects.

'The Secret History Of The World And How To Get Out Alive' is the most astonishing compendium of concentrated knowledge I have ever come across. It made me yearn to be able to set aside a lifetime just to be able to study it inside out, follow its leads and pull on the dazzling threads dangling from every page. Alas, the urgency of humanity's predicament means we are running out of 'time'. For the earnest seeker this book may catalyse something in you for which you have been seeking."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"So, the world is in a bit of a state at the moment, and there's nothing you can do about it, right? As the saying goes, those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Pretty obviously we're making the same mistakes over and over so perhaps it's about time to dig a bit deeper and find out 'what the devil' is really going on.Well this book is the place to go. It's not the easiest to digest, as it contains so much material, and races through so many new concepts, and introduces a lot of revolutionary ideas. Its impossible to absorb it all first time around, however exciting it might be. Its the kind of book that always reveals something new when revisited. This is the mother of all 'treasure hunts' across history and mythology, spanning all kinds of disciplines from archaology to brain chemistry to politics. This is no 'Da Vinci Code' though, it is a serious and dedicated study, in which every line of investigation is subject to exhaustive examination. If you are naturally curious about the world we live in, this book opens up many more questions, and avenues to be explored. Once you are hooked, there's no way out. Certainly, my view of the world will never be the same again."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I once read the story of a woman who, each time she visited a new city would always seek out the highest building and make for the top of it, so as to better orient herself in the landscape before going off to explore. Reading 'A Secret History of the World' was very much like that, the journey imparts a knowledge that you just wouldn't find otherwise. I thought it was well researched and written with an uncommon depth and breadth of understanding, a very enjoyable and revealing work.Worth a visit just for views when you get there as they say!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This book is so well researched and so fascinating, it is hard to overstate its importance. It is a huge volume covering history, myth, little known advanced \\"prehistoric\\" civilizations, esoteric traditions, many branches of science, psychology, political control systems, hyperdimensional realities, and so much more. With a very large number of citations of sources, further reading can take you on a marvelous journey lasting years.It's not what one would call an easy read, but it's also very hard to put down. Challenging and stimulating, it's one of those things that can change your thinking and life. And for those who have already been searching and seeking and digging deep, many pieces of the puzzle will fall into place.Well worth buying this one, it's a bargain chock full of invaluable material. It will be a great addition to anyone's library of important books."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"There is simply no book quite like 'The Secret History Of The World'. I was simply astonished at the sheer depth and range of the material covered in this book. It has had a profound effect on me since even as a child I have always known that there is something profoundly wrong with this world but I could not articulate what I was seeing. I could not see the whole picture, I could only see some crude outline of some unseen semi-formless, quasi-physical reality that hid behind the scene of our everyday reality but I was looking at it as if through a colored glass. But I knew that it interfaced with our 'normal' everyday reality in some way. I knew it, I felt and sensed it, I semi-percieved it, but I could not articulate it proper. But I knew it was there and I knew that it had profound influence on our everyday reality in some way, as if it was hiding behind a curtain that had no seams. In fact, I knew it was even more real then the everyday reality to which we are all familiar.Laura Knight's book 'The Secret History Of The World' has helped me immeasurably to understand this unseen reality better. Simply put, no other book that I have ever read (and I have read many of them) has explained the nature of this unseen reality as this book has. This book is simply a stupendous effort of the human will to pierce the veil of reality as we know it and see what is behind it. Laura has made a choice to inform humanity of this unseen reality, a reality that hides behind the curtain of our awareness. It took Laura nothing less then a lifetime of dedicated effort, at great cost to her own personal safety as well as to her family's safety. But her choice to make this search is who she is. How can one go against who they are? You cannot, otherwise ones peril will be far worse, for themselves as well as for their family.Laura Knight has spent an entire lifetime selflessly dedicating herself to carefully researching history, physics, philosophy, archeology, astronomy, geology, sociology, psychology (the list goes on). From these researches she has written this book as so to help us all understand the essence of what is really going on in this very crazy, pathological world that we presently live in. She gives us the big picture. Many books have been written to explain why the world is in such a chaotic state. Psychologists, scientists, philosophers, have all tried to explain these things but their range of vision is severely limited due to shortsightedness or long-sightedness, since they could only see what they wish to see and can only see the part while overlooking the whole. When one focuses on what is near then the far away becomes blurry and distorted and conversely, when one focus on the far away then the near becomes blurry and distorted. Because of this blindness there have been forces throughout all of history, forces that are masters of deception that have taken great measures to cover up, deceive and obfuscate our knowledge of our past so as to disassociate this knowledge from our present day knowledge. The end result is that we do not know our own past and by default we are doomed to repeat it.Indeed, those who forget history are always condemned to repeat it. There simply can be no true future if our true past is not understood. There will always be those very powerful forces that are powerful enough to literally shape the destiny of entire civilizations using lies and deceit to vector these civilizations to clash against each other thus producing the necessary opposing forces so as to generate the requisite power and energy to direct these civilizations into a prison of their own making so as to serve the needs of an invisible directing malevolent intelligence.These civilizations, which includes our present day civilization, serve as slaves to the nefarious agendas of these malevolent forces and it is these forces that use man's owncreative moral nature along with his own willingness to be deceived, as the basis for this slave-hood.Any person who wishes to affirm their own free will and expose this deception for the benefit of humanity will be viscously attacked by these malevolent powers who see this free will affirmation as an opposition to their monolithic rule. As Gurdjieff says: \\"A strong positive evokes a strong negative.\\"Laura Knight-Jadczyk is one such person who has been viscously attacked by these negative forces for exposing this grand deception. Because of death threats by agents and agencies known and unknown, she had to leave the United States with her husband and her family since it appears that the focal point or the base of operations of these nefarious forces is here in the United States. However, she and her husband Arkadiusz Jadczyk, who is an internationally known theoretical physicist and who is also an expert in hyperdimensional physics, continue to inform mankind of this grand deception by heroically maintaining ongoing research in spite of repeated attacks by these forces to defame their good name.The nature of these forces that work through man's psyche and the horrible effect they have had on man's history, both individually and collectively, is masterfully researched in Laura's book 'The Secret History Of The World And How To Get Out Alive'. She gives facts and the facts might give us fear but, most importantly, as the ending of the book title suggests 'How to Get Out Alive,' the book also gives us HOPE on how to escape from the collective madness they we are presently engulfed inon this 'ill fated planet,' as Gurdjieff so wisely expressed it.There is more to this book that I have written in my review here. Much more. I personally think Laura's epoch-making work 'The Secret History Of The World And How To Get Out Alive' will be one of the most influential books ever written in history. This books objectivity, it's voluminous knowledge and it's vision of hope for the future will be a powerful force to balance the negative forces presently invading humanity and only such a strong positive force can give us any hope at all of creating a new future for our children and children's children. If you love your children then I would say to, without fail, read this book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Ms. Knight-Jadczyk has done a wonderful job with that book. She was able to see the reality which has been kept secret for so many years. It is a book that everyone should read. You will not see the world the same manner after reading her book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"A life-changing work. The book is the fruit of a lifetime of fearless seeking of the truth. What Knight-Jadczyk has given us is an honest, realistic path to ascension, one that doesn't require burying one's head in the sand of one-sided positivity. Rather, this path requires facing squarely frightening, negative truths about the human condition.Knight-Jadczyk, following the work of Gurdjieff, Mouravieff and Castaneda, argues that humans are, for the most part, machines imprisoned in pens, partly of our own making, serving as \\"food\\" for something that does not have our best interests at heart.According to Knight-Jadczyk, we are living through the climax of thousands of years of history, a transformation fraught with dangers and opportunities we can barely imagine.By combining the latest in scientific theory with the Fourth Way path of Gurdjieff and with rigorous analysis of history and myth (the Grail stories, Greek Myths, the Bible, Sufi and Alchemical literature) for clues on how we came to be in the fix we are in and how to escape it, Knight-Jadczyk has contributed something new and uniquely valuable: realistic hope."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I have never been able to comprehend human behavior.

Her revelations in the book regarding the hyperdimensional control system and the Techno-Spirituality of the Ancient civilizations was nothing short of mind boggling to me and I'm not same after reading it. The book had made me re-think and reevaluate everything that I had ever learned in High School and College. I liked the way the book was written. It was written for both the layman and scholar and everything in the book was backed with sound scientific research.

Most of what we have been taught about history is wrong. It would take me at least a decade to read and study all the material listed in the bibliography of this unique yet mind shattering book. However, the little I have read of the material included in her extensive research has led me to rethink everything I have been taught regarding the history of the world.Her book is very well researched. Her points are adequately supported. The bibliography and index serve as a solid foundation for reading this book, as well as the pursuit of independent study of questions presented within. The author's open minded and unbiased views are clearly reflected in a writing style that balances the blow of the cold hard facts with the offer of some challenging yet realistic solutions for the reader. I highly recommend this book to individuals who genuinely seek to learn the truth regarding the human condition, how we got here, why - and what we can do about it. \\"The devil is in the details\\" and for those who have eyes to see - the details are here."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This book is a grand tour of the human condition. It examines elements of traditions and history and the process whereby history and myth are transmitted and evolve.In the author's own words:\\" As I searched through the literature in hundreds of fields of study, the chief thing that became apparent to me is that mankind is in the iron grip of an uncaring control system that raises him up and brings him low for its own mysterious purposes. No group, no nationality, no secret society or religion, is exempt.\\"Having taken this as a working hypothesis, Knight-Jadczyk delves into ancient history, the often confused origins of the Bible, Egyptology, fragments of what is known of esoteric traditions, the bloody history of religion as a control system, alchemy and many other fields. She tracks the vague traces and hints pointing to an ancient technology involving things such as control of gravity and time travel.The book attempts to place the human drama in a cosmic, hyperdimensional context, as if embedded in a higher world of archetypes, as above, so below. She explores various mythical renditions of this theme, ranging from the Matrix movies to the legend of Perseus.Much evidence is presented for the existence of a lost \\"scientific spirituality,\\" of which scattered remanants are found in traditions. This loss is in part a result of probably cyclic cataclysms, in part a result of the hyperdimensional forces shaping history for their own ends. The turning point on which the present shape of the world depends is seen to be the disappearance of the prehistoric culture of cooperation and the disappearance of the ancient technology. These opened the way for the introduction of a patriarchal culture of domination with its monotheistic religion claiming an exclusivity on the divine.Throughout the book the author presents a summary of observations on the possible spiritual development of man and how this may affect the course of history and how some of this knowledge has been suppressed through the ages. Thus we do not only have an exposition of forces shaping history but also an idea of how such knowledge can be applied today.The book is very broad in scope and deals with an astounding volume of information. It does so with good awareness of context and constant attention to how even initially valid information has been twisted and misrepresented at all turns for various ends. References are made to natural sciences when these are relevant.There is probably no other book that draws such a volume of multidisciplinary information together into a coherent whole."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Lauara Knight-Jadczyk's book \\"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive\\", is amazingly thought provoking. With so much of our current world being a mess, she has diligently researched the historical eveidence that shows just maybe why we are as we are today, why the world seems to be on a precipice of destroying itself. I was captivated and the book led me to do much research of my own and I think she is on the right track to figuring out what is going on and perhaps what a person with conscience can do in a world that seems so lacking in critical examination of itself."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This book started my journey down the rabbit hole. It contains so much research and information that I was totally astounded. I had to read it twice. Laura Knight-Jadczyk is an amazing woman to have devoted her life to answering as many of the questions of our existence as she can. Her writing style also amazes me because I'm not a very avid reader and I absorbed a lot from just my first read. Enough to open my eyes to many things I had never given any thoughts to and much more. Nobody puts the pieces of the puzzle together better than Laura imo. This book is a must read for anyone especially if you already have the questions and are just looking for the answers. Knowledge protects!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"At 700+ pages there is so much material in this book, it is easy to become overwhelmed. It is a bargain at $20; I paid $50 and felt I more than got my money's worth.Another reason to read this book slowly is to think about the ideas she presents; most of them are exactly the opposite of what we have been taught.Laura does a good job of citing her source materials and explaining her conclusions, and if you try to read this massive book quickly, you may have trouble processing any emotions that come up as the sacred cows of our culture are skewered. (Be especially gentle with yourself if you were raised in a Southern Baptist home.)I am surprised by the negative reviews of this book. Laura lays out a banquet of ideas; it is hard to believe that a least one or two of her conclusions do not merit the serious thought and reflection of the readers, even if they disagree."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Forget what you think you knew about the world because you have no idea.This book is a treasure trove of well researched facts, ground breaking information which spans very diverse subjects into a coherent whole.It will make you look at the world with new eyes and the author does a great job of fitting the pieces together.This book is dense and it's a long read but it's a worthwile investment, and contrary to other books in the same category you'll find a renewed interest in reading it again because you will have probably missed certain connections made the first time you've read it.Higly recommended !"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This book contains an amazing amount of information - extremely well researched, and really gives the reader an accurate picture of our true history.

History as a series of painful collective experiences just seems to keep repeating and repeating.In this book, the author pulls on many threads of History, Mythology, Science, Religion and UFO Research that lead towards the discovery that although History does keep repeating, there appear to be some pretty important and previously unrecognized causes for humanity's apparently endless repetitions of suffering. Not only have there been the obviously ruthless and power mad tyrants orchestrating world events but there is a huge amount of evidence to suggest that behind these \\"controllers and shapers\\" there have been less obvious hyper-dimensional controllers working from another density, whose overall agenda is to feed on the sufferings of humanity and act to challenge, distract and divert seekers of truth from their quest. Food for thought indeed and highly probable. If we don't understand the disease how can we find a cure??Drawing on scientific principles, the author suggests that positive change and an alternate outcome to the endless repetition of these negative historical cycles can only occur when we develop the courage and perceptual tools to see things \\"as they really are\\" rather than ignoring reality or creating imaginary wishful thinking about it. She offers clues that a \\"way through to another reality\\" have been left by others in the past , such as the Cathars, Mythic and Alchemical literature, Casteneda, Gurdjieff and Mouravieff - for those that seek it.\\"We hypothesize that the myths, rituals, ceremonies of the ancient religions are but surviving fragments of a technology from which the true significance has vanished. further we might think that it is in discovering the secrets of this \\"technology\\" that mankind has a chance to become free of the Terror of History. what is this secret technology? it is nothing less than the Holy Grail, the Ark, the Philosopher's Stone.\\"A truly inspiring book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I have read many books trying to make sense out of the lies and half-truths we are taught on this big blue marble.

Except that it wasn't available years ago, and when you read it you will realize why.Anyone with even one foot in academia will realize that all subjects in the sciences are separated, and jealously guarded separate disciplines, when in fact there are clear interconnections between subjects. Heaven forbid that the neuroscientists should ever get together with philosophers; or historians with fishmongers; because if they did, they might realize that something very very fishy is going on in our world; something which needs some serious connections making in order to understand what has really been happening all these millennia. The depth of research is awesome; the author, without committing herself to any \`ology' in particular but drawing on many, is able to make those serious connections. If you think you know what the \`grail quest' actually is, then read this book before you begin your journey.

A neat package from these diverse seekers is presented as Knight-Jadczyk rips the veil off of esoteric mumbo-jumbo that clouds so much of other literature.What really happens in the brain during alchemy?

It's definitely an entertaining read, but the author has a habit of jumping to conclusions that make the story more fantastic (the better to sell the book, my dear).I also think the author is too quick to discount certain sources that should be taken more seriously, and places too much weight on sources that should be taken very lightly (such as her \\"cassiopean transmissions\\" and the movie \\"The Matrix\\").I do, however, appreciate her ability to pull together all sorts of information from her experience and studies, and feel as though I've been given a taste of what many of her sources contain, giving me a \\"stepping stone\\" for further exploration. I mean, seriously, who has the time to read all of those books and sift through all the garbage to find the gems? Apparently this author does. The author perpetuates the garbage-sifting cycle, however, by presenting a very few gems amongst her own garbage....Some of the gems, however, are worth it. :)Do I recommend reading the book?

I hoped it contained new insights, revelations and enlightening truths that could assist humanity in breaking away from its current state of collective manipulation. What I found, was a poorly edited book lacking orderly continuity - a compendium of disjointed, convoluted and frustratingly disorganized material that the author failed to make cohesive in a meaningful way.Even though Ms. Knight-Jadczyk claims she arrives at her conclusions by applying scientific method and thought, upon close scrutiny one realizes the author attempts to support her opinions by bombarding the reader with a myriad of discombobulated story fragments from a multitude of sources which she ties together using cryptic telepathic communications she calls \\"Cassiopean Superluminal Transmissions\\". Yet, she tries to discredit the work of remarkable scholars such as Zacharia Stitchin should they not fit her views along the way.Instead of wasting money on this book and painfully navigating close to 700 pages to come up with very little value in the end, knowledge seekers would be better off reading the works of Fulcanelli, Gudjieff, Mouravieff, etc. and arriving at their own conclusions. However, for really enlightening information, I suggest reading David Ike's and Dolores Cannon books, Paul Shockley's, \\"Cosmic Awareness Communications\\" transcripts and Jane Roberts' \\"Seth Speaks\\" transcripts."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"How can you review such an extraordary book that encompasses all and everything?

In fact, the beauty of this vast synthesis is that you'll need to read it again and again to grasp the true import of what Mrs. Knight-Jadczyk is presenting here.

I have learned more from reading and researching this book than I thought could be possible in a lifetime. I would say that this book is an 'eye opener', but it is more like a 'Mind Opener'.

Knight-Jadczyk covers a wealth of information in this ambitious 679 page volume, which tackles topics ranging from history, science and psychology to biblical exegesis, mythology and alchemy. In a brilliant synthesis, she peels back layers of history from the Pleistocene to the present, exposing a thread of control that can only be understood in the context of a hyperdimensional reality and teaching the reader how to read the signs in order to understand it in a meaningful way and do something about it. She also shows that esotericism is not antithetical to science, but that the two are actually the same when enough knowledge has been acquired to understand their identity -- knowledge that has been purposefully kept from us by a control system that feeds on us through our ignorance. And while providing an enormous amount of material toward this end, she doesn't spoon-feed, and encourages the reader to apply critical thinking in order to connect the dots on their own.

It will make you pay closer attention to the signs in our reality because the implications are huge!!!Have you ever read a book that tackles the major questions concerning life on our planet? Answers to questions like what does objective reality look like or why is our world the way it is now are outlined in this book. Thoroughly researched, Ms. Jadczyk draws on art archeology, science, philosophy, religion, her investigations into the paranormal and more to help us see what the history of mankind has been trying to tell us all along. Namely, that we are responsible for our being and the tools for taking responsibility has been artfully hidden via distortions, disruptions and manipulations. She shows us how to go about finding the tools and to develop the skills to overcome the lies we are fed daily. As it says in the book:\\"[...] Life experiences reflect how one interacts with god.Those who are asleep are those of little faith in terms oftheir interaction with the creation...People who paystrict attention to objective reality right and left becomethe reality of the future.\\"Ms Jadczyk outlines the process of paying strict attention and tells us why it must be done now. If we don't, history has a way of repeating itself through cataclysms both natural and manmade. She even shows us how all the signs point to this cyclic process unfolding today and how we can prepare ourselves for it.

I've read this book twice and am now reading it for the third time. It's dense with facts and hypothesis, and is completely referenced as to her sources. There is such a wealth of information she has uncovered and tediously pieced together, including reading between the lines to fill many of the gaps, that I am nearly overwhelmed!To say that I'm glad I found this book would be a serious understatement. This book is priceless -- a must have for anyone who really wants to learn about our world, its real history, the possible true meaning of the \\"holy grail\\" and \\"ascension,\\" and how such information has been hidden from the masses."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"For those with a critical eye and open mind, willing to suspend all preconcieved notions and say \\"What if?...\\", this book will make fascinating reading. Laura Knight-Jadczyk has condensed years of research into an explicitly-referenced, information-dense book that blows apart many of the widely accepted notions of humanity's past, present and future.If you've always felt something was \\"not quite right\\" about the state of affairs on planet Earth, this book provides a thorough explanation of the basis behind such a nagging intuition. No area is considered \\"off limits\\" - Science, Religion, History, Myth, Philosophy, Government, Pop-culture, the \\"UFO phenomenon\\", War, Psychology, Human nature... it's all in there.The writing style embraces the spectrum between the pleasantly conversational and rapid-fire cross-linking of concepts, facts and figures that will make your head spin. It is a book that will sustain its value over many re-readings, and provide much food for thought with personal lines of research and exploration of other literature. Heck, the bibliography alone is 18 pages of fine print! I'm into my second reading of it and still feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.If this book is an accurate picture of the current objective reality of this world, then humanity may have a glorious future ahead of us - if we have the strength to choose it; collectively, and individually. The alternative might be not so appealing. With all the bad news on TV these days - bird flu, climate change, war in the Middle East... is it too far-fetched to consider that there might be unseen forces shaping the flow of events? I personally don't think so, but it's up the individual reader to decide that for themselves.I think LJK has done us all a great service in putting the information out there in a concise way. And if it's all just a tall tale, then it's still the best one I've ever read, so I'm willing to consider my purchase justified, however things turn out.Very highly recommended for anyone of a questioning nature."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"It is one of those books that you just get more and more engrossed in the more you read. When you finish the book, you wish it would go on. It is so enrapturing and so mind opening that you can't help but start to think about and question everything you have ever learned.The author Laura Knight-Jadczyk goes to great length to look at things from many different angles and continues to question reality where other writers often get into a fixed viewpoint. More than anything the reader is challenged to think for him/herself, as the solutions to the abundance of subjects raised are not handed to the reader on a platter. Many threads are being explored and pulled on in the various chapters and instead of just saying this is what it means the reader is gently encouraged to weave the threads together themselves and encourages to explore the subjects furher.The author is down to earth and has a willingness to question everything that she has read, which means that everything is looked at from many different angles and sources. On top of it the book has a good index and source list which has proven valuable in the search for further understanding.I read the first version of the book 3 years ago and reread this updated version of it. After reading the first one I was so enthused that I ordered and read a number of the books that are refenced as sources. Rereading the book gave me a new understanding of what I had previously read and made sense of many things that had first time around just been left in my mind in the 'dont know category'.Since then I have had the good fortune to read every other book of the author and can only say that it has changed my life. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the more likely history of the world and the many mysteries and anomalies that have largely gone untold but which have shaped the current world situation."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Throughout time, there were scattered crumbs afloat on a strong wave of the dangerous sea without mercy, but no single bread was ever seen. However, these crumbs are now beginning to be found and pieced together: to form single bread. And, this bread was the \\"Truth\\" and the mysterious discoverer of these crumbs was Laura Knight-Jadczyk. This was her approach when she wrote her transcendent work entitled \\"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive,\\" which was brought to the eyes and ears of the world in 2005. She has embarked on a perilous journey to discover the unseen clues in many areas of research: history, science, religion, mythology, physic, psychology, and even unidentified flying object. With these clues, Knight-Jadczyk has brought about a true meaning about the nature of our reality. By looking at three basic themes: the nature of COINTELPRO, the existence of the hyperdimensional reality, the discovery of two different human races, one can gather a paramount understanding about the nature of our reality and how one would seek a way out of the domination of inhumanity.The COINTELPRO is an important term for the readers to be aware of and Knight-Jadczyk has widely used this term throughout the book because the activities of COINTELPRO are currently misdirecting or corrupting the course of humanity. The term \\"COINTELPRO\\" stands for \\"Counterintelligence Program,\\" which is a \\"FBI's secret program...set out to eliminate 'radical' political opposition inside the US [and it is also] a high level psychological operation specifically set up to vector 'ideological' trends - beliefs, etc\\" (p. 8). It is a latter purpose of COINTELPRO that is critical because it is set out to create a disinformation, also known as false information or lies, to be spread when certain people are set out to discover a 'sensitive' truth about a certain group or a hidden agenda. And, it is an expectation of COINTELPRO that people would believe in its disinformation and 'go away.' This is especially true when people are seeking for the answers about unidentified flying objects, aliens, or any 'paranormal' phenomena. Knight-Jadczyk clarified this when she pointed out that:\\"The COINTELPRO files show the U.S. Government targeted a very broad range of religious, labor and community groups opposed to any of its agendas, and it is only logical to assume that the same type of operation would be created to cover up the \\"alien agenda.\\" Such a theoretical COINTELPRO operation also goes far in explaining why, when the sincere researcher of UFO phenomena enters this field, he or she discovers only lies, lies, and more lies; confusion and disinformation. That is most definitely the signature of COINTELPRO.\\" (p. 10 - 11)With an understanding of COINTELPRO and its activities, the readers will see what is really happening in today's world events. It is best for one to discern the true information from false information, especially when a disinformation that is being promoted by certain groups under the control of COINTELPRO. Sometime, when a push comes to a shove, this operation would do anything to achieve its goal. The author stated that:\\"The few professionals who spoke out against the hysteria [as promoted by religious fundamentalists] were systematically attacked and discredited by government agencies and private organizations. (...) If they can't corrupt you, they kill you, and if they can corrupt you, they still kill you so you won't have a chance to change your mind and recant your recantation like Jacques de Molay did when the Templars were destroyed. Those who get close to the belly of the beast are generally subjected to a new \\"approach\\" it seems. And that approach is the biggest betrayal of all.\\" (p. 17, 19)The COINTELPRO have a great number of 'agents' inside Human Potential Movement or certain New Age groups, as well other respected organizations, whose goal is to instill stories of lies to the right individuals. The fact that we were unable to discover the full truth of either unidentified flying objects or any other worldwide paranormal phenomena is because the COINTELPRO was achieving its purpose daily. In an allegoric sense, COINTELPRO threw out great number of molds in disguise of bread crumbs onto the sea, and they will look like real bread crumbs, tasted like a real bread crumbs, but the ingredients are greatly poisoned.When Knight-Jadczyk captured one of the wandering crumbs of Truth, she also discovered an important key to an understanding of the hyperdimensional reality. In \\"The Secret History of the World,\\" she has devoted a fourth chapter on this subject of the hyperdimensional reality, which is basically \\"the idea that the world in which we live was a 'form' or reflection, or 'double' of another cosmic world that existed on a higher level\\" (p. 123). This concept may be quite difficult for many wide-eyed readers to grasp and might give them quite a headache, but it is a very important concept because it brought about an understanding of the nature of our reality to which our reality is a projection of a hyperdimensional reality. A basic understanding of this concept would most certainly change one's perception of our reality, but it would not be fully comprehended by using our limited level of understanding. Is our reality an only reality or not? How many realities are there? Are we dreaming or are other people dreaming of us? Such questions would make our minds to be rendered as numbness. The hyperdimensional reality or hyperdimensional physic is a term used in the study of the quantum physic. The author also addressed the issue of 'Time' or linear as relating to this concept:\\"In our geometry we define a point as an infinitesimal section of a line. A line is an infinitesimal cross-section of a plane and a plane is an infinitesimal section of a solid. Thus, our three dimensional reality must be defined as a series of infinitesimal sections of a four dimensional body. Conceptually, this means that our entire reality is a section of a four-dimensional body - a realm of potential dimensions beyond three-dimensional contemplation.\\" (p. 125)Our reality is considered to be a linear reality where we would go in a straight line in time as well as in our thoughts. How we currently perceive time is part of a linear reality. However, a hyperdimensional reality does not involve this term of linear, and it may have a different mechanical workings of time. The author has also explored mathematical dimensions, dimensional thinking and the question of perceptions, and Einstein's theories as part of understanding hyperdimensional reality in this chapter.Knight-Jadczyk's discussion of two distinct human races on Earth in her book would surely overwhelm the readers. How could humanity be consisted of two different races, one might ask. To describe the two races, the author has brought into this book the works of Boris Mouravieff, where \\"pre-adamic/adamic\\" concept is discovered, and of Fulcanelli on \\"Primitive Chiliasm.\\" In short, the adamic human race have a \\"full set of DNA\\" and is connected \\"to the higher centers in place and functioning,\\" while the pre-adamic human race \\"have no possibility of reaching the higher centers because DNA hardware isn't in place\\" (p. 154). But, the problem is this: we cannot tell a pre-adamic bring apart from an adamic being at face value because they are intermixed and the way to tell them apart is a keen and long observation. Knight-Jadczyk has elaborated on this:\\"The DNA of these two races is so mixed that both can be found within the same families. Your brother, sister, mother, father, daughter, or son. Not somebody \\"other\\" across the world or across the street worshipping a different god or with a different skin color. It may be somebody you live with every day of your life, and if so, they have but one reason to be here, to drain, distract and deflect souled [or adamic] being from evolving. And it is important also to note that this cannot be \\"conscious.\\" Such individuals are as little aware that they do NOT have \\"higher centers\\" as those who do except, perhaps, that the latter may feel something is \\"missing\\" in their lives.\\" (p. 158)Not everything is as what appears to be. The idea of two different races living among each other would surely shock the sleeping minds of the readers. It may be quite a challenge for one to 'detect' a pre-adamic being when observing other people. But, can we tell if we are pre-adamic beings ourselves? The author has further explained the difference between pre-adamic (or Organic Portals) and adamic races (or Souled Beings) and their place in our world in the fifth chapter of her book.There is a great number of research and literature being referenced and used in this book, and there are sixteen pages worth of bibliography. It is quite safe to say that this 'controversial' book does not come from the author's imagination. Using a scientific approach, she connected the dots, per se, in her years of broad research. Indeed, she has devoted a great deal of her time and energy into this book. And, because she has filled her book with data and research, the author brought forth a good deal of information that she has uncovered that may not have been known to a general public before. Whatever books that the public would generally read might not be entirely correct or accurate because some books would not have enough data to support their theories or hypothesis. For her book, Knight-Jadczyk backed up her thesis with solid evidence.In Knight-Jadczyk's \\"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive,\\" one can apprehend the hidden nature of our reality and how one would find a way out of the domination of inhumanity by looking at three basic theme: the nature of COINTELPRO, the hyperdimensional reality, the discovery of two different human races. With an understanding of the nature of COINTELPRO, the readers will have a good sense of its activities in today's world events. With the concept of the hyperdimensional reality being introduced to one's mind, the nature of our reality as a projection of a hyperdimensional reality is grasped. The concept of two different races living among our world would change one's perception of what is humanity and would bring a certain understanding about themselves. Such a life-altering work, one will discover the number of truths about the human condition and its history. With great respect, it is of opinion that this book to be highly recommended. And, the author's discovery of crumbs of Truth from the most dangerous sea is most certainly a food for thought."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I do not remember what I was searching at the time but Google books brought me to this one -- it is endlessly fascinating"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I don't think I am able to fully express how amazing and important I think this book is.

This is a must read for those finding themselves lost with our current information and are seeking the truth in life."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I'd hated history all of my life until I read this book. It's full of so many interesting facts and observations made by the author that I realized I've really been missing out, so I haven't quit since. The book sent me for a loop the first time I read it, and the second time, and the third time, always introducing me to new concepts and ways of pondering them, as well as sending me back to earn another degree. I've since spent much of my time reading from her extensive bibliography and learning the most fascinating things. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I only wanted to read one chapter of this book (that my husband, who bought the book, thought I might find interesting) but this proved impossible: this book is seriously addictive! You will love it! Well, that is if, like me, you like your non-fiction backed by solid data, full of witty associations, presenting loads of references and written by someone with an eye for detail and with a good dose of humour. I guarantee you will read things you NEVER read anywhere else and much of the material is totally groundbreaking (those witty associations and eye for detail really pay off big time!). Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"If you ever wondered why the world is the way it is, this is the book to read. Laura draws from an extraordinary amount of sources to convey an objective view of our world. Reading this book, I learned to question our reality, accepted history, what influences it (and us) and what may be in store for all of us. This is a must read for anyone who wonders why things are the way they are on planet Earth.And please ignore the negative reviews! If you are seeking answers, this book will give them to you."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"The book is HUGE, but well worth the effort of reading it. The author takes the reader on a trip through many topics in our history and presents clarification of- (and sometimes an alternative view to-) the events being discussed. This book, as well as others from this author, should be read with an objective mind. That is, the mind should not accept views presented, nor defend ones acquired from other sources, without thorough research. Few of us have time to follow ALL the resource links and it is my personal opinion that Mrs. Jadczyk definitely took the time to follow the links and pointers presented to her, whether they be bibliographical notes or subliminal messages. I highly recommend this book (along with others by this author) to anyone looking for clarification on why things are the way they are on this wonderful planet we inhabit."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"A fantastic read!Everything you have wondered about or wanted to know is in this book.Highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Heard about this book from a friend and could not find it anywhere. None of the big brick and mortar bookstores dare carry the book. I guess truth is stanger than fiction after all.If you read Dan Brown's DaVinci Code, make sure to read Secret History for the facts and a much larger picture of how dire the situation is for mankind.The material is well researched, so brace yourself to be hit 'up side the head' with the 'real deal'!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I couldn't put this book down when I started reading it and haven't stopped learning from it since.

Start the journey yourself by reading this book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"It is one of the rare books which is a must for all the sincere truth seekers. even though we like to explain our multi faceted existence in simple theories/terms, those theories rarely explain the things in entirity. This book is a very fascinating book in highlighting all the factors/players that influence own existenance. Wonderful Book. open your self for new understanding and Enjoy the reading. Rock and Roll. Iam giving 4 stars, as it is shocking in many respects and very huge book to read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"This is a review of the book, which is impossible to cover in it's entirety save for vague generalization due to it's mammoth size and diverse contents. In addition, I believe it's important for the reader to know where the ideas in the book come from and I would also like to share my experience as a dabbler in the author's world...I remember when I discovered the author's website (type \\"cassiopaea\\" into any search engine to find it), I was deeply in \\"seeking\\" mode and would leave no stone unturned, so naturally Laura's website, the ideas of which form the basis of this current book, intrigued me. I had read a few traditional (and confusing) Western Alchemy/Occult type books (or parts thereof) as well as a great deal of the sort of armchair philosophizing books that attempted to sort of \\"bring it all together\\" for the neophyte seeker. I'm talking about the standard sort of books any fledgling dabbler in the occult is bound to read first: stuff by Israel Regardie, Dion Fortune, Manly P. Hall, Gurdjieff, Franz Bardon, etc.At the point when I randomly came across the author's website I had come to appreciate something in Buddhism that I had not really found coherently expressed in the various other forms of mysticism/occult I had studied for the previous 10 years or so with all my sincere efforts. When I stumbled across this author's website, my mind tumbled into an abyss of total doubt and real spiraling \\"out of control\\" feeling, but I stuck with it. I read and entertained her beliefs honestly and open-mindedly until I really understood her reality. And it disturbed me to believe it was true. Then, one day, I woke up and realized something I had read by RA Wilson really applied here: \\"what the thinker thinks, the prover proves.\\" This was a reality tunnel nobody has any way of proving or disproving... and it's completely negative, not unlike all the religions this author condemns as evil tools of manipulation! I would almost guess if I stuck with her ideas for too long, it would have caused some sort of psychotic break or something.Now, I personally believe in non-carbon-based life, as have some of our most brilliant scientists, such as Planck and Shrodinger (so I'm not a kook!), so when the author explains that she receives this information from a Ouija board, I don't discount her offhand as a nut-case. However, you should be aware that this is how she comes to a lot of her conclusions; she asks \\"the Cassiopaeans\\" about something and they give her answers on a Ouija board. She then mulls it all over and comes up with some truly terrifying ideas about reality. It took her a while to fully trust them and, actually, she's still not completely certain if she can trust what's coming out of her Ouija board because it could be misdirection coming from other entities, who naturally want to keep the author and everyone else trapped.In the author's eyes, pretty much everything is mind-control (and I don't disagree with her here). The problem, for me, is that what she presents as supposedly a fully-researched and presumably legitimate approach to the subject matter is anything but that. She certainly knows a lot of general and fragmentary information about a lot of subjects which she pieces together methodically and thoroughly-- not unlike David Icke, although I'm sure some will not appreciate that comparison. It took Icke several books of terrifying paranoia before he finally came to the conclusion Hindus had expressed far better a thousand years earlier: all is love... so what is with all the paranoia-inducing speculation and hearsay?)This author's conclusions (opinions) are basically all the result of sheltered personal interpretation, perhaps an overactive imagination and perhaps the ideas of those beings she might possibly channel through her Ouija board. Her opinions on various religions or mystery traditions are not those of one who has actively experienced them as a part of the community. Without any firsthand knowledge of many of these subjects, she tends to resort to conjecture. As a matter of fact, she HAS to resort to conjecture, unless she is depending on her supposed spirit guides... in which case, she is then resorting not simply to speculation, but also to hearsay.If it is true that the mind creates its own reality, it is not surprising that the author seems to be living in her own private hell, complete with death threats."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"...to the questions about our existence, this book will give invaluable information.Several decades worth of research has been condensed in to this very impressive tome, and the author's ability to present and weave it all together is spectacular.Reading the book gives one information and understanding that will help in seeing the world the way it really is (\\"the man behind the curtain\\"), instead of the facade that has been put up.Why has the facade been created, and by whom? What is your role in it all?The book is essential reading!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I was so looking forward to reading this; I saw all the positive reviews....seventy of them and was impressed. It was expensive, but I squeezed the household budget a bit and purchased a copy.Good grief. There is a great deal to say about this book. But I won't except for a couple of points. There are nuggets of interest, but they are overwhelmed by bad writing, a wildly unfocused presentation, and an AWOL editor.The author has an off-putting fondness for exclamation points. During an early chapter, I believe the part discussing the elusive Saint-Germain, I noticed a veritable truckload of them. It lent a breathless, girlish quality to the prose that was enough to convince me that either the woman can't write OR that her editor (if there WAS one), needed to repeat elementary/middle school English. And this isn't even counting the problems with it's/its, which is generally covered in the third and fourth grades. A professional writer/editor should have caught all of this.I did feel, as another reviewer of the book commented, that I was slogging though muck. And it's a shame, because she does present some interesting ideas. But you have to wade around to find them and it was excrutiating at times.I have noticed, after reading all seventy reviews, that the one and two star reviewers were assailed with bitter counter-comments. This is unjustified. I did not care for this book, but this doesn't make me stupid. And it doesn't make me a monster that wants to sabotage Laura. I just feel duped. If it is true, as one critical reviewer posted, that Laura's fan club showed up to pad the review section with raves, I will try to be much more careful before buying an expensive book based on positive reader reviews."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Laura puts the puzzle pieces together like no one else. This work is all encompassing and very thoroughly researched. If you have a desire to learn the hidden truth of our world, this book is a must have!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Reading this book is one of the best things that ever happened to me! After plugging along through one book after another, this one pulled together all those historical threads in such a way that it not only gives you the understanding of why things are like the way, but also how imperative it is for one to free their mind from the poisons of false beliefs. There's a lot of dead end alleys out there. Yet this book will not only give you a map of the past so you are not doomed to repeat it anymore but also a flashlight for the future!This book is a great reference book too and digs deeper than anything you've ever seen before. My children love to hear me read some of it to them. I am quite amazed at the author's base of knowledge and her keen ability to link clues together. Read it and be healed."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Yes you understand that Iraq is a mess. You know that Bush and Blair are liars. You understand the pain and suffering in Pallestine. You feel the whole world is going to hell in handbasket.

Learning is not simple and to learn it quite a struggle and a necessity to undertake it seriously, in the case you want to live with your eyes open.There's so much out there, written in books and painted in the media, that presents just half of the picture, half truths, half lies. And few ones are able to report it all clearly, sometimes because they simply don't know, sometimes because their works will never be published by big editors. Thanks for this great work, with so many informations and references, written freely and without bias of sort."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"If I were cast away on an unpopulated island, and could only take one book with me, it would be this one. Truth is, I am sick of the lies and deceit of the system, and almost gave up trying to find any real answer to the two burning questions: 1) why things are the way they are, and 2) what can one do about it all? I am glad I found this book. It is packed with well researched facts, and combines scientific approach with spiritual ideas in a novel way, to paint a coherent picture of our reality. Now I can tell my children that there is hope."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Do you really, really, know what's going on? I doubt it, cause nobody dares to tell the truth.

The Secret History of the World makes it clear that \\"official culture\\" is based on a view of history that does not stand up to scrutiny. Laura will take you on a journey that includes the search for the Holy Grail aswell as a distant past where there was an apparent knowledge of time and space beyond anything known today, the remnants of which are strewn around the world as megalithic structures. If you want to open your eyes to a whole new reality of what it means to be a human being on planet earth, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"From the first pages I was amazed about the details that were not in my history books in school at all.I annotated this book so much, almost every page became filled with my diagrams, new ideas inspired by the topics covered there. Underlined a lot of sentences and looked up especially fascinating topics in the library.The author has good humor and skillfully changes gear so descriptions doesn't get boring at all. In fact I wanted this book to never end and wished it had at least three other volumes. Secrets in history absorbed me and opened my eyes to our unknown history. A lot of our history was intentionally changed by writers in the past and upon first reading it was so unbelievable. I thought my history books in school contained only the truth.I gained a new perspective!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"One of the most incredible books I have ever read. Being a history buff, I wanted a source that I could get down to the bare facts and true history of our world. Laura Knight-Jadczyk has done some amazing research and it is back up by facts. Highly recommend this book if you are looking for the real quest of The Holy Grail. Could not put this book down."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"More and more of us are becoming aware albeit slowly of the direction our civilisation is heading. This book and other titles from Laura Knight-jadczyk provide a light in an otherwise dark tunnel. Laura writes in a thought-provoking and interactive style with great attention to the finer detail. Secret History is a collection of data that know one's being should be without for any hope of surviving the coming storm.I personally would recommend all of the material published by Red-Pill press. Fantastic Work! Looking forward to more of the same."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Straight from the loom of master weaver [and author] Laura Knight-Jadczyk, this book is a masterpiece, and I loved it.Employing a weft spun of logical extrapolation and scientific deduction to shuttle across a warp of meticulously researched historical facts, she deftly creates a rich tapestry of immense proportion and import. Filled with such compelling topics as science, philosophy, history, religion, the Holy Grail and its legends, the Philosopher's Stone, alchemy and ascension, this expansive work rises to the level of manuscript. Each subject is fully and exhaustively covered, then masterfully fitted into its larger, metaphysical context.With a siren's \\"voice\\" and never short on wit, Knight-Jadczyk engages the reader with an easy-going style. No theme is left unresolved, nor is the thread of any topic ever allowed to drop.Whatever your passion, you will find it waiting for you within the pages of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Before you give up on trying to understand what is going on in the world today, read this book first. Laura Knight-Jadczyk's Secret History reveals closely held information and history that should be taught in every school to help us all understand the dynamic between our world and ourselves.The wide possession of such closely held historical knowledge and information, now uncovered in Knight-Jadczyk's Secret History, has always been threatening to the powers that be, so that such knowledge has been hidden away. By conducting thousands of hours of painstaking research resulting in this book, LKJ made what has been hidden, and secret, available to all in this very readable and valuable work that will answer many questions, and will help the reader grasp the nature of the situation the world finds itself in today. If you want the truth and think you can handle it, and pride yourself on thinking \\"outside the box\\", as they say, buy this book and read it, your world will not be the same afterwards. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"The Secret History of The World is a precious gift for everyone trying to open their eyes to the reality we live in. How can we understand our present and our future if our past is not understood? So many questions burning in everyone's mind. When trying to answer these Ms. Knight- Jadzyk doesnt guess or starts plotting conspiracies. Instead she observes reality that surrounds her and spends years doing a thorough resarch of such magnitude that she can easily put to shame many academic historians. The results are delivered in articulate, wholehearted and enjoyable way."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"I am about to buy this book for a second time. This book presents a convincing account of the dynamics behind the \\"terror of history\\". What do I mean by this? I am referring to that feeling one gets, when you take a couple steps back from your daily travails and realize that for our all supposed progress it would seem we (humans, in general) aren't much more than a mob waiting for an excuse. If you are like me, at some point you stopped diving back into distractions to hide from this feeling but instead asked, \\"Why? Why are things like this? Do they have to be? Most people I meet are just regular folks. So, why is everything so screwed up?\\" You are likely to have more questions than you started with if you read this book, but your questions will be of a fundamentally different order. Read this!"},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Do you ever wonder how and why things happen as they do?Have you ever questioned the stories your teachers and the mainstream sources feed you?Do you sometimes look at the world and wonder how things got so screwed up?Have you ever wondered if the world is going crazy or is it just you?You are not alone so welcome to the club. The inmates are running this asylum called Earth.This is the gist of Laura Knight-Jadczyk's \\"A Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive\\". Of course there is more to this book (679 pp.) than can be summarized in a few paragraphs or a short review. In fact, the amount of information and research contained in the book is quite impressive. Nicely footnoted with a 16-page bibliography and an 85-page index, there is much to reference and cross-reference in this hefty tome.In her quest for Truth the author seeks to uncover the mysteries of history, expose the man behind the curtain, and wake the sleeping masses from their matrix induced slumber. She debunks history into myth; the Old Testament was written as a propaganda tool for the acquisition of land and political power (surprise!), turns myth into history; the Trojan War was an actual event that was fought on an island in the Atlantic Ocean not the Mediterranean Sea (it would be quite difficult to get lost in the Mediterranean for ten years). And she introduces the reader to brilliant seekers such as Fulcanelli, Mouravieff, and Gurdjieff.Other subjects explored include hyper-dimensional realities, DNA programming and changes, ancient civilizations, the philosophers stone, cosmic catastrophes, grail legends, and alchemy among many others.Because the subject matter ranges all over the cosmos the author's attempts to tie it all together sometimes leaves the reader overwhelmed and feeling lost but the Secret History is no easy venture. Understanding the world and how it works requires a lifetime of study and effort. Of course, most of what she presents is reasoned speculation based on years of research and observation. She is strong in her beliefs but never dogmatic as she presents a cogent case in spite of the controversial subject matter and the lack of hard evidence due to the passage of time and the obfuscations of accepted history and conventional thought. She challenges the reader to caste aside linear thinking and expand one's consciousness into higher dimensions.The author's purpose is to challenge conventional religion and philosophy by radically re-defining our narrow interpretations of history and culture and thereby guide us through the asylum. But first we must un-learn what has been ingrained in us since the advent of our very own DNA and only then can we begin to learn the Truth. One does not put new wine into old wineskins.If you heard the truth, no matter how astonishing, would you believe it?Go ahead buy the book. Take the red pill."},{"Title":"The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive","review":"Allow Laura to take your hand and lead you on a journey through the back dark alleys of world history in this book, a journey that will change the way you see things for ever.Imagine that everything you know is an illusion, a lie, at best a picture filled with holes from on purpose omissions and diversions: from the world history to the religious stories, from the scientific discoveries to the archaeological excavations, from the new agey movement to the ufo abductions, and on and on and on....Laura KJ, is the one person who did not give up on the existential question that burdens us all \\"Who are we, What are we, What's the purpose?\\" and instead of conforming like the rest of us - who just get tired of asking or find an answer that don't really fits but make it fit - she dedicated her life into \\"digging\\". And found out more that she went looking for. Now after 30 years of labor and research she shares with us her findings.

Laura's extensive research and beautiful writing combine to provide an insightful book that is sure to shatter your illusions and bring freedom to the soul. Nothing I have ever come across touches upon so many and varied fields of study to join them into a seamless story.

Using the eyes of the intellect, the discipline of a scientist and historian and the heart and soul of a mystic Laura Knight-Jadczyk has brought together science and mysticism to pierce through the very nature of reality itself. Her revelations in the book regarding the hyperdimensional control system and the Techno-Spirituality of the Ancient civilizations was nothing short of mind boggling to me and I'm not same after reading it. The book had made me re-think and reevaluate everything that I had ever learned in High School and College. I liked the way the book was written. It was written for both the layman and scholar and everything in the book was backed with sound scientific research. Clearly this author has devoted her entire life to \\"piercing the veil\\" of reality to get to the essence of things. The book is ALIVE and is written with a intelligence that literally sparkles.

The chapters are arranged chronologically, beginning with the question &quot;Did St. Brendan Discover America?&quot; and ending with &quot;Was O.J. Simpson Guilty?&quot;Aron is very fair in his summary of each mystery. In clean and simple prose, he lays out the background, summarizes the competing theories and offers a reasoned solution, ending each essay with a brief but thorough annotated bibliography.If you are looking for a book that offers sensational solutions to mysteries real or imagined, you'll probably be disappointed by the &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; series. Aron fairly summarizes the &quot;off the wall&quot; theories about each of his mysteries, but he always comes to a conclusion that seems pretty plausible. No space aliens, Elvis sightings or grassy knolls here, but there's still plenty of mystery to be explored and enjoyed.If you like this book, you'll want to read Aron's two previous books (one is another collection of American historical mysteries, the other examines the mysteries of world history). For those who enjoy somewhat more sensational solutions to their historical mysteries, try Hugh Miller's &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot; and &quot;More Secrets of the Dead,&quot; based on the BBC documentary series of the same name.

Was Aaron Burr a traitor? Did James Earl Ray kill Martin Luther King? Was Alger Hiss a spy? What caused the Gulf War Syndrome? Was O.J. Simpson guilty? The author attempts to provide the answers in concise yet informative chapters that run between six and ten pages. I liked that the author seemed motivated by an honest search for the truth rather than by some desire to make political statements. For that reason alone, his conclusions seem valid. Of course, while the answers to a couple of these mysteries seem obvious, others cannot be answered with certainty. For that reason the author gives what he admits is his best guess. Also, a couple of the author's conclusions seem superfluous. But, overall this book is informative, readable and intelligent."},{"Title":"More Unsolved Mysteries of American History","review":"This book contains 30 cases of unsolved mysteries. Each case is described in about 6 to 7 pages and is followed by a list of annotated references.

In each case, the author succeeds in presenting the relevant information in a well-balanced and even-handed way by shedding light on arguments from all sides with the relative fairness that they each deserves. It is clear that some cases are more complicated and thus are more difficult to resolve than others. I was aware of the existence of some of these mysteries, but in many cases, I was not aware of any mystery at all. Thus, I learned something from each of these fascinating cases.

Anyone that doesn't like this one, well, I can't imagine why!! If you are expecting, and want help choosing what you want at the time of birth... especially if you have an OB and want to deliver in a hospital - this is the book that will help you ask the right questions, and write the birth paln that will help you get what you want out of the experience!! It even has info. about getting what you want out of a c-section!! GET THIS!! You will learn SOMETHING, I bet!!"},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"The cultural view of 'childbirth as a near death experience' in the U.S. is very real, so I thought I'd comment:How to read a book: with a mind open to learn. with research abilities. with a desire to explore further when something presented swirls up strong FEELINGS within, the stronger the feelings -> the more is required of self to face an honest effort to discover truth.Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt: culturally, we have slaughtered the truth that pregnancy is a normal state and childbirth is a normal function of the mature female body. The best kept childbirth secret is that normalacy IS safest for mother and baby, as well as most satisfying....and that for the majority of mothers it really isn't difficult \\"to have it normal\\". Yes, there ARE deviances from normal, as well as actual complications, that may place a different spin on the nature of the experience of childbirth, and which may cause normalacy in childbirth to be more difficult or impossible to achieve safetly or with desire. How often does that occur ? Depends on who you ask ! There really is a difference between being delivered (and the support is for the medicalized experience) and giving birth (and the support is for keeping mother comfortable and confident).Normalacy in childbirth is attainable, is protective and provides A Best Birth, A Safest Birth. To step forth with a bit of free-mind effort in the pursuit of discovery of why this is so~ there are questions such as: What IS normal ? Why is it protective ? What causes some women enjoyment of childbirth without drugs or surgery, while some scream asap (before labor !) for elective paraplegia (aka: epidural) or elective surgery (aka: just take it out) ? Why does the World Health Organization urge the U.S. to return to a midwife-based system of maternity care ?A Good Birth, A Safe Birth, as well as Obstetric Myths VS. Research Realities and The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth (to name a couple) will provide assistance in gaining a meaningful education on the subject of birthing normally."},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"This book describes every medical intervention out there. Most Doctors try to be as medically interventive as possible because they are there to make the money. Epidurals, C-sections...etc.. are worth a heck of alot more than a nonmedicated non interventive birth! After educating myself and reading this book, I told my doctor how my birth was going to go, and it did!"},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"Because of the negative review above, I am going to buy this book. Just what is this author's &quot;narrow&quot; view of birthing? I will let you know if I agree with that reader's opinion. I will be reading it for my doula training."},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"The title requires some translation: by \\"a safe birth,\\" the authors mean \\"safe from the interference of doctors and nurses,\\" and by \\"the childbirth experience you want,\\" they mean childbirth with a minimum of interference from doctors or nurses, which they claim is the way most women want it. If you already know that's what you want, this book may seem a bracing pep talk on how to talk back to the medical establishment. However, if you're either unsure how you feel or, worse, if you actually think you'd like some medicinal pain relief during what's widely agreed to be the most painful experience in most women's lives, this book is not for you. I'm not sure how they selected the women they surveyed on birth preferences, but considering that they quoted only about 1 woman who actually wanted drugs rather than having them forced upon her by evil doctors, I have my doubts about their selection methods. In my own experience, I have yet to come upon a woman who got the sort of athletic satisfaction out of the unmitigated pain of labor that seems so common among their interviewees. Most of the women I know seem to think pain hurts, and it'd be nice to have less of it.The authors claim that interventions by doctors (all sorts of pain medications, inducing labor, episiotomy, and especially caesarean sections) only make childbirth more dangerous for both mother and baby. This seems highly dubious to me, because far more women and babies died during childbirth before these techniques were invented. They back up all their conclusions by citing scientific studies, but neither of them is a scientist, a doctor, a nurse, a public health specialist, an epidemiologist, or a midwife, so I doubt they really have the qualification to do the kind of scientific analysis of birth technologies that they claim to be doing, and I strongly suspect them of cherry-picking studies that support their ideological convictions and ignoring evidence to the contrary.In addition, a book written in 1992 about childbirth choices is likely to be completely outdated for women giving birth in the age of Damaged Care, I mean Managed Care. To give you a hint of the problem, while the authors mention HMOs, they feel the need to define the term. The health care world has changed, and many of the options they describe may not be options any more."},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"This book was full of mis-information about pregnancy and birth. The author used &quot;facts&quot; from unrelated scientific studies as &quot;proof&quot; of her arguments regarding obstetrics. The author is trying to scare readers into following her own narrow birthing philosophy."},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"My wife thought the book was so funny she nearly went into labor prematurely laughing so hard. I am kidding about the labor part, but she literally could not read passages aloud to me because she couldn't stop laughing. This book is nonsensical, so long as it isn't taken seriously. The authors attempt to create an alternative reality, complete with lingo, which sounds good, feels good, and has no pertinence in the reality which we all actually share. Hopefully no one will get hurt in their construct. Please don't bother."},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"The birth of my first son did not go as I had wished, it ended up being an overly medicalized affair. I thought I had read enough and educated myself enough but I was wrong. I wanted a second child but was more scared of childbirth after having gone through that bad experience. Knowing there had to be a better way, I began reading more books. I read a dozen books before and during my second pregnancy. Each book had a different twist and something to learn from. These authors make bold statements regarding childbirth issues, compared with some of the popular mainstream childbirth books. But just when I was thinking that maybe they were wrong, they cited a reference. Everything these authors state is backed up by references and is credible. The reference section that lists these studies is 34 pages long! There is a very detailed index, which is helpful.One unique feature this book has is a wonderful chapter on why OB/GYN physicians do what they do. It is explained in detail how the training of an OB is medical in nature, that they are trained to look for and solve medical problems and that they are surgeons by training. This was the only book that really explains in detail why a midwife and an OB have different attitudes toward pregnancy (a medical event vs. a normal life process for a woman). The authors don't doctor-bash, but are very clear about why things happen the way they do in a hospital setting and/or with an OB as the health care provider.For those interested in home birth, it is discussed and cited as the most safe for both mother and baby, and the references are there (for anyone who doubts that issue).This book was so full of good information that I ended up highlighting many passages, which I usually never do (as I want to keep my books clean). To get the birth that one desires, one must know much of this information before beginning care with a health care provider. I urge anyone considering pregnancy to research the childbirth issue in the beginning. The chapter on controlling the progress of labor and pain relief is very enlightening and should be mandatory reading for all pregnant women. In the end I realized that we have to advocate for our own healthcare, by choosing a provider whom we trust and who shares the same concepts on pregnancy, labor and delivery. This book covers topics such as what your options for birth are, different types of health care providers, different types of birth settings, OB training and belief system, how to find a provider, questions to ask your provider and hospital, cesareans: why they are popular and when are they medically necessary?, getting support, the nurses role, childbirth support, doulas, and the woman's emotions. The overall tone of the book is positive and &quot;matter of fact&quot;.Oh, and in the end I had the birth I wanted, a normal birth in a hospital setting, with no interventions at all, attended by my midwife, my doula, my husband, and I delivered a healthy 11 lb. 11 oz. baby boy!"},{"Title":"Good Birth, a Safe Birth, A","review":"My wife and I have read this book multiple times and recommend it to everyone we know who is pregnant.In fact the reason we came to amazon.com today was to order some more copies to hand out to our friends.Most people know more about choices to make when buying a car than they do when having a baby.

It opened a whole new world for me in terms of birthing since none of my friends or family would even think of having a birth outside the hospital/OBGYN scene. The basic premise is that birth is a natural process and should be treated as such unless there is a medical emergency. It gives you information regarding why hospitals/nurses/Dr's do the things they do and why that may or may not be good for you.

The book is not for everyone--just those who are confident in taking control of their health care and beyond. To me, information is power--it separates me from the many mothers who are content in going along with what everyone else is doing. Having the birthing experience you want takes work, time, and research. The proof is in the pudding--I had healthy baby after a noninvasive, natural childbirth with a certified nurse midwife &amp; doula at a hospital. How many mothers say that childbirth was one of the most empowering experience of their life? I do!

Anyone who claims that this book is 'unbiased', however, is sadly mistaken! The overwhelming tone of the book is 'hospitals and doctors are evil and must be destroyed'. I agree that the medical establishment intervenes too much in a natural process, but the bashing gets to be a bit much. Also, I found that much of the book's assertions are based on studies from the 1960's and 1970's...I'd like to see something a little more current. A lot can change in 30-40 years!!

Some historians supported this new notion with tendentious misreadings of history, but others of a more empirical bent began to undertake histories that looked beyond the old narratives of individual nation states and focused instead the commonalities of conquest and colonization in the Americas and Africa as practiced by Westerners.Bailyn dicusses the \\"contours\\" of Atlantic history by outlining the discipline's key findings, elucidating its key ideas, citing its indispensible texts, and historic techniques such as statistical investigations, e.g., the construction of a slave trade database compiled from actual records which demonstrate how the slave system served to underwrite the entire system of trade in the \\"inland sea\\" of the Atlantic. For the amateur historian, and perhaps even for the professional, Bailyn's \\"Notes\\" section is exceedingly useful as it offers a rich survey of the most important texts that have emerged in this rich and rapidly expanding field of study.Here are a couple of exemplary passages from the book. \\"In its first, original phase Atlantic history in the broadest sense is the story of the creation of a vast new marchland of European civilization, an ill-defined, irregular outer borderland, thrust into the world of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere and in the outer reaches of the British archipelago. Life in this contested marchland was, literally, barbarous: that is in its initial stages it was, in large areas, a scene of conflict with alien people, alien in language and mores, hostile in purpose, savage and uncultivated. Europeans, native Americans and displaced Africans, all -- each from their own point of view -- saw it that way. For all, others were intent on destroying the civility -- European, native American, African -- that had once existed. Latin America, to paraphrase John Elliott, was no wilderness; the conquest made it that.\\" Page 63.Bailyn's notes the barbarity of the conquerors did not vary by religious conviction or national origin. \\"Puritan New England was not different from Mexico or Peru. '\\"It was a fearful sight,\\"' the pious gentle Pilgrim leader William Bradford wrote of New England's Pequot War (1637), \\"'to see [the Indians] frying in the fire and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the stink and scent thereof.'\\" Page 65. Indeed the Dutch and English conquerors read accounts of the Spanish conquistadors and were more than familiar with their techniques. The Dutch, having been subjects of Spain, may have been less frequently cruel in their dealings with native peoples than others, but were capable of exceeding cruelty. For instance, Dutch soldiers in a raid near New Amsterdam cut some of the native children in pieces \\"before the eyes of their parents, and threw the pieces thrown into the fire or into the water.\\" Pg. 63. Clearly, the Spanish were not the only conquistadors.I don't mean to give the impression that Bailyn speaks only of the barbarous first or conquest phase, he also does a admirable summary of the colonial phase. Once the domination of indigenous people's was relatively complete, the colonists and those who stayed at home in Europe profited mightily from the slave trade: the labor system that wove together, for instance, the economic lives of New England farmers who sold their agricultural products to the slave masters in the Caribbean, so that they could buy fine lace and fine wine and other items from Europe and so keep maintain the appearance of civility. Labor for the sugar, rice, tobacco and cotton plantations came primarily from West Africa, but was also supplied by the exportation of the many dispossessed, conquered and persecuted people in England, Ireland, Germany, France and elsewhere in Europe. Athouigh Bailyn doesn't say it explicity, the economic imperatives of globalization have been around for a long, long time.I don't mean to suggest that Bailyn concentrates only on the most barbarous elements of Atlantic history. He offers insight into how certain cultural aspects drove and supported this vast, complex process. Quakers are, for instance, a paramount example of a tightly knit but far-flung commmunity who profited mightily in the chaotic marketplace of that time both because of the bonds of trust forged in their communal worship, and also and because there were Quakers at every entrepot in the system, relaying intelligence on the fluctuating prices of slaves, sugar, rum, tobacco, whale oil, etc. As Bailyn notes, black markets, corruption, bribery existed side by side with \\"official trade\\" and so it best served those who could outwit the authorities, or those authorities who could actually enforce their authority. Ideas flowed as well, ideas of liberation, revolt and democracy. Bolivar, son of a wealthy planter, educated in Europe, knew of Montesqieu, Madison, Jefferson and Rousseau -- not unusual for a member of the Atlantic elite.A marvelous work of tremendous reach and scholarly erudition packed into just a weekend's reading, \\"Atlantic History\\" takes stock of this new current of historical research and points presciently toward the new directions it may take."},{"Title":"Atlantic History: Concept and Contours","review":"This slim book is a work about the history of Atlantic History, broken into two parts. The first part deals with the history of the subdiscipline. The second part presents a condensed history of what was going on in the Atlantic during the era (circa 1500s-1800) that Atlantic historians tend to study. To anyone new to the idea of Atlantic History, the first essay, essentially a historiographical essay, would be very helpful. While not an exhaustive historiography, Bailyn does discuss the founding of Atlantic History as a subdiscipline as well as mention some of the major authors and works. Interestingly, the origins of Atlantic History come not from a historian, but rather journalist Walter Lippman is widely regarded as the founder. As early as 1917, Lippman was pushing for an Atlantic \\"community\\" and his cause was picked up after World War II and can be seen in such organizations as NATO, largely as a bulwark against the Communist East. Bailyn argues that the historians who picked up on the theme of an Atlantic community or civilization were not active proponents of Cold War ideology, but that seems hard to prove across the board. At any rate, Atlantic History was born and scholars who took up the cause argued that Atlantic civilization was unique due to common economic and institutional structures and cultural life, interior ocean, and colonization via maritime routes, which led to a distinctive political world. The acculturation with the native population was also different than European dealings with Asia and helped lead to the distinctiveness of this region.The second essay brings out three themes of the subdiscipline. The first theme is the lawless nature of the points in the Atlantic world where encounters occurred. Bailyn argues that rather than a specific people, all parties (Europeans, Americans, and Africans) involved were barbarous, especially early on, and this gave the region a specific character. The second theme is that of connections. Atlantic historians point to the interconnectedness of the region economically, socially, culturally, politically, and demographically. The third theme is that the Atlantic emerged from Enlightenment thinking. Enlightenment ideas bound the region together while also making it distinct.The only major flaw I found with this work was that it seemed to focus mainly on Europe and the Americas while devoting little attention to Africa or the Caribbean. My understanding is that there are Atlantic historians who study the history of Africa and the Caribbean, but based on Bailyn's work one must assume that is still a small part of the overall historiography. That is a shame as that seems to be one area where Atlantic History could teach us new things.This is a useful book for a few reasons. It is easy to read and therefore accessible to someone who knows little about Atlantic History. It provides a nice, albeit broad, overview on the origins of the study of the Atlantic world. I think many people would find it interesting how historians took an essentially political movement to unify the Atlantic region due to the Cold War and ran with it, attempting to document the historical foundation of Atlantic civilization. Finally, the introduction of the themes that Atlantic historians have written about and studied thus far provides a good framework for the novice to see what the subdiscipline has been up to. Based on the size of the book, you know that this is not a complete introduction to the subject, but it provides a starting point."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"As true Laura and/or Rose fans know, \\"Bachelor Girl\\" is simply a redress of Roger MacBride's 1977 \\"biography\\" of Rose Wilder Lane, which in turn was a rip-off of Roses's 1919 'semi' autobiographical novel, \\"Diverging Roads\\".I feel this was a poor finish to the \\"Rose Years\\" series. Given that the MacBride family inherited the hugely successful and profitable \\"Little House\\" franchise from Rose, it's a shame that they've passed off this fictional account not once, but TWICE, as a true depiction of Rose's life as a young woman.While the essentials and facts are mostly true, anyone who has read or researched Rose's life knows that Rose and Paul Cooley were never \\"engaged\\". And Gilette Lane was not the \\"dashing older man\\" portrayed in the books. In fact, he was one year younger than Rose! Evidence supports that they met while Rose was working in Kansas City and her subsequent move to San Francisco was likely to follow him there, marrying him the next year, BEFORE they sold real estate together.My disgust with this book really lies in the fact that the owners of the Little House franchise (the MacBride heirs) should have shown more respect for both Rose and the fans of the series and ended the Rose years with a more accurate and honest portrayal of their benefactress.The spunky characterization of Rose from the earlier books is gone here, and we're left feeling concerned about her choices and future. Nice example to set for girls of today who've read this series from the beginning!"},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I have been disappointed with the entire Rose series, but particularly this book. I've been reading the series along with my daughter, but I doubt if either of us would bother if we weren't looking for answers to 'what happened next' to Laura and Almanzo. If this is a true picture of Rose's life and personality, then I am very sorry for her. She spends most of her time bored, discontented and depressed; she sees her parents as hopelessly outdated and old-fashioned; she chooses, time and again, to do things her parents disapprove of, then does not seem to learn from the misery those choices cause to herself and others.I find little of the independent spirit of Laura in this book. For example, upon returning home after a school year in New Orleans where she became interested in social issues, Rose laments that her peers in Mansfield seem to care nothing about those issues. But Rose does nothing to educate the others or even express her newfound views. After moving to Kansas City (to attend a telegraph course at her parents' expense, which she applied for in secret), Rose finds a decent room to live in, only to abandon it meekly when an overbearing acquaintance of her mother's demands that she must move. When she confronts her boss, asking that he make good on his promise to give her a raise, she dissolves into tears and leaves the office when he refuses. Spunky? Independent? I don't see it.She moves to San Francisco, where she moves in with the first friendly girl who speaks to her, and soon joins a 'fast' life of driving, dancing, and drinking till all hours of the morning. Though MacBride throws in a few token statements of Rose's supposed better sense, Rose's actions speak the loudest. \\"This life...., wasn't for her, she knew. But it would do until she got a better idea.\\" The problem is, she never gets a better idea.Even the ending, with its promise of a new start for Rose, falls upon her by circumstance, not by any action or gumption of her own.Though written in easy-to-read format, the subject matter of this book is adult in nature and will leave younger readers far behind. The characters and motivations are thin. I think readers could find far better descriptions of bachelor-girl life in San Francisco in this period in history than this disappointing effort."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"This is an indirect copy of a fictional serial Rose wrote around 1918-1920: \\"Diverging Roads.\\" It was republished by Roger Lea MacBride as \\"Rose Wilder Lane: Her Story,\\" back in the 1970's. Unfortunately, it WASN'T her story: after giving the book that misleading title, MacBride explains in the introduction that many details were changed from Rose's real life. I compare this pitiful effort to William Holtz's staggering portrayal of Rose, and it is obvious which of these two men had more scholarly respect for Rose Wilder Lane. Even though I do not agree with many of Mr. Holtz's conclusions about Rose and her relationship with her mother, his work is fully researched, the information sound. The same cannot possibly be said about MacBride's attempts to pass off fiction as fact.In the serial, here's what eventually happened to Helen (Rose's character): she doesn't marry, but joins forces with other women who are writers/journalists, and realizes that she wants a life of freedom and independence. That part was never published by MacBride, and I have often wondered why that was so. I personally don't understand why the \\"Rocky Ridge\\" series ended in such an adult fashion. MacBride could have concluded with Rose traveling to Kansas City to pursue a new career; Rose ended her book \\"Old Home Town\\" that way, with her character Ernestine (a young Rose in disguise) going off to business college to learn happily ever after. But no, it is much easier to copy Rose's original text than it is to come up with your own. Yes, I realize MacBride may have already passed on by the time this volume was approached, but anyone with background information on Rose and half an imagination could have finished the series with more success. Actually, that goes for the whole set of books, not just this one."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"If anyone out there has hesitated to read the Rose Wilder Lane entries into the extended Little House family as they felt as I once did they would be pale copies of the original series, please don't hesitate any longer! This series has a voice of its own, and is very, very well written. I wish it was longer. I loved this last book. Rose is very different than Laura and in fact I think most women of her day. She is very strong willed and intelligent, and determined to make her own way in the world. I was especially struck by the descriptions of the early day of her life both in Kansas City and San Francisco---just how lonely and desolate life could be for a career girl starting out in those days, and how strong she was to persevere. Her growing awareness in this book that the life she always saw for herself---as a contented wife to Paul in a small world---is not really what she wants is very well done. The message sent to girls who might read this book is powerful. I also very much liked the way this series &quot;grew up&quot; like the original series. This last book is quite adult, though certainly not inappropriate for those who also read the early ones."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"&quot;Bachelor Girl&quot; was a nice closing episode to the 'Rose' series of books. It was a well-chosen ending place to the story as Rose clearly is leaving the child world and entering that of the adult at the end.The 'Rose' series, overall, makes a nice compliment to the original 'Laura' series--not as good, mind you, but a decent sequel. The series starts off a bit slow and uneventfully, but picks up in the later books. I'd recommend them to young readers who've read the 'Laura' books and want more of the story. They don't have, and won't give, the same historical sense as the original series, however, as they lack that element of first-hand flavor Laura was able to give to an era she actually lived through.Now the nit-picking critique...I found myself questioning the portrayal of Rose's personality in this 8th book. In the previous books she'd been pridefully, almost arrogantly, confident in her intelligence and educational achievements. Though she hadn't socialized well with kids her age she had been bold and out-going in other ways (dating a college man, etc.). Now, grownup and on her own, Rose is suddenly shy and uncertain, letting herself be trod upon and looked down upon. And tell me, would a girl who had managed to learn fluent Latin in less than a year have to look up the definition of &quot;inhibitions&quot;? Laura, even when she was being a proper young lady, always held onto her inner rebelliousness--Rose's seems to have been nearly snuffed out in most of this book.I also wondered about her sudden interest in being a housewife. Flirting with the idea of playing house with Paul could have worked better if it had been clearly battling inside her with her desire for independence. The entire Paul relationship was not quite as deftly worked as it could have been. Its resolution was foreshadowed in a clunky, predictable way. It was interesting to meet Rose's future husband (and future ex-husband), Gillette Lane. He was not fully fleshed out as a character, but one could see how he would both fascinate her with his flash and style and, regrettably, the traits that could make the relationship fall apart later.Oddly, San Francisco didn't come to life in the story. A curious omission was the cable cars. I never quite felt I could place her within the City even though several specific places were mentioned (including places where the, mentioned, street cars would have been cable cars). The atmosphere was missing.Something I would have liked to have seen hints of was Rose's future career as a journalist. Though she wrote many letters (were these historically authentic? ), the inclination to a writing career didn't come through.Though these books were written as children's or young adult's stories--fiction based on fact-- I would dearly have loved to have seen an &quot;historical notes&quot; section at the end."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"A great ending to a great pioneer series. Rose has grown up within our eyes as we were first introduced to her life in 1993.It saddens me that Roger Lea MacBride is no longer with us to write more stories of Rose's life. It seems I grew up with her within the past 8 years, reading of her time of life and her thoughts about life. What also saddens me the most about reading this book was the aftermath of Rose's and Paul's relationship.Therefore, Rose had followed her heart thoughout her hardships which only made her a stronger person. Like her mother Laura, her life touched us all."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"The writing style is completely different than the other books. At times it reads like what I would imagine a Harlequin Romance would be like. The book is just dreadful and completely inappropriate for the target market, i.e., girls from 6 - 12. As other reviewers have stated (thorvald's and RoseFan's take below are spot on), Rose is no longer the self confident heroine but a confused follower. She falls in with the wrong crowd. I guess a parent who is reading along with their daughter could use this as a learning lesson, but the subject is too adult for the bedtime story age child. I suggest you avoid this book."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"Although I was interested to read about this part of Rose's life, this volume wasn't as well written as the rest of the series (it was published after Roger Lea McBride's death and may not have been fully completed by him). It reads a little strangely (especially because it is written at an easy-read level but covers an adult period of her life) and sadly ends fairly abruptly, too, at a major turning point for Rose.To read more about Rose's life, try \\"West from Home : Letters of Laura Ingalls Wilder, San Francisco 1915,\\" which tells you what Rose was doing nine years after the end of this book and how things turned out for her."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"Roger Lea MacBride unfortunately died before he could complete the Rose series, and whomever Harper tapped to do the ghost-writing did an utterly awful job. I seriously cannot understand why they put Mr. MacBride's name on the cover -- this book is so utterly devoid of his authorship. Language, dialogue, character development are all completely opposite of Mr. MacBride's style.Worse, Rose's character is continuously maligned. She rejects her roots, her morality, her own intelligence and good sense.And in terms of this being a book for girls -- never! The book gives practical instructions for how to learn to drink alcohol, stay out all night partying, and deal with low self esteem by wearing racy styles and flirting. Rose's highly moral fiance is treated with contempt and presented as a foolish and selfish, while the careless, money-grubbing rival wins out in the end. Roger Lea MacBride, Rose Wilder Lane and Laura Ingalls Wilder would be spinning in their graves.The first four books of this series are very well done, but don't bother with this trash."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"This is an amazingly relevant portrait of a young woman striking out on her own at a time when young women were expected either to marry or stay at home and become old maids. Like her mother, Laura, Rose was a pioneer but in this case an urban pioneer seeking her own identity in a world that was often hostile toward ambitious women. I highly recommend this to adults as well as young adults, and the earlier books which are a living history lesson in life a century ago. Read &quot;New Dawn on Rocky Ridge&quot; for a devastatingly beautiful portrait of the death of Pa Ingalls in Laura's arms."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"It seems that happiness eluded Rose.Considering the other \\"Rose\\" books, this final book was far too short. Personally I would have liked it better if the author had written on about Rose leaving to go with Gillette Lane in the real estate venture. I'm one of those people who doesn't like to be left in the dark.I read \\"From West to Home\\" a book composed of letters Laura wrote to Almanzo from San Francisco. From this book, we learn Laura visited Rose and Rose's husband Gil Lane in 1915. So we know Rose and Gil got married.But actually it would have been better if Bachelor Girl had been longer or even another \\"Rose\\" book had been written.I thought Paul was awful to Rose. He strung her along for so long and then left her to cope with the \\"damage\\" to her reputation and her character after she and Paul stayed out all night. It wasn't their fault the boat was late or slow, but people who knew her in town assumed she was trash after that and basically let her know what they thought.Later in San Francisco, Paul visited Rose and stung her with a remark about her wearing makeup and went wild over Rose's remark about an egagement ring.This book is entertaining, but I couldn't help wishing for a longer read."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"Thoroughly charming, but rushed at the end. Having read a previous volume written by Mr. McBride, I realize, however, Rose's life quickly becomes more adult, and thus, less appealing for children. She is just as fascinating as her mother."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"My complaint is that they should've gone on with Rose's life! I mean, they should've talked about her marriage to that man who abandonded her, they should've mentioned about how he left all alone in California in huge debt and how she paid it off by using her smarts to sell off land and other things! They left the book off at a sad part where she never married Paul, and that left reader so anguished over that. They should've really made another book or two that talked about her struggles and her triumphs. That was a pathetic ending to this series because it only showed the begining of her life! She had so much more happen to her, and maybe it would've been less heart-breaking for me if they shown what she did and how she learned lessons after she left Paul. But in that book all I was left think was of how stupid Rose was. She was very foolish, really. I wouldn've been happier if they had been more closer to the real truth, and shown more of what happened to her later. It really left you at a hanger. This series could've and should've been longer."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"My daughter is a true lover of little house series and she reads it over and over again. But for this book, she just read it once and never touch it again. The other Rose's stories are rich in details, full of description, and going slow time wise, giving a complete picture about Rose's life. \\"Bachelor Girl\\" seems to be in rush to just end the series, it's not as beautifully written as the others. Rose's thinking and minds are not completely told."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I've read most of the rose years. The books before this one are interesting. In this last book, I was very displeased. Rose leaves home and boards in a small isolated room which leaves her with no friends. Although she makes friends towards the end, she ends up doing things she shouldn't and loses her engagment with her childhood sweetheart because of her new friends. This book was a disappointment to me after enjoying the books before this. :("},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I think \\" bachelor girl\\" is excellent. It manages to portray an young adult's frustrations and dilemas almost accurately.The way Rose felt frustrated about not doing anything useful, when she lived with her parents and then her struggle to work and support herself...May be this book is not appealing to children as it deals mostly with an young adult's mind...and even the temporary loss of confidence in Rose is perfectly natural as any young and intellectual adult will go through that phase atleast once. I'm very impressed with this book."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I read the Rose series out loud with my 9 year old and it was wonderful. Rose is a grown woman in this volume,and you really feel for her when she experiences hardships and heartbreaks. Knowing how she was a &#34;founding mother&#34; of the Libertarian party made this book all that more interesting because she was promoting socialist causes at this point in her life."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"This is the best in the Rose series. Finally we find out what happens to her although the ending is not clear. A very good look into the time period with some surprises and a look into Rose's wild side."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I was a HUGE fan of the Laura Ingalls Wilder series so I started to read Rose's series too. I fell in love with them as I did for the other series. It came down to this book. I bought it as soon as I could and started reading it the second I got it. It was amazing, like the others... until the middle-end. My heart stopped beating when she talked to Paul. I don't want to say too much to give any part of it away, but I cried toward the end when Rose and Paul talked. I was upset for days after I read it. Maybe I just had high hopes. Some people may be fine with the way it ended, but I was not. I haven't picked up the book since then - that was 2 years ago. Don't get me wrong, it was written beautifully, carrying on with the series perfectly. I just didn't like the ending."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Bachelor Girl&quot;. Even though it is the last book of the Rose series, I feel that the story could go on longer, but it had to end sometime I guess. Rose even met her future husband Gillette Lane in this book. He had hazel eyes like I do. At first it seemed that he must have been coming on too strong for Rose, but later on she felt(I think)that she loved him. As for the other adventures in this book, the woman that she was livng with, I thought was trying to interfere with Rose's life. Rose finally decided to leave Kansas City and arrived in San Francisco."},{"Title":"Bachelor Girl (Little House the Rose Years)","review":"This has been a great series, but it ends just when it's about to get really interesting. Although most people know Rose Wilder Lane only as Laura Ingalls Wilder's daughter, she's far more interesting in her own right. Rose became a well-known author, traveled all over the world, was briefly a Communist but was disillusioned by her trip to Soviet Russia, and eventually decided that the only revlution worth caring about was not the Russian Revolution but the American Revolution. She finally became a free-market anarchist and a major influence on the 20th-century libertarian movement. Her best nonfiction books are _The Discovery of Freedom_, _Give Me Liberty_, and _The Lady and the Tycoon_. (Tragically, all but the first are out of print, I believe.) She was a great fighter for liberty, and an incredibly delightful prose stylist, with a sharp mind and a sharp tongue. One of my favorite quotes from RWL (as her fans call her): &quot;On Patriotism: I do not go into rhapsodies about \`my country,' its rocks and rills, its super highways and wooded hills.... This whole world is almost unbearably beautiful; why should I love Oak Creek Canyon or California's beaches or Washington's Sea Island counties any more than the Bocca di Cattaro or Delphi or the Bosphorus? Because *I*, me, the great RWL, was born in the Dakota Territory? The logic seems weak, somehow, don't you feel? My attachment to these USA is wholly, entirely, absolutely to The Revolution, the real world revolution, which men began here and which has -- so to speak -- a foothold on earth here. If reactionaries succeed in destroying the revolutionary structure of social and political human life here, I care no more about this continent than about any other. If I lived long enough I would find and join the revival of the Revolution wherever it might be in Africa or Asia or Europe, the Arctic or Antarctic. And let this country go with all the other regimes that collectivism has wrecked and eliminated since history began.
