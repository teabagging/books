I couldn't believe the story was a fiction, however it taught me my own culture which I never knew or thought about.As I read along, I could relate myself to Sayuri. Even though I am here in US, I still live with Japanese culture when I have a dinner with Japanese men. We, as women, are still expected to serve drinks to them. To have witty conversation is considerably good not only your daily routine work. Followed by Karaoke is often required after dinner. In 90's, an ordinary girl entertains men. You can see a scene like this anywhere whether if it's in NY or Tokyo. The culture didn't change, but the players.The book was written so poetic as if Sayuri was really telling her story. Her pain, feelings and emotions were so real, I almost could feel it for myself. It also well described how seniors petrify juniors such as Hatsumomo's meanness towards Sayuri. Every details w! as so familiar to me.The book definitely gave me an inspiration and confirm my own identity. I still cannot get over the fact that Sayuri was a fictional figure, but I am glad the book was written and widely read to many Americans and/or Westerners to have better understanding of Geisha and Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a wonderfully unique reading that kept me on edge most of the time. The subject matter as well as the history left me hungry for more. Already head first into Eastern literature this was certainly a tantilizing taste (even if it did come from a Westerner). What does this say to us feminists? How accurate is this, I ask myself?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book after I got into it, but it started kind of slow. For anyone interested in how a Geisha lived in Japan during the 30's and 40's, this book really gives you the flavor of that lifestyle. The ending was quite abrupt and unexpected, but overall a book worth reading. Hard to believe it was written by an American male."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The life of Sayuri as a geisha in Japan could have been told in a more efficient and effective manner. I felt that the story had been &quot;padded&quot; to lengthen the book, dragging out seemingly insignificant happenings that did nothing to enhance the story. However, I did learn more about the Japanese and their ideas regarding the place of women in their culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.

But looking back I find in interesting that almost all the women are portrayed as without human concern for each other, and in the end we find that it was the male &quot;Chairman&quot; that saved Sayuri. So it becomes the typical Western Cinderella story. Even the kind Mameha was only acting on the Chairman's behalf."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Couldn't put it down!!!

Bravo, Arthur Golden!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I saw nothing particularly remarkable in the fact that this book was written by a man. Male authors have successfully written female protagonists for centuries. The reverse is also true. I was also astounded by the reader who was so surprised that anyone could write so convincingly about geisha. It's called research. I've read numerous books on geisha, therefore for me there was nothing especially new in the subject matter. What I particularly enjoyed were the individual characters. I did not find them shallow, but rather subtle. I was not disappointed by the ending - under the guise of a memoir - a geisha would not find it appropriate to divulge all the details of her private life with her beloved danna, and if I remember correctly, the character says as much. I was left with a slight feeling of bitterness - a feeling that even though Sayuri had found the love she'd hoped for, life unfolded slowly, and satisfactorily, rather than ecstatically. I believe that this is realistic, and nothing resembling what one finds in romance novels (which I abhor). I rate this book a 9 rather than a 10, simply because I don't feel it will be everyone's cup of tea. Green tea."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought this was an interesting read and really opened up my eyes to this aspect of Japanese culture. I felt really sad for the geisha girls. How horrible to be trapped in a lifestyle that devalues you as a human being and treats you like a trained animal. They glory in their physical beauty, but their souls whither within. And to be forced to give your first sexual experience to the pervert with the most money rather than to a man who cherishes you is really sickening. Geisha life is nothing more than glorified child abuse. This book will intrigue and disturb you with it's injustices."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading and hearing rave reviews about Memoirs of a Geisha, I couldn't wait to read it. For the first hundred or so pages, I found the book fascinating, but the story and the characters never developed in any gripping, three-dimensional way. I do give Golden credit for his detail and verisimilitude. Yet he never really enters the minds of the main characters. Plus the constant metaphors became tedious."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Usually, when I read a great book, I give it to someone else to enjoy, but &quot;Memoirs...&quot; is staying on my bookshelf and nobody's getting it.

I felt so much emotion for Sayuri and Mameha and that *@##*@@, Hatsumomo, that even after I read it thoughts of them would go through my head as if they were people I really knew!!

It is the story of a young Japanese girl who is innocently and unknowingly thrust into the secretive world of the Geisha.

The author manages to hook you from the onset and although you are emersed in historical events, you are transported by the easy and excellent read. Fortunately for me, there is a shop off the plaza in Santa Fe, that had a full kimono on view - they really are as long as the book described and as lovely!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This well written book is a compelling read. The author's communication of a geisha's emotions throughout her life seemed honest and believable -- quite remarkable in a work of fiction where the main character's experiences would seem to have little resemblance to actual experiences of the author."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The voice of Sayuri captivates me right from the beginning of the book. The poignancy of the tale of an innocent girl sucked into a world that is totally alien is touching but well written so that it does not become melodramatic. Sayuri's courage to face her adversaries and her quiet acceptance of her destiny is remarkable. I empathise with her, cry and laugh at her sometimes funny annecdotes of the men she meets and her acute observations of life. Golden could have done better during the wars years by giving us greater insights into the bombing of Hiroshima for instance. The war that spanned over four years seems too short and surely there is a lot more suffering than what is potrayed. The ending too is a bit disappointing, it reads more like a Harlequin romance. But the last paragraph did echo the sentiments of the first half of the book. Thank you for the good read !"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden ably exemplifies that one needn't be either a woman, or Japanese to capture the life of a Geisha. What a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was like meeting a dear friend and be entrusted into the confidences of her struggles and history that brought her to the person she is.

I could hardly put it down and was sorry when it ended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden transports us into a culture few of us will ever truly understand in his debut novel. Impressive in its detail, Golden's greatest literary accomplishment is his ability to transform complex social situations into complete understanding and appreciation for a foreign culture.We learn, along with young Chiyo, the ins and outs of Japanese Geisha culture; the dos and donts, those with whom it is auspicious to associate, and the price at which anything, including one's innocence, may be sold.This is a must-read for those who have an interest in understanding other cultures.

Since English is my second lauguage, I thought it would be harder to read this in English. But I was totally wrong about it. Probably helped much by being Japanese and having knowledge and concept of old Japanese society, I didn't have any trouble to imagine the world the author tried to explain. As Japanese, I think this book is so impressive, fascinating, and very well-written based on thorough research. This book is enjoyable from the beginning to the end. I edmire the author's effort on his studies and research, and this is truly worth reading even to Japanese people!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There's nothing I can say that could possibly add to all the positive reviews this book has received. This memoir, so poetically and beautifully written, takes you back to the geisha times, and does so in such a way that you could actually see, taste, and feel the narrator's feelings. From the first page to the last, I was hooked on every word. What shocked me the most, was the fact that this was written by and American man! The voice is so authentic, details so vivid, you would swear this was written by a genuine geisha. I highly recommend exploring this geisha subculture, I found it totally intriguing."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So well done is the first-person narrative of this book, that it is hard to believe it was written by a man, and a American Caucasian man at that. It is the story of a young girl who is sold to a geisha house at the age of nine. The reader is plunged into her world, following her life through the 1930s, when there were more than 800 geishas in the city of Kyoto, through the war, and right up to today.I identified with her completely, felt her pain at her abandonment, her attempt to run away, her struggle to adapt, her innocence of what is expected of her, and the fierce competition and cruelty of the other geishas. The details of her training are fascinating -- from the way she learns to pour tea and expose just the inside of her wrist as a way of flirting -- to the discomfort of sleeping in the elaborate waxed hairdos.Her story is told simply, in a clear authentic voice. But it goes deep into what it is to be Japanese and live in a world where every movement is structured. My understanding of Japan was deepened as I got right into the skin of the characters.I read the book slowly on purpose because I just didn't want it to end, and I found myself thinking about it all the time. Don't miss the joy of reading it. I give it my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I imagine most men would be reluctant to buy, let alone read, this book because on the surface it appears to be &quot;a woman's book&quot;. Well gents, get over it. Don't deprive yourself any longer!I read Memoirs of a Geisha because I lived in Japan for a number of years and, well, it's unusual to find a mainstream novel involving that country (or its people). But I didn't expect much. Well, the book was simply great. The novel just oozes with the feeling(/taste/smell) of Japan. Read the other reviews for further accolades. However I can't find the words to describe how well the author succeeds in transporting the reader to mid-20th century Japan.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? The author fails to fully develop some characters, which becomes increasing evident towards the end of the novel. If it weren't for this I think Geisha could easily become a modern classic by anyone's standards....and I can't wait until they make it into a movie!(PS - other great books involving Japan include Spring Snow and The Sound of the Waves, both by Mishima.)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel immensly. Definatly provides a cultural insight into Japanese traditions. I found it interesting that a Westerner could depict the feelings of a young geisha (who is forced into the trade) with such precision. A very captivating book which makes you fume with rage at some of the injustice that Sayuri &lt;--(I'm not sure if I spelt that right) has to tolerate. While in the process of reading it I thought about nothing except getting back to the book until I finally finished it. Only after I reflected on the reality I was slightly perplexed. The ending seems unprobable and questionable - overall a good read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I do a lot of reading and this bestseller surpasses them all. Arthur Golden did a fine job of using intricate detail throughout the book.The way he fully describes the Kimonos they wear and the difficulty of doing the Geisha's hair and trying not to mess it up while sleeping gave me an appreciation for those women who chose that as a profession.If you like Japanese culture this book is definately one you should read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of the most compelling pieces of fiction masquerading -- and I mean, *truly* masquerading -- as non-fiction in some time. I admit, this piece was able to break through my cynicism and touch a very tender part of me. Often times, the story seemed so real, so vivid I had to double-check that, yes, indeed it is fiction.Of the work, I will say this: Deceptively rich and layered, this book succeeds in transporting me to another time and place in ways so few can."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I tend to be very weary of books that EVERYBODY love. Call me a snob. This book was different. From the second I read the first paragraph I could not put it down. Literally. I read it in one afternoon. I believe Golden captured the very essence of being a woman and being a Geisha. Not only did I feel like I was a part of the lives of the characters, I felt like she was telling her story only to me.

I think I'll keep this one in my collection."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is easy to read, and at times the prose is delicate and provocative. But ultimately, the thin characterizations (and absence of motivation for any of the characters), and our heroine's complete lack of an inner life--she goes through life with blinders on, never learning, never changing, never growing--damage this book. I never thought of our narrator as &quot;female&quot;; she seemed sexless, and she often reacted to things like a man. Arthur Golden, despite the reviews, failed to find a woman's voice and sensibility in which to tell his tale. I found &quot;Memoirs&quot; superficial and frustrating; I forced myself through to the contrived ending. Golden is an able enough writer; he's just shallow. We've all been duped by great reviews garnered because the subject matter is unusual and exotic.

I was amazed tha that whole world was much more than I had ever hoped to expect! I found the novel to be detailed without being monotonous, I found myself put under a spell of storytelling at it's best. I found the characters to be like none other. The stunning image of these persons stick out in my mind like a sore thumb. I could not help but be reminded of another novel that I had read (Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Childred&quot;) in where Rushdie's &quot;Saleem&quot; is like &quot;Sayuri&quot; in Golden's &quot;Memoirs&quot;. The idea of characters like these are a wonderfuld asset to stotytelling, and a relief in this day and age where it seems that alot of characters in alot of novels hold no mystery or depth.

I love to learn.I was surprised - and delighted - at the amount of personal detail Golden included in his intimate descriptions. This is what made Sayuri's story so believable, and it's what compelled me to keep the light on just a little longer every night.

By the end, I think every reader felt a little japanese, understanding motives and circumstances as someone japanese of that time period would have understood them.I actually stopped reading this book in the middle because I was looking for a more intense, nail biting book. But when more aptly in the mood, I picked it up again and read the rest of it in one sitting. It's nail biting in it's own way, I discovered, especially as you begin to not only sympathise with our main character but grow with her. The latter half of the book is even more engaging than the first."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't have read a more interesting book. I was never really interested in a Geisha story, but I was hooked as soon as I read the first page. This book had my attention when I read an article saying the book was going to be made into a movie. As soon as I saw the news, I frowned: \\"A movie about a geisha?\\" In my view, a geisha's life was nothing more than entertaining men.However, I was very curious; therefore, I picked up this book from the library, and started to read it. Well, I feel I have already watched a black and white movie about geisha Sayuri's life after I finished this book. This book is about her legendary life. Sayuri was a pretty girl with stunning blue-gray eyes. Her family was so poor and her father sold her and her sister to Okiya, one of the wealthiest Geisha house in the district of Gion in Kyoto. As soon as she was in Okyia, her torment began. Hatsumomo, a renowned and one of the most beautiful geishas started to give her a very hard time. She treated her like a serpent treats its next meal. Because of Sayuri's unusual beauty, Hatsumomo couldn't bear having her as a rival, in competing to become Okiya's adopted daughter.Fortunately, it was Sayuri's fate to become a prominent Geisha. An accomplished geisha named Memaha, approached her and summoned her to her apartment. From then on, Sayuri trained as an apprentice under Memaha, and the cruel war between Hatsumumu and Sayuri began. We see how Hatsumomo made Sayuri's life so difficult and desperate. When Saruyi almost lost hope of wining the struggle against Hatsumomo, she got help from Pumpkin who was Hatsumomo's geisha sister but who hated her for her vicious treatment of the other girls. Now it was the turning point for Sayuri. She and Memaha were able to prevail over Hatsumomo, and eventually drove her out of the Gion distract. In the meanwhile, Sayuri always fancied the man of childhood dreams - Chairman. But even though any other men fell for her, Chairman was the only one out of her reach...This book was beautifully and poetic written. I am sure Golden knows Japanese culture so well since the writing style, such as the dialogue and the passages expressing Sayuri's feelings are all so Asian! I don't have to do much searching to prove it. Here I just opened the book, randomly turned the pages, and picked the following dialogue between Memaha and Sayuri:Memaha said:\\" Waiting patiently doesn't suit you. I can see you have a great deal of water in your personality. Water never waits. It changes shape and flows around things, and finds the secret paths no one else has thought about - the tiny hole through the roof or the bottom of a box. There's no doubt it's the most versatile of the five elements. It can wash away earth; it can put out fire; it can wear a piece of metal down and sweep it away. Even wood, which is its natural complement, can't survive without being nurtured by water. And yet, you haven't drawn on those strengths in living your life, have you?\\"\\"Well, actually, ma'am, water flowing was what gave me the idea of escaping over the roof.\\"\\"I'm sure you're a clever girl, Chiyo, but I don't think that was your cleverest moment. Those of us with water in our personalities don't pick where we'll flow to. All we can do is flow where the landscape of our lives carries us.\\"\\"I suppose I'm like a river that has come up against a dam, and that dam is Hatsumomo.\\"\\"Yes, probably that's true,\\" she said, looking at me calmly. \\"But rivers sometimes wash dams away.\\"These Zen or Tao style dialogues can be found many times in the book. The way Golden wrote it has given it the feel of a true story. I think it's a book you can read again and again..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is not a bad novel, nor a poorly written one. The author's fascination with his subject matter and his extensive research are evident.

This sort of fantasy has humiliated Asian women inside and outside the US for many years and must be condemned.However it should be said that the book does an important service to the Western public by portraying geisha for what they are; treasured artists charged with carrying on the centuries-old tradition of ancient dance and music.

He describes her milieu to perfection. The reader is transported in time to Japan, from the year 1929 until the years following World War II. Golden portrays the desperation of the geisha to become successful. He also shows us the hard work, the political infighting and the scheming that are part of the &quot;game&quot;. This book has much to say about the horrible plight of a Japanese woman who depends on others for her livelihood. She has to become the person that others want her to be instead of expressing her own identity. It is heartbreaking.

I wish, however, this book had been entitled \\"Restless Hearts\\" (or something similar), as I then would have understood that what I was about to read was actually a romance novel with a \\"historical\\" setting. As to how accurate the novel is in portraying the lives of WWII-era Geisha, I cannot say, as I am neither Japanese, nor a Geisha, nor a WWII-era Japanese Geisha historian. But even assuming that Golden gets his history right, his book is still filled with two-dimensional characters, adolescent themes, and bad plot contrivances. I give it two stars because I enjoyed the writing style.

I'm into fantasy books, mostly, like Harry Potter. I've read memoirs like Rocket Boys. I've read fiction books that tell of some experience, but not like this. They all seemed so fake. I always ended up with the feeling that it couldn't happen in real life or that real life wasn't like this. Books that did seem real, had an element of fantasy that made me think-but wait, this doesn't exist. (Ella Enchanted, Harry Potter) Charles Dickens was too eighteen-hundreds. That didn't feel real either. The past is just as much fantastical as witches and wizards and unicorns. Even though this story took place in the 1930s, it feels so real. Just like it was happening to me. I loved the first person; I haven't read that many books in first person. This book, story, has an ethereal beauty and yet is so down to earth. It has a happy ending, even, that seems real. Arthur Golding has captured the way a human-being is and feels. It is simplicity in its simplest form, but more complex than even we, who are human beings, can imagine. The author has captured what nature meant us to be and who we are, though we may not realize we think complex thoughts in such a simple way. I went through two sleepless nights being Sayuri, for I could not keep this book down. Even when I was not reading the book, I was thinking about. Most stories, after they end, I wish to continue, but this book was so complete, I did not think once of what would happen next. There were no \\"holes\\", as I call them, in this world, because this world was not imaginged or created in a few years, but thousands, millions, billions. While I was being this book, just as in my life, the weight of the past, present,and future was weighing down on me along with the realization of how big and small was the world and universe i live in. This book really is that beautiful, and I'm only 14. No one actually thinks like Shakespeare; they think like this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I borrowed the book from a friend of mine whoose family bought it but never read it. Just a bit of background information regarding myself, I have been intretsted in the Japanese culture since day one. Maybe being partially Japanese is to blame but I have been fascinated by the culture. Everything to anime to samurai to geisha to sake. 8 years later, I am now a Japanese language student studying to be a translator.Several reviews made sense to me for those who understood the Japanese culture and even more so the dark life of the Geisha. I myself never knew much about them however, after picking up this book, I did make a note to educate myself regarding the Geisha. When I picked up this book, I knew it was not going to 100% correct to history nor to Geisha. Fiction never is. However, if you go into a book, or a movie, or something of that nature with the view that \\"Oh my god this is not 100% fact!\\" and spend the remainder of your time with the material trying to disprove it, you miss the over all picture. \\"Memoirs\\" to be was a beutiful novel of a basically fantasy life of the Geisha. I took it as it is and didn't let some of the obvious nuiances distract be of enjoying this book.The character are made to look disgusting. They are meant to look like money-pinching, slave-driving people that take joy ins eeing themselves elevated and see others smashed to the ground - Chiyo/Sayuri included. Without that feature, this book would become a happy-happy-joy-joy fest devoid of any true character developement.One element I loved about this book is the detail described in it's pages. Everything from the way the hair was worn to the designs of the kimono to the surroundings to the events Sayuri finds herself in. However, I never expected this book to be a \\"Everything that You Want (or Don't Want) to know About Geisha\\" type style. What people, who are not knowledgeable in Japan or Geisha, are more intrested in the appearence of kimonos and the thoughts of Sayuri then the in-deph explanation of the tea ceremony or any other precise attribute of the Geisha. The book is to tell a story of a young girl who want from rags to riches and became one of the most desiered Geisha of Gion. Not a entire encylopedia of Geisha. If you want that, some reivewers have posted some very good books to look into. Which drives my other point...This book, as indictated by some reviewers was a very good read for someone who only knew Japan for samurai, raw fish, and possibly cartoons with large eyes and blue hair that shot fireballs from thier hands. Oh and Godzilla. Can't forget him. To me, if this book somehow educated the average American and introduce them into the world of historical Japan, then this book is very much worth the time and effort. This book helps introduce the person to the world of the Geisha and ultimately 1930's Japan which was on the ridge of being industrialized. The Japanese words used are explained while pertaining to the story but the author doesn't go over board and pile on terminology over terminology expecting that everyone who reads this is a scholat in the History of Geisha. He knows his audience is people who know nothing concerning Japan but find the world of the Geisha exotic and entracing. What they get is something not what they expected but yet something they can indentify with.Overall, setting aside my \\"Japanese superiority complex\\", I enjoyed the book instead of pointing out every single misconstrued fact (or \\"lie\\") and enjoyed this book. The edning wasn't exactly awe inspiring but it was decent. I highly reccomend this book to those who are intrested in the Japanese culture but I urge those who are still intrested to pursue other areas of Japanese history. It is such a historical rich culture that it is almost a crime to not read about it"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"i read this book and i loved it. i really couldnt stop reading. the movie was amazing also. i recomend the book and the movie definatly!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't like reading things when they're popular, so I generally wait until the buzz has died down a bit.

Back in the 1930s when ancient customs dictated how society operated, the Geisha - part sex slave, part entrepreneur, but primarily an artist - played a respectable role.With the brush of details and much research, Golden transforms the impish Chiyo to the graceful Sayuri. He vividly describes how she moved from despair, to obedience, to success, to daring to hope. Along the way, we learn about Japan during the Depression, with the caveat of how Japanese perceived the conquering Americans after WWII ended, a defeat, not only in the hand of a stronger military apparatus, but of new ideas.In many ways, it's a hard book for a modern western woman to read. Under the loveliness of the rituals, the mizuage is a formalized rape by men whom we treat as pedophiles. Yet, can we judge a Geisha yearning for a danna (a man who pays the bills) compare to the western version of a Trophy Wife, or a Toy Boy, or even the unruliness of MySpace. Simply written, but stirring with erotica and rites, Memories evokes, probes, and exalts the tradition of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Okay I read this book when I was a sophomore in High School and I love the book. I was surprised that when the movie came out it did it some justice. I'm not one to ruin plots so I won't go into detail. I must say before I read the books I thought Geisha's to be beautiful women, that looked like dolls. Boy was I wrong for in a sense they're basically high class concubines. I loved the story, enough detail and enough dialog to keep it easy and flowing. How the young girl Chiyo grows into the fully trained and lovely Sayuri. I love the detail on how one must train and how they live. Like a specific code of life an acceptance. Near the end it does tend to drag a bit but when you finish it leaves with that sense of awe that makes you want to pick it up and read it again. Overall the movie did an excellent job of captivating the book. I love how the author did his research and integrated the lives of many Geisha's in WWII in a single fictional novel.If you like this one, read Anita Diamant's The Red Tent"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was the first book in a long time that I had trouble putting down. If I wasn't reading it, I would want to be reading it to find out what would happen next. This ranks up there with some of my favorites."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When my daughter decided to read Memoirs of a Geisha, I picked it up as well. I like to keep up with what she's exposed to, and perhaps I can add to the content, or explain difficult concepts. It's a good way to share a common interest as well. With that mindset I picked up this novel, hoping to keep up with her. That turned out to be impossible. She finished it in two days, and it took me a week.There wasn't anything for me to explain, there weren't any loose ends to tie up, and there weren't any inconsistencies for me to analyze. Like Dickens and Austen, Golden knows how to tell an epic. An epic that tells the life story of one woman, Saruyi, the deaths of both a culture and a country, Imperial Japan, and the birth of two new nations, post-war Japan and America.Saruyi is stolen from her home and forced to live a life she didn't choose. She comes to grips with circumstances forced upon her by rebelling and excelling in that order, but masterfully throughout this isolated story of an emerging Geisha celebrity Golden weaves the world events as an integral part of this life.The major theme throughout this tomb is sacrifice. Saruyi sacrifices her feelings, her humanity, for the life she's forced to lead because to maintain that humanity she'd have failed at being a geisha. She sacrifices everything to be the best, yet at the same time Japan was sacrificing everything for its own dominant aspirations.Without giving away any spoilers, Saruyi sacrifices everything many times over until she finally figures out that what she really wants, and that's what she lost so many years ago when she was sold away - her innocence and her free will. While the ending is a bit contrived, it works to redeem the storyline.Here's to a story filled with great themes, amazing scenes, and a story arc worthy of the classics. Here's to great conversations with my daughter over a beautifully told story.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So much has been said in praise of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" that I'm not entirely sure what I can add. The story is enthralling from the very start; Arthur Golden draws the reader in by vividly painting not only his main character, but everything around her. His attention to detail and surrounding pay off in a sumptuous novel that is hard to put down.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", while fictional, reads like an autobiography, and indeed the author's research and use of interviews with a geisha are evident in the book. We meet the narrator Chiyo-chan when she is a young girl, daughter of a poor fisherman, whose mother is at death's door. Chiyo longs for a better life and secretly hopes that she will be adopted by a local, weatlhy businessman; however, different plans are in place for Chiyo and her sisters Satsu, as they are sold into a world of virtual slavery. Torn apart from her sister, Chiyo finds herself in training to become a geisha in the Nitta okiya, but her stubborness costs her. With her training at an end, she is destined to become a maid. But her whole world changes once again, after a chance encounter with a wealthy man, known as the Chairman, who makes her long to become a geisha after all.The rest of the novel is devoted to Chiyo's training in becoming the geisha known as Sayuri. And in everything she does, her focus is to gain attention from the Chairman. A long-held Western perspective is that 'geisha' is equivalent to 'prostitute'; rather a geisha is more like a mistress or a kept woman. Their task is to beguile and entertain men who will become their patrons.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a captivating read - the vast majority of the characters are vividly drawn, but the narration can get restricted through the viewpoint of Chiyo/Sayuri. Readers wish that her main adversary, Hatsumomo, was given more background, and the Chairman seems to be the one character who is given the least attention. This is odd since he is the focus of Sayuri's entire life, but he remains flat and the ending of the novel, when Sayuri achieves everything she dreamed of, is rushed and somewhat unbelievable. The reader almost begins to root that things won't turn out how the narrator wants them to. In spite of that, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a fascinating read that is a magical glimpse into a vanished world."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's interesting that I tried to read this book several times, at the recommendation of friends who loved it, however I could never get into it. When I saw this audiobook, I jumped at the opportunity to try again. Having the story told to me by such an outstanding reader made all the difference in the world. I loved the vivid descriptions and the attention to detail. It's truly amazing that a male author could write such a clear picture into the geisha lifestyle with such intrigue, sensitivity and historical accuracy. It's obvious that a lot of research went into this story! I realize that I missed some parts by listening to the abridged version, but now I feel inspired to go back and read the book someday, or at least see the film, which I heard was so visually stunning!

But I am extremely happy that I tried it out because this one of my top favorite books now. It tells the whole life story of this little girl named Chiyo who was taken from her poor little fishing village, Yoroido, to Gion to become a geisha. She encounters many hardships and challenges in her new life that could easily have destroyed her, but she strived to survive. This is a rags to riches kind of story, in that this poor, beaten down girl evolves into one of the most popular and successful geisha of Gion, all because of her perseverance. It was beautifully written, tieing in the exquisite culture of Japan with the life struggles of a rising geisha. If you are going to read any uplifting and motivating book any time soon, this is definetly the one to read. Although struggles accompany her almost to the very end, Chiyo- later renamed Sayuri- never gives up and takes her life into her own hands."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs Of A Geisha is an informative novel that will forever remain in the reader's mind. This novel tells the story of a young girl's childhood and continues on until she is an old woman. We see her ascent in Gion as one of the most sought after Geisha's of her time. Although this was a wonderful book in my opinion, it certainly wouldn't appeal to all audiences. A mature female would be most able to appreciate this story.There are many reasons people enjoy books. Some people enjoy the thrill of being scared, others love crying over a heart wrenching Nicolas Sparks novel. However, what makes this book so likable is how relatable it is. The audience most likely has very little knowledge of Japenese culture and of the life of a Geisha; this book is a wonderful introduction to that society. Although the audience may have never even heard of a Geisha, they will be able to relate to the emotions she is forced to deal with: homesickness, grief, loneliness, elation, sexuality, dealing with authority and love.People that enjoyed Chinese Cinderella by Adeline Yen Mah would also enjoy Memoirs of a Geisha. Although Chinese Cinderella doesn't deal with the life of a Geisha, or even Japanese culture, it does introduce the audience to the Oriental world and the differences in lifestyle.The author wrote this novel in the first person. He focused on vivid description to help bring the audience into the setting. However, at times, he described some very disturbing images that stay with the reader. Also, he includes sporadic use of Japenese words which can be difficult to follow, especially since there is no glossary. Even so, Memoirs of a Geisha is a wonderfully informative story sure to captivate the hearts of its readers"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book! The simple, almost Zen-like imagery of pre-war Japan was hypnotic. The world of the Geisha is truly a world within a world--one with many twists and unexpected turns. Truly, an education for any Western-born person."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I first bought this book, I had pretty high hopes for it. The beautiful cover wasn't the reason - although it did help. It was because I was looking forward to a more sheroic novel, so maybe that's why I disliked it so: because I just had something else in mind.The book seemed to go on and on. I couldn't quite figure out Sayuri's obsession with the Chairman. Not only was she around thirty years older than him (I agree with her that age doesn't really matter in love - to a point), but she had only seen him once as a child, and she obsessed with him for the rest of the book.The only time I enjoyed reading it was when she was learning to become a Geisha.The book must have been well-researched, and the author obviously knew much about geisha and their lives, but the books was depressing most of the time, and it gave me a very helpless feeling.And concerning the subject that a geisha is an artist, not a prostitute... Well, they certainly have to use their brains more than a prostitute. They have to go through training and learn instruments and how to dance. But, after reading this book, I'd call them high-class prostitutes who have more choice about whom they \\"spend their time\\" with. Just like the back of the book said, a geisha's virginity is auctioned off to the highest bidder.Of course, the man she ends up with is already married (they all are, so don't let this shock or spoil the book for you), so it makes the reader (or at least, made this one) feel cheated and disappointed. I guess it just demonstrated harsh Japanese culture, because Sayuri felt lucky and truly blessed to be a geisha - although I shudder and may agree a small amount when I think of her sister.The book left me feeling disappointed in mankind in general, because there were no real characters in the book, besides perhaps Nobu. Sayuri was desperate and not incredibly smart (although she wasn't dumb, I'll give her that).The descriptions were rich (either beautiful, or grim, gritty, and harsh) and caused strong feelings, so the writing itself is good. It was also captivating (although not because I was enthralled. It was mostly because I was waiting for it to get better).In short, if you're looking for a happy, lovely novel about a dancing and exotic Japanese girl, don't think you're going to get any of that in this book. It was a good book, and certainly enlightening, but very sad and depressing."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is a novel and the character of the geishas is only Arthur Golden's inventions. But the novel presents a seamless authenticity of a hidden world full of complex rituals, ruts, regulations, and machinations. Interwoven between first- and third person narratives, the novel is a geisha's reflection of her life that began in early twentieth century, in a remote fishing village Toroido. A little girl was sold to an okiya in Kyoto where she worked as a maid. Upon separation from her older sister and after the death of her parents, she lost all hope and her dream of seeing her family shattered. All that was left in her were confusion and confusion.Since the outsiders have limited knowledge of a geisha's profession, even though the geisha might be in a less favored position to observe incidents around her, Sayuri might have left a record of herself that is far more complete, more accurate, and more compelling than any previous account. Arthur Golden has presented a character, a geisha from the 1920s, to deliver a powerful account that reconstructs nuances of a mysterious profession.The incessant chores, the acrimonious okiya mother (headmistress), the constant bullying from the jealous geisha in the house made the little girl's life more difficult. It strengthened her determination to run away. Her futile attempts to escape enraged the mistress and forfeited her opportunity to get the training to become a geisha. Chiyo (Sayuri was her geisha's name later) ineluctably faced a bleak prospect as her debts to the okiya stacked high. Since nobody made a decision to become a geisha, her only choice was to at least complete apprenticeshipand hopefully made enough money as a mediocre geisha to pay back for her living expenses and lessons. One can see that being a geisha is no more than a total surrender of self and will.Chiyo's road to become a geisha was thorny. She was constant the target of bullying from a senior geisha who hated anyone more successful than she was and who thrived to rid of all prospective rivals. Even though the senior geisha had falsely accused her, faulted her, and rendered her debut a standstill, her determination to become a geisha did not spring from the inventive to revenge on her enemy. The driving force was to attract a man who was as gentlemanly as the one who gave her a coin when she first arrived in Kyoto. This is the heart of the novel: in the geisha's world where appearances are paramount and where love is scorned as illusion, our little heroine has steered her whole life toward winning the affection of one man whom she admired.The geisha world was about putting on the most impeccable appearance in order to attract a long-term patron (danna) who would sustain a relationship like a business deal. In other word, a true geisha would never risk to blemish her reputation by making herself available to men on a nightly basis. Even though she would not pretend she never gave in to a man she found attractive, she had to be extremely careful and discreet about any serious romantic relationship that would jeopardize her relationship with beneficiaries. A geisha, like our heroine, was advised against any circumstances that would diminish the chance of anchoring to a powerful danna. A geisha was to put on the best show to fish for a sponsor. Therefore, on the account of the exquisite fabrics that draped a geisha and the strict ceremonial measures, the most severe rebuke a young geisha was likely to receive probably wouldn't be for performing poorly, but rather for having dirty fingernails, tousled hair or having poor manner. Every aspect of a geisha's life is used to secure an affluent tutelage, is programmed to success, which is gauged by money. Behind the impeccable beauty was painful melancholy.In a world where a girl's virginity was auctioned to the highest bidder, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA illuminates how inexorably a geisha must comply to the complicated ruts in order to sustain popularity. It beguiles the reader as much as the geishas beguiled the most powerful men; and immerses the reader in an exotic territory with its nuanced portraits of lives in the okiya and the gion (geisha district in Kyoto). The novel spans over sixty years encompassing the Great Depression and the Second World War, following which sees the downhill of the geisha industry."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I never would have picked up this book and read it but a friend loaned me this book and urged me to read it. I thought I'd have to force my way through it but found it to be very captivating and difficult to put down. I never knew exactly what a Geisha was but I guess I had some of my own ideas. Turns out their life was completely different from what I had thought. This book shares the difficulties and hardships of a young girl torn from her family and all she knew in life. You felt her pain and struggles through Mr. Golden's writings. The characters are so bold and well described. Several times while reading the book, I was shocked at how well a man could convey what a young girl must've been feeling. You honestly forget that this wasn't a woman writing about her own difficult life. I would encourage anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha are a fictional account of a real geisha, but make no mistake: when you find someone named \\"Mr. Snowshowers\\" or \\"Doctor Crab\\" they were real people, but their names were changed so as not to embarrass their families.I thought the idea of a fictional \\"Memoir\\" was terrific - and I actually thought the Translator's Notes added to the whole. Many great authors of the past have done such things in an attempt to draw the reader deeper into a chosen world (for example, the foreword to Lolita, where Nabokov says the book could not have been written were the protagonists still alive). Clearly, this is a work of fiction - I mean, where did you find it on the shelf? So get over your idea that this somehow belittles \\"real\\" memoirs and enjoy the artifice, just another detail in a richly layered narrative.This book reveals to the reader the world of the geisha - a universe foreign to western civilization. For instance: kimonos come in one size. Every time a geisha wears a kimono, it must be tied by a specially trained person, so that it looks as if it were custom tailored, and an ornamental - not to mention complex - knot must be tied with an obi (a long strip of silk) around the geisha to hold the kimono together.The thing that makes this book most desirable to read is the vividly written passages. The story is told in the first person - through the eyes of Sayuri. The voice is that of experience, but in no way condescends the reader. The narrator keeps a comfortable psychic distance from the reader and feeds a desire in the reader to learn more. This is not my usual style of book at all, and in fact I've never been interested in Japanese culture. But I was so swept away by this book and the lifestyle depicted that I couldn't put it down I truly enjoyed reading the book in part because of the author's genuine interest in Japanese culture and the effort to transmit the culture to English readers. Highly recommend for those who enjoys a good read on world culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Cultural lessons were interesting, but maybe I could have learned more from a non-fiction?

The way the Japanese society was so accepting of the lifestyle of a Geisha, and how the unvalued girls basically felt incredibly lucky to become a sexual servant was uphalling, but at the same time it was a comment on the values of the people in the Japanese society, and how something that seems unjust in the U.S. was so widely accepted in this foreign place. The geisha in the book was stripped from her childhood and made into the model geisha in her mid teens, and her virginity was auctioned off, a highly respected ceremony. (Being a teenager at 17, this made me feel violated for the character.) I enjoyed this book immensely, but was somewhat intreigued by the lack of discussion of death in the book. There was little talk of the feelings of people about the deaths of the characters, and there was little time spent talking about it, and the death was rarely ever referenced later in the book. I would name this book, Memoirs of a Geisha, among my top favorites."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"You truly get swept away from your everyday into the little okiya of Sayuri-san and the rest of the beautiful geisha of Kyoto. You will get lost in the beautifully told history of a world beyond your wildest imagination - you will be the one wearing the ornate kimono and the dazzling ornaments... it truly is a bittersweet surrender into the life of an innocent girl turned into a geisha sophisticate..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to agree with one of the L.A. reviewers. This novel started out as a tight, intriguing, well-paced story that absolutely unraveled by the end. I was left feeling that Golden needed to wrap things up, almost as if he had become bored by his own characters and wanted to dispense with the story as quickly as possible. The novel's pace completely changed, characters became caricatures, and the whole subplot about the Chairman fulfilled itself in the most ridiculous way. After raving about this novel for two days while I read the first two-thirds, I had to admit to my friends that I couldn't ultimately recommend it. I'm glad I waited until it came out in paperback."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was unable to put this book down! This was an extraordinary work that brought you into the world of the geisha in Kyoto. The descriptions of the era were thought provoking and alive! Thank you for a delightful treat!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Mr Golden is a master of minutiae. His paragraphs drip with rich detail which are a delight to the senses. You can almost taste the Japanese tea and visualise the exquisite kimono designs.A possible weakness is that a good two thirds of the book deals with the truly epic 'bitch fight' between protagonist Sayuri and gorgon Hatsumono, complete with torn kimonos and frazzled hair buns. While this big sister/small sister thang is jolly good fun, Golden could have fleshed out other characters such as the shadowy Chairman or events such as those in the post War period.It is commendable that Golden has presented to us a little known aspect of an Asian culture in such an accessible format. He has undertaken a huge amount of research for this story and one hopes he uses his collected information as the impetus for another great story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If this book was a true picture of the life of a Japanese geisha, I was astounded...for many reasons. First and foremost, I was shocked at the lack of value placed on children. Secondly, I was dismayed to learn of the role of women in Japanese culture. Finally, I was saddened to realize that geisha life was probably the best choice Sayuri could have been given.Memoirs of a Geisha has made me want to read more about Japanese culture and history."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The writing style was smooth and easy to follow. The story and characters kept my interest. If you are timid of reading a story about a different culture, don't be. This author guides you through without difficulty. I don't understand why some reviews here compare it to a &quot;Romance Novel&quot;. That is really selling this book short."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The strengths of the book shine through from the first page to the last. Golden's poetic and beautiful imagery, tinged with zen simplicity, understanding and appreciation for beauty and nature, inform the narrator's thoughts and descriptions, and while not always peaceful or reflective, the feel of the novel comes across as genuine. A Japanese reader may well feel that this is a cheap rendering of their speech and culture; but the target audience is the west, readers reading in English, and to an American there is a natural grace to Golden's prose, unforced and simple, yet often vivid and imaginative.The weaknesses are unfortunately in the story and in some of the characters. Simply put, the story line comes across as jerky and episodic, random and finally contrived, and too pat. The story's ending, with the heroine achieving her goal at long last, almost entirely by wild luck and coincidence rather than the twenty years of pining and planning that have been described, is not satisfying, and is clumsy. She has done nothing to earn this, and little to earn so much else.The characters are similarly spotty. Her erstwhile friend and later competitor Pumpkin is well drawn for a minor character, and the changes in her personality over time are interesting and well done. Hatsumomo, the villain of the novel, is sharply drawn and genuinely scary, a well executed character. And Nobu is perhaps the most fully realized character in the book; by the end of the story, his gruff but honest quality, and how he is treated, actually makes the narrator less sympathetic. But the narrator comes across as thoughtful, kind, and good; however, indecisive, and prone to allow fate to decide her course in life. Again and again the reader mentally urges her to do something, do anything, to further her progress along; but no, she waits for life to happen to her. It is frustrating going for readers weaned on Raymond Chandler books. Tanaka, Auntie, Mother, Granny, Satsu and the Chairman are all essentially cardboard characters; there is little logic behind Sayuri's extended obsession for one older man who offers neither compassion, companionship, nor even conversation, year after year.That said, the book's strengths make this a fascinating read. The background of World War II, the dying of the geisha culture and changing of Japan in the postwar period are all touched on, and one sees a bit of the rough side of female servitude as well as the smooth. It's a good read, and should make for a beautiful movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After being captivated for nearly 400 pages, I was so unsatisfied by the contrived ending of this novel that my entire reading experience was spoiled. Yes, Golden's details of Gion culture pre-WWII are fascinating, and the intense rivalry among geishas (who accept their roles in Japanese culture because they have &quot;no other choice,&quot; as one character notes) puts a literary spin on traditional soap-opera fun. But the &quot;happy ending&quot; was a [unbelievable] Hollywood slap-in-the-face to Japanese notions of duty, honor, and morality. From a narrative standpoint, the novel spends a lot of time showing the complex depth of the relationship between Sayuri and a man she would do well to accept, and almost no time developing the character of the man who ends up being her &quot;dreamboat.&quot; As a result the ending is flat and absolutely unfulfilling.Yes, Sayuri's attempt to escape her &quot;fate&quot; says something about the powerlessness of women in Japanese culture, but no one will mistake this for a feminist text. Her character at the end seemed so selfish and cruel that I was left irritated at having spent so much time with her.What a wonderful novel this ALMOST was! I'm surprised the editors at Knopf let Golden put a pin in what should have been a beautiful, brightly-colored balloon."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This begins as Charles Dickens might have written it, had he such a vision, continues as a fairy tale, and concludes as a strange and touching story of love spanning decades and ending in happiness and fulfillment. But primarily this is a fairy tale, and like all fairy tales there is beneath the surface an underlying current of the dark nature of humanity that can only be glimpsed through the use of symbolism. Just as the wolf in grandmother's bed represents something more than a wolf, so it is with the men attended by the geisha. And so it is with her as well. She projects the image of fairy tale beauty and an attentive loveliness, but is in fact a woman of business whose attentions are bought and sold, just as with any commodity. This is the illusion and the pretense, and the soft, embroidered veil between us and the truth that is paid for.This is also a beautiful novel, charming and witty with just the barest touch of satire, an original work of a cunning genius, as readable as a best seller, as satisfying as a masterpiece. Although written as realistic fiction and presented as the memoirs of someone who really did exist, the story and especially the action are veiled reality. Notice that Sayuri is fifteen when she first learns of the significance of her virginity. Since her captors would have put a very high price on maintaining that virginity until they could sell it, they would have taken very careful measures to ensure that she could not lose it; consequently, being the clever girl that she was, Sayuri would have understood what that meant. And to suppose that she knew nothing of sexual intercourse until Mameha's story of the lonely eel and the cave... Well, this is part of the contrivance and illusion maintained by geisha and its tradition. But make no mistake, the girls know, but their knowledge must be expressed and understood euphemistically.There are a number of other \\"contradictions\\" in the novel that are of no real import because the world of the geisha is the world of illusion and fairy tale. Although Chiyo never says so directly, she knew quite well what was being done to her sister in the house of ill-repute that she visited in the poor section of Kyoto. There is something wonderful and alluring about this duplicitous view of human sexuality found in all cultures. One of the wonderful things about Golden's novel is how he shows us its expression in the Japanese tradition. When Hatsumomo's vagina is forcibly investigated by Granny and Mother looking for evidence of semen (and Chiyo is about ten years old) she understands what was found because she had seen the man between Hatsumomo's legs in the dim light through the partially opened door. Adults find comfort in the illusion of a sexless childhood, comfort that can only be maintained through the artifice of self-deception. Please note that this is not a criticism of the novel; on the contrary. It is part of Golden's vision to realize that a fairy tale view of Chiyo's sexuality was necessary. Note also the scenes with Mr. Tanaka when she appears as a naked nine-year-old. Read carefully we can see that his sexual desire for her is apparent and is symbolically acted out through the device of her sister with the Sugi boy and Mr. Tanaka's bare touch of her cheek. Incidentally Nitta Sayuri's narrative is coy by design, and it is this structure that allows Golden to so beautifully present this fairy tale world with its illusion of a foreign and bygone reality.But the fairy tale ends three-quarters of the way through, and then begins a counter point as the war and the hardships are brought home to the Japanese people and to Sayuri personally. Now we have a tale stripped of illusion, devoid of symbolism, replete with the harsh reality of a civilian population with dwindling resources, impending loss, and the sound of bombers overhead...This is the kind of commerically and artistically successful novel that makes other novelists despair of ever coming close. The exquisite style, the confident scholarship, the ample energy so gracefully expended, the unerring sense of what is appropriate, the generous and apt use of metaphor, the clever plotting, the rich detail, the sure commercial feel: a publisher's dream, an agent's adrenal rush! I expect a lavish movie production, an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, and perhaps even the first important opera of the twenty-first century to follow.Or maybe a Disney cartoon in the tradition of Snow White and Cinderella. On second thought, probably NOT!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"And I read a book a week! Memoirs of a Geisha is destined to be one of the greatest books of this century (or any other for that matter). Arthur Golden writes with such an amazing eye for detail and feeling that the reader forgets that this book is fiction and that the author is a man.I fell in love with the characters, with their world and having been to Japan it made me want to return - tomorrow! This book is beautifully written and the topic is unique.I could not put this book down and when I finished it I felt as though I had lost a good friend. I have read it several times since I first picked it up in April and I always enjoy it.The most interesting thing about this book is that the author wrote it three times - this is the third version. I believe that the first two were written from different points of view (third person as well as in another character's voice).I can not wait to see what Spielberg does with this moving story on film."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are some books (and some movies) written using a well-known formula. These formulas almost always guarantee bestseller success. One of the most popular is the &quot;Cinderella&quot;. It is a surefire way to sell books, and this is why you see it time and time again. This is how it goes:Hero or heroine must be born into poverty or come to it fairly quickly in the story.Hero or heroine must possess extraordinary beauty and/or above-average intelligence.Hero or heroine is subject to the most hideous trials and tribulations while still a child, and when you think nothing worse can happen to the creature, it does.Hero or heroine possesses a heart of gold.Hero or heroine has the opportunity to be equally evil to those that damaged him/her, but because s/he is compassionate, s/he refuses to.Hero or heroine rises above adversity and survives all calamitiesThere is always a happy ending.&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a perfect example of the &quot;Cinderella&quot; format (some readers called it Oliver Twist, some Jane Eyre; it's all the same). Chiyo is an extremely beautiful child (the constant reference to her gray eyes became too much too soon) and very smart, whose father is a poor fisherman, not very bright, and whose mother is dying. She and her sister are sold and soon separated, and poor Chiyo (who will later change her name to Sayuri) suffers enormously for the next 400 pages or so.The best part of this book is its detailed descriptions of all things geisha, from makeup to hair to clothing to ceremonies to education to housing... After reading the book, i felt that i had learned a lot about this important subgroup of Japanese culture. I also enjoyed the prose, for the most part. As a person who sometimes has to explain foreign customs to others, i identified with the tone that Sayuri used when describing things. The story of young Chiyo is also quite entertaining, from her days in the tipsy house till she gets under Mameha's wing. After that, the story line goes downhill. The worst part, from a literary standpoint, is that the book is formulaic, and uses many artificial devices to keep the plot going. For example, how come Hatsumoto is so bent in destroying Chiyo from the moment she meets the poor girl, who is only 9 years old? Hatsumoto can't be that much older than Chiyo, yet she is machinating like an old witch, and we do not know exactly for what reason. Also, Chiyo's encounter with The Chairman is so brief, yet she is so affected by it for years and years to come. Even though when they met she was crying and her vision was blurry, she remembered his features like they were engraved in her brain. The Chairman and Hatsumoto are artifices to make the story move along. The flow, especially after Chiyo becomes Sayuri, is really poor. The intrigues and the &quot;convenient&quot; situations and coincidences that take place really detract from the story. The final pages are particularly bad. All of a sudden, the author wanted to wrap it up and there is absolutely no development and scenes just do not make sense. I can't really explain some of my objections without spoiling the end, but all things related to The Chairman were so very unbelievable. There is no amount of willing suspension of disbelief to make me swallow the final chapters.People love to see these plots because they are predictable and there is a feel-good quality to them. For example, i have to admit i couldn't wait till i found out what horrible ending Hatsumoto had, after being so cruel and despicable to poor Chiyo. But overall, except for the cultural aspect of the book, this is as bad as a cheap romance novel from the supermarket."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"While intrigued by a glimpse into a world closed to me, I find the author altogether more interested in things than in people. This is the proper stance for an historian and student of visual art; it is a handicap for a novelist. Golden is distant, and his novel only about surfaces. It has no depth, a melodramatic plot, flat charac- ters, and he generalizes experience rather than communicating sensation. The oft-mentioned blue eyes are a red herring, not a functional symbol. While it is perhaps apt that a story about a culture that objectifies women -- and geisha in the extreme -- would objectify its characters, and that a work almost devoid of subtext would have stock archetypes as actors, it doesn't seem deliberate artistic intent, and if meant as subtle comment, is too dear at the narrative's expense.Golden is, perhaps, too well trained as a collector of facts. Loathe to present anything that is not verifiable, his novel exists within the tiny limits of reality. A novel must be a work that breathes in the infinity of fiction. Art is not a thing observed, that we can view and set aside. Art is an act: experienced, incorporated and symbiotic. Golden hints at intimacy, but does not enter into it, requires only passivity in the reader, demands no emotional investment and delivers only entertainment. He never dares to create a world inside his characters as real as the one outside them, the details of which he lovingly reports. Golden does not risk the act of fiction, the act of Art. In this, the author is like his geisha protagonist: adept in the craft of presentation, polished appearances, elaborate surface decoration and the gestures of emotion. But under all those layers of exotic paint and silk? Empty.The betrayal of Sayuri by her culture is that it does not allow her to be herself, and only values her as a commodity. Ironically, Golden commits the same act when he does not let us learn about this woman or about ourselves by allowing us access to her interior. We are left with a collection of interesting factoids, vivid spectacle, pastel sentiment. And the same question after the last words of Golden's book as we have before we began: who is this woman, and what does she have to say to us?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Where to begin? I got this book after several recommendations from friends. I only regret not getting it earlier. One of the ways I like to rate books is how much I miss them when I'm finished and I feel as though I've lost a good friend. Towards the end of the book, I found myself slowing down, a measure of my attachment to Sayuri and her tales. This book is an incredibly well thought-out and beautifully written piece that is so endearing and passionate. The main reason I picked up the book was to learn and gain insights into the secretive life of Geisha -- what I got was so much more than I ever expected.Holden has an amazing ability to make the writing appear so effortless and yet, each word seems so carefully crafted and deliberate. Memoirs is written in 1st person narrative and convincingly so; many other people have commented on his extraordinary ability to sound like a female author. For me, there is just the right amount of dialog -- my preference is for an economy of words, and Holden gets it right.All in all, a fantastic read and finding another comparable book to read has been tough. I'm going to try Snow Falling on Cedars and Angela's Ashes."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to admit, I'd never even been very interested in Oriental culture. This book was recommended to me, and despite excellent reviews, I was hesitant to pick it up. However, I did, and I have been grateful ever since. This is once of the most richly drawn tapestries I have ever encountered. I knew before reading this that geisha were not prostitutes, but I had no idea the lengths that they went to. The extensive schooling, the makeup, the OBI. (I had no idea that the obi was that complicated.) Not to mention the story! Between Hatsumomo and Nobu, I felt as though I were just as upset as Sayuri. I also must commend Arthur Golden for something that I haven't heard in a review as of yet. I had to look at the book jacket picture 3 times before I would allow myself to believe that a man penned such feminine thoughts and experiences. Not to mention the erotic symbolism that I thought only existed in the minds and hearts of women. I don't know whose head he crept into, but he sure took notes well. It's been awhile since I was upset that a book was ending. I flew through the book with such a frenetic pace that I was regretful in the end that I didn't have more time to spend in Gion. A worthy and triumphant first effort."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Entrap yourselt within the beautiful and enchanting culture of Japanese geishas. Memoirs of a Geisha is a book that gives great meaning to the overlooked Japanese culture of geishas.This book is surely different and unlike any other book I've read. Not only because of the plot of the story or the theme, but because of the way it's written.The author of the book, Arthur Golden, portrays the story in the eyes of a young girl whose life is going through the tough stages of blooming into a geisha. From her tortuous childhood living in a tiny village and being taken away by a stranger to the time of her present adulthood, adventures, and hardships are all illustrated using intriguing language and explicit details. The narrator's sufferings and achievements make the grand theme of this book obvious and true. The theme is revealed in many parts of the story. Because the theme is so easily found, the book goes quite deeply into fine points about the foundation topics that lead into this theme. Although set in a far-off and foreign country in the time of World War 2, the setting is one more thing that makes this book readable and enjoyable. By using original Japanese words, the reader gets used to the setting of this beautiful country more. The words to describe the settings draw the most incredible pictures in the readers' minds.The story also has many surprises, twists, and turns that totally leaves the reader grasping for need of reading on. The quick pace in the plot and the quickly changing conflicts and problems leaves no room for the reader to be bored.Memoirs of a Geisha is interesting and definitely not boring. A wide range of different types of readers would get into it easily.

When I read &quot;Memoirs,&quot; I found myself captivated. Golden's prose paints elegant, definite pictures in the reader's mind, capturing every detail of Chiyo-chan/Sayuri-san's life, from the little fishing village of her birth, to the Nitta okiya in Kyoto. His talent for placing himself in Sayuri's mind is extraordinary: As I read, I felt that I was listening as a Japanese woman told her life story, rather than reading the words of an American man. Golden's style is highly epigramatic, with wise sayings such as &quot;A shopkeeper who leaves his window open can hardly be angry at the rainstorm for ruining his wares&quot; peppering the entirety of the novel. Overall, &quot;Memoirs&quot; is a truly well-written novel whose monetary success testifies to its quality.

This inside look at the life of Geisha is heart wrenching. These poor women were brought through so many emotional and difficult experiences, and yet Sayuri manages to get through all of it and remain a whole person. Characters are weaved throughout the book -- such as the Chairman, and you find yourself wondering what the motives are behind each of them, what they are made of. As Sayuri grows from a child, to an intelligent and clever woman you cannot help but to be drawn to her, and to her life experiences.

From the very beginning I found myself entrenched in the life of the main character/narator.

As Sayuri grows from a child, to an intelligent and clever woman it is impossible not to be drawn to her, and to her life experiences. This is a book that everyone should read.

I won't give it away, but will say that the ending was wrong, wrong, wrong - it completely didn't fit the main character. The ending just confirmed that the author, despite his writing skill, was a man who can't really imagine what it is to be female, or what would really make this geisha happy.

He does an excellent job explaining the customs and life of a geisha in a way that is very natural and completely woven into the story. It is unpredictable and extremely captivating."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Luminous and sad are the first two words that remain after reading the Memoirs. Unreal, surreal, there is both the endless sorrow of Emile Zola, and the refined delicacy of Jane Austen unfolding in the removed quarters of the geisha houses of Gion in pre-war Kyoto. The book itself is deeptively written; Golden says it is a transcription of a Dutch professor*s tapes made when he interviewed the Geisha--Sayuri--of the title; thus both the woman and her biographer are removed from real life. And this is the way the geisha live, the intricacies of day-to-day living, the tiny vital things the women study almost in secret, cannot be exposed to the harsh glare of the outside world. When her parents are quite ill, Sayuri is gently tricked by Mr.Tanaka the broker into being sent to Kyoto as indentured maidservant to a renowned geisha house. There she suffers the slow torture of being considered and raised up to become one of the most prominent geisha of her day, 1930s Japan. Reading this book in tandem with Runaway Horses, Yukio Mishima*s violent portrait of those days, it is impossible to believe both are describing the same time, the same country. The geisha dance, play, sing, all but removed from their fellow citizens; when Sayuri must flee Kyoto during WW2 her exposure to the outside world is quite shocking. The slow unfolding of her loves, with the injured Nobu, with Nobu*s friend the quiet Chairman of Iwemura Electirc, occurs with an Austen-attention to detail. But it is a sad thing, doomed in its own transedence, its own temprary nature. The geisha are as removed as mermaids, ultimately as unreal."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was an okay read.

Many of the women described in Memoirs were geisha because they had to be however they were intelligent, strong, and very capable women. For this reason, I think that every woman who reads this novel should be grateful for her freedom and ability to follow her dreams instead of waiting for her destiny as Sayuri was forced to do."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a very enjoyable book and the characters are appealing. I learned a lot about geishas and Japanese culture. It's a hard book to put down and reads swiftly. Minor complaints: the rivalry between the geishas goes on way too long and no one really changes in the book; the good characters stay good and the bad remain bad. Needed a little variety.

I felt her pain, her hopes, her triumphs. I really enjoyed the glimpses into that closed society. Altho' to the men the Geisha were fluff, underneath they were strong and ambitious. Realizing her life would be infinately better as a Geisha than as a maid she was lucky to get a second chance. Once she got it she made the most of it, such as it was.The ending was too fairy tale and WAY too rushed. I must admit I wanted her to live happily ever after but I feel that was a cop out ending.

Not only was it informative about the life of a geisha but so true to life of the social system in Japan and how people are treated.

I did however, feel that the ending was a bit hasty. It was definitely one of the best books I have read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Usually am not interested in historical or factual fiction, but our book club chose this, and I reluctantly started reading it, only to find myself engrossed with the degree to which the author included wonderful metaphors that brought out extremely important philosopical points to me. The one I especially am referring to is the point at which Sayuri realized she must no longer focus on looking back at the un-retrieveable past, but from then on must face forward and look to the future. It is true for all of us. Read this book in your leisure and experience the nuances present on every page. It is more than a &quot;story.&quot; Much wisdom is present on these pages."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I notice that many of the negative reviews center on two criticisms: One, it was written by a man, and two, that it's not \\"Japanese\\". The first criticism is simply inane. That implies any man who ever wrote a female character, or vice versa, wrote beyond their \\"sphere of experience\\" and was by definition flawed. Of course Golden has the ability to understand and get into the mind of a Geisha. The simple act of writing a female character in first person does not make this a bad book, and anyone who thinks it does is foolish.Second, as for criticisms about the research, it is important to remember this book is a novel. Foremost it's a vehicle to convey a story while exposing the reader to a short timeframe of an incredibly complicated lifestyle; which itself is a tiny component of overall 1930's Japanese society. It is not meant to be a history book, not meant to be a dissertation on Geisha lifestyle, and it certainly isn't an attempt to emulate Geisha in Japanese literature. Again, to think this is anything other than a novel is foolish.Having said that, this IS a very well written and engaging novel. It's a page turner. Golden has a rare gift of prose - the reader is drawn in and kept in suspense. It's not complicated or deep - there are no hidden messages or deep revelations. This does not mean, however, that it is a sophomoric effort. Rather than being one dimensional, the characters are quite multifaceted, and I can only assume some of the negative reviewers didn't quite understand that. Hatsumomo is clearly a woman on top of her game, who is scared to death of her future and will use her intelligence and amoral conscience to protect herself. Sayuri is an intelligent and resourceful woman who, rather than being a submissive doll, is determined to find her own path to stand and succeed, as did her mentor Mameha. And yes, it was a sexist, degrading world they lived in with few options. Golden says this verbatim through his characters. To reviewers calling this a work of sexism, what exactly DO you think 1930's Japan was like?This is no a stellar work of literature. Golden never had any illusions as such. It's a simple, easy, engaging novel; a good story, with mildly complex characters in a well-researched setting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"With more than a thousand reader reviews already written about this remarkable novel, I'm sure there's nothing much more that I can add to it. But I'd still like to comment that this has got to be one of the best works of fiction that I have ever read. Being a Westerner, the author is highly commended for seeking out painstaking details on one aspect of Japanese culture that is sadly often misunderstood, and injecting so much life into his characters that you feel for each one of them tremendously.Although I was never one of those people who thought of geishas as &quot;prostitutes&quot; nor mere paid escorts, this book still managed to teach me a lot of things about their lives that I never knew before.While reading this book, it was quite hard to believe that it wasn't actually written by a real-life former geisha herself. I had to keep flipping to the author's acknowledgements at the end of the book to keep reminding myself of that fact!If you're in the mood for a novel that would take you on a breathtaking ride to another place and time, try this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's extraordinary novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, is quite a deceiving piece of literary work. After reading the book, the only thought in my head was my astonishment of how it could possibly be a work of fiction. Everything seems so real as Golden captures the essence of the the town of Kyoto pefectly through his amazing description, from the hem of a woman's kimono to the crash of the waves of the river against the bridge. The reader is magically transported into a new world of dancing, singing, and extravagant ceremonies o the most diligient of artisans: the geisha. Golden's extensive knowldege of the lifestyles of geisha allows the novel to flow easliy, as if spoken from the mouth of an actual geisha. It is the lifestyle that most do not get to taste, especially nowadays with its dying culture, but Golden opens a window and breaks the barrier of tongue, race, or sex, allowing one to learn the fascinating stories firsthand and walk behind the main character, Sayuri Sakamoto, through the entire novel. An amazing aspect of Memoirs of a Geisha was the wonderful selection of metaphors and similes that Golden had chosen to use. It seems as if each com parison was carefully selected, using the most interesting terms possible in order to create a vivid picture in the mind. The way Golden is able to capture a spectrum of different personalities, from her wistful childhood to her independent womanhood, within the same person also makes a lasting impact on the reader. As Sayuri grows and evolves, the reader feels as if he is as well, which has a remarkable effect ont he sense of attachment the reader feels to her. Almost anyone would thorougly enjoy this gem of a book, especially those readers that are searching for an original plot and want to experience a completely different kind of lifestyle. Through this one book alone, a person is able to transport themselves to Japan in the mid 1920's and live the enthralliong life of a geisha in order to find the beauty of a lost culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't think I could say enough positive things about this book in the space allotted! I decided to read it because I was curious what a geisha really was. I know most Westerners think them to be prostitutes but to me that didn't seem to be the whole of it. Indeed it's not. They are very skilled and cultured women who for the most part entertain men with stories, dances, and games. But that's not to say there isn't a little of the other involved in the job description. Namely in the ritual known as mizuage, the selling of their virginity.We learn about the life of geishas through a young Japanese girl named Chiyo. She was born to a poor family who painfully sale her and her older sister in hopes they'll have a better life. Chiyo is bought by a geisha house in real-life geisha district, Gion. We witness her struggle from maid to an apprentice and finally an actual geisha named Sayuri. The only problem that I could have with the book is the ending. I can understand why she ended up where she did... how else would she feel free to tell her story? But the build up was so great with wonderful tales and exquisite detail that the end seemed a little abrupt. On a whole the book is still good enough to make up for it.Read this book because it tells an amazing story filled with splendid characters, remarkable descriptions that make you see the story in your mind, and because you can't help but pick up some of the Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought arthur S. Golden's book portraying the life of a sucessful Geisha was enchanting. The book is so detailed, he describes every kimono so richly that the reader feels like they are in the room with the characters. The book is so captivating because it combines the romantic lifestyle of a first rate Geisha who worked her way up from nothing amid the beautiful backdrop of the way life was in a Japanese Geisha community in the early 20th century. What makes this book so special is how unusual it it, Golden captures the sense of pride and tradition of Japan and just how tough life can be."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden is a man and he is not Japanese but if there was a female, Japanese pseudonym on the cover you would never question it. He demonstrates a deep understanding of Japanese thinking and tradition in the values and personalities he assigns to his characters.He writes as Sayuri - a woman from a small fishing village - recounting \\"his\\" life story. Shortly after the story opens, Sayuri starts training to become a geisha (geisha translates into English as &quot;art-person&quot; or &quot;artisan&quot; not as &quot;prostitute&quot; as many people believe). The geisha were women skilled in the social arts who entertained their clients with witty conversation, music and dance among other things. As with many things in Japanese culture, these arts are very ritualistic and require rigorous training of the type the West normally associates with the martial arts.Sayuri's story, as she undergoes hardships to become a geisha and later as she takes her place in the social hierarchy, will amaze and bewilder people unfamiliar with Japan. It may even strike some as unbelievable but, to steal the old adage, fact has always been stranger than fiction.I found the book an enjoyable, easy read. The characterization was good and, through the characters' actions, Golden does a reasonable job of showing us the existence of some Japanese social norms such as tatemae (public face) and gaman (tolerance and perseverance)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a novel that should satisfy any reader's appetite for characters who live and places that are real. The protaganist is Sayuri whom we follow from her involuntary servitide to an 'okiya', a sort of boarding house for geisha, through her training as a geisha, to her position as one of the most adored in her profession. Through the author's simple prose and ample, but not overstated, use of detail, we are able to be in Sayuri's world; we are in the Gion teahouses with her while she displays her subtle graces to her wealthy customers and we come to understand the often intricate relationships between customer and geisha. Sayuri is a strong character who has aspirations even in the midst of the hardships of her servitute, the depression of the 1930s, and WW2. She is not perfect and I frequently thought her unlikeable; she is not immune from jealousy and treachery. But one very easily admires her strengths and is able to empathize with her actions in the setting of another culture. The author, who is male, has done his research well. He has succeeded in placing the readers in another culture and letting them enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wow. From the moment read its first words, it was impossible to put this book down at all. It really took my breath away. I'm surprised how well a Western author could, in such amazing detail, give us a first-person view of Japanese attitudes, lifestyle, and culture. This book makes want to visit the country all the more. In addition, I was captivated the emotional ups and downs of Sayuri's bittersweet life, from her heartwrenching separation from her family to her transition to life in a foriegn land. A well-written masterpiece overall."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have read lots of books that were said to be great but &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is the first that has lived up to all of its lovely reviews. The story begins with a young girl Chiyo-Chan, growing up in a poor town until being taken away from her family to a new town where the core of the story is. Chiyo-Chan now seperated from her family goes into training to become a geisha but it is not a smooth or easy road getting there. I strongly encourage anyone to read this book who would love to wrapped in a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The second I heard the *title* of this book, I knew I was going to love it. I have a weakness for fiction regarding Asian women (Kitchen God's Wife!), but even if I didn't, I would find this book amazing. Arthur Golden can write a woman's voice as well as any woman author I've read, and his attention to visual detail is near-perfect. I read this book on a 24-hour train ride, and I ignored most of the gorgeous Pennsylvania scenery in favor of Sayuri's world. I don't care who calls this book a treacly romance novel, I don't care if Sayuri's obsession with the Chairman is &quot;shallow&quot;, this is quite simply the best book I've read this year. I wish I could gather my words together and say exactly what I feel about _Geisha_, maybe I'll write another review when I can, I don't know. All I can say is that this story enchanted me and rooted itself so deeply in my mind that I was left disoriented upon finishing the book, thinking I could turn around, go back to New York, and find some way to meet Sayuri!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story unfolds with the heroine being sold to a geisha house to as a servant girl. She was selected because of her unique grey eyes, while her sister, being more common, was sold to a brothel. Despite her mistakes (like escaping through the toilet window and landing with a thud and injury), her luck takes a change for the better when a rich old Japanese man - referred to as the Chairman (who later becomes her benefactor and lover) is captivated by her beauty and arranges for her to be trained as a geisha. The heroine relates her own story through rose tinted glasses and regales her successes (such as being a great geisha of her time) as well as her failures (such as her search for her true love). She tells of her suffering through the second world war, almost becoming a kept woman of a badly disfigured man (all through which she continues to bear the torch for her true love). However, the story starts to drag and becomes pretentious when she swears that all she ever wanted was to be loved and noticed by the Chairman. She tells of how she eventually is reunited with her true love in a fairytale-like fashion. All in all, it is fun for easy reading on lazy sunday afternoon. Don't expect great literary talent here."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Yes, I am one of over 1,000 to review this fabulous book! I was so enthralled by every word.

Golden really must have thought, slept, ate like a geisha to be able to produce such intimate and womanly thoughts like Sayuri's. To me, the dialogue (down to the teasing tone) really sounded like the way a Japanese lady would speak, almost like a translation from a Japanese converastion. I think that's the effect Golden was trying to create to pull us into the narrative. Same goes for the interesting metaphorical language used. Asians, and the older generation especially, being more in touch with nature and superstition, always liked to use metaphors of nature and such to relate things to them. So it's just appropriate that Sayuri speak in this way too since Geisha's were from a past era. Those who felt the metaphors were overdone obviously could not appreciate the different language style of another culture. I just think this book makes for a GREAT read so go buy it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the best book I've read this year. Golden has done a wonderful job describing everything in such intricate detail and emotion. A romantically tragic story of a poor japanese girl turned popular geisha. Though not a new concept, it was still intriguing and bittersweet."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was glued to the words of this book from the beginning. It is erotic, exotic, and so well written you feel as if you are in Japan watching the story unfold. The ending however left much to be desired. I felt that the last 50 pages or so did not do justice to the book. It felt as if the author was suddenly tired of writing and quickly wrote an ending. It lacked the great story telling that the rest of the book has. I would, however, recomend this book highly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden has opened a previously unexplained world--the world of the classical Geisha. Narrated as a true story of one of Japan's most famous Geisha, the novel immerses us in the exotic world of the Geisha--women trained from childhood to be beautiful and graceful and to enchant men. While many westerners conceive of the Geisha as a high class prostitute, that concept is far from the truth. While a Geisha's virginity may be bid to the highest bidder, that is a one time affair with subsequent visits strictly non physical--the slight glance of a bear forearm or neck is considered erotic and pleasing. By the end of WWII, there were few classical Geisha left in Japan, especially in Kyoto where the most famous Geisha lived. The author has written a historically interesting and accurate account of a culture now vanished. The reader is drawn to the life story of the little girl, Chiyo, who becomes the lovely Geisha, Sayure. The tragedy, triumph, and romaqnce of her life are enthralling and exotic in modern culture and we have a glimpse inot a world of beauty and power and artistic performance beyond compare in western society. A must read for a book one can't pout down!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book deserves all of the wonderful reaction it has received. An enlightening yet engrossing look into the world of geisha and the Japanese culture. As a student of Oriental philosophy, I believe this book is written in language as simple as haiku and as image laden. The unique metaphors and the desciptions of the physical aspects of deep emotions were particularly poignant. As a lover of classical literature it is rare that I am so moved by anything written today. I believe this book is an instant classic ( and I do not say this lightly). As a woman however, I am dubious of its author's gender. Other reviewers have hinted at this, may I just come out and say that I don't believe this was written solely by a male. Perhaps the women Mr. Golden thanks had more than a little hand in this book? Otherwise, in my opinion Mr. Golden has achieved what all male writers before him have found impossible and that is to write a woman who is completely convincing to women. I can't wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is interesting to have a look at at Japan's geisha subculture and Golden does a good job in that respect. But the story is disappointing. Golden uses the voice of a woman but the story shows the perspective of a man - he gets the little things right but the big picture betrays him.The story is about the creation of a geisha. The geisha doesn't know it but she is being created by a man whom she coincidentally falls in love with and spends her geisha days conspiring to run into. In keeping with the place and time, and because she loves him (and to the delight of the author?), the geisha's physical and emotional well-being are completely tied to the whims of this man.In summary, he creates her and she loves him. And she has blue eyes. It's surprising that Golden didn't give her blonde hair and large breasts as well. He gets to create her twice - once as the author and once as the hero of the book.By the way, the old, self-sufficient women who were good at making money were portrayed as hideous, evil and heartless. In it's own way, this sort of thing is amusing but ...this book is a medium-sized waste of reading time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's novel is the best work ever to appear about the most unusual and enigmatic world of the Japanese Geisha. He has penetrated not only the mind of the Geisha but has opened to the western imagination much that is enigmatic of the Japanese character. I have never read a workd so dramatic and psychologically suspenseful yet crammed with factual details of the greatest complexity. His historical and cultural details are one hundred percent accurate. No one has ever explained so well the art of the kimono, which in Japan is a genre frequently overlooked because of its utilitarian nature. Add to all these virtures a literary style of the highest order, a style clearly in the tradition of a Nabokov. This is a novel that may be appreciated by the Japonicaphile as well as the ordinary western (i.e., American) reader having no knowledge of Japanese culture or history. His description of Japanese life, especially the life of Kyoto, before and between the wars is a treasure in itself. No student of modern Japanese history and culture should fail to read this marvelous work."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was a true page turner.

After reading a few chapters I was proved wrong. I instantly purchased the book and on my long road to Vegas(restless 14 year olds need something to do for 6 hours) I was kept occupied with this mesmerizing book.Under the artistic and eye catching cover lies something even more beautiful, the tale of Sayuri, a girl who once was a daughter of an old fisherman transforming into one of the world's most renowned geisha. Sold to an okiya(geisha household)at the age of 9, Sayuri falls into a whirl pool of deceit, loss, betrayal, pain, and lonesome. In the clutches of Mother(head of house),Auntie, and Granny, Sayuri must learn to somehow deal with Hatsumomo, the geisha who basically pays the bills at the okiya. Hatsumomo day by day tortures Sayuri(who first is similar to a maid in geisha training) and taunts her. Blaming her for lost items and her own troubles, Hatsumomo succeeds in Sayuri having to pay a debt that will never be repaid and is soon posed as a \\"bad apple\\" and her geisha training is put on hold until Mameha(Hatsumomo's rival) decides to carry Sayuri under her wings.Every caterpillar gets into its coccoom and becomes a butterfly.Honest to G-d, this book was sheer bliss to read. Nothing dissapointed me about this book, except that it ended much too soon.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" flawlessly chronicles Sayuri emerging as a woman and beautifully depicts the mysterious life of geisha.The story seduces the reader with the delicate beauty of Japan and the innocence of a young girl. Arthur Golden paints a beautiful picture with descriptive words and a thick, creative, and no doubt unforgettable story plot.Touching and romantic, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a book you do not want to ignore. While reading, I suggest a tissue box at your side. There are many joyful moments(especially the bittersweet ending, ONE OF THE BEST ENDINGS I HAVE EVER READ)and very sad ones that will start the waterworks.Highlights of this book include the imaginitive, realistic, and honest point of view of the main character, Sayuri.

This book is a must read and requires a place on your shelf."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Okay, i too read this book very quickly, but i loved it so much. i didn't see any flaw in the characterizations and the people seem very believable. i wasn't able to predict where this book was going and i liked that. i cried for her and you felt her pain. you saw the transition, the metamophosis from the poor little fishing village girl to the full fledged geisha she eventually, through hardships and work. the characters and descriptions are right on and you should read this, it is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I usually read books of a non-fiction nature, for the simple fact that most fiction books I've ready are so boring. I picked this one up at the train station though because I forgot to bring something along with me to read. I'm so thankful for it too! This is one of the BEST books I've EVER read in my life. The author really has a way of drawing the reader into the book, as if you were really there. The characters are very well rounded, and the descriptions of people and places, and senses is very well done. If you don't know anything about the Saigon Geisha in real life, especially during the war, the author does a great job of relating very real, true facts about them and their way of life through this work of fiction. This is a book that I look forward to reading again and again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Absolutely charming. In spite of the brutally accurate description of the subservient role women faced (still?) in Japan, I was immediately fond of the main character and the purity of her perspective on life. If this is Golden's first published novel, I look forward to his future works. Like the song \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" by U2, similes emerge as this authors favorite literary tool. While they are darned-good similes there frequency brought me out of the Gion district of Kyoto and back into the chair in which I sat."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Through this whole story I thought it was non fiction, until the end when my fellow Lit. group members told me it was not. I couldn't believe it! The story was horrific in many ways, very demeaning to women I thought at first, but these women seem to enjoy the Geisha world, very different from our own. It is a society unto itself, with Geisha who have more power and men to provide well for them, and the underling Geisha in training, some of whom are treated as slaves while learning what it is to be a Geisha. There is much ritual involved and can have a good or horrid end for them. A fascinating read about something I knew nothing about, exept what is on TV. A glimpse into a culture not near my own."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"WOW!it's not often that i come across a book this long and of this genre that i can finish in a few days. This book, however, would not stay shut. it was very persistant; whenever i was doing any work it would call to me to read it.....and i would obey. written in beautiful, adolescent detail, this is a book so realistic it is almost impossible to believe that it is fiction.i'm serious, this is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to say that this was one of the best books I've ever read. I believe that any woman who reads it can truly relate to this young girls life. I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wonderful! Captivating from the very start."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fascinating book. I had no idea what Geishas really were. This book is very well written. Hard to put down- just a great story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; profiles the last gasp of an essential element of Japanese culture. Though most Americans think of &quot;geisha&quot; as synonmous with &quot;prostitute,&quot; nothing could be farther from the truth. The women who lived the life of a &quot;Geisha&quot; were well-educated and highly sophisticated, a rarity for &quot;average&quot; woman in the stifiling confines of Japan's male dominated society.The story of this real-life Geisha and her mentor is both touching and historically insightful. From her birth at the height of Geisha glory, through Japan's painful defeat in World War II, this story is a peek not only into the secret world of Geisha culture but also a look at what it means to be Japanese--something few Americans truly understand.This beautifully-written book is a joy to read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is amazing. What makes it so interesting is its vivid character development and cultural/historical accuracy. Although the descriptions of Geisha life are enthralling, the book also has an important message about inner and outer strength, communicated through the development of the heroine."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I love the female fantasies of Geishas, Ballerinas, Bellydancers, Princess and have been wanting to read this book after everyone I know recommended it to me, saying I would love it. I did. So, if you have hesitation because of all the hype and worried it wouldn't live up to expectations, don't worry. I was wondering where it would all go when it opens in a small dreary fishing village, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. The descriptions of the costumes and the life of Geishas were intricatly woven into a beautiful story about a woman you grow to care about deeply."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden is on to something. His many years as an American living in Japan has given him unusual insight into the culture of pre-World War II Japan.This story of a beautiful young girl from a small fishing village, taken away from her dying parents (with her sister) and sold into slavery as a geisha, reads like a well-told autobiography. A fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the interplay between geisha and patron, geisha and customer, geisha house and Japanese culture.An excellent, well-written book with only a few very minor rough edges in the writing. It's a believable, poignant and interesting read. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To read Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is to sink into a new and strange pool of water and watch the light change colour on the surface of the pool. He writes beautifully of the transformation of little Chiyo into the geisha Suyari (both the changes inside her but also, important for a geisha, the outward changes required of her) and introduces the reader into an exotic, new world along with the young protaganist. The majority of the novel is this story of becoming a geisha and that is the part of this book that is so magical. The cast of supporting characters (geisha and their clients) is wonderful. The book picks up speed with the World Wars and falters a little with the somewhat forced ending but the magic of the bulk of the book before all of this will carry the reader joyously over anything. This was a marvelous and knowing novel that will transport the reader."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There is not much to be said about this book that hasn't already been said. I'd been meaning to read it for years, and when I finally did, I was not disappointed. Golden has created a world that so few of us know anything about. I certainly cannot speak to the accuracy of his depiction of the life of a pre-WWII Geisha, but was captivated none-the-less.His portrayal of the character of Sayuri is not fairy-tale perfect as so many have implied. I found the character believably flawed-particularly in her treatment of Nobu, the gruff-but-kind, disfigured businessman who chooses her to be his mistress. And, even in her later days in New York, she still seemed to maintain an aura of artificiality, as though the role of the Geisha could not be shed.I couldn't help but be swept up in the world Golden has created. The story is well-worth the hype it has generated."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thumbed through this book at the bookstore for almost a year before I finally borrowed it from the library...and then regretted having waited so long to experience this interesting story. Golden follows the life, love and intrigue of Sayuri, a poor Japanese girl basically sold into the geisha profession in the 1920s. Golden spent 10 years researching the geisha culture, and breaks many Western stereotypes of the profession while being praised for his ability to capture Japanese culture so innately."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was an interesting and addicting read. Great story! It was very informative and eye opening to hear about the lives of the geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A rare, and exquisitely beautiful read. Like a snowflake perfectly preserved, I will be completely enraptured each and every time I read Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Now, a lot has been said about this book, from the accuracy to the writing style, and everything in-between. Most people (both those who like and those who dislike) make valid points. But I give this book 4 stars, and here's why:When I read a novel, I read for entertainment. I don't mind if the author decides to mess just a little with reality or change history a bit, as long as reading the novel is a rewarding experience. Memoirs of a Geisha is just that. I read this story and get lost between its pages. (Well, a Kindle book doesn't have pages, but I think you get my drift.) I feel Chiyo/Sayuri's anguish, her confusion and frustration, her innocent uncertainty, her determination in the face of overwhelming odds. That's what I love in a novel.Now, if this were an actual memoir, I would feel outraged that details are wrong and the culture isn't 100% spot-on. If it were a historical account, I'd be angry. But it isn't supposed to be nonfiction. For what it is, I enjoy it. I take Memoirs of a Geisha at face-value, as a fictional account of a girl's struggles in a land I'm not all that familiar with. I suggest anyone else reading it do the same."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed \\"turning\\" every page on my kindle. I expected as much being that this was the second time I've read this book in a few years. Still, I felt very moved at most of these scenes.I loved SayuriI LOVED Hatsumomo, oddly enoughAnd I LOVE LOVE LOVED Mameha.If you've seen the movie and loved it, forget it. You'll love the book so much more. I know I do."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I dearly love this book, mostly because the imagery is so beautiful. I find myself enthrall in Sayuri's story and wish I could find more books like this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for the story as much as I did to learn more about old Japan and how a geisha really lived her life. You can tell the author did a ton of research in writing this and I did enjoy the story line."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought the movie was great but, the book is even better. Full of details that were left out of the movie.I have not put this down... every chance I get I emerge myself in this beautiful story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"what more can i say - heart breaking and heart warming at the same time.i really love this story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Ahhh, Memoirs of a Geisha, an incredible story filled with vivid descriptions and well-developed characters. The reader is mesmerized as Nitta Sayuri recounts her rise, beginning with abject poverty as a young child, to become one of Japan's most celebrated Geisha. A true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story is so epic and intimate at the same time. Mr. Golden envelopes you in Sayuri's world so completely, it's easy to lose yourself and feel as though it's just you and she sitting comfortably having a conversation about her extraordinary life. There are books that come along that are rare and precious ~ this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is a MUST. Totally transports you into another time and culture. Unputdownable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and read it in only 3 days. I can't believe the way a male author realistically captures the universal feelings of a young woman, such as unrequited love and insecurity about the future. The fact the setting is earlier this century in Japan makes the novel even more fascinating."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"the characters are a written with realism and sympathy, and you get a real insight into the way that poeples minds work. The plot is convincing, and even the &quot;translator's note&quot; at the beginning seemed real. Tons of research muist have gone into this book, and it is a really beautiful read. The author gives the reader a look at a foreign, lovely world fluently...Sayuri is a thoroughly likeable, yet human character, and every sentence gives your imagination something to wonder at. This is a book for everyone !"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So compelling in fact that I missed my stop at the train station! I finished all 400 plus pages in barely a week; I found time to read that I never knew I had! Golden has done an amazing job describing a life that most of us would never know about otherwise. My only problem is, what can I read next!?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was a pure delight to read. Well written and researched, and so interesting! I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must agree the title is not appealing to me at all. But when i sat down and read, i slowly drift into the story itself. I felt as if I am Suriya's friend, seeing her through her life. I simply cant leave the book alone. Very well-written!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Credits to Golden as a westerner to portrait a geisha's life and thinking. I would give a B+ to that respect. Good attempt at portraiting life of Japanese at war, but not in-depth enough. Good job in the creation of Chiyo and Sayuri - From the book I can feel the transformation of the child into a woman through her conversation. I do enjoy the first part of the book better. As to storyline, it's a bit to long winded after Chiyo becomes Sayuri, the real Geisha. I am having a hard time finishing the last part of the book (still have 20 pages to go) As a book I expect more depth and literature touch. Reading the book gives me the feeling of watching a Japanese soap opera."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When the friend who gave me this book to read said &quot;let me know how you like it &quot; I thought, &quot;oh no I'm actually going to have to read it!&quot; By reading the title, I thought it was going to be another sex book. On the contrary, it is a novel that is tastefully written. In a nutshell, it is a story about a girl's life and how she came to be a Geisha. It is written in first person and it is as if she is sitting across the table talking about her thoughts and feelings about her life over a cup of tea. It is wonderfully written, each chapter taking you to the next, you will not want to put it down. Someone should make a movie out of this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's a long time since I have read a book which has intrigued and excited me as much as Memoirs of a Geisha has done. I finished it the other day, want to read it again very soon, but feel I must let what I have read sink in before I read it again and possibly gain even more insights into the lives of geisha during the thirties and forties. On the one hand their lives were glamorous, yet on the other, they were very bleak, as they dedicated their lives to entertaining the somewhat chauvinistic men of that time. Sayuri, the heroine, is intelligent and caring, but nevertheless learns to accept her life of service as befits a true geisha. Golden seems to have been able to enter the very feminine world of the geisha, he portrays the life with sensitivity and understanding. A great achievement considering he is a man looking at a very specialised women's way of life. I would recommend this book as a wonderful, thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I haven't picked up a book this enjoyable in a long time"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was a beautifully written novel, enchanting from start to finish. The reader is transported from a small town then to the intriguing geisha world in Kyoto. There were very few flaws with the novel. For one, I did not buy into the final relationship between the Chairman and Sayuri, I felt that she was in love with an idea or symbol versus the actual character. Also, there was a need for further developement in that relationship as well as some of the other subplots (i.e., Sayuri's relationship with Pumpkin, Hatsumono, and Mameha). However, the author captured the Japanese geisha culture in a spellbounding, beautifully written novel, which could not be put down! Bravo Arthur Golden!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is by far the best book I have read in a long time. The story gives you a window into so many worlds, not just Giesha culture but Japanese culture, war, slavery and triumph."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After finishing this beautiful, enthralling book, I kept wondering why a Japanese writer could not have written it. Then, I remembered about the wonderful and exotic world created by Bernardo Bertolucci in his movie &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, and understood why. If an Asian had directed that movie, it would have been something completely different. I'm hoping that a Japanese translation of the book will come out soon, so that more Japanese people can become immersed in a world which they have never known, or almost forgotten. I would especially like my grandmother born in 1911 to read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wow!! What a fabulous book. I want to read more about the Geisha's of Japan, and the stories they have to share. How fortunate we are to have choices that these women were never given!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's hard to give this book just 3 stars. Maybe it's a 4. I have really enjoyed reading it (in 4 days) and it's hard to put down. I am not sure why the other readers are so hard against it. Of course it's fiction, but it's very interesting. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book to be entrancing. It captured my attention from the get go. I fould Golden's descriptions of the Geisha traditions and lifestyle to be beautifully described. Not to mention his ability to capture the essence of Japan during the time period. I felt as though I were sitting in some of those teahouses with Sayuri. Definately a recommended read. Not only entrancing and entertaining but also informative. I now have a new interest in reading more on the Geisha culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I love the opening of a little pocket of the world that is so remote from my understanding of the world and seems removed and unimportant to me -- and is so much a part of someone else's world -- it is all that they know. I have experienced this feeling many times having moved so often in my life. You break into a new place, learn a new place and people (every region of the US has proven distinct to me) then you move away and it is sad at first and then so far away its hard to remember the sadness, but it's there and it makes itself a part of experience.The language inside the book kept my eyes running at (happily) with its beauty and escriptiveness. I felt very sad during many &quot;scenes&quot; in this story. Had a hard time putting the book down, so I finished it faster than my normal pace.Steven Spielberg has the movie rights to &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and the film is slated for December of 2000. He has pursued in excellent detail other social pieces and I hope this is one - I'll be in line for it if so."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must admit that I had many preconceived notions about this book before I ever picked it up. My mother has a copy, so I skimmed the first few pages of it out of curiosity. I could not put the book down, and read it in three evenings. Is it great literature? Probably not. Is it a very compelling story containing its share of poetry? Definitely yes. If you have lived and worked in Japan for years and years, you will undoubtedly pick this book apart and beat it senseless until you have assured yourself that you know more about Japanese culture than the author could ever hope to. However if, like me, you know next to nothing about Japanese culture, and even less about the geisha arts (all these years, I thought that geishas were merely prostitutes), then this book will give you not only a good story but a bit of knowledge as well. Some of the other criticisms of the book are laughable. Only an American living on the eve of the 21st century could make them. Don't read this book unless you approach it with a rather open mind and the knowledge that women did not always and everywhere live as freely and with as many options as in the USA of 1999. Loving the Chairman was one of the few willing actions of Chiyo/Sayuri's life. Isn't it interesting that many of the other reviewers would have liked to see her deprived of this?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am amazed that the (white, male, jewish) author was able to so convincingly portray a geisha of that era! The details are rich, the characters convincing, and the plot holds you. I felt like I was part of this distant world. So far the best book I've read this year."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The subject matter of this novel is extremely intriguing. Therefore, it is all the more dissappointing in the telling. The author can't capture the voice of his title character. She is precious and undeveloped. There is very little tension or psychological revelation in the telling. This is an overhyped book, ripe for the Steven Spielberg treatment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"People are way too hard on this book. I have read about 6 other excellent books about geisha since this one, and I don't find any gross inaccuracies like some people claim. For starters, it would be inaccurate if it were a biography of Mineko Iwasaki, but since it was never intentionally written to be about her (or the culture of her times), I don't see anything \\"wrong\\" about it. Misuage was real, sorry. I still can't believe she sued him, and for the record, Sayuri's story is twice as interesting as Mineko's. Memoirs of a Geisha was written by an American man and should be treated as such: A fantasy novel for western women. Have *FUN* with it! It was a hit with Japanese critics, likely because it's not as trendy there to discredit the research of Arthur Golden like it is here.As for character depth and development, visual imagery, and understanding of a female's mind in childhood and young adulthood- this is one of the greatest works of fiction I've ever read. I wish the author wrote more books."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are only two types of books, one that you need an extra push to help you finish, and another which seems to possess some kind of mysterious force that keep pulling you through to the end. Sadly, the second type is quite a rare commodity, but I can assure you, Memoirs of a Geisha is exactly this type.The pace of the book is perfect. Arthur Golden is incredibly adept at turning words into lively pictures in his readers' heads through his remarkable use of narrative skills. Let me give you an example:\\"Grief is a most peculiar thing; we're so helpless in the face of it. It's like a window that will simply open of its own accord. The room grows cold, and we can do nothing but shiver. But it opens a little less each time, and a little less; and one day we wonder what has become of it.\\"How beautiful, isn't it? And also how true it rings! You will come across analogies like this throughout the entire book.Geisha is a seldom explored territory in the English literature, but Arthur Golden had done such an excellent job in portraying the struggles and life of a Geisha that you can hardly believe it's just his debut work.Absolutely captivating."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you have only experienced the movie, let me make it as clear as possible: you have barely scraped the surface. This a very rich and rewarding novel that will absorb you into another time, a far away land and a completely alien mentality. Welcome to the Floating World of the Geishas in its twilight.This is loosely based on the true story of Mineko Iwasaki (whose much more accurate autobiography is also available under the titleGeisha: A Life) presented in the form of a novel by a brilliant Arthur Golden (too bad he did not follow up his success with a second novel).Japan in the years following WWI was a country in transition. The old ways were on their way out yet they have a way of soothing the soul of any nation, especially one found itself caught in limbo, between progress and tradition. In this transitional world Sayuri is offered the chance to become a Geisha. The unique color of her eyes, her patience and artistic abilities soon propel her to the position of the most famous Geisha of them all. But one should always be wary of what he wishes for.Fame and success are never a guarantee for personal happiness. Predictably, Sayuri's love story is bittersweet and has many false starts. In fear of spoilers, I shall only say that life is never boring.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Just read an excerpt..or the first page and you will see that it pulls you into the story immediately and it never lets you go. I was never bored and fell so deeply into this story and into the imagery and emotion that I wish I could find another book that could take me on a such a journey as this book did. I've been searching but have not found its likeness. I was blown away that this story was written by a man and not by a Japanese Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"this book was very detailed. i read it after watching the movie, and learned more in the first few pages than i did from the entire film. i won't summarize as others have done that, suffice it to say this is a story about the life of a geisha. i thought that though the author was very descriptive, i wasn't compelled to immerse myself in the book. sometimes i felt the author's writing style to be uncomfortably detailed. i do enjoy detailed writing, but... i don't know what it was but at some points i just felt uncomfortable. maybe that was the author doing his job well as i know if i lived in japan at that time i'd be pretty uncomfortable, but people can write about uncomfortable subjects and not make it uncomfortable to the reader, so i guess i didn't enjoy his writing style. in fact if i remember correctly i put this down for a while somewhere in the middle of it and then convinced myself to finish it. of course it didn't help that i knew the basic story line, even if i didn't enjoy the writing style i'll stick it our for a good story, but that part was kind of spoiled for me.the story itself was fascinating though. it covers a very interesting subject and is very much worth the read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is hands down one of the best books ever written. The details, clarity, and insight into this secret world of geisha's (completely misunderstood by the West's need to categorize everything) is written as this is truly the memoirs of Sayuri. However, she does not exists, she is a compilation of the author's many interviews.The way that he embodied her life, her fears, her hopes, and her sorrows was masterful. If you are looking for a good read this summer, I would put this on the top of the list.On a side note: bypass the movie, once you have read the book it will only anger you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Goodness me, there are plenty of reasons for me to despise this book. But, as it is pretty much a blatant Cinderella and I am a fairy tale freak, I read it and absolutely loved it. Every time I tried to critique I became once again raptured. The writing is beautiful, if it does focus mostly on conversation, but it still manages to greatly capture Sayuri's thoughts and look on the world. Frankly, I despised her as a character as she was utterly silly, but one could not help but be entranced by her story and those of the people she knew. If analyzed from the perspective of Cinderella, this is a Cinderella story that analyzes and tosses into cold reality every detail of the story. But it's all there, in a truly intoxicating story that explores the world of Japan. I don't know enough about the country to know the accuracy, but each detail was enjoyable just the same. Definitely a girly book, but something the hopeless romantic will always appreciate."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to say, that I am impressed with this book. It took me until the end of the book where the author stated that it is purely fiction to realize that what I had just read, in fact, had never happened! I was so sure that this story was an actual memoir, that I read the introduction over, the author's last note over, and then had to look online for anyone to tell me differently. I still can't believe it's not true. It was such a great story.The story follows Chiyo (or Sayuri, as she later comes to be known) through her life as she strives to become a Geisha after being sold as a child. The emotion in the story is amazingly real, and the events that take place are enthralling. I like that Arthur doesn't take a dramatic turn in the book by having a character do something you wouldn't expect. It seems more like a real memoir that way.This was an interesting book to read. If you have seen the movie and loved it, you will also love the book, though, I recommend reading the book first. This is a great opportunity to peak into the Japanese culture as it was before WWII. The culture is alive and deep in this book. Arthur Golden did his research pretty well. I loved being able to see life through the eyes of Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I did not find this book to be an easy read. However, it was worth the effort. It follows the life of a young girl, who becomes a celibrated geisha, from pre World War 2 Japan to her later life in the United Sates. It is a fascinating look at another culture, and has very well writtne and deliniated characters. It was,for me, at times difficult to identify with the characters and their motivations, but this is because it is a different culture. I definitely recommend this book though. Just stick with it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"We rated the novel, Memoirs of a Geisha written by Arthur Golden 5 stars because it shows the interesting aspects of a geisha's life. It took you through the experiences of a young girl who is forced into the life of a geisha. The reader is immersed into this great story and follows the tragedies and triumphs of the soon-to-be geisha, Sayuri. She encounters some very difficult times in her life and it feels as if the reader is following Sayuri through her experiences. She is taken away from her family and sold to become a geisha in a district called Gion, living with a family and a famous geisha, Hatsumomo. Hatsumomo is a very jealous of Sayuri's unique beauty and this causes feudalism between the two. Hatsumomo does anything she can to get into Sayuri's way of becoming a geisha.Arthur Golden uses strong metaphors and depicts the lives of the Japanese geisha very clearly. For these geishas, beauty is everything. It is like a competition trying to see who is the most successful geisha, where rivals emerge and obstacles get in the way. Memoirs of a Geisha is a must-read book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Considering this is Golden's first novel written from a female's viewpoint, I'm impressed. I learned much about pre-WW2 Japanese culture; Golden painted his research into the picture without the story turning into an encyclopedia entry. If you like biographies, you would like this book even though it is fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished this book last night and I have to say that it is one of the best books I have ever read! I could not put this one down. It's a novel, but reading it it really seems like the life story of a geisha in Japan. It has all the emotions in it. Anger, sadness, love... (you know what emotions are) This book prompted me to want to learn more about geisha, especially the contrasts between practices of earlier geisha and geisha in more modern times. The best thing is that 3/4 of the way through this book I learned that Steven Speilberg is planning on directing a movie of Memoirs of a Geisha. You can bet I'm looking forward to that! I totally recommend this book to everyone. It is destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The prose flows nicely and is very pleasing to read. The story is like entering into someone's life that is normally forbidden to know of and experiencing it vicariously."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I first read this book, I thought it was one of those comman historical fiction books. But it wasn't! Not only would you explore the world of a geisha, (with being a beginner,apprentice, novice and geisha).And learning how beauty and manners was everything. But this book also explores the world beyond a growing geisha in training named Sayuri. It shows how she she struggles with people and a rival like:Hatsumomo. This book is great for historical fiction lovers and just readers that are touched by dramactic novels.I give it 2 thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An absolute must for holiday traveling. Sayuri's story unfolds gently, affording the reader an evolving awareness of a lost cultural heritage. The pace is far from slow, however, with an engaging story-telling style and unique characters that keep pages turning. Although the story spans a lifetime, Golden has captured the essence of his character as she develops from a child, to a young woman and through adulthood. While some subplots and characters leave you aching for more development, the total work is engaging. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was skeptical of this book and almost didn't buy it. Once I got to page 2, I couldn't put it down. I read it while walking to work, while waiting in lines, on my lunch break, and every other moment I could carve out some time. I couldn't put it down. I thought Arthur Golden did an amazing job of bringing the reader into this exotic and little known world. Even though he lives 5 minutes from where I do, you'd think he were a Geisha girl himself! This is the best book I've read in a long time. I bought several copies to give as holiday gifts to friends."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Totally fascinating, I felt every emotion Sayuri described. As I read more of the book I was drawn into the depth of the the true feelings of someone who had lived through these experiences. The way in which the book was written made it easy to imagine the life of the Geisha, the good times and the hardships of a young orphaned girl whose life is transformed in a totally unimaginable way. I couldn't put this book down, but I didn't want it to end, not just tears and laughs but real life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Upon reading this book for the first time, my dormant interest in Japan soared. Wonderful sweeping vocabulary coupled with an astonishing grasp of human emotion (suprising that the heroine is poignantly described by a man). The story tells the rather typical tale of a Japanese girl unprovided for in a backwater fishing village. Sold as a geisha and telling of a lifetime. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was a wonderful historical fiction. I was so enthralled with the customs and rituals that a geisha had to go through. The book is well written and very powerful as it tells of the worst of times and the best of times of a geisha. I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I picked up this book, I was ready to be amazed and not once did it disappoint me. The way Arthur Golden describes the kimonos and the way of life, was absolutely breath-taking. The life of geisha is so intriguing. I plan to read up on more books about geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For someone who has been eyeing modern novels askance for a long while, as though afraid of being bitten by the disappointment bug once more (the more hyped, the more disappointing usually), I was recommended by two people to read this novel and was surprised and delighted to find it not only a wonderful, fully fleshed out novel (not the usual dull acutely self-conscious, complacent autobiography maskerading as novel) but a novel that not only contains developed characters, a point, motivation, and loads of interesting details, insight and perception (from an apprentice geisha's point of view -- no mean feat), but written by a man to boot! A man really interested in women as human beings, rather than the usual objectification which is really nothing more than a negative projection of the male psyche. This is a lovely novel and I become completely absorbed in it everytime I pick it up and find myself unwilling to put it down. It has been such a long time since I have had this experience with a piece of modern fiction that I just have to celebrate it with a review to Amazon!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book difficult to get into in the beginning. It was different than what I normally read and interesting, yet not engaging. About 1/3 to half way through, though, I found myself really involved in the storyline and the characters. Very well researched, interesting characters, a lot of emotion. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Goldens story, Memoirs of a Geisha, has very beautiful sentences and descriptive passages. The problem with the book is that not one Asian male in the book is interested in anything other than money and sex. Sure, the chairman gave her a hanky to dry her tears and money for an ice cream, but why... Well, turns out later he wants to &quot;help&quot; the little girl become a great geisha. Arthur, stretch yourself, you could have had one decent asian male in the book. This is a time for bringing the world together not a time to flame the fires of prejudice and unreasonable bias."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"How could anyone find a better word than MIZUAGE to describe &quot;the first time a man's eel explores a woman's cave&quot; ? Arthur Golden opens a window to an unknown world of eroticism, humiliation and exploitation, describing with mysterious accuracy the refined fortress of Kyoto Geishas Culture along the present century. Just before her death, an old Japanese Geisha settled in New York tells the story of her life. The seductive power of the narrative voice of this legendary Geisha takes the reader to a between wars Japan, still full of feudal echoes and to one of the Japanese traditions which inspires more curiosity in western societies: the Geisha, a peculiar cultural tradition linked with such arts as seduction, music, dancing or the classical ceremony of tea."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After repeated recommendations, I finally decided to give this book a try. I was completely engaged almost immediately. The description of this aspect of Japanese culture and the life of this poor girl sold into a life that is a bizzare mixture of luxury and slavery was fascinating. Once the conflict with the other geishas in her house was resolved, however, the story degenerated into a somewhat predictable love story. Still an enjoyable read, and a great source of information about a very foreign world."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fictional piece that chronicles the life of geisha Nitta Sayuri. Born in Yoride, a fishing village on Japan's east coast, around 1920, she was sold to Gion in Kyoto as an apprentice geisha. The memoires are alleged to have been recorded in Sayuri's New York appartment over a period of two years in the 1990's. Golden provides us with an account of the mysterious life a geisha leads at the height of its popularity before WWII, the way it survived during the Great Depression and its temporary closure near the end of the war. The Western perception of this antiquated art form is largely mistaken and we are provided with an explanation that is both harsh and forgiving. Golden is a Japanophile and his research has produced a novel that is enjoyable and eye opening. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who has an interest in Japanese culture and/or is intending to visit Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was surprised to learn that some people didn't adore this book as much as I did. I thought it haad nothing boring, the story kept up, I couldn't put it down! I learned so much from it and it touched me so deeply. It was eloquent and beautiful and I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have just recently finished reading &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;. It took me two weeks to read and I must say that having to put it down to go to work was a challenge. I simply couldn't put the book down. It was brilliantly written. I find it amazing that a man can write so beautifully from a woman's perspective especially a woman who is from a land that tends to be so foreign to us. I found myself wondering many times about what Sayuri would be up to next. It was a joy to read this book, I am so glad I bought it. I have recommended this book to several of my friends and they are enjoying it as well."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the book to be very good over-all. The research and attention to detail was excellent. I probably could not have found a better book to read, if I wanted to learn about the Geisha culture. I was disappointed, though, that although 'written' as a true story, it was, in fact, purely fiction. Also, the book was fairly predictable, and full of cliche. Still, overall I found it enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I visited the US recently, my friend told me that Steven Spielberg planned on making a movie about this book. I finally bought the book last week and I was totally engrossed to the detriment of my job and family (luckily I read fast). If you have any idea of what life was like for a wealthy family during that era, you will understand this book. My hat is off to you Mr Golden for causing me to constantly ask if this book really had been written by a young American male. My husband will read it now and when he is finished I will send it to my mother who was born and raised in Japan at this time. Maybe she is the better one to pass an opinion on this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was one of the best that I have read this year. I stayed up late into the night reading it. The characters were so vivid and real. It also gave a good description of Japan and the geisha culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I actually thought the book was a true biography. I had no idea till the end that in was fiction. The book kept me interested and I had a hard time putting it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoy this book immensely, great view into an unreachable world. Scary and intriguing. Golden writes so convincingly in the voice of a geisha it makes for a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Initially I was very reluctant to read this novel as it seemed a bit boring from the excerpt I read on the internet. So you can imagine my surprise once I started reading and found myself fully engrossed and completely riveted. I was completely dispossessed of my misinterpretations and wrongful early pre-judgements. Forgetting that I was located in a one bedroom highrise in Chicago, I was completely transported to the teahouses and found myself actually observing the rituals of the geishas and their customers. At times I felt as if I myself were wearing the beautiful kimonos described in the novel. To forget that you are reading much less reading fiction is what I consider a literary work of art, and this is the best way I can sum up Memoirs of a Geisha. Thank you Mr. Golden.Simone A."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"although i am asian myself, japanese culture is so far removed from my own that i still found the descriptive parts of the book enthralling. i admit to being raised in a more westernized setting and it truly did alter some preconceptions i had of the meaning of the word geisha. however, i did expect so much more, and i've come to wonder at some of the pettiness involved in the plot. i wasn't so much expecting a love story but a peek into the secret world of the-mistress-that-isn't, and i guess although the author did reveal unchartered territory for me, i still found something lacking by his concentrating on the love story. i do have to admit, though, that the romance aspect was a bit touching, and i found myself feeling for the characters; not so much Sayuri or the Chairman, but rather Nobu, the underdog who never did anything to deserve being treated as he was. but then of course, this too reflects real life, right? maybe i'm just cynical, or maybe it's simply that i don't believe in huge turnarounds, but to me the ending would have been more poignant if it didn't end exactly the way all love stories seem to: with seemingly unrequited love being confessed in the span of one sitting and eventually conquering all. get real. nothing had been resolved. he stayed away from her for fifteen years because his friend was in love with her, and suddenly decided to hell with that only when his friend was disappointed with her. what then of his loyalty to his friend that kept him away for so long? and if you're going to bring in the whole true-love angle, why then did he stay away for so long? by now you're probably wondering why i gave the book 4 stars at all. don't get me wrong... i *did* enjoy reading it; the setting was fabulous and the characters intriguing. i just think that if he chose for the so-called memoirs of this geisha to center on one particular love story of hers, its complexity would have been better appreciated than a tidy wrap-up of an anti-climax."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and began it without full knowledge of what I was getting myself into. What an uplifting story in so many ways! I couldn't put it down. For true historians of Japanese history, you'll find that even though the author takes some liberties in producing a work of fiction ( i.e. the importance and formality of some ceremonies, etc), he does do well in addressing the situation in Japan at the time of the war from a perspective much different than that of a normal person. What I liked best about the book was that I gained an interesting perspective into a world that has really been swept away with westernization. It is certainly well written, never baudy, but very eloquent and respectful to the culture, language, and tradition."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A &quot;memior&quot; written by a man which is fully feminine and wholly human."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"great book, makes you think of stereotypes a bit differently and how other cultures live. One of those books that you need to find out what happens at the end but try not to read the last page first."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As an Asian American female, I find myself agreeing with other more cynical reviewers.Golden's attempt to prop his fantasy viewpoint within the historical backdrop of his novel falls completely flat. Granted, he manages to create a meticulously crafted world, but much like Lucas in Phantom Menance, in this case, effects override the actual plot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The girl at the bookstore said she and all her friends just loved it. Was hoping for something alone the lines of Shogun. Wasn't Shogun. Didn't love it. Was tempted to stop reading several times, but hoped it would improve. It took so long to get where it was going. I did learn about the life of a Geisha, but would have preferred something richer. The men, even the Chairman, were mostly jerks and so immature. Drinking contests! The word &quot;love&quot; was never mentioned. I would have run away, for sure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wonderfully told tale of a girl who grows up in a fishing village to become a successful geisha in Gion, a geisha district in Kyoto. The story has been told before of a young, poor girl rising to success through perseverance and luck; but the setting and time period is unique. Entertaining read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I would compare this to Amy Tan's books, although not quite as good. Arthur Golden gives terrific details into the life of Sayuri a Geisha living in Gion, the Geisha capital of Japan in the early/mid 1900's. The reader gets and inside view of a Geisha's life. Pretty it isn't. His details on a Geisha's clothing, etiquette, and day-to-day lives are quite vivid and the reader has no problem visualizing Sayuri's cruel lot in life. The book is quite sentimental and has moments of triteness, but I would recommend it for it's desriptive details of a Geisha's life. However, if you are interested in Japanese historical fiction I would also recommend James Clavell's Shogun - one of my alltime favorites!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For me, this book was a disappointment. It was just another ''Romance novel'', not a totally bad one, just not what I expected. The author provides a very detailed insight into the world of Geisha's in the 1930-40's but he failed to convince me this was the true picture.The childish and amateurish style of writing was somewhat annoying. Because the characters, are never fully developped ,unfortunatly they remain superficial page after page and become to some extent very predictable.The 400 pages are overburdened with repetitive and descriptive details ( from how to apply make-up to tying an obi). The ending is so typically Harlequin romance...Come on...To me, it seems Golden is trying to convince the reader (or himself) that he has done his homework by writing an extensive description of the Japanese culture and adding a dash of American romance to it.If you fancy Harlequin romances, buy it, you will love it! On the other hand if you relish and appreciate distinctive and well written books such as White Oleander, Poisonwood Bible, Cold mountain etc...Skip this one!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Note to self: never ever read a book about a woman coming of age - written by a man. The story (was there a story?) plodded along like a sea tortoise - yes, that's the type of lyrical imagery one can expect from Golden. The characters are two-dimensional, stereotypical, and completely uninteresting. I've read romance novels better written than this. The true crime is that Golden has taken a potentially fascinating woman, situation, and era - and rendered it as dry as parchment paper. If it's true Steven Spielberg has optioned this book for the big screen, I predict major rewrites. Read \\"The Red Tent\\" instead."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sayuri's a perfect male fantasy: An Asian sex slave with western features (grey/blue eyes). Now, why couldn't she just have been a drop dead gorgeous Japanese woman? Why the colored eyes? But that's not what gets me. Would any intelligent person fall in love with the type of man who takes her away from her dying folks, forces her sister to be a cheap ol' hooker, and pays her way to becoming a dumb little tea pourer? I'm talking about the Fisheries Manager and the man who eventually ended up being her sugar daddy. For Christ sake, these men were old enough to be her father! Talk about pedophelia and hooking. This book is pretty sick...sugar coating the male intent with a very willing female narrator."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Too bad we do not have novels written by geishas or meikosan about the life of an American male writer at the turn of the century. They would be almost as good fun as Memoirs of a geisha.It deserves however two stars because the author made his homework, and the book is indeniably well-researched - even though as many native English speakers he probably never even bothered to learn the language. Only, as far as I can tell, most geishas, including contemporary ones, and their male friends, including European ones, would think that he has understood little of his findings and of Japanese culture in general."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Little orphan girl is mistreated, has many mis-adventures and then ends up with the man of her dreams, of course, he is greatly diminished and they grow old together after finding and losing each other. And guess what, she bears him a child. She lives happily ever after taking care of him. Exuse me - the only thing missing is the insane wife. Hatsomomo will do for that. And the war will fill in the rest of the blanks. Blind - well that works too - remember it was only temporary in the original."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To get the most out of this book, it's best approached as a historical/cultural lesson wrapped in a fairy tale.With the narrator being a worldly woman, I expected more insightful prose. It often came across as juvenile. The metaphors were probably fresh in their original context; not now. The author would have been well served to update them a bit to reduce the cringe factor.That said, within this candy coating there is much substance. The wealth of detail from this hidden world makes the reader feel like a priveleged voyeur.I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had put off reading this book for the longest time because I had felt it was going to just sensationalism. Now I wished I'd read a long time ago!I could not put this book down. Mr. Golden describes in such wonderful detail the intricacies the life of a geisha - the kimono, the hair, the makeup, the training, everything. Interwoven through this was the story of a young girl who eventually does become geisha during the 1930s.Is the book factual? Is everything contained within the pages absolutely true? With the secrecy surrounding geisha, who can really say, except that probably not. But the story is so beautifully told and the details are so clearly revealed, without getting bogged down, that it becomes so easy for a reader to get swept up and taken away on this ride. There are some troubling parts to the book, but it is all part of the author's tale. And the ending is a bit odd, but strangely it works.As a note, I thought the move was well done, too, though could not compare to the book. I would recommend the movie, but only in conjuction with the book. And this book is so beautifully told!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK, SOME SAY ITS TRUE TO FACT OTHERS DISAGREE. EITHER WAY I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book tells the story of a woman who was sold as a girl to an okiya in pre-WWII Japan to be raised as a geisha. It is told from the perspective of the geisha as an old woman as she looks back on her life. It describes in fascinating detail the life of a geisha, from student to novice to full geisha, including such details as makeup application, styles of kimono, and, more intriguing, the politics of establishing status and position.This book is an excellent example of what I look for in historical fiction. Until reading this book, I had little knowledge of or interest in the life of geisha during this period, and yet the book made the topic compelling. Sayuri is a complex, sympathetic character, and through her adventures, we learn about the culture, the values, and the social rules of her time, as well as the details of daily living. The characters seem believable even though they operate by different social conventions. Even the style of writing rang true to me as the syntax of someone who doesn't speak English as a first language. As a bonus, I also felt I learned something about the art of triumphing over an enemy without fighting them head on."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a carefully contrived piece and a mental scenography of sorts. You can definately see Golden's research pulled together to form a vivid picture of a young girl's hardships and suffering percieved through the eyes of an experienced geisha, or so it seems. The only down fall was the similies and metaphores that seem to be a cliche' interpretation of the Chinese and Japanese culture. That's a small technicality and I wouldn't let that stand in the way of reading such a great neoclassic. He also explores the sad and competive world in which the geisha lived (that isn't as attractive and flawless as society may assume) and unfolds how most of them REALLY got into the business/art. A book that is difficult to put down and will keep you thoroughly intrigued throughout your read. This book is sure to leave a lasting impression."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was instantly taken by the metaphors. They continued to be frequent and high quality throughout the book. As an American who has lived in Japan for 14 years, I of course have stereotypes about Japan but am not surprised when people break them. Sayuri remained true to the dream that had been the only thing that sustained her through long years of adversity, even when it meant making a difficult choice to hurt someone deeply. Being true to oneself is not an alien concept in Japan. She acheived her dream, and then the portrayal of it was admittedly a little flat, but still very emotional for me because of what she had had to go through and how long she had had to wait. But then again, Japanese men are more than just a little flat when it comes to expressing there love for a woman. Sayuri's closing metaphors about life contain a profound spirituality that I don't often see here in Japan, but she was a unique character."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Once in a while, a book takes you so deep into another place or culture filled with memorable characters and brought to life in vivid detail that it is almost impossible to put down. &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is certainly one such novel. This is a mesmerising tale, written in simple, direct and elegant prose that hardly puts any strain on one's imagination except to savour the wonderful recreation of a dying Japanese sub-culture. Perhaps the simplicity and the feel-good conclusion are its only failings, but these are minor glitches that should not detract from the Arthur Golden's engaging story and his ability to completely submerge the reader into the amazing world of the geisha to such extent that one wonders where the line between fact and fiction is drawn."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I generally read some 2 to 3 books at any given time, and it most often takes me about 2 and a half weeks to finish a novel. From the day I picked this book up to the day I put it down, only 3 days had elapsed. I hesitate to call this book a classic, that word seems to invoke the feeling of boredom in most people.What I will say, however, is that this book is timeless, despite the loss of the time in which it was set. I felt the humanity of this work.The characters lived and I felt their breath in my mind. I was intoxicated by their realty, which will now once again become memory in the shallowest pools of my consciousness. It made me feel twice lived and in love with sadness!Make use of Arthur Golden's vision! Relive! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"&quot;I couldn't put this book down&quot; as many people had stated. Personally I thought this book was well written. Difficult as it is to describe Eastern Culture to Americans, Arthur Golden managed to do so. This book described a love story that was kept alive through faith and hope. I thought that the characters had unrealistic personalities, no true feelings were portrayed in this novel, making the characters appear &quot;dumb&quot;. Too much forshadowing went on throughout the novel especially Nobu. It was easy to guess what will happen next. The ending seemed very dull, asif Arthur Golden was in a hurry to finish the novel. Overall I thought this was a pretty good book, certainly not the best, but it kept me a very alert while reading it, wondering if the next scene was what I expected."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is wonderful It encompassed my eevery moment. I planned my day around it-sounds addictive? it is! This story of a young girl turned slave and then to Geisha was heartbreaking and also a success story.

Yes, it's well written, but, as many of its critics have pointed out, the turns of plot and characterization are weak and uneventful. For the first two-thirds of the book we follow the plight of poor Sayuri up until her twenties; the last third wraps up her life, racing through WWII and the American occupation. A pleasant read, but I won't be pushing it on anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An amazing cross-cultural autobiographical piece of fiction told in the first person by the Geisha heroine.The novel opens when our heroine is only 9 yrs old, in 1929 Japan. Her mother is dying of bone cancer, and her and her older sister are sold by her father.Her sister is taken to a house of common prostitution, but Chiyo, the heroine who is narrating the book, is taken by a Okija (Geisha house).Geisha, I learned, are entertainers--they sing, dance, tell stories, make jokes, and carry on interesting conversations with the patrons of tea houses.They also become the mistresses of very wealthy Japanese men. I always thought the Geisha got to choose who would be her dannae (her wealthy patron) but as it turns out, they have very little sayso over it at all. The deflowering of their virginity, which occurs at around age 14 or 15, goes not to a man they might like, but to the highest bidder. There is, however, a love story in the book as well as the many other trials and misadventures of Chiyo, whose Geisha name is Sayuri.There are quite a number of twists and turns and plots &amp; counterplots, and I couldn't put the book down--I found myself rooting for this young woman in her battles against a very cruel, but very beautiful Geisha named Hatsumomo, and for her to find happiness with the man that she fell in love with when she met him on the street as a child and he was kind to her. But will she ever meet him again? Or will she be forced into becoming the mistress of the brusque, horribly disfigured Nobu--who is the business partner of the man she truly loves?The detail in the book is exquisite, Mr. Golden certainly did his research. And we learn about the actual daily rituals of Geisha, what it is really like, from the inside."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderful book. It artistically portrays the life of a Geisha without being obscene. Arthur Golden also brings the setting and characters to life for the reader. Without his skill of being able to completely describe the surrounding in an interesting way, the book would be boring."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, a fictitious novel about the life of a young Japanese geisha (Chiyo/Sayuri) and her trials and tribulations is a captivating story that both pulls at the heart strings, and elevates the reader. It is a story of cruelty, hopelessness, heartbreak, success, rivalry, betrayal, revenge, and love. Set in the Gion district of Kyoto before and during WWII, Arthur S. Golden succeeds in portraying the daily life of this young woman in startling detail, yet still keeping the reader interested and wanting to learn more about her. Sayuri's successes and failures belong to the reader. This book is an excellent and lucid read, I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys either biographical works or learning about Japanese cultural values in a non-textbook sense or even anyone who just wants to read a good story.-S"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is exactly what the book does for you. It puts you in the shoes (or rather zori) of a little Japanese girl with very rare eyes. But Memoirs of a Geisha isn't just about the events of her life, it pulls the reader in to this post WWII Japanese world as if you're living in it. The characters are so real that you could hardly believe that they are the product of one man's imagination. When there was a joyous event, I was relieved and when things went wrong, I cried, that's how real it was to me.As Sayuri grew up I was surprised to learn so much about this unique culture and its customs which, until now has remained much a mystery to me. It's so amazing how this simple yet poetic voice that golden has given Sayuri can so vividly bring to life the world around her.I challenge all adventurers out there to read this book and adventure into Sayuri's world where dreams and freedom are equally out of reach for a woman, and a good life is only obtained after years of hard training and suffering."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An incredible read that you will not be able to put down! This book was very descriptive and I loved the analogies throughout. It's hard to believe this is told 1st person in a woman's mind (Sayuri) and written by a man! Amazing...I am eager for Arthur Golden's next novel to come out....can not wait!!! THIS BOOK IS A DEFINATE KEEPER!!! I have recommended and lent it to several people who also fell in love...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was hooked on this book simply after reading the translator's note! I was not disappointed once I began the actual novel. While Golden did not accurately portray the world of geisha, his fictional version is nonetheless highly entertaining. His descriptions of young Chiyo and her life leading up to becoming a geisha are absolutely enchanting and I simply could not put the book down. The reader sympathizes with Chiyo and wants the best for her as well, so the reader eagerly awaits the moment in the novel in which she becomes a geisha. And yet, when that moment occurs, the Chiyo you have rooted for all along becomes the self-absorbed Sayuri that one quickly loses compassion for. What lessened the book's charm for me was that the chairman plot was too contrived and unbeleivable, that Nobu was the REAL Prince Charming, and that Sayuri's treatment of Pumpkin was despicable. Perhaps circumstances truly did hinder their friendship in the beginning, but after Sayuri was well-established in the okiya, there was no reason she could not have done more to salvage the friendship and contribute to Pumpkin's future. I could have easily gotten over my disappointment of not having Nobu's character triumph if Sayuri had atleast done right by Pumpkin. But to do so badly by them both... I could only give it 3 stars because of my own personal issues with the plot which are too hard to expound on without giving away too much of the novel, but I'm sure those who have read it know what I mean. I'm by no means upset, though, that I took the time to read this book. Overall, the writing was still exceptional, elegant and absorbing. The bottom line is don't expect literary greatness or an extremely accurate view of geisha life but do expect to be highly entertained. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm sure that this book isn't quite accurate on any number of measures, but it sure makes a good yarn. You feel transported to another time and consciousness--a late-feudal, early-modern Japan, where tradition and dogma perservere even as Japan is radically changing. The characters offer intrigue and suspense, and the novel--like a tourist trip--offers a titiliating, if not-quite-real, view of an earlier Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I first picked up this book and read it a few years ago, I was captivated. I simply could not put the book down. I was drawn into the life of the fictonal geisha Sayuri, and her life and trials. I thought the world of a geisha fascinating! I read it over and over again, and had to buy a second copy as the first got worn out.Then I read &quot;Geisha: A Life&quot; by Mineko Iwasaki, whom Arthur Golden had interviewed. I was shocked. I come to find out the inaccuracies in &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, and how it wasn't an accurate representation of a geisha's life. Mr. Golden obviously needed to do more research, or listen more closely to what Ms. Iwasaki told him.Bottom line, if you're looking for an interesting story, by all means. But if you're looking for something a little more accurate, please read the aforementioned book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Did not excpect to enjoy this book as much as I did. I just wanted to read more and more. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden is a wonderful novel. Golden did an excellent job at really letting you enter a Geisha's life, and what it was like through his use of imagery. Many descriptive words are used that paint a picture for the reader's imagination to visualize. The descriptions is what made the book so wonderful and enjoyable to readThe novel is strengthened very much with Golden's use of imagery. Each word plays an important role in what the sentence or paragraph is describing. No detail was left out so that a true understanding of every situation Sayuri encounters on her journey of life was stated. When the story first starts out it moves slowly and there is not much going on. However, as the story goes along Sayuri comes upon more elaborately set scenes and situations. In these scenes and situations, Golden includes every detail in his writing so that you can relate, as the reader, to how each character is feeling.Memoirs of a Geisha is an all time favorite of mine. It was and unforgettable book that would be impossible to forget about what was read. Almost every page has a lasting impression especially on how to view life. When at first when Sayuri was taken from her family she thought that she could never live fully again, later she realizes that there is always something in life to live for even if it is not what you wanted it to be, you just have to find the good in it. I recommend reading this novel, especially if you enjoy reading historical fiction; it is one of the better of the novels out there."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a fascinating book!

I liked the characters and wanted to know what was going to happen to them, I felt like I was in their everyday life. I was ticked off at the end though - she simply gets her own teahouse in New York and this is the end. I don't buy that being someone's mistress makes one complete. I liked the story, I liked knowing where she came from and that once she was a geisha it was a secret, the setting of pre-WWII Japan was beautiful and interesting.I have not seen the movie yet so I cannot comment there."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was very historically interesting.

It was helpful in providing an in-depth exploration of how geishas were groomed, how men were like through the depicting of the geishas'interesting liaison with different male clients and other issues. The ending was touching with subtleness, without being too melodramatic. I especially liked Arthur's use of the imagery of water (i.e. water flowing down the rocky edges before reaching the final point) being likened to the pathway of life i.e. one has to go through life's ups and downs.This book's highly recommended for those who think that there's been too much hype over this book, for those who are willing to spare some time for a good read, and for those who doubt if they can finish this book because you will! ;p"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you've ever wondered what it is like to live the life of a geisha, this is the story to read. It is clear that the author did a great deal of research for this story. At times I had to remind myself that this was a work of fiction, because the story seemed so real. Sayuri, the main character, had so many struggles to overcome, but she handled everything that was thrown her way. I learned a great deal about the life of a geisha by reading this novel. I thought the author did a good job handling the love stories within the novel. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I've been reading everything I could get my hands on since I was able to do so, including cereal boxes at breakfast, and I never read anything any more captivating than Golden's book.

I don't give 5 starts lightly. 4 stars means I love a book... Anyways, from the premise of the book, (its an 'autobiography') to the descriptions of the elaborate kimonos, the Sumo Wrestling, and ugly men, 'Memoirs of a Geisha' left my head spinning. I read it, and reread it, I loved it so much. Definatly not just a chick book either."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is so amazing! Arther Golden steps into, not just the mind of Sayuri, but her soul! I've read it at least twice and I plan to read it over and over! Every time I pick it up, it's glued to my fingertips. This story is about a young girl named Chiyo. She is stolen from her family (really she was sold) and brought to the Nitta Okiya in Gion, Kyoto. She has her problems, but she becomes a wonderful Geisha with many stories to tell. This book is so amazing; it's a masterpiece! Don't believe me? Buy it and find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"With fiction, very little impresses me. Though that may mean precious little to you, it does shorten the list of literature I recommend. And I recommend, with all the enthusiasm I can muster, that everyone not only read, but own this masterpiece. Sure to take it's place among the classics, it was a delight to read. The detail was outstanding, emphasizing the thorough research that went into this book. But, what was most impressive was the way in which he weaved fact and fiction. After reading the book I was not only knowledgeable about the life a geisha led, I felt as if I had known one personally. A tome ripe with wisdom, this is a treasure to be passed from generation to generation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book starts out with Chiyo living in her childhood town. Before a disturbing death occurs, she and her sister are sold to a geisha district. They are seperated basically for the rest of their lives with the exception of one minor meeting.The majority of this book is about her experiences in Gion. She comes face to face with what I could call a devil. She somehow manages to live her life through the many encounters of this person. It's definitely worth reading just to find out what happens to the devilgirl!Although I'd like to write a full review on what my favorite parts are, I will not do that. If you are reading this review before you read this book, I can only tell you that I highly recommend that you DO read this book! It's my current favorite.There's one disappointment with this book, however. It took me a while to completely understand the ending. I agree with some reviewers when they say that the author was simply tired of writing, and ended the book in a nice, little package. The second to last chapter was still, in my opinion, in the peak of the book.Even with that disappointment, I would still recommend this book to any older reader. It has a combination of sadness, happiness, and excitement, and you can't forget the unability of keeping this novel shut."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Through the twists and turns of excitement that Memoirs of a Geisha holds, I must say that it is beyond one of the best books that I have ever read. Personally, I've never became so emotionally attached to a book; I'd often find myself crying at certain points; I'd also laugh sometimes. There are many ups and downs in life that this book couldn't explain better.Unfortunately, there was one disappointment, for me. I was hoping that she would end up with another person, but that's only because I wasn't aware of someone elses feelings -- which you'll see if you read it -- but after the book was finished, I was a little more relieved.I should tell you that this is the first book that I've read for pleasure in over eight years. I wanted the book to be longer. I wasn't okay with it ending where it did - I wanted more.I would recommend this book to anyone that's looking for: sadness, happiness, excitement, laughter, and many other things."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A year ago, I was given this book to read while I was away for a long weekend at the shore. I've since bought it for five people, and I know several more that will love me for presenting them with this book. I read it in 2 days, put it down for a day, and then read it again. It's evocative, delightful, and poignant. The reader feels for the protagonist, from small joys to large life-shattering upheavals. Mr. Golden has a delicate touch, and paints the delicate silk canvas of the geisha life with broad swaths and intricate characters. Do I recommend this book? Yes, and heartily. Let the title be your guide."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To be honest, I would have expected that I wouldn't be too excited about this book, considering my lack of knowledge of Japanese history and culture. Well, thinking this was a big mistake. From the first page on I felt absolutely seduced by this wonderful book, and I couldn't put it aside until I finished it. It's the astonishing story of a poor fisherman's daughter who makes it all the way to becoming one of the most famous geisha's in Japan. Impressive, brilliant, and an absolute pleasure to read. So go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This tome is as richly rewarding in it's depth and descriptive detail of the life of a geisha as Pearl S. Buck's book was of China in &quot; The Good Earth. &quot; Both carefully weave the reader through the trials and tribulations, the emotions and the characteristics of lives so foreign to our American psyche. The portrayals of sacrifice, perseverance, and personal triumph, takes the reader into a miasmic, panoramic journey that shows what the human spirit can endure and overcome. Although the post-WWII portions of &quot; Geisha &quot; were not as precise as the previous content, I would highly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was truely amazing. Never before have i been so blown away by something as wonderful and as profound as Sayuri's story. Upon the completion of this book, i felt that i knew this girl, that she had been part of my life and that she had written her story especially for me. i didn't see her as a &quot;prostitute&quot; i saw her as a geisha, she had gained my respect and i felt as if it were my place to defend her against the West's perception of her profession. The story is captivating from first to last page...you simply cannot stop reading. It truely did amaze me that this powerful novel could have so much impact on the way i think and the way i now see people. i no longer judge by what i am told, by the common view. Sayuri's story was so real, you couldn't help but feel you knew her.

Although somethings are left unexplained, there is enough detail in this novel to satisfy the mind's curiousity about this foreign world.

If youre a reader who likes to learn and be entertained at the same time, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Unbelievably eye-opening book. Gripping right from the beginning. I never imagined that a book about Geisha's would be interesting to me, but from the introduction to the end I couldn't put it down.

If I didn't read the book I know I wouldn't bother seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book over 6 months ago, and yet it is still alive in my mind.Sayuri just came out of the pages and lived around me. Arthur Golden is probably the best writer I have encountered in a long time. Anyone can get into this book. I will always appriciate geisha from this time on. You learn so much about WWII and what it was really like to be a woman in Japan. I am looking forward now to the movie based on this book. Arthur, I don't know if you can top this wonderful achievement of yours, but good luck."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden has revealed a new and mysterious world to us in 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. The book debunks all the popular myths about these women of Japan and provides an insight into the life, thoughts and angst of a geisha in Kyoto. Beautiful imagery and a fine attention to detail brings Sayuri to life for us. Although the thoughts and feelings attributed to the young Chiyo seemed rather adult. It was a pity the book focused so much on her early life and glossed over Sayuri's actual experiences in later years. The sense of yearning and the question of 'Will she really get to be with the Chairman she dreams of so much' kept me engrossed till the end of the book. The characterizations of Hatsumomo, her nemesis, and Auntie, her friend and mentor, were vivid and helped in understanding Sayuri. The reproduction of the Japan of the 30's and 40's was excellent and each minute detail well researched. On the whole, a good book, although the completion of it leaves you wondering about her later years. You are also left feeling sceptical about a teenager having such intense thoughts and profound mental imagery when faced with challenging circumstances in life. A good read, the book draws you in."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden has revealed a new and mysterious world to us in 'Memoirs of a Geisha'.

Following Sayuri down her path from nine year old girl to woman was believable, very well written and so hard to believe it was fiction. I only wish the book would have spent more time toward the end with Sayuri and Chairman; it seemed rushed when it reached that point and I think it deserved a few more chapters ... or maybe I just didn't want it to end. I guess I should have realized Chairman was married considering the married men had their mistresses but I thought they'd live happily ever after together. It's been years since I have seen the movie and I know it won't do the book justice but since these characters are now ingrained in my head, I need to revisit it.

I loved it because when I was reading it I wasn't getting bored. I didn't want to stop reading. I think it taught me a lot about geisha's something I would never learn in school. Before I read this book I always just though geisha's were just to be beautiful, I didn't know they were bided off to men and had to leave home at a young age and go through pain. What really stood out to me is that girls younger than me have to be sent off by their family to start training to become someone to be bided off to different men. It makes me sick I would never want my own family make me leave to become something I'm not. I would recommend this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Japanese culture like I do and who wants to know more about the culture of geisha's that's we would never know. This book is great for a high school student. It's good for a high school student because when you read it you feel sad for this girl, and you don't want to put the book down. It makes you want to learn more. I really think this book should be a book everyone reads at some point in their lives. We always learn something new about different cultures, and this shows us how different our cultures really are and how lucky we are.This book really makes me want to learn more about Japanese culture and I wish there was another book of Memoirs of a Geisha.

Any connection to this country fascinates me, but Geisha are generally something of the past. This memoir reveals the way traditional geisha women lived and worked, and it is not the romantic tale I expected. Years of training, financial hardships, and emotional tax went in to becoming one of the special women that entertained upper class man in tea rooms.This book is written in first person, so all the events are first hand accounts. One of the most interesting aspects of this book was the way the her role as a geisha developed over time. It begins with her as a young girl, then she becomes a trainee, to obtaining her first Dana (a financier and \\"husband\\" of sorts) and eventually leaving that life behind and moving to the United States and opening her own tea room. This is an oversimplification of events, but it follows her through nearly her entire life.I have never seen the movie, so I cannot say if they are similar but I throughly enjoyed the book-it is a quick read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sayuri is taken from her home, separated from her sister, and her parents die. She is essentially an indentured servant until she can pay off her debts to the oyaki, including the cost of taking her in. We are able to see the complex web of struggle, support, and jealousy that exists among equals - the geisha, who are taught to be the best in their talent as social entertainers and preservers of traditional song and dance - and yet to maintain a modicum of control over the men they become mistresses to (their main patrons). It's all very detailed in the importance of their values of respect, modesty, and honor. Even their virginities (mizuage) are up for sale to the highest bidder.We also see they are essentially powerless when it comes to the men that support them - money being power - and they have to be careful who they choose as their danna. At least, if it is not simply a life of comfort they are looking for. If a geisha is not to manipulate or be manipulated, it is the best she can hope for in time to find a rare savior of sorts, a benevolent man who is more than his own self-interest. Though Sayuri shares with few people her past history, she still manages to open her heart.This may leave the reader to wonder if this story is meant to glorify any form of being a kept woman. In reality, it's beyond the necessities of day-to-day living and the career one was brought up to practice, i.e. what the Japanese would call destiny. Obligated to the Mother of the oyaki, this does not exclude the ability to have a streak of independence (to a degree) and enjoy partnerships and entertainment as can be afforded in this lifestyle.I would strongly suggest seeing the movie also - it's great, better IMO than the book and faster-paced. Since I've been reading something about how the author broke his promises to the geisha whose story he was inspired by, I will also check out Geisha of Gion by Mineko Iwasaki."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What struck me most about this book was that it was fiction. Repeatedly as I was reading it, I would turn to the cover, or the front matter, or the book's description, or the author's bio, and was each time baffled to find that this was, indeed, a work of fiction. The voice is so absolutely convincing, the setting and storyline painted so vividly, that at times I forgot I was reading at all. The story is the fascinating tale of a young girl sold to become a geisha. A geisha, well trained and successful, lived the life of a princess, but it was a life of sacrifice, of hard work, and, in the years surrounding WWII, one that would change in definition, requiring that some very difficult decisions be made, and all with unknown consequences. It is at once a rags to riches story and an impossible romance. It is tragic and inspiring and truly makes one reconsider what one thinks he believes about pre War Japanese culture. An amazing, enlightening, inspiring read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fate smiles on a comely girl from humble circumstances in twentieth century Japan who finds her way into the profession of Geisha (which translates approximately as \\"art person\\" in Japanese). Our heroine faces many challenges along the way, from a harsh and demanding apprenticeship to the poverty resulting from World War II. The difficulties of navigating the labyrinth that was the painfully formal world of the Geisha, however, made a personal life that included a deep and abiding love very elusive. I still marvel at the finesse employed by the heroine and the author in this truly fascinating quest! The result is a brilliantly formulated and satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I went to Japan and visited Kyoto, Gion street before, saw tourist that make-up like geisha and even saw a real geisha walking down the back alley. When I returned back home, I was reminded about the movie - memoirs of geisha but did not have a chance to catch the movie due to the lack of time. Hence I purchased this book first. It took me 2 weeks to finish reading the book, considering I have work and family commitment. But the story was just so captivating, about how the life of geishas and how they were treated throughout their growing days. I heart every character mentioned, even the bad ones. Certainly, after reading the book, I would think of going back Gion to visit the place again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Personally, I've never been a lover of the Japanese culture, but this book has changed that. It's certainly full of suspense and an excellent romance, but, more importantly, it brings the culture and the times up so close that I felt as though I was a little Japanese girl being raised to become a geisha. I was involved emotionally from the beginning and could picture in my mind the place and every detail of it. I am truly sorry that it is over."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"...because he so completely captures the voice of Sayuri, the girl from a poor fishing village who was sold and became a great geisha. I almost missed my train twice, this book so completely sucked me into 1930's Japan. The characters, particularly Sayuri, are some of the most compelling, from Hatsumomo, the cruel geisha who jealously guards her position, to Mameha, the geisha who decides to help Sayuri. I also learned a lot about the geisha culture - all the more interesting because the reader is learning about it alongside Sayuri. If you like to read because reading is a form of escape into another world, this is definitely a book you should pick up."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In his novel, Golden has captured the essance and misunderstood life of a Geisha. He takes us through a remarkable world of beauty,hardships, freindship, cruelty, and love. Through a former geisha's eyes he tells a tale of a child raised in a small fishing town, torn away from her home and forced to work in an oikya and train to become a geisha, while another cold hearted geisha strives to make her life as difficult as possible. From the first page you will be emersed in the world of japanese culture, by the end you will find you'reself to be almost sad that the book is at it's end.Memoirs of a Geisha is an erotic and gripping novel, about women seducing the most powerful of men and the wonders of a dying tradition. I suggest this book for anybody who wants to read a truely great and mesmerizing novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Spoilers ahead: I thoroughly enjoyed this book, until the end. I felt (and others I have talked with agree with me) that the book was leading up to a completely different ending. I, like others, was completely swept up in this book. I kept having to look at the author's photo to remind myself that it was not an autobiography. And for that reason I was expecting a different ending. As I was reading this book I thought this was going to be one of my all-time favourties, but the ending just left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's 'Geisha' was not as unusual as it might have seemed had I come at it unaware of the potential to identify gender in literary 'voice'. This is a beautiful fictional 'memoir' of the life of a geisha in Japan during and after WW II. The narrative of this woman's childhood, being sold into geisha-dom, her elaborate training and the generally bewildering society of the geisha was a fascinating read - especially because the sophisticated and high-cultured environment of the geisha tea houses is a relatively unknown subject. The issue of the world of the geisha is a very complex one before we can even enter into argument about the ability of a white Protestant man to write in the voice of not only a woman, but one of a dramatically different culture. I may offend my fellow feminists by saying that I believe that a well written novel (well researched, and carefully crafted) is just that, a well-written novel, regardless of the gender of the author. Unlike so many novels I have read, this one did not leave me with a lot of questions - just the wish for more. I was sorry that the last couple of decades of her life were hurried through and I understood why (that would be a different book! This one was about her years as a geisha). This is a sign of a good book - you want more!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Given the hype surrounding this book, I expected to be &quot;wow-ed&quot; by it - but I wasn't. Certainly, I found the historical details interesting and it was enlightening to learn about the life of a geisha. Still, the characters seemed so stereotypical and one-dimensional to me. In addition, I found the the plot, particularly the ending, to be way too contrived and predictable."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was happy to see a bestseller that wasn't a Danielle Steele romance -- this is a thinking person's bestseller. Golden has done his research -- I guarantee you'll feel like you are a geisha in training in Japan when you read the detail and nuance that Golden includes in his book. I was entranced by the writing, plot, and detail of this excellent historical novel. It's hard to belive that enough people were interested to make this a bestselling novel, although I have to say it deserves its status as such. I found it engrossing reading from first page to last with enough detail to hook even the novice reader. Finally, several years after writing the book, Golden has sold the rights to Hollywood who will undoubtedly make it a strong movie -- if done right, this could be a memorable movie. If done poorly, it will disappoint the thousands of readers who loved the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I begin by saying that I have no ties to the Japanese community and have no way to measure the accuracy of this novel. All that I am qualified to say is that this is one of the most real books I have ever read. The characters have a depth that is rarely portrayed in fiction and through the suffering of our Heroine Sayuri Nitta. The story follows Nitta from her days as the dutiful second daughter of a poor country family through the trials of her schooling, her apprenticeship and successful career as a Geisha. While each step is fascinating it is the picture that is painted as a whole that makes this novel the captivating story that it is. By portraying the suffering and growth of all of the characters in his story Golden has painted a modern day fairy tale that educates and entertains its viewers."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a journalist, I happen to know quite a bit about this story; I decided against printing (I work for a leading newspaper) because the author declined to go on the record about what I knew to be the truth. The geisha in Kyoto who is attacking him for getting it &quot;wrong&quot; is an unstable woman notoriously disliked in the Gion district. She most certainly has ulterior motive in attacking him.Here's what he got &quot;wrong&quot;: a scene takes place on a boat on the river, but it's in a section of the river that is too shallow for a boat (it doesn't change the historical fact that they did sometimes go out on boats on that river); a scene in which the geisha wears a kimono more typical of geisha from another district. None of the details she told me about make the least difference. What she's really upset about is, as far as I can tell, is that she told the author--as well as a number of documentary film makers--about her mizuage setting a record and is now embarrassed at being held accountable. She claims that things like mizuage don't take place in the geisha district. This is patently false.Before you conclude, on the basis of one geisha's words, that the book is a poor representation of the truth, READ THE ARTICLES with a critical eye. The Post journalist behaved very irresponsibly in printing such an imbalanced piece. He thought it would make a good story, and perhaps it does; but it doesn't tell the truth as responsible journalism should.I don't think the author will mind if I pass along one thing he mentioned to me: that he has gotten fan letter in Japanese from a number of geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden painstakingly made this book appear to be a true story. I was so taken into Saruyo's life that I was completely devastated to learn, only at the very end, that the entire story was fictional. The book jacket and &quot;translator's note&quot; are extremely deceiving. I'm sorry I ever got so involved in the characters."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Author Golden's, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is an unforgetable tale in which you find yourself breathing in the pages as if they were air!

But no matter what type of fiction you like you should read the Memoirs of a Geisha, it is a wonderful, finely-crafted example of what a novel should be."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"OODLES of KUDOS to Arthur Golden for this jewel! I was intrigued from the intro and felt as if I walked around in my own kimono and lived amongst cherry blossoms until I finished the book. I am amazed that a man owned such insight into the mysterious culture of the geisha and women in general. I have always been curious about Japanese beliefs and way of life, but until I read the book I thought a geisha was just a high-priced call girl who wore a bit too much makeup. Instead, I now understand the sacrifices, skill, and mental fortitude it took to endure this hard lifestyle. I learned that instead of choosing this as a glamourous &quot;career&quot; that most are either born into it or sold as slaves. I am all for women's lib and against oppression of women, but I did find myself having the utmost respect for the tradition of these artisans and the devotion they showed in every aspect of their lives. The spirit of the geisha was fascinating, and I will carry the lessons I learned from this book with me throughout my life. It will make you want to get out of your sweats and order a kimono!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What a wonderful book! I could not put it down.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I feel as though I've been asked to write a review about a person I've just met. Not a book I've read. I wouldn't be able to review a person. That would objectify that person and limit the possibilities of humanity. I could however reflect upon the meeting of an individual so that is what I will do here--reflect upon my meeting with the geisha, Sayuri. What an elegant woman. Arthur Golden brings her personality so much to life that rather than seeing a physical female person I get strong images of her essence. And her essence is exactly that: elegant. Sayuri is strong, determined, driven, clever, realistic, understanding and human. Each of these attributes make up the rainbow that is her. The most predominant of colors of this rainbow is yellow that represents her wisdom. Upon my reading I folded over many pages with sage sayings that resonated truth and understanding to me. One such example is the following: &quot;Adversity is like a strong wind. I don't mean just that it holds us back from places we might otherwise go. It also tears away from us all but the things that cannot be torn, so that afterward we see ourselves as we really are, and not merely as we might like to be&quot; (top p. 248)It is with this reflection that I invite you to meet my dear sister and friend the great and humble geisha, Sayuri."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I definetly recommend this novel to anyone...

As the tale pulls you along she is transformed by circumstance and puppet strings till she ,the waif from a poor fishing village becomes the most sought after Geisha in Japan.Truly a book that one cannot put down.Intellectual and so detailed you feel and see every nuance Golden intends you to and quickly become attached to the main characters.Although at times Sayuri seemed without strength, the detail of her life written leaves you with no doubt she found happiness.

It's very interesting to see into another world, in a sense, to learn how others have lived their lives and the hardships that they have pushed through.

The love story, and just the interesting things that you learn from this books that you wouldn't know otherwise are reason enough to pick this book up."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The main character was the least interesting one I'd ever encountered; no original thoughts and no personality. There's no incentive to keep reading when I simply don't care what happens to her!

After I read the book then I can write a review on it.Im just excited now that Ive actually received it, I can wait to read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This fictional account of a Geisha in the Gion area of Kyoto is told very believably. Chiyo/Sayuri, the first person storyteller, purportedly tells this story to a fictional memoir-writer in her old age, telling her story from her childhood in a poor fishing village to her involuntary move to Gion and her teen and twenties years there. That's the primary period covered in the story, Sayuri's Gion period, running from the nineteen-twenties until after WWII. The story was engaging for the first three-fourths of the book, and the details of life in Japan during Sayuri's growing years were well described and created a lucid setting. The adults around Sayuri in Gion and her okiya, geisha home, were fleshed out well, most especially her antagonist, geisha Hatsumomo. For this reader, the duplicity of many of the geisha was uncomfortable. One big reason I felt connected to Sayuri was her apparent relative lack of guile. Regrettably, she fell back on that, the uncharacteristic event that she used to change her life. That action made an ugly reflection on how Sayuri and other geisha, too, responded to the demands and lack of freedoms that they faced. The book was a likely four stars for me until the end, which I found rather tepid. Upon investigating whether Sayuri was based on a real person (apparently not), there was some information that seemed to indicate that the selling of Sayuri's virginity was not accurately portrayed, in spite of what appeared to be a thoroughly researched and accurate portrayal of the times."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I love the movie but the book is so much better!!! I am very happy I purchased it for my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I saw the movie first, well done like a fairy tale. Later I bought the book. The story happened before World War II, pretty similar to stories of Chinese women back in those time (before 1949), when women were weak, when polygamy was legal, when a successful man could have a wife sitting at home, a girlfriend waiting outside, and nobody would criticize him. In the contrary, if the successful man did not have a concubine or girlfriend, people would probably think there was something wrong with him... That's how it was in old China and Japan. In fact, my great-grandfather (born in 1910) married to 2 women on the same day back in China in 1930. Life was complicated back then, I cannot imagine myself living in the old time. Thanks to the new law that terminated polygamy. Time is changing, women are changing too. If the story happened in today, what do you think the Chairman's wife would do to Sayuri? Would it still be a fairy-tale? If I were Sayuri (in today), I would not become the Chairman's lover. There are many ways to repay a favor (e.g. send gift or pray for him), not necessary to give your body."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read then re-read this book. Then I listened to the book on an audio CD. It was nice to be able to hear the words. The story lends itself very well to the audio listener as well. I recommend it.I enjoyed the story but I still came away with a feeling that I had been told a Cinderella like tale once again. The little girl from the fishing village seems almost too resistant to the hardships she endures after she is sold into slavery by her father. This in itself is a horror story. Miraculously this tiny girl survives many truamas almost without a scratch. In fact, she sort of endures her suffering rather well and comes out on top...Much like the happy endings in old Hollywood films.I was not too bothered by the above, just a tad annoyed. It was written by a man who never was a little girl. Although he does a good job weaving this story. This is much concentration on how women become Geishas but not much on how they really feel about their lives. Do they wish for another life? Do they marry and have families and personal lives? The book somewhat focuses on what a Geisha does and makes it very clear that they are not prositues. OK, but they are trained to serve rich men. I would have liked to hear if they ever go back to their families and what their personal lives are like.Even with the above I am glad I read this work."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is ideal for anyone who has been to Japan and wants to understand more about the history of the geisha and how they were and are trained.

This book felt like it switched genres at the end; it was an intriguing, cultural story of struggle and determination, and then it decides to be a dime-a-dozen romance novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"LOVED THIS BOOK.

I won't spoil the novel; I was simply bothered that the ending seemed rushed and lacked credibility when compared with the rest of the story.Golden has created a remarkably nuanced, interesting, and believably human narrator in Sayuri. Her voice is consistent throughout, her failings in plain view of the reader, and her emotions are utterly credible and palpable. The account of the geisha bitterly fighting each other for meagre measures of autonomy and power are comic, engaging, and bleak.Golden does an excellent job of creating a character and seeing her through a challenging life from which she mines out what treasures she can and simply survives the rest."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of the most beautiful and romantic books ever written.

I love stories which unveil insights into Japanese culture and 'Memoirs' doesn't disappoint in that respect. Plus, Hatsumomo is a fantastic villian, someone you absolutely love to hate. However, the writing was dull and unintellectual; it definitely was not the flowing prose I expected for a story about geishas. Definitely looking forward to Spielberg's interpretation on the big screen!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really liked this book for many reasons. First of all, for it's historic content. It is clear that the author did proper research and based the details of the life of the Geisha on fact. It was a good story and a fluent read, well written without rambling prose and irrelevant descriptions, which is so common with novels these days. However, Golden did manage a very delicate way to describe events and things that held one's attention. I loved reading about the artistry of the Geishas, not just their role as prostitutes. The only reason I was tempted to give four stars is because the end was weak. Sure we all like happy endings, but the way Sayuri was set up in New York by the Chairman (hope I'm not ruining it for you), is a bit of a fairytale ending, but then, this is fiction. In all fairness, I do give five stars because of the way it was so eloqently written. It must be hard to know where to go with such a story. Would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is unbelievable. I loved every page. Do not be turned away by the size of the novel, for you will be missing out on a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had heard great reviews about this book, so I bought it. My friend and I absorbed it within a weekend, and we each agreed it was neither satisfying nor believable. The beginning of the novel was promising -- it has some interesting metaphors and the girl's story was mesmerizing. Then there was the oh-so-promising conflict bwtween the two beautiful geishas. It began with a band, and just sizzled out by the end of the novel. But what destroyed this novel was the fact that it was way too obvious than the author, a man, was trying to write as a woman. He was clumsy and unrealistic when it came to the sex scenes; he probably should have consulted his wife at this point and asked her what it was like to lose her virginity. Anyway, it was an interesting book, but it did not live up to its expectations."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs Of A Geisha is frightenly brilliant!

As the title suggests, it is the story of Sayuri, sold by her parents at a young age to an okiya, a geisha house. Not only is it an engrossing story of suffering, longing, and triumph, it's also a fascinating look at the life of a geisha during the 1930s and 40s. The description of the places and characters was so vivid I could see it all. The whole concept behind a geisha - that having a mistress was not only acceptable but even expected of wealthy men - was somewhat jarring to my Western sensibilities, but the tale was told with such compassion and earnestness that it was easy to get drawn in to the different culture, and almost forget that it was written by a middle-aged American man and not an aged Japanese woman. There were things here and there that struck me as unrealistic - Nobu's interest in geisha despite finding them irritating, the pure malice of several characters - but by and large it was a great read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After devouring this novel, all the others I read after it paled in comparison.

It is an inspirational tale that begins with Chiyo at her home, and you find out that her mother is dying of cancer.But, eventually, she is sold to a Geisha house, and her sister is sold to a house in the \\"pleasure district\\". Please excuse my lack of correct Japanese words. In the Hanamachi, Chiyo is trained as a Geisha and eventually, falls in love with The Chairman. He was the only one to show her a bit of kindness, so she clung to his kindness and kept him in her heart forever. She becomes the most famous Geisha in all of Japan. The novel takes you through a series of ups and downs and twists and turns and also shows you, the reader, a different world, that most people don't know about. Over all, i can sum up the book inot two lonely words -- Cruelty and Love. Those two words, for me, are the heart of the novel. Enjoy, i give it five stars!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't know if my words will make a difference or not, compared to the fact that millions of people have read and wrote reviews about this book. However, this book definitely told the story of a young geisha who somehow took control over her own destiny. She was a courageous young girl who loved strong, stood to what she believed, and fought for things to be right. Golden wrote an amazing story of the geisha life. Everything he wrote seemed so factual that you wouldn't even question as to was this fiction or non-fiction. I felt as if I were walking alongside young Chiyo, then geisha Sayuri all through the book. It was an amazing feeling as you read the story because it was just so captivating, and you feel involved in the story. The entire book was awesome. The movie wasn't too bad either. Obviously in a book you develop your own imagery somewhat, but the movie did a good job in telling the story. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of both!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I decided to pick this book up after I was quite intrigued by the movie. Since the movie was a bit vague, I wanted to read the book for myself to know what exactly happened. To my surprise, much of the book details in the novel do not directly correlate with the movie. Most likely, in the movie there simply wasn't enough time to articulate ever detail of the story.Having not read a good novel in a long time, this book definitly got me back into my love of reading. I simply didn't want to stop reading it, even in the dead of night. Golden is an excellent writer and his style is very fluid and filled with similes and metaphors.Overall, if you love a great book, pick this book up!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is an enchanting trip to another place and time. The author transports you into the world of the geisha. Although the book had been recommended to me several times, I didn't take time to read it until after I had seen the movie. After watching the movie (and the special features on the DVD) I felt drawn to the book. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading. It was no less compelling even though I already knew so much of what would happen. It was a delightful start to my summer vacation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't what it is about the way some writers craft their words when writing a story. Sometimes, all I need is to read the first page and I know I'm going to love the rest of the book. That's how it was with Geisha. The metaphors and descriptions of people and places are so beautiful - almost like poetry. At some points towards the end the plot slows down - don't expect some kind of grand climax. I did want to know what happens to the main characters, though. Although some of the supporting characters are not given much dimension, you really do feel like you know Sayuri and Pumpkin and want them to succeed. Now I want to rent the movie and see how they treated the story for the screen."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is a pretty and easily readable novel based on a fictional character's memoirs. The introduction is actually not a real introduction, but part of the novel. In the introduction, the author makes up a character who becomes close with a former geisha, and out of trust, the geisha retells her story.It is the story of Chiyo-chan, a girl from a small fishing village. Because her mother was dying and her father couldn't afford to keep her and her sister, he sold them. Chiyo-chan ended up in an okiya, where she was to begin training as a geisha, and her sister Satsu unfortunately ended up in a brothel.Life at the okiya was extremely difficult for Chiyo, particularly because of a geisha called Hatsumomo, who felt threatened by Chiyo because she had gray eyes and was certain to grow into a beauty. Chiyo made a decision to find her sister and run away. However, the night they planned to run away was an unlucky day for Chiyo, so while her sister was able to run away, Chiyo wasn't. She had to cease her training as a geisha until one fateful day when she met the Chairman. She immediately fell in love with him and made up her mind to do whatever it takes to be with him. A geisha by the name of Mameha took Chiyo under her wing, and the two of them collaborated in destroying Hatsumomo. Chiyo, who changed her name to Sayuri, became the most successful geisha, and made history when someone bid the highest amount ever for her mizuage.The war years hurt Japan, and the geishas had to temporarily stop entertaining. Sayuri's friend and soon to be danna, Nobu, made sure she found safe haven. But while she was grateful to Nobu, she still loved the chairman, but despaired at ever having the chance to be with him.At the end of the novel, her disparity is replaced by joy as she meets the chairman and realizes that he has loved her since the day he met her as well, and he was the one who made sure that Mameha took her as her apprentice geisha, so that Sayuri could be with the Chairman.Memoirs was an extremely pleasant read. While it ended a bit too neatly and perfectly, it was an enjoyable read, and felt genuinely feminine and Japanese, even though the author is an American male. It's no wonder it was a bestseller."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden follows the life of a young girl from a nondescript fishing village into her infamous reign of geisha-hood in one of the most thriving cities of Japan. From the very beginning of the book, the reader is subtly placed in the environment Golden wishes to create. Golden leaves nothing up to chance; every page, word, or comma is put there deliberately to better tell his story. It's evident that he placed careful consideration into the writing of this book, which is especially conveyed by the tone of his protagonist, Sayuri. Her very female essence is so powerfully captured that, in the beginning, I had to check the author's name every few pages just to ensure it was really a man.Somehow, Golden manages to create a character which his Western readers can relate to, without losing even a touch of the fundamental nature of Japanese culture. The rituals and spirit of traditional Japan remain intact not only in the environments of Sayuri, but also in her approach to and understanding of life. The growth of Sayuri from a young child to a grown woman is startling in its careful and intimate details. Even as a child, her character has an astounding depth that does not detract from her ability to be, think and act as an average child would. As she develops, her joys and pains becomes one with the reader's, sending the reader on an emotional rollercoaster. By the first fifty pages, the reader will have experienced every emotion she has ever felt in her lifetime, which demonstrates the exquisite literary skills of Golden.By giving the reader direct access to Sayuri's most personal and, of course, very complex thoughts, Golden even manages to make Sayuri's almost insane obsession with the chairman seem normal. One has to draw oneself away from the book's reality in order to realize just how abnormal her attachment would be in the light of reason and facts. Golden also dispels many Western myths about geisha. While many associate the word with sexual debasement, Golden clearly demonstrates how a geisha is trained as an artist would be, and thus should be respected as such. Keeping with the true Japanese character of a geisha, the sexuality in the book is more like an undercurrent, ever present but never in waves.Sayuri's life, as the life of any geisha, is complicated, filled with many downfalls and uncertainties. Although Golden brings a reverence to the geisha profession, he does not romanticize it. The hardships and adversities may mark the strength of Sayuri, but they also reveal how easy women and children can become victims of society, each other and themselves. Sayuri is also not without fault, many which, in keeping with the retrospective tone of the book, she admits to and explains.One of the most wonderful things about this book is that it does not presume a right or wrong. One's perception and outlook on life is what counts the most, which is why ultimately, Sayuri had to hold on to her hope of being independent, rather than give in to society's expectation and standards of becoming Nogu's mistress. Although her choice is selfish, she does what she feels she must do to save herself. In her actions, there is courage that should be admired.My only complain with the book was the ending. For such a beautifully written story with such complex characters, the ending seems almost too simple, too easy and too rushed. The critical exploration that paced throughout the book is missing from the end, which seems as if Golden felt he had to fit everything in a limited page number and simply threw some words in to wrap everything up and make Sayuri happy. On the other hand, perhaps he was trying to send a message that we often don't believe is possible because we're so jaded by life. By simply believing, wanting and hoping in something is sometimes the most critical part of making the impossible happen. It is when we persevere throughout all, with that goal always in mind, that we will achieve the things we once only dreamed of."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was brilliant, and beautifully written. I guess the main thing you should realize is that it is fiction, although Golden based some of it on his interviews with Mineko Iwasaki, one of the best-known Geisha of her time. When the book came out she sued him for breach of contract, he had named her when he said he would not and she said he misinterpreted Geisha -that they were not high class prostitutes as she felt they were portrayed in the novel.Whatever the situation, this is a magnificent piece of writing, and highly recommended.Sayuri's mother died when she was a child, and her father sold her into slavery -you get the impression this was done because he knew he would die soon too and wanted to make sure his daughters were looked after. They were sent to the Gion district in Kyoto and Sayuri taken in to an Okiyo (Geisha House) as a maid. Her sister was not so attractive and was sent to be a prostitute in a different district.Sayuri nearly ruined her chances of becoming a Geisha by being rebellious and trying to run away. When she realized that 'outside' there were very few opportunities for her, she decided she wanted to become a Geisha and was taken under the wing by an older 'sister' -a well known Geisha.From this she rose to become one of the most famous Geisha of all time. During this time she entertained many men -but not ina sexual way. The Geisha were entertainers but not prostitutes -they were kept women by a successful man who they would join with in a ceremony -although not marriage.Through all this she is in love with a man who appears to not know she is alive.The descriptions are wonderful, the writing colourful, I really felt I was there.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Be aware that this audio tape is an abridged version of the book, so it's missing some material. The most important parts are here, though, and if you're a fan of audio books and tapes, which a lot of people like to listen to while they're commuting or travelling in their cars, this one is fine if you don't mind the fact that it's not the entire book. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is an abridged version.I had a few other comments about the story. I don't read much fiction these days, sticking mostly to history and nonfiction, but I made an exception for this novel since I am a student and teacher of a couple of Japanese martial arts, and I'd absorbed some small knowledge about things like geishas during my studies. And I'd heard about how good the novel was.I wasn't disappointed. I found Golden's book about a geisha during the 1930s, when the geisha tradition and culture was already dying, to be an accurate, detailed, and well written story about the life of what could have been a typical geisha. For me it's reminiscent of Yasunari Kawabata's famous novel, Snow Country, a bittersweet story about a love affair between a wealthy Tokyo playboy and a provincial geisha in a remote mountain town. Kawabata won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1968. The bittersweet quality derives from the fact that the geisha knows that although by most standards she is still young, she is past her prime and is one of the last of a dying breed.Like Kawabata's novel, Golden's novel sensitively and realistically portrays the world of the geisha during a time when it was already waning. Golden shows that, contrary to western stereotypes of geishas as ordinary prostitutes, they were highly cultured and educated, trained in music, poetry and the arts, and more than able to hold their own and intelligently converse on many subjects with their often wealthy and powerful clients.I understand this is Golden's first book. It's a fine debut by a new author and I hope it won't be his last. It will be interesting to see what he does next after such a spectacular debut.By the way, an interesting little side note here. I've studied a little Japanese, and Japanese is replete with epithets, slang, and various and sundry derogatory words relating to people's mental, moral, and physical shortcomings. One funny aspect of this is how reptiles and especially turtles come in for a lot of abuse. Calling someone a turtle, for example, means you're saying they're slow or unintelligent. And if you call someone a \\"deb game,\\" it translates literally as \\"a turtle with buckteeth.\\" But the actual meaning is a \\"peeping tom.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Chiyo is taken from a tiny fishing village at nine years old, away from her home, her father, an old fisherman, and her mother who is dying a slow, painful death. Haunting and beautiful, Memoirs is the story of \\"a fisherman's daughter\\" from Yoroido who becomes Sayuri, one of the most famous Kyoto Geisha.There are many fictional memoirs, novels that use this device to tell the story, but I have never encountered one as real as Golden's. Most begin in the style of a memoir and quickly deteriorate into a first person novel. With Memoirs, I felt as if I was in the same room with Sayuri, in New York, sipping tea and listening to her tell us her life's story.Memoirs of a Geisha bursts with joy and sorrow from the first page, and there is a strong current of painful memories that runs through to the last."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a great novel. The characters are so well described and clear, so wonderfully drawn, you can easily see any of the characters in any scene. Sayuri appears like any girl, she is someone with whom one can empathize, and the pre-WWII geisha scene in Gion is painted so vividly that one can hardly believe that this is a novel, not an actual oral memoir. To realize that Golden is really an american man from Tennessee is quite amazing--this book is so well researched and factual that it's difficult to believe he simply write this himself. A definite must-read--amazingly vivid and beautifully written."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is a very sad story about the selling of children into the sex trade.Arthur Golden doesn't dodge the essential points of the geisha business: the investors in human beings (\`education', kimonos, make-up) want their money back with a profit and this end justifies all means (torture).In this book, a big chunk of this investment is paid back by selling the geisha's mizuage (her deflowering) for the colossal sum of more than a year's earnings of a labourer.Poor parents were forced to sell their daughters for sheer survival: \`We become geisha because we have no other choice.' A geisha's life is governed by resignation and fatalism: \`we viewed ourselves as pieces of clay that forever show the fingerprints of everyone who has touched them.'The main goal of every geisha is to become a kept woman, the mistress of a wealthy man (her danna), for without a danna \`a geisha is like a stray cat on the street without a master to feed it. \`But, \`a geisha who expects understanding from her danna is like a mouse expecting sympathy from a snake. Geishas have to keep their true self concealed.'The central issue is \`sex for money'. The central member is a man's \`homeless eel'. Geishas are there to be \`consumed'.Of course, there is fierce competition between them. They all have to pay back their huge debts.This book says also a lot about the Japanese society, where wealthy people pay a fortune for deflowering virgins, who are sold out of necessity by their poor parents.Arthur Golden wrote a realistic and moving story using expertly thriller elements.Not to be missed.I also recommend highly the memoirs of a top geisha (Mineko Iwasaki's \`Geisha of Gion') and of a \`normal' one (Sayo Masuda's \`Memoirs of a Geisha').For a more general view of the Japanese \`water trade', I recommend Nicholas Bornoff's \`Pink Samurai', the works on Japan by Ian Buruma and the deeply moving document about child prostitution by Tomoko Yamazaki \`Sandakan Brothel #8'."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I simply love this book. My best friend introduce this book to me and I was like 'huh'.. why do I need to read about the boring life of geisha in the olden days of Japan? Oh, how wrong I was. I am glad I read it with her persistency. If you simply enjoy reading autobiography, this one is for you. It tells the life of Sayuri, of how she ended up being sold to a Geisha house and how she survived in that place. She made it to being one of the successful geisha and this didn't come easy as she has a rival, Hatsumomo who is constantly making life difficult for her. The life of Sayuri is full of ups and downs and we get to learn the Japanese culture in this book. Read this book, I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book Memoirs of a Geisha was extraordinary. The characters captured my heart and the feelings of the geishas were explained so well that I felt as if I were also a geisha. I felt that I was next to Sayuri throughout the whole book, and her character was so real. The situations that the geishas go through are so attention grabbing and make you want to help the geisha through her problems.This book has many good parts, yet some parts that are not very appropriate for certain people. I think I would recommend this book to people who are at least in high school. The book is great, but some parts would not be suitable for young children in elementary or middle school. I would also recommend this book to those who like Japanese history and historical fiction. Also this could be a good read for people who enjoy biographies or autobiographies."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha amazes readers with its outstanding portrayal of a different culture and society. Not only can one easily be sucked into this novel, but one could learn from it too. I especially enjoyed this book, more so because of its new culture insights than because of its intelligence or classicism. Still, the novel was written well enough to suck me into its plot and finish the story of a Japanese geisha's life during the Depression leading to World War II. Although I enjoyed the book as a whole, the ending of the story seemed abrupt. Sayuri's life seems to hurriedly become boring, of which the author stops writing and drops her as a subject.Personally, I would recommend this novel to anybody interested in anything from world cultures, good stories, or simply a fast read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden\`s Memoirs of a Geisha is fantastic. I can\`t believe a man wrote this book. It is a great tale about a girl sold to be a Geisha by her family. The story deals with such topics as the main character, Sayuri, selling her virginity and World War II\`s transformation of Kyoto. Ultimately, Memories of a Geisha is a romance about Sayuri and her struggle to marry a man known only as the Chairman. It\`s a fast read. The story takes place in a very interesting world.

Nonetheless, the book is a still a good read with magnificent flow."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Im Japanese, I was born in Japan, and still am very familiar with the language. So throughout the years I have come across the word Geisha, and I took high interest in this book. I have been told that Geisha were prostitutes but my Japanese mother begged a differ and recommended this book for me. It takes place in a little fishing village on the sea of Japan called \\"Yoroido\\" Chiyo-san is the youngest of a fisherman's daughter, she was very unique for she had these breath-taking gray-blue eyes. Her older sister Satsu wasnt anything to look at. Their mother was dying and there father was in no condition to raise children alone. So a wealthy man by the name of Ichiro Tanaka, persuaded their father to sell the girls. Chiyo was sold to an Okiya where geisha were trained and lived and Satsu was sold to a whore house. The girls loose contact with eachother, and lived on their lives as they were bought for. Chiyo went to school for she was in training to be a Geisha. Satsu ran away from the whore house and is never seen or heard of ever again. As the years pass, Chiyo turns into this beautiful young apprentice geisha and she even falls in love with the wealthy chairman of Iwamura electric company, but geisha are not allowed to have husbands or boyfriends, unless they buy that geisha. This whole story is told through her eyes, and all the hardships she goes through in order to become a geisha. She didnt have a choice whether or not she could or could not be a geisha, she was forced. Geisha are \\"artisan\\" they entertain a crowd of men through dancing and playing their shamisen which is a japanese guitar. She has an older sister geisha who looks after her and teaches her more about entertaining men, that was Mameha. She makes Chiyo into a Geisha whos name turns into Sayuri. Sayuri's virginity is sold to the highest bidder and then a man buys her for solo personal night time hours in exchange that he pays for all of her expenses. These are just a few experiences that she has to face in order to become a success. Throughout her years of becoming a geisha Sayuri grows old and is known as one of the best Geisha known in Japan. Japan was not doing so well economically where abouts in the US they were rising. So Sayuri decides to move to the US and own her own teahouse. Every chapter of this book is suspensful, it was intense, i felt terrible for her having her viriginty sold and when her whole family was taken away from her before her eyes. But im very hopeful that she does get to know what love feels like and that she finds happiness in the end. Thats just a fast easy to follow summary on \\"Memoirs of a geisha.\\" And please do not think Geisha's are prostitutes for they are graceful entertainers, that are trained to dance and sing, they set the meaning of beauty in Japanese history."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The generally rave reviews about this book are a little misleading. Many people will try to sell you on its authenticity. I would have prefered reading about the culture of the geisha from the perspective of a Japanese writer rather than an American academic ( the author is a professor in E. Asian studies.) The book doesn't breathe under the western fascination with the minutia of every fold of every garment of the geisha wardrobe. I have a hard time believing that we couldnt wait for a Japanese told chronicle of the same story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an incredible book! Written with a poetic style that flows from one page to the next (so that you can't put it down!), this is one of the most lyrical books I have ever read. The reader is caught up in the plights of Sayuri and her struggle between her two destinies. The book is so well written from the point of view of a geisha it is almost difficult that an American man wrote this. A great book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is an extremely readable and detail-filled fictionalization of the life of a geisha in both pre- and post-war Japan. I found it to be a very sensitive portrayal of a young woman's quest for peace in the face of great adversity. Unfortunately, the novel, for me anyway, begins to fall apart once the central villain, a rival geisha, is defeated. You quickly realize that the drama is gone, and the next 100-150 pages drag on without the dynamism of that conflict."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's novel provides a detailed description of the life of a geisha, opening the door on an aspect of Japanese culture I knew nothing about. His descriptions are crisp and his writing style is often poetic. As such, readers will no doubt find it a fascinating and flowing adventure into a different world. The journey is made through the eyes of the female protagonist, Sayuri, who is recounting how she came to be a geisha. Unfortunately, I found it difficult to become emotionally involved with the characters, especially Sayuri. While I would have to reread the novel to give it an informed feminist reading, my casual reader response was one of offense. Sayuri's character lacks the nuances of a woman's perspective, and as such her character remains flat. For example, while Sayuri spends much of her time dwelling on a man she doesn't know (waiting to be saved by him), the demise of her family, the loss of her sister, is quickly explained, dismissed, and left emotionally unexplored. Further, for a novel so centered on a community of women oppressed by a male culture, the lack of any authentic female bonding being honestly conveyed is a critical flaw. The memoir narrative style may serve as an explanation for a certain emotional detachment that holds the listener/reader at a distance, but, because this is a world foreign to most readers, more emotional resonance was needed to give the story lasting impact."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's impressive what Arthur Golden has done with this book. I wouldn't have believed that a middle-aged white man could actually write convincingly through an adolescent japanese girl's point of view. The intricate details of the geisha life described by Golden is impressive, along with his knowledge on the subject matter. However, it almost seems superfluous at times, almost to the point of pretentiousness. The story is simplistic with predictable plot turns. The heroine is a modern feminists' nightmare. I kept expecting to see the girl grow up to see herself, and the people around her, for who they really are. But then again, maybe that was Mr. Golden's point. Overall, I think the book is good for wasting time. It's akin to one of those feel-good summer blockbusters which leaves you with nothing but a few, somewhat memorable images and an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. If you're looking for substance, this isn't it. If you decide to read Memoirs, skip the last chapter."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was introduced to me as good historical fiction. It is neither good history nor good fiction. This book seems to be written by a person smitten by Japanese culture. The author seems to be so interested in talking about the culture that he forgets to build a story with depth and meaning. While the main characters have some depth, the rest seem to be more caricatures than real people. The plot line is all too predictable and offers no surprises."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden wrote well and realistically in the voice of a Japanese girl and young woman through part of his book. His book was somewhat of value because he seemed to be able to capture some of her thoughts. However, I do not agree with some of the reviews. I did not find the book captivating or enthralling. Some of it was interesting and some of the first half was quite good and seemed to be written in the voice of a pretty Japanese young woman. However, much of the book was boring and I wanted to get through with it. When I got to the second half of the book I was disgusted with it.The part about the doctor taking the girl's virginity was perverse and depressing. I would rather hear a true historical account of the Japanese people and culture, and not Mr. Golden's fictional story.Mr. Golden's writing in the second half of his book makes himself seem like a perverted old man. He was not very credible. Mameha was a lousy teacher. She could have taught the girl to say something to distract the fat Mr. Nobu from undressing her.Beginning on page 328, Arthur Golden ceases to write in the voice of a young Japanese woman, and one can tell he is writing in his own voice. His perverse desires are obvious.The book from that point was disgusting. I could not finish it. It made me sick----the part about a doctor taking a young woman's virginity and then saving vials of blood from various women. It was vile and disgusting. Horrible. I tore the book in half and threw the second half away. I did not finish the book.

You can see the same thing duplicated in movies with loads of special effects and yet with no basis to keep your attention other than explosions and what-not every three minutes. When you leave the theater, you could hardly have called it a 'memorable experience.' In Golden's writing, other than possessing an exquisite writing style marked by its flow and captivating descriptions, and metaphors, he is also able to tell quite a remarkable and disarming tale. What makes the story all the more intriguing are the many dimensions of each character that the reader is presented with, particularly in the cases of Sayuri, Hatsumomo and Pumpkin. Though it has been noted by reviewers here and in other places that the book is simply a highly-dramatized \`nothingness', I cannot personally disagree any further. The depth of the characters and the basis for some of their decisions is in no way soap-opera fodder. The anguish Sayuri feels in her choice to betray her friend or to loose the man she has loved so dearly for so many years is not slightly considered. But to each his own opinion... I would like to leave you with a quote that I think exemplifies Golden's masterful use of prose: &quot;... but when I sipped from the smallest of the three cups we used, I let the sake wash over my tongue, and a single drop of it spilled from the corner of my mouth. I was wearing a five-crested kimono of black, with a dragon woven in gold and red encircling the hem up to my thighs. I recall watching the drop fall beneath my arm and roll down the black silk on my thigh, until it came to a stop at the heavy silver threads of the dragon's teeth. I'm sure most geisha would call it a bad omen that I'd spilled sake; but to me, that droplet of moisture that had slipped from me like a tear seemed almost to tell the story of my life. It fell through empty space, with no control whatsoever over its destiny; rolled along a path of silk; and somehow came to rest there on the teeth of the dragon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had given up reading for many years, but decided one day to buy Memoirs to see if something so foreign to me as Japanese culture would hold my interest.

It is the story of Chiyo, a young girl taken from her familiar childhood home, to take part in one of Japan's most everlasting traditions - the art of geisha. The abuse Chiyo endures in the okiya she becomes a member of is an obstacle in her path to fame as a geisha, but with her strength, as well as her miraculous good fortune, she becomes celebrated and loved throughout Japan.

Walking around the bookstore or library for hours can sometimes yield little more than one or two books that look promising, but you are never really quiet sure if it will turn out to be a good book until you get home and start reading. I got incredibly lucky when I sat down to read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by Arthur Golden, a book I had vaguely heard about from teachers and friends. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was different than most books I had read previously because it took place in Japan and dealt mainly with the upper class of Japan and the Geisha.Immediately upon starting to read this book I was drawn into a world like none I had known before, the world of early 1990's Japan . \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was incredibly informative and educational for me. Before I started to read it I thought that a Geisha was a kind of glorified prostitute in Japan who also happened to entertain men, but after reading I learned that a Geisha is more of a paid hostess and rarely if ever sleeps with her customers. She is paid more for her company and hints of sexuality. From the moment you begin reading you are drawn into a world of secrecy, jealousy, sensuality, and heartache that completely grips you and makes this book a page-turner. Another thing that makes this book incredibly entertaining is the fact that Arthur Golden is male and writes from the perspective of a female. He writes so convincibly from the perception of a female that you forget that the author is male. I really enjoyed reading this book and I strongly recommend that anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, or just a good book, to read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was so well written, I couldn't put it down. You follow a girl growing up in the orient through all of her experiences, however large or small. It's a somewhat sad story, but a story of hope at the same time. I'm sorry I couldn't write a better and more descriptive review. I just want to let everyone out there know that this book is well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must say the only reason i read this book is because all of my friends raved about it. I can honestly say this book, in no way, disappointed me. Memoirs of a Geisha is an excellent book that has a way of building each moment in your head. Golden provided exquisite detail about every aspect in Sayuri's life. Whenever Sayuri was stressed, i felt stressed. Whenever Sayuri was sad, i felt sad. The way he gave the kimonos so much detail, allowed me to paint a picture in my head and at time it seems as if you can feel the silk fabric brushing against your own skin. Arthur Golden is an amazing author who clear puts much effort into his writing. I highly recommend this book for anyone to read"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put this book down!! It starts off seeming like just another story about a village girl's life, but quickly unravels to reveal a breath-taking story of the rising of a geisha--throughout it enchanting the reader with beautiful descriptions of kimonos, Japanese architecture, tea ceremonies, hairstyles, as Arthur Golden puts us right in the middle of Gion. I felt as if I were part of the parties, and I had urges to dress myself up in kimonos and put on white make-up, etc. But besides the picture Golden was able to paint in my head, it is also a tale of rivalry, betrayal, trust, loss, and the bitter reality many of us are still naive to. It depicts the hardships during the war, and it makes you sad to hear of characters' rise and harsh falls after you've been so familiar with them throughout the novel. I was even a bit sad to see Hatsumomo's downfall.Mameha was definently my favorite character-- I envy her. I also have very, very deep respect for Nobu. When he was able to offer his help at her desperate time of need, despite her betrayal of his trust, I felt strong admiration for this man. It's a shame Sayuri hurt him deeply over and over again, I wouldn't have been able to do it.If you're interested in Asian culture, bitter rivalry between women, malicious plotting to ruin an enemy completely, and the relations between men and geisha---then this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I picked up this book, I didn't buy it. Instead, I borrowed it from someone. I wasn't sure how I would like it so I didn't want to spend my money on it quite yet. I read the first 2 or 3 chapters and put it down, but a few weeks ago I decided to pick it up again and I couldn't stop! This was one of the best books I have read in awhile. Beautifully written with eloquent passages and excellent descriptions, 'Memoirs of a Geisha' tells the story of a unique girl, Chiyo (later Sayuri) from an obscure Japanese town who is sold into slavery and ends up at an okiya to be trained as a geisha. Through many obstacles, such as the closing of the geisha districts in WWII and the horrible nagging of Hatsumomo, one of the premier and most infamous geishas in Kyoto who Sayuri happens to share an okiya with.I personally enjoyed this book very much. All of the characters were well formed and the story never seemed to get too boring or strenuous. The exotic setting was a change, as was the subject. I loved to read of the descriptions of Sayuri's eventful days as a geisha-in-training under Mameha and of Hatsumomo's sinister actions that plagued the book (and made it more fun). You could feel Sayuri's sadness when she discovered her sister's fate as a Kyoto prostitute, her happiness when she dreamed of the Chairman, her secret love, and her helplessness whenever she was punished due to Hatsumomo's actions.I would say my favorite character was Mameha, although I enjoyed Hatsumomo very much and even felt somewhat sad when she, a premier geisha, was kicked out of the okiya and later became an obscure prostitute to survive.There were some problems I had with this book. When plots and plans were explained, they seemed too complex and were a little too hard to understand, such as when Mameha explained the distribution of monies at the okiya or even towards the end when the Chairman explained his actions and plans on how to achieve Sayuri's affections. It could have been explained in simpler terms.But all in all I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it to all. The author does a wonderful job at disguising his voice as a woman's and no, this book is not just some women's reading group book. If anyone is looking for a good book to read I recommend this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I feel this book was written in a fashion on which we see from two POVs.

The ending made me angry...just that she was kind of a back stabber. And I was upset when I found out that Sayuri wasn't a real person.

He treatment of Pumpkin (her de facto sister) and Nobu (her suitor) were abominable, but she just didn't seem to get it. I had pity for her at first, but that quickly faded. And the writing was quite lacking in imagery much of the time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book had it's up and downs, but was ultimately very slow-paced. It is OK if you don't mind reading 5 pages about walking down a dirt road or observing a rock on a sidewalk, to put it one way. The writing is good and even humorous. The author is impressive in his ability to relate events from a woman's perspective.I could not get pulled in and would never have finished it, were I not required to read it for a bookclub.I, too, was disappointed that there was not more emphasis on the &quot;art&quot; of being a geisha. Also, the back of the book mentioned that she had to find a new life after the war and the geisha houses closed, but she just took up being a geisha again ultimately. That didn't seem like any great new freedom or beginning.I can see why people found it interesting, but if it doesn't grip you after the beginning, don't look for it to improve."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is well written and easy going...

Sadly, I am disappointed. Not only do I find it hard to NOT put down but also to finish reading. Memoir style writing is indeed popular right now as evidenced by &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; and the NYT Food Critic's (I don't remember her name) recent book. The good thing about those books is that they aren't fiction. This one is and as such should be more literary, yet it is not. Another amazon.com reviewer cited Golden's metaphors as cliched, and I agree tenfold. There is no originality in the use of words, of vocabulary, I don't even feel any sympathy for the geisha, since the plot line seems so paltry to me. I took a Japanese literature course in college and was excited by this new book since it would rekindle my love for this country's culture. Then I started reading the book and the rest is -- to use a cliche-- history. Yes, Mr. Golden is an educated man, yes he has travelled and studied the culture of Japan in depth, but no, a work of mesmerizing and riveting beauty it is not. &quot;Life of An Amorous Woman&quot;, &quot;Woman In the Dunes&quot;, &quot;Masks&quot;, even &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; are more representative of Japanese literature than Mr. Golden's &quot;Memoirs&quot;."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautifully written novel manages to keep the reader engaged.

A must read for all those who appreciate a well-written book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I finished the book last night. I'd been coming back to it whenever I had free time because I was so engrossed in the story. The writing is almost flawless. My only complaint is that it seemed to wrap up pretty quickly, as if the author was tired of writing and decided to just sum up the last 40 or so years of her life. Given the outcome of the story, it makes sense, but it also left me with more questions. After everything that this geisha had gone through, I wanted to know more!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sayuri Nitta was not always a stunning, cultured geisha. In fact she was raised in the small fishing town of Yoroida by a woman who died young, and a fisherman who named her Chiyo. When the mother dies an arrangement is made that sends Chiyo and her sister, Satsu, to the Gion district in Kyoto, a place where they later learn will become intrical in their destinies. Immediately they are separated; Chiyo is sent to an okiya where she learns that it is intended for her to become a geisha. It is later that we learn what becomes of Satsu, which is more unfortunate than what happened to Chiyo.At first Chiyo embraces her training, but she is homesick and misses her family desperately. The only thing that keeps her going is a memory of an encounter with a certain gentleman simply known as the Chairman which has made quite an impression on her. It is this image that she clings too, even when all else becomes difficult it is his face that spurns her on to accomplish what she must, even when she later becomes a successful geisha.There are many more people in this book who make up this extraordinary palette of colors and storytelling. One that stands out is Hatsumomo, who instantly becomes Chiyo's arch nemesis. There is also Mameha, who takes Chiyo under her wing and helps her to become Sayuri, the most sought after geisha of her time. I could talk about the men involved in this book, but who am I kidding, it's the women whom the book is about, and that is what makes it a fascinating read.There were a few details that made this not a perfect read for me. It was a good book, but it very easily could have been a great book had a few things been attended to. For one thing, one never knows quite why Hatsumomo has singled out Chiyo as her rival, besides the obvious beauty thing. I figured it was something connecting to the fact that Chiyo was from a fishing village, since Hatsumomo was so disgusted by her smell upon their first meeting. I naturally presumed the tension started because of that, perhaps Hatsumomo was from a similar village and the smell reminded her of her roots. Whatever the reason for the rivalry, it was never fully explained and I wasn't satisfied by this. The other annoying thing was the fact that Golden decided to sum up the last bits of Sayuri's life in the final chapter. This would have been ok if there was more resolution to her relationship with the Chairman before the end... there was a bit of a resolution, but not the kind I was looking for, it was very anticlimactic to say the least.Still, this book was a good read, a page turner if you will. I enjoyed it and wasn't sorry that I read it. I can't wait to see the movie now, in fact, if it's opening tomorrow I am there. I think if you are looking for something that will keep you interested this is definitely the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in Japanese culture, or who may have simply heard about the movie about to be released and wants to compare the film with the original story. Arthur Golden spent years meticulously researching and revising this debut novel, taking great care and plenty of time to make sure it was a true representation of what a geisha's life was like in the 1930s and 1940s. To create a sense of realism, he even writes a fictitious translators note, to make it look as if this really is a story told in Japanese by a real-life geisha and then published after her death. I caution the reader, however, to put aside pre-conceived notions of what geishas are and what they do for a living. The movie is rated PG13, and for good reason. If you are looking for passionate, romantic sex scenes, you will probably be disappointed. There is sex, but little real romance, at least in the book. For anyone with an open mind and a desire to learn more about this integral part of Japanese culture, about how women were and for the most part still are regarded in Japanese society, this book will deeply satisy your curiosity."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A page turner! i love the narrative method it is written! it allowed me to visualise each event! written very simple and definatly a page turner!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a book that you treasure long after it is over. It is a book to own as you know you will read it again one day. I never wanted it to end. It sucks you into an exotic and foreign world that I never even knew existed. The characters are drawn so vividly that I don't believe I will be able to watch the movie because I feel it would be a disappointment. It could never live up or be as intense. The descriptions are done so well of places and things that I was taken to Gion. I myself was transported there into that exotic world and never wanted to leave. The emotional range of this book is so deep that I found myself crying and feeling so much that i would sometimes have to put the book down.

Demure Chiyo, feisty Hatsumomo, perfect Mameha, sweet Pumkin; adored them all."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A friend gave me this book a year ago, knowing that one of my most avid interests is learning of other people's cultures and traditions through reading and travel. &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is filled with descriptive images revealed in charismatic tongue. However, like one other reviewer, I must agree the book is not one hundred percent accurate in Japanese culture. The origin of the dogwood tree in Japan, and the fact that in reality it actually does bloom in May, not autumn as one could determine from the book, are minor inaccuracies. However, many of the Japanese sayings do appear to be the words of one who is definitely not Japanese.We should remember this is a work of fiction; the author can portray the characters, events and details any way he chooses and the story, itself, could very well be a reality. From a tiny fishing village to Kyoto, the book depicts the life of a young girl to geisha in vivid and expressive detail. The story is filled with beauty, passion, mystery and intrigue, and dispite it's minor flaws of Japanese detail, it is a still a captivating story and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Just an observation; notice how the prose of the reviewers, that so gratiously, submitted their 5 star ratings...their own insightful review parallelled the authors writing. There is a difference between prose and prozaic. The reviewers that were OVER-generous with ONE star, have the intelligence and sardonic wit, as demonstrated cleverly in their reviews, that they will learn to stay away from the bestseller list. As for me, after 10 pages, I concluded that he's not a writer- maybe a storyteller, but mostly a typist. I'd rather watch paint dry."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An extremely disappointing and pedestrian novel that simply does not warrant the media hype it has received. The language is flat and without depth. The prose is mundane. A good editor would have cut the redundant sentences and tightened the narrative. This story of severe child abuse and misogyny is not redeemed by moral insight or cultural lesson. If it hadn't been a bookclub selection, I would have set it down after the first three chapters and spared myself the sickening sense of voyeurism that comes with witnessing senseless human cruelty."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fake book. Superficial research invalidates it as serious inquiry or social science writing, thin, two-dimensional plotting and characterizations place it low on the fiction food-chain. Genuinely conceived, resonating novels spring from somewhere real; on some level, at some point they are felt. We care about Jane Eyre; Golden's pasteboard characters mean nothing to us and, we suspect, even less to him, except perhaps as the ticket to a best-seller with an exotic theme. One doesn't even learn that much about geishas -- the facts are sprinked thru bumpily like raisins in dough. The reviewer who compared it to a bodice ripper got it right (one could add, a rather palid one...and those ever-returning grey eyes...I remember a Harlequin Romance that featured grey eyes...) Real research, real writing, real passion, real wit: not here."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is absolutely enchanting from start to finish. Arthur Golden's use of metaphors, beautiful imagery, factual information, and detailed characters create a book that reads as if it was actually dictated by a geisha.Golden uses his poetic metaphors and imagery to describe most everything from how Minister Sato drank his sake to Sayuri's \\"tipsy house\\".Besides the metaphors there is ample knowledge to be gained from the detailed explanations on training and dress. For example a young geisha is expected to learn to dance, play the shamisen and drums, perform tea ceromony et cetera; a geisha 's kimono is the same length no matter who wears them and under the kimono an underrobe, obi,a datejime-waistband, a koshimaki-a hip wrap,and a short sleeved kimono undershirt are worn.Golden's fantastically drawn characters add to the books greatness. They all have a relatively broad range of emotions and feelings that make them endearing and life-like. Sayuri,the daughter of a fisherman, goes through many trials (like Hatsomomo's cruelty, or being separated from her sister, Satsu),yet gradually she learns to accept her new lifestyle as a geisha.The story's elegant language, detailed information and wonderful characters make Memoirs of a Geisha a marvelous read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's prose is outstanding and he managed to write believably from the point of view of somebody of a different gender, from a different culture and a different generation. Quite impressive.I took off one star because after a while, I found the prose to be over-the-top. Research has shown that when people lie they add a bunch of extra details to make their lies appear true -- Golden's book struck me in this way with his exaggerated descriptions of the &quot;crab-like&quot; doctor and disfigured love interest as well as the protagonists own emotions and experiences. Also because the second half was a let-down compared to the first half. The first half dealt with a fairly believable account of life growing up in the okiya and the tension she had dealing with an older, rival geisha. The second half was simply about a sort-of love triangle and semi-titillating escapades during which I got more and more disinterested.I took off another star because he is spreading disinformation by claiming that geisha auction off their virginity which, according to his primary source Mineko Iwasaki, is not true. Yes I know this book is fiction but it still does a disservice to Japan and geisha to portray them in this way.After reading this, I soon read Liza Dalby's Geisha and Mineko Iwasaki's Geisha: A Life. I liked these books immeasurably more but then I am the type that prefers real stories of real people and events over flowery prose in a fictitious world. For prose and just a &quot;good read,&quot; Golden's book is something that most will enjoy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I guess I've just heard so many people rave about this book that I just expected something more. For the first half of the book, I could harldy put it down in the beginning, but somewhere in the middle, I lost interest and had to struggle to finish. I can't exactly put my finger on the reason. I think it may have been a combination of things. One, after Sayuri is no longer an apprentice, I think her character loses something. You see her transform from a humble woman with a good work ethic into a pampered brat who in my opinion, lives a very shelterd life with no regard for others. I have to give away more of the book in order to go on, and I don't want o ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it yet, but I think those of you who have read it know exactly what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Either way the book fell short. I would guess that the jumping point was when Hatsumomo is forced to leave, and we are told that she ends up being a prostitute. The resolution was much too pat, and we were deprived of ever gaining anymore insight into one of the book's seemingly most compelling characters. It all went downhill from there, as the growth of every supporting character, with maybe the exception of Nobo-san, was stunted. As I said, I won't even take into consideration the ridiculous, condescending rush-ending we were subjected to.The first chapter was brilliant, and so promising. It was written beautifully; the execution, flawless(and remained this way until the third or fourth chapter). The awkward use of metaphor, and pretentious pondering of what was already clearly implicated was almost absent from the first half of the book. Little Chiyo-chan was more of a complex character than Nitta Sayuri ever came close to being. Granted, she wasn't a geisha; but rather a fascinating psychological study. Mr. Tanaka was better realized and written, and more intriguing than The Chairman could even dream of being. The Mameha who only helped Chiyo because of a built-in and innate, self-righteous need to eliminate and blot out what was imperfect and unworthy (Hatsumomo) was a hundred times more real and interesting than the honorable and compassionate woman-of-her-word she was revealed to be later."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"First and foremost, I would like to say that Memoirs of a Geisha is a work of fiction and should NOT be taken as actual historical or factual account into the geisha culture.I read this book when it first came and found myself enjoying reading it but, eventually when I finished reading it, I found myself feeling disappointed.Memoirs of a Geisha has been written in a way that is very descriptive which you will find evokes your imagination and transports you to another time and another place. But despite this...there is something lacking to the story - depth. Many of the characters seemed rather \\"hollow\\" and I felt that they had been left grossly undeveloped. Also, the look at the \\"flower and willow world\\" seems superficial and only barely scratching the surface of this intriguing and complex society.It is interesting to note that many geisha themselves are not happy with this book, claiming that it is full of flaws ranging from minor inaccuracies to major betrayals. I feel that this is very important to keep in mind whilst reading it.Essentially, this book is just a western &quot;romance&quot; story that has been given a &quot;Japanese&quot; face. Although it is evident that Golden has put the time and effort into researching the elusive world of geisha, there are many discrepancies throughout this book, hence why it should only be taken as a work of fiction.For those who like a good story to read, I recommend this book.

I became engrossed in the characters (especially Chiyo/Sayuri) and couldn't wait to see what would happen next.

However, I am not much of a reader, so I didn't have time to read it. I lived in Kyoto, Japan (the setting of the book) for a short time and recently returned. Since I had some free time now, I decided to read this book. I thought the story was very mesmerizing and I stayed up the whole night reading. I just couldn't put it down because I had to know what was going to become of the main character. Even though it was a fictional story, I felt as if I were reading a biography of someone's actual life. The descriptions of the setting, characters, and culture matched those of what I had actually saw and experienced during my stay in Kyoto. But, even if a reader didn't know anything about Japan or Japanese culture, you can still enjoy and understand the story. I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is an artful, sensitively written novel, depicting how innocent little Chiyo from a poor Japanese fishing village overcomes multiple adversities--unexpected betrayal by her aging father, death of her ill mother, separation from her sister (who is sold to a house of prostitution but has the strength to escape), cruel and spiteful treatment by veteran geisha Hatsumomo, loss of friendship with her peer Pumpkin, the emotional anguish of a forced undressing of her kimono by the Baron, sale of her virginity (mizuage) for financial gain by the \\"mother\\" of the household (okiya) which bought her from her father years earlier--all en route to becoming first-class geisha Sayuri in the Gion district of Kyoto. Though the term \\"romance\\" is never used in the story itself, the intricate sequence of events richly unfolds into an eventual realization of Chiyo's youthful dream to be loved by the Chairman, a successful Osaka entrepreneur and businessman, who first notices her strikingly attractive blue-gray eyes (rare eye color for a Japanese) one afternoon during a stroll and takes the time to show kindness when she is sad and lonely. Due to their age difference, personal circumstances, the impact of World War II, and, most importantly, the Chairman's obligation to his business partner Nobu, not until almost two decades later does the Chairman permit himself to express his feelings for Sayuri.Despite the personal triumph of protagonist Sayuri and the novel's Cinderella-like happy ending, the work also can be construed as a controversial rendering (by an outside foreigner) of the values and mores of early-to-mid-20th century Japanese society, at least with regard to the geisha world. However pleasurable and commonly accepted in Japan the entertaining, drinking, dancing and carousing at geisha teahouses may be, we cannot overlook the moral and ethical underpinnings of the story: the Chairman is a married man with a wife and family and, since Sayuri knows this, aren't their intimate encounters (\\"we drank each other up with so much yearning and need that afterward I felt myself drained of all the things the Chairman had taken from me, and yet filled with all that I had taken from him\\") considered adultery?; the Baron manages to restrain his physical desires but isn't luring a 15-year-old girl to one's estate and stripping off her kimono \\"just to have a peek\\" considered sexual harassment and molestation?; when a father knowingly and willingly enters into a contract through a businessman in the neighboring village to sell one daughter to a geisha house and another to a jorouya (house of prostitution), isn't this a form of child slavery and exploitation?; when the \\"mother\\" of the okiya takes a leadership role in auctioning off Sayuri's virginity, under the tutelage of geisha Mameha, whose virginity had been sold in the same manner a few years back for a record price, isn't personal choice being blatantly violated?; when geisha are expected to sell their entertainment services, including after-hours sexual favors to wealthy businessmen (danna-san), to pay off apprenticeship debts and thereafter to support the okiya, shouldn't we begin to question the ethical fabric of the broader society that supports the geisha world?Indeed, the historical basis and authenticity of the work have been questioned, by none other than Mineko Iwasaki, the former geisha to whom the author gives foremost credit in his acknowledgements. Following publication of the book, Iwasaki disputed aspects the author's treatment of information she conveyed to him through a candid \\"insider's tour of Gion\\" while he was researching the book. According to news reports, Iwasaki sued the author for breach of contract and defamation, but the parties later reached settlement outside of court.So, how much of the foundation of the story can we believe, what is the professional and personal life of a geisha really like, and what role does the geisha world actually play in Japanese society? Like a first-class geisha spinning tales during \\"big liar\\" drinking games with her customers, Memoirs of a Geisha is a very entertaining and enjoyable read but, unfortunately, historical fact and sociological truth are, I would guess, better sought from a more sober source."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As the name of this book suggests, the book is all about, well, memoirs of a geisha.. :-)Before I read this book, all I knew about a geisha is that she's a Japanese girl who provides entertaining and lighthearted company to men. Nothing else I knew.. However, this story revolves around a geisha and with every page I turned, I got to know more.The strong point of the story is the way the memoirs have been presented.

He really fuses a non-male (not to be gender stereotypical, okay, I am) voice and gives this girl-woman such a feminine thought process. The character is a wonderful introduction to the mysterious and electrifyingly seductive world of the Geisha and her role in Japanese life. It's a fascinating read about people and how they strive to better themselves and this book is a beautifully written, rich delve into watershed landscapes, fabrics, blossoms, and love and obsession, and how a girl becomes a woman and learns the art of emotional foreplay. Of course it became a film and rarely do movies do books justice and in this case, the book is the keeper. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is rich, engaging, and beautifully written - that is, right up until it hits World War II. Sayuri is a well-constructed character with a sharp wit, almost too sharp at times when taking into account her age, and a strong will for survival. She has pros and cons to her personality and her emotions are easily felt by readers. The descriptions are usually very good, though occasionally lengthy and confusing, and the people seem realistic (I only say seem because this is coming from a Western point of view who is not an expert on Depression-era Japan).The story is wonderful until World War II comes along; then it falls flat on its face. It really does amaze me that the war, which left thousands dead and later generations to pay for it, came and went in a matter of pages. It's not safe anymore, Sayuri goes out to the middle of nowhere, ruins her hands through hard labor, and oop, war's over, let's go back to the city and get drunk like old times! I understand that Sayuri may not have been involved much in politics, but I would have expected a little more commentary than that. Later she only observes that the people in the city have changed, there are a lot of American soldiers, and Western-style clothing is becoming popular.The plot simply goes downhill from there. Sayuri becomes obsessed with her quest for the Chairman and seems to have lost all of the intelligence and witty comparisons and observations that made her so intriguing. In a twist of fate that only a book or Hollywood could provide, Sayuri does indeed end up with the Chairman, who has secretly loved her all along, and the story goes on to resemble a cheap romance novel.Though beautifully written (up until the last part), two things continue to bother me about this book: the fact that it is presented as if it were based on the life of \\"Japan's most celebrated geisha,\\" an actual woman named Sayuri (read the first half of the summary on back), and also that this was written by a white American man. I just have to wonder about the accuracy of many things in this book, especially since so much resembles current Western thoughts and ideals.I'd like to give this book 4 stars, and indeed I'd give it 5 if I just had never bothered to read the ending, but because I did read the ending and I did learn that it was written by a white American man who basically just took a real geisha's life story from an interview he requested and twisted it without her permission, it gets a 3, which is mainly for undeniably good writing ability."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a beautiful novel, with one fatal flaw. When I read the book I honestly thought it was completely non-fiction, and not until the end was it reveleaed the entite story was invented by an American male. Normally I would think this should not matter on the quality of the book, but in this case it certainly does. The first half of the novel is fascinating as it details a geisha's upbringing and training (although I have no idea how accurate these portrayals are). The second half is more of a cheesy love story, which tips the reader that this is really a work of fiction. Depending on your taste, I would recommend reading a non-fiction book on the interesting topic of geishas instead."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I give this book two snaps! This was a beautifully written book and the author grabbed me even still with his introduction to the woman who inspired this tale. The characters in this book are unforgetable. The scenes and key moments in this book are vivid and detailed. I was so impressed by this book, I gave this book to my friend for her birthday, (who happens to be a writer by the way) and she feels the same way I do. And for her to say that about a book means alot since she's just as picky as I am. Actually, I take that back. She's a lot pickeyer than I am.This is a must read for anyone who is interested in getting a glimpse of how a geisha lived, but not just existed mind you. The world of a geisha is very different than what you would think. For while the idea of a subservient, submissive woman leaves a foul taste, the geisha had a power of her own. A power, I might add, some women have forgotten they have, like stopping a man in his tracks by merely giving him a glimpse through your lashes instead of a glimpse of cleavage. For while the geisha existed (and still does) in a male dominated culture, the geisha was very much like the courtesans of old. They were and are the most privileged women in the world. Highly educated and cultured, these women however shape and size, lived in a misunderstood state that many still criticize.The author did a magnificant job in telling the significance of everything to the showing of the geisha's neck to the preperation of putting the face of the geisha on.There were moments in this book that moved me and there were some that were cold and made me wince. But that's what I wanted. That's what I want from all my books.So to end my review, let me just say that this book will take you away to a time and place where the world of a geisha will give you a different aspect on life, and even some of the aspects of your own life. This book is an eye and mind opener. Very educational and informative to be exact. A sure fire literary dream come true, a keeper for anyone looking for a jem to add to their library collection or even a book report for those in the collage world. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"With the long-awaited screen adaptation directed by Rob Marshall (\\"Chicago\\") coming next month, Arthur Golden's original novel is certainly worth a second look as it remains one of the deepest and most convincing immersions into a foreign culture, the highly complex and mythologized world of the Japanese geisha. The first-person narrative is such a bold move because it immediately gives a sense of autobiography that a lesser writer would have come across as merely self-indulgent. Yet, he invents an academic figure to \\"write\\" the foreword - Jakob Haarhuis, a fictional professor of Japanese at NYU, provides an explanation for how the memoirs are gathered, that they are the taped memoirs of the protagonist Sayuri.While it's obvious that Golden has done his research, what takes the book to a higher level is the way he penetrates the psyche of the people caught within the orbit of this cloistered world. The story follows the life of Chiyo, a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of her unusual grey eyes, Chiyo is then sold to an okiya (boardinghouse for geishas). The scenes in the okiya are Golden's most meticulous and accomplished, especially as Chiyo undergoes a grueling apprenticeship and competes with the beautiful, worldly but wholly spiteful Hatsumomo, who is the okiya's star geisha. Men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner, and she takes her new name, Sayuri, symbolizing her metamorphosis into a professional geisha. Surviving some unsavory escapades with some of the okiya's most undesirable patrons, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature and becomes the mistress of the man she had set her heart on all along, the benevolent chairman of an electrical supply company.While a more predictable story would have stopped there with the love story, the author goes further and has Sayuri move to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen until the chairman dies. In a certain way, I wish Golden did stop the book in Japan when WWII ends in the story. The chapters afterward feel rushed as if the author is losing interest in her story and wants the reader to get to the inevitable ending quickly. Regardless, Golden fills the book with vivid images and subtle descriptions of the nuances of Japanese culture. Absolutely invaluable in its detail if sometimes too overwhelming to appreciate at once (a repeated reading is recommended), the story reflects a brilliant eye for the customs and rituals within geisha society, including its politics, rivalries, and traditions. Having been to the historic Gion district of Kyoto, where present-day geishas still live, I have caught a glimpse of these women scurrying about in their beautiful kimonos looking both fetching and anachronistic. Golden captures their stories with compassion and an anthropologist's fervor. This is strongly recommended both as fiction and an essential ingredient of Japan's cultural history."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Haunting and delicious, Memoirs of a Geisha was truly a book that made me want to read more.

It is told entirely from the viewpoint of the memoirist, of course. She unfortunately maintains complete equanimity and betrays no personal faults despite the extreme hardship after the death of her mother and the almost uniform cruelty and desperation of almost everyone with whom she interacts. I felt the story lacked emotion and depth. It could have been a fable or a children's story but I don't think it qualifies as fiction. For a better version of a similar story, I recommend Theodore Dreiser's classic novel, Sister Carrie, about an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, where she becomes a kept woman."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"with all of the hype this book has gotten, i couldnt wait to read it. i found the intimate view of japanese culture to be very interesting. i also found that my perceptions of a geisha were incorrect.while i did enjoy this book, and developed an appreciation for japanese culture, i did not find the book to be the page-turner i thought it would be.however i still recommend it; if not only for an interesting peek into the daily life of an apprentice-turned-geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was THERE with the women.

It didn't appeal to me, that's all.Oriental culture isn't foreign to me. I am Chinese, I've seen Oriental culture, I'm nearly suffocating in it, etc. I personally think this book draws much of its charm from its exotic setting, much like pioneer novels did for East Coast city-dwellers when America was younger.But despite its exotic settings, the book keeps a distinctly Western flavor. It seemed like it looked at the geisha life through a Western-tinted lens of wonder--which is fine, really, but IMHO, it's lacking the &quot;feeling&quot; of Japan. It doesn't feel like Japan, it feels like a Japanese movie set built in Southern California.Otherwise, it's lovely. The writing is gorgeous and the character development especially is excellent. I'd still recommend it, just for a good and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I hadn't read a book like this in a long, long time. A book that stayed with me for a few days (its scenes, its images, its art - in a very vivid way) even after I finished reading it. It touched me so deep, it made me feel such strong feelings, it was so real, and it left me with that bitter-sweet taste of life.A little girl, born in a corner of the world, where nothigness was lifestyle, is brought out of it facing a life where choice is not even a word. While her childhood was filled with nothing much, her adulthood is filled with so much, but choice. How can one even live when there is no choice? Well, the artistry of the writer, and the very life of this woman, have the answer.The book is so rich, its language is deep and full of metaphors, symbolics, epithets...the images are so real and so touchable, the feelings are so strong, there is no escape in being one with the characters and living with them. The skillfullness of Golden can be read in every letter, and the amazing life of this woman, her character, her survival is the means that displays it.This book is a fine piece of literature.

Each character is drawm very well and they seem to come alive , as you read the book. The author has a profound insight to Japanese culture and it shows."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was mesmorized by this story. Taking place in and around Kyoto, Japan, this novel, which could easily have been nonfiction, describes the life of a young child who is thrust into a not so innocent world. Shortly before the death of her mother, Chiyo's father basically sells his daughter to an okiya in Kyoto during the 1930's with the hopes, I gather, that she will make something of herself as a geisha after years of highly regimented training.Young Chiyo's life growing up in the okiya during Japan's depression was dismal. Golden's portrayal of these years is magnificent. I felt as if I were an unidentified character within the novel rather than solely a reader.The child grew up in horrendous conditions and was treated miserably to say the least. You must remember, she was given room and board and training in hopes that someday a significant portion of her profits would come back to the okiya and thus ultimately its owners.This novel is about growing up and becoming clever, wise, and independent at a very young age. It is about love, hope, and patience while living during a very tumultuous period in Japan's history.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to explore a young girls attempt to understand her role in life. In doing so perhaps you will be able to reflect on circumstances that paved the path upon which you arrived at your present destination."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is by far the best book i have read in a long time. you sympathize with chio (later sayuri), you celebrate with her, and you feel everything that she feels. the books begings when she is forced to become a geisha. you follower her as the begings her schools..gets kicked out of her schooling, finds new hope with the man she loves.

His genius was to combine elements of Dickens's DAVID COPPERFIELD and Austen's MANSFIELD PARK and set his story in the fascinating world of geisha before and just after the Second World War. His heroine, Sayuri (Chiyo), is also neither like Dickens's David Copperfield or Austen's Fanny Price is that she is much more proactive and is at times even devious, but she shares their deprived upbringings and victimizations by childhood nemeses--and, like them, becomes recognized for her true worth as she matures. Golden also writes like a dream, and has done superb historical research for his work. Although it is true his heroine-narrator never seems to reflect long over her guilt in making other characters' lives miserable--or in the meanings for her nation of the wars it wages against China and other nations--, the novel is a beautiful and romantic read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"it is simply the best book i've ever read, although there is mature(VERY mature) stuff in it.I recommend it to teens"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I truly enjoyed the book on CD.

There are certain to be some discrepencies, and if you ask me, Golden did a lot of hard and successful research for the writing of this book.I found the prose and use of metaphor and descriptives really effective. The main disappointment to me was the book's ending. It seemed to me rushed and just wrong, especially in the case of Nobu. I found that Golden didn't give the reader enough material for any real feeling towards the Chairman. One even must question Sayuri's infatuation with this man whom she hardly sees; and this infatuation is so strong that in the end she is willing to hurt a good man like Nobu to be with him. Chairman is quite a one-dimensional character, unlike Nobu, who is honest and supportive throughout years and years and this leaves us feeling cheated with the story's unrealistic ending."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had been reading nonfiction books for such a long time that I decided it was time for me to pick out a fiction novel. A few of my friends had read Memoirs of a Geisha a couple of years ago and they all enjoyed it.I read the translator's note at the beginning and was so hooked I couldn't stop reading. I finished the 400+ page book in less than a week and everytime I had to put it down I couldn't wait to pick it back up.As I read the book I felt like I was listening to a woman talking to me about her life. I felt as if she were really sitting in my living room and remembering her stories. The detail and comparisons are wonderful and the characters are all well-developed. I had no previous knowledge of geisha and was really enchanted by the new world I was uncovering. I felt like page by page I was learning more about this culture, time period and place than I could have discovered in a text book on Japan.This easy to read book, though not short, is perfect for a light read. Definitely a great book to pick up if you're longing for a delightful story. After I had finished the book I caught myself sometimes imagining that I was a geisha in the Gion district, complete with my kimono and properly tied obi. Although not a most glorious life, this book shows how being a geisha became the life of these girls and women even if it wasn't their desire."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful story that I could not put down. The detail and the wonderful plot kept me interested and wanting more. I think that the ideal audience is women of any age and anyone who is misinformed about the life the geisha really lived. The story was great for me to relate to a girl because it was all about growing up in Kyoto, Japan. There were things that I had never known about geisha. All my perceptions of them being highly paid hookers was taken away when I read this great story about a real life, about a person that I could actually relate to. I found out that geisha were very interesting women. Sayuri was the main character. She was taken from her family, separated from her sister, and learned the ways of a geisha in a household where nothing was ever free. She was tormented by an older geisha and lived a very hard life until she officially became a geisha herself. The story of her hardships was great. The characters were so real and the story came to life easily for me. The detail of the story captured my imagination and I could always imagine being right there with Sayuri. I felt the pain of missing a sister and being all alone, I felt the anticipation of becoming a geisha, and the hatred she felt for the older geisha in her household. I wanted to reach out and help her and give her advice; I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know what would happen to her next. I highly recommend this book because it tells a wonderful story and helps people to understand that people of different cultures aren't different at all because we all share the same emotions."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have now read this book twice. I can only do this with good stories. I re-read Rebecca and Little Women and Memoirs of a Geisha. The book transports you to another world. You find yourself forgetting that these men all have wives at home and taking the side of the geisha. As I read, I wish to wear a kimono and have my hair styled elaborately. If you are looking for a good story and to also learn much about Asian culture, then I suggest you buy this book now."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are no words to express how this book captured my heart. I really felt as if I was reliving Sayuri's life through her own words. The author, although a GUY, wrote masterfully, and totally convinced me that I really was reading a geisha's memoirs. He explained everything so beautifully, and the story unfolded so realistically, that I couldn't help but cry when I finished the book. It became a part of my life for a few days, and really has changed the way I view life. I really can't explain what I mean (which is quite obvious), but let a sentence suffice. I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book on my sister's recommendation, with much hesitancy. I don't usually go for the \\"book of the week\\" but was intrigued by the geisha culture, so I gave it a shot.The first thing that shocked me was that \\"Memoirs...\\" was written by a man. Arthur Golden's ability to paint this culture and their womens' strength is staggering. The politics and cutthroat behind-the-scenes drama take the reader to a world where virginity is given to the highest bidder, and love is set aside for duty. Behind the richness and beauty of these women lie dreams and wishes that must be hidden away in order to survive.Read this book and you will look at our freedoms and traditions in a new light. Women the world over aren't that different after all. Just ask a guy named Arthur.- Another great read along these lines is \\"The Red Tent\\" by Anita Diamant."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I felt like I was the one living in the lives of the characters of this novel.

Just lovely!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. From the beginning I had this negative outlook on Geisha women, however this book really delt with a young girl growing up and living the Geisha lifestyle. In their culture, a geisha was envied by all. This book is well worth reading. A good novel to travel with."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was rated in \\"like new\\" condition. It smelled like the seller went to their great, great, great Grandmothers very damp cellar to send us this book. It smells so bad my daughter can hardly breathe when she reads it. It was not even worth the penny I paid for it & it does not deserve the 1 star rating. I'm sure glad my daughter doesn't have asthma, she wouldn't be able to read it. The only positive thing about this seller is it came in a timely mannor."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I became aware of this book when it showed up on my 15 year old girl's required school summer reading list. I was shocked that such a book had been suggested to a 15 year old girl to read. Themes found in the book include child prostitution, child exploitation, rape, bizarre sexual practices, slavery, abortion, and exploitation of women. A young girl is sold into slavery, gets trained on how to \\"beguile\\" men into paying her for sex and giving her gifts, other geisha have abortions at the request of their lovers, and all throughout not an ounce of remorse or infusion of morality. She lives happily ever after as the owner of a New York tea house after she has conned men into giving her money and keeping her in the style she became accustomed to. Even the geisha upon which this story was fashioned has threatened to sue because it cast her in a bad light. Finally, if geishas are not prostitutes then I do not know what is. If it quacks like a duck, it is a duck. If her virginity is sold to the highest bidder, and her regular lover bids for her undivided sexual attention, then that is prostitution, by definition. I guess Heidi Fleiss did not think she was a prostitute, either.. . . and we give this to 15 year olds to read . . . What is this world coming to!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I usually try to refrain from buying a book when it's a bit too popular, and I should have followed my own guidelines this time. I'm very sorry but I just had to say that this was the most boring thing I've ever read in my entire life, and I read everything! I took it to the beach with me last year and it almost ruined my vacation it was so bad.

I am a 27 year old female, conservative, college educated, and I have read a few good books. This was certainly not one of them. Characters are so simplified, either \\"GOOD\\" or \\"BAD.\\" I felt as if I were reading an essay of some nonimaginative woman who was trying to make everyone feel sorry for her. Just because it made it to a bestseller list, does not mean it is worth reading. Jerry Springer's show was popular too but we all know how 'good' that was. This book is in the same category.Do not waste your time on this book, I felt sorry I did."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden is trying to follow the life of a Japanese woman. It is hard for men to truly portray a woman; that is why very few genuine female characters exist in literature. Arthur Golden fails too. He fills pages with banalities in the life of a girl training to become a geisha, a social butterfly who must entertain men with dance and tea-parties. Her face is painted white like a mask and her lips are tomatoe-red. A clown face? If Mr. Golden is to be believed, humor is not encouraged in that society. If you make it to page 280 and not have died of boredome yet, you will be appalled with the performance of the highest bidder in Kyoto to deflower her. The act is a bloody mess without any emotional involvement. Do I believe it? No! This elderly creep paid for privilege to eel himself into a virgin. Poor little 15 year old geisha on her way to become a courtesan! I was thinking how many women throw away a moment like that. Do it geisha style, girls! Give it to the highest bidder. One thing was interesting in this book. For the \\"morning after\\" this geisha was handed tea herbs for a concoction to prevent pregnancy. Our pharmaceutical industry has so far prevented us women from learning this ancient secret. As we advance in the Age of Aquarius, we women are on the rise, unstoppable, leaving centuries of degradations behind us; and the movement is blessed, because the world needs female wisdom. If I understand this author correctly, the world of a geisha to be toyed with by men belongs to the past. For it's historical value I must give the book a second star. Ms. Gerborg Frick"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Im sorry, I couldnt even finish this book. It was just extremely bland. I thought there would be more in it than just a bunch of bitchy women trying to impress a group of sleazy men. What was even worse than the simple plot was the characters. They just didnt seem real or very interesting to me. And all they did was bicker. Over men.Constantly. Throughout the whole book.Its not that the women in this book want to impress the men, they really just use them on the pathway to gain fame for themselves. I still dont quite understand much about what geisha do. I mean, in this book it seemed like all they did was go to drinking parties. I was hoping they would be more artistic. I also dont think that the authors writing style was very original, beautiful, or interesting.It was kind of flat and what is really annoying is when he keeps throwing in &quot;deep thoughts&quot; for Sayuri to have but she seems like an airhead to me. Like always going on about that slimey chairman guy.I never did see why she was so obsessed with him. He seemed really boring to me but then maybe thats because she is also extremely dull. I dont see how such an supposedly accomplished woman could be such a boring ninnie. Anyway, this is defiantly one of the worst books Ive ever encountered and im glad I quit it to read Anne Rices The Queen of the Damned.

This is a \\"must-read\\". I have not met a person who has read this book and not loved it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden's richly detailed writing style enhances the prose in \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" although his liberal use of ornate metaphors can be tiring to some readers. Young Chiyo, who adopts the geisha name Sayuri, starts life as a little girl from a fishing village called Yoroido and transforms into a celebrated geisha in Gion. The adult Sayuri in the last third of the novel is almost unrecognizable from the Chiyo of the beginning, making Golden's fictional depiction of the evolution of a girl worth a read in its own right.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is thoroughly researched and well-conceived, but probably not true-to-life, which is acceptable given that it is a novel and not a memoir. As a novel, though, \\"Memoir\\" could feature better development of Hatsumomo's character. Clearly, Hatsumomo is an evil, wicked fiend but what about her redeeming qualities? Is it her undeniable beauty, or the fact that at one point she said to Sayuri what is quite possibly THE meanest insult that I have ever read in a novel? I want to be able to like Hatsumomo for more than just the sole fact that she is so incredibly and entertainingly evil.The last fifty or sixty pages of the novel seem to fall into place fairly conveniently with new revelations that essentially clear up the tumultuous rubble that built up in the second half of the story. This is not to say that the ending is lazy, but it is simply not as absorbing as the beginning in certain respects. The book, which is set during the Great Depression and World War II, gets more discouraging as Sayuri grows older and more worldly. With notable skill and style--especially for a debut novelist--Golden uses Sayuri's younger sensibilities to paint the first parts of the story in a more hopeful hue than in her adult chapters. See for yourself.\\"Memoirs\\" is good as long as it is read as more of a fictional tale than as an authoritative text on geisha life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book brought the geisha lifestyle alive to me and transported me to a distant land with customs so unlike my own westernized views of women, relationships and feminine power. A different viewpoint and very good reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Well-written, well-researched, engaging, and a pleasure to read, this book allows a rare glimpse into the world of the early 20th century Japanese geisha.

The only annoyance I found was an overabundance of analogies and metaphors."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you want to be transported into a lovely historical fiction novel then you will want to listen to this audio. Davis adapts a Japanese accent with a perfect theatrical presentation.This story is about a young peasant girl who became a popular geisha and the journey there (pre and post WWII). The book is filled with hints of petty jeolousies, plots to influence, and a cast of characters who leave you eager to hear the next events. The story seduces you through Chiyo's maturity into the popular geisha Sayuri--and I found myself rooting for her during her quest for her heart's desire.

It tells the story of its enchanting heroine, Sayuri, beginning with her days as a poor girl in a fishing village, through her journey to become a well-known respected geisha, and to her older age when she recounts her remarkable life story to a publisher in New York . The old adage \\"write what you know\\" certainly doesn't apply to this American male author who somehow spun this wonderful and detailed story about something he could never have come close to experiencing."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel is truly one of the most beautiful, well articulated, and descriptive stories i have ever read..

We know about Noh and Kabuki actors, traditional theater, and the white paint used on their faces. This reader has also been beguiled by stories of the aesthetes of Boston and Paris who were transfixed by Japanese art and culture. Naturally the world of the geisha is a good deal messier. This novel is a recreation of that world in the 1930's and 1940's by a scholar of Japanese art and history. The novel may have become as popular as it has basically for two reasons. The first is that Arthur Golden does a masterful job. The second is that the themes of the novel resonate in our culture. We have become intensely interested in the violation of innocence-- shades of Samuel Richardson's PAMELA. There is a third reason, too, and that is that in our classless and relatively fluid society we are enamoured of tales set in more traditional societies where considerations of caste are paramount.Her geisha name is Sayori, her birth name Chiyo. She is one of two daughters of a fisherman. Her mother is dying. Her family cannot afford to buy the mother a beautiful robe for dying. A Mr. Tanaka, the head of the Japan Coastal Seafood Company, has already arranged a physical examination of Chiyo and her sister. Chiyo believes that Mr. Tanaka wants to adopt them. Chiyo and Mr. Tanaka's daughter sneak out at night to follow Mr. Tanaka to a tea house where he sits with the geisha.Surprisingly, Mr. Tanaka transports the girls out of town in a direction away from his house, to be turned over to a Mr. Bekku. The sisters are separated in the city, Kyoto. Chiyo is taken to an okiyo in Gion, a geisha district. Eventually managing to contact her sister, she endeavors to escape with her the following week, but is thwarted by the increased vigilance of the okiyo workers. She does come up with a plan, but in jumping off of the roof of the building in which she is being held, she breaks her arm and is discovered. Following this escapade she spends two years being a maid and comes to realize that being a geisha is a means to other things. Through a series of complications her geisha apprenticeship resumes. The reader is led through the competitive world of geisha. Golden shows the claustrophobia inevitable in an environment relatively cushioned from the stresses of world affairs during the worldwide depression and World War II. Finally the district is closed down during the latter years of the war and its inhabitants left to find work in the factories. Sayuri sews parachutes in the shop of a kimono maker. She returns to the district several years after the end of the war and subsequently settles in New York City for reasons I cannot say without giving away the plot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is an amazingly wonderful book. The well developed plot and fascinating story keep the reader interested. Authur Golden brings forward a side of Japanese culture that has always seemed proper and prim, but in depth we learn that &quot;what goes on during the morning in the office and what goes on in the evening behind closed doors bear no relationship to one another, and must always remain compartmentalized and seperate.&quot; The way Golden weaves both the morning and evening details of a geisha's life is done well. The style of writing was easy to fallow. The vivid description he uses throughout provides for lovely inagery. &quot;The radient smile she'd worn now faded, just as the darkness fades from a valley when the sun rises on it,&quot; is one of the many examples of how Golden displays his talents in writing. He also uses cultural terms and explains them for the benefit of the reader. For example, when he talks about zori, there is no definition in the dictionary, but he explains that they are wooden sandals with tapering soles that make it hard to balance. These cultural terms bring the reader further into the culture and the story. In all I would give this story a 9. It was a very good read, but I found myself wanting to find out what would happen faster then the author would allow. Gloden has written an excellent piece and it has met my expectations. I would recommend that anyone with an interest in Japanese culture read it, for it gives more depth to an interesting culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a great book and it certainly shows the life of a Geisha, but I think that the romance lacks a little feeling.

The author has a marvelous way of describing the sights and feelings of Sayuri in such a way that you really understand her. Yet, the descriptions aren't so refined and perfect that they aren't believable as her actual thoughts. And I give the author credit for, while he had to describe some intimate encounters, he did so with a discreetness I wish more authors (and Hollywood) would learn.

I would also like to thank the reader from California for recommending Fried Calamari."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book elucidates a culture and custom few Westerners can understand. I was captivated and actually finished the book with an unexpected respect for these women who found a significant place in a social hierarchy that offered little to women. The story is engrossing - a must-read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This audio cassette program is terrific. Bernadette Dunn does a fabulous job narrating this fascinating story. It's hard to believe that it was written by a man. I found the story riveting. And I would highly recommend the audio version."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Well-written and with an authentic aura, but not nearly as life-changing as most of the world (including Madonna) would have you believe. Golden's ability to craft an Asian woman's life tale is remarkable, but ultimately its sense of Eastern reserve will leave many without any emotional investment in the story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautiful, haunting prose. An entree into a culture few Westerners know anything about, with a heroine as determined and self reliant as Scarlett O'Hara. The language and the landscape will stay with th reader long after the last page is read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book makes you feel like you are living in the world of the main character, Sayuri the geisha. Every detail is depicted intricately and told with a sense of beauty and eroticism. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put this book down. I was so taken with Suriya and her story, that I just kept reading until my eyes blurred. After the first few chapters, I resigned myself to the fact that I was reading an entertaining and well-told story, not a excellent piece of literature, but I loved it anyway.Until the end.What a horribly disappointing ending to a good book. I had gotten used to the fairytale that was Suriya's life.Really, she was an entertaining character, but not strong or deep. And darn lucky, if you ask me. So to have luck swoop in again in the last few chapters is such an unbelievable manner... ugh.I won't read it again, but I sure am glad I read it once."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought the the plot was really clunky, the writing mechanical, the characters poorly developed, and most of all I resented the fact that the men portrayed in this work were, with one exception, represented as twisted, horrible creatures. Mr. Tanaka, Dr Crab(!), Nobu, Minister, the General.....all written up as cretanoid mutants. And the author is even a man! Not only a man, but an American who is interested in Japanese history primarily and did some amount of study in Japan. He no doubt thought himself qualified after his residence there to publish the &quot;great&quot; Japanese novel. I would imagine the Japanese literary community is appalled at this book.Perhaps some of the material about the geisha class themselves, their training and culture was redeeming, I don't know. But the plot was like some turn of the century, silent film melodrama. The feud with the other geisha Hatsumomo was an absurd subtheme in my opinion, as was the novel-long, nauseating idolation of &quot;The Chairman&quot;.I bought this because of all the great reviews I saw in Amazon.com and because it was such a best seller. Was afraid that, I must be missing something really good here! It's books like this that make me steer clear of modern fiction by and large."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Reading this book made me want to go back in time to visit Kyoto, Japan pre-WWII. The story is suspenseful and captivating but certain flaws in the story never seem to be resolved. One such flaw seems to be the fact that we never seem to really get to know the object of the main character's affection.Like most love-at-first-site stories, the meaning behind it is largely non-existent. The main character's motives for her infatuation with her love interest seem contradictory to her lack of value for other characters who in their own ways also encompass the same virtues he does. Though the author does seem to notice this contradiction, his only attempts to acknowledge it are by drawing out some painful consequences that never get resolved. For this reason, I found myself not liking the character much because of her superficial and thoughtless attitude toward other characters.Not to say I didn't enjoy the book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The hero simply seems to lack heroism in some key moments."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My mom at first didnt really want me to read this book... she said I probably wasn't mature enough... But it turns out I did read it, and Im glad I did, because I've never read a better book. I wish it would never end, and now Im afraid I can never find another book like it. At first I thought it could never be like The Lovely Bones, but it was even better. It was a great book, I cant even find the right words to explain how much I loved it"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a geisha is a book for those who want to have a quick glimpse at the lives of geishas. The book tries to drive away the misconception that people have -- that geishas are prostitutes.The book is in first person, the story being narrated by the geisha Sayuri who was born to a poor fishermen from a remote village, but goes on to become a world renown geisha.The author gives many intricate details about the life of a geisha and I found them very interesting. I was hooked onto the book _all_ the time.I particularly liked the author's style of comparison. Some people might find the writing style irritating, but I loved it.I found the climax a little disappointing. The author probably wanted his readers to feel happy, so he gave a happy ending to the novel. I felt the characters were shown in a different light in the end just to achieve the feel-good climax.The characters are not that well developed. They seem implausible at time.I liked the book for the insight it gave me into the life of a geisha. I was so curious to know more about them that I often found myself looking up more stuff on geisha over the net.It doesnt look like a true autobiography. Bcos Sayuri doesnt talk about her feelings at all. Its more like a narration of incidents.If you do not read this book, you are not missing anything. Because the information given in this book can be obtained from any other book or on the net. If you give it a try, you won't be disappointed because the book is fast paced. It doesn't drag and you might like the author's writing style."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Only flaw is the ending seemed a little to contrived/happy. In life things don't always work out the way you want them to.As a whole, good story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is the skillfully narrated story of a sensitive girl forced into life as a pre-World War 2 Japanese geisha. Sayuri's (the novel's protagonist) early life is filled with simple conflicts as she struggles to survive in her cruel surroundings. As Sayuri enters her teen years and full-fledged geishadom, however, the situations in which she finds herself become increasingly complex. The book masterfully explores such themes as taking control of your own life, struggling with seemingly inescapable immorality, faith and perseverance, and, of course, love. Sayuri arguably doesn't always make the right decisions, but the reader will feel for her as she struggles to maintain her faith and innocence. Like a flower, the delicate story grows more nuanced and beautiful as it progresses.The book is not completely 100% accurate in terms of Japanese culture, but I don't think the very few minor mistakes detract from the themes.I've seen the book on reading lists for middle-school and young high-school children, but it is probably not appropriate for kids of that age as most of them likely won't be able to get past the simple sexual overtones to see the deeper undercurrents beneath (hey, but then again, I'm 18, so who knows?)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was captivated with the story until the last quarter of the book when the detail became too tedious and the choices the characters made became too cliche. I'm mad I spent so much time on this long book when I could have been reading something of substance. Too corny."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I usually don't read books like this one, but after hearing various recommendations for this book, I decided to try it.I was pulled into the story right away. I loved the metaphors the author used, and the story was enthralling. You learn so much about the Japanese culture.The story is about a girl who was kidnapped from her town of Yoroido and sold into &quot;slavery.&quot; At her okiya, Chiyo meets a nasty geisha named Hatsumomo. For some reason, Hatsumomo decided that it is her job to make Chiyo's life miserable. She accused Chiyo of accusing jewelry, which of course she didn't, and puts her into a great deal of debt.I don't want to give any more of it away, but Memoirs of a Geisha is a truly amazing book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I've read Memoirs of A Geisha for two times and I'm now working on my 3rd round! This book has opened my eyes &amp; lead me deep into the world of geisha. I would strongly recommend this book to those who are interested to learn about geisha (especially beginners).The story begins with Chiyo, a poor country girl who grows up to be a geisha. This novel is character-driven as we see the gradual changes in Chiyo's character (soon changes to her geisha name, Sayuri). The character itself brings out the essence of the story and is worth burning the midnight lamp just to finish the whole book.However, it is a must that we realise this book is merely fiction and is just a representative of the true geisha life. The author may have altered facts in order to make the story interesting. But I tell you, it's worth reading it!!I would give this book a 6-star if I could."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a well written book with an interesting description of life in Japan at that time. However, the lack of moral reflection on a life of prostitution (a high class call girl is still a prostitute) offends me. The complete acceptance of the validity of men taking mistresses and women living to serve men make it little more than a politically correct exhaltation of the worst in the Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is absolutley wonderful. I can not believe that these are fictional characters. I have one request for Mr. Golden- MORE PLEASE!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I highly recommend this book.

I finished it in two days and would reccomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is by far the best novel I have ever read. Reading Mr. Golden's words transported me to Japan- rather, to a Japanese painting. As much as it is highly descriptive, like a painting done with very fine brushstrokes, Memoirs of a Geisha is written in a subtle, delicate style simultaneously peaceful and riveting. I have recommended the book to three people, all of whom have thanked me profusely! Kore wa ichiban no hon desu, Golden-san. Domo arigato gozaimashita."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book offered a brilliant insight into the world of the Geisha. It portrayed the Geisha as something other than the mystical oriental doll-like creature often viewed as the Asian Prostitute. Instead, it gives the reader an opportunity to learn about the inner world of the Geisha, the training, the thoughts, the culture and history behind these women. The development of the characters, particularly the primary character from her childhood to the ultimate fantasy of being the Geisha to the Commander was a gem and I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Mr. Golden has written a wonderful touching story of the life of a Geisha named Sayuri. As the story unfolds, the reader is swept along with Sayuri to the Geisha district of Kyoto where her new path in life begins. In order to survive, she focuses all her determination and courage on her &quot;Savior&quot;, the Chairman. There are many memorable characters in the story but Hatsumomo as the &quot;root of all evil&quot; is outstanding. Although I found myself truly hating her, I experienced a certain pity... I enjoyed this book so much I read it in two days."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Great world-building from start to finish, and well worth reading for anyone curious about the geisha and their world -- I'm unsure how solid the author's research may have been, being no scholar, but I certainly found it absorbing. The story-line, however, is in the end conventional to the point of becoming a bit of a disappointment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I find it hard to believe that Speilberg is making a film out of this.

This really fills the bill. Eastern culture is such a mystery to so many of us and this book truly brings our common humanity to light."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although I read this book for 3 nights straight, and finished it, I was very disappointed. Since this was a &quot;memoir,&quot; I expected the character to speak to us from the perspective of someone who was looking back at their life. All the characters were so two dimensional and we never really got into the heart of any of them. Great descriptions of clothing, hairstyles and locations, but I found little which took me into the soul of the geisha life. A good book for vaction reading, but I certainly would not call it any kind of a great novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It wasn't until I read the critics review of Arthur Golden's, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, that I was able to understand why I had such a strong sense of deja-vu as I read this incredible novel. Golden's prose and appreciation of social nuances as life changing events are repeatedly compared to the style of Jane Austen. I can only agree. The one thing I find so difficult to believe is that Golden is not a woman! Sayuri's story is eloquent and moving....yet it also takes pleasure in revealing the small things, the rules and mannerisms, of a style of life that has almost disappeared. I found myself rooting for Sayuri's success as a Geisha and was extremely sorry to come to the last page. I look forward to Golden's next attempt with pleasure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was so engrossed in the life of Sayuri that I lost track of time and missed an appointment. Oh well! It is a book that once you start it you will not be able to put it down until you finish that final page."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I never thought I would be very interested in the life of a geisha. I was soon entranced and delighted by this wonderful, engrossing novel. The fact that it is written by a man in the first person of a woman is just a hoot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The characters were wonderfully drawn. Golden had excellent insights into his female characters. His male perspective was apparent only a few times. He educates us about the gheshia culture while providing interesting characters and a good story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have lived in Japan for seven years and visited Kyoto and the Gion district and Golden brought to life the Geisha district. You really are able to picture all the characters and Tea Houses that he talks about in the book. It was a book that I didn't want to end and like some of the other reviews, I had trouble believing that what I was reading was fiction. If you live here it is a MUST read. If you are interested in Japan or Geisha then it is well worth the cost. Buy it you will love it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I truly could not put this book down. It kept me up later than I care to admit. The story of Sayuri's life was so fascinating that I forgot it was fiction and actually told someone that it was a biography. Japanese culture has often seemed mysterious and fascinating, Arthur Golden's book has just re-enforced it. Sorry I'm finished reading it, thrilled it will be made in to a movie!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was greatly moved by how well the author put into words how I feel about people I love who have gone on or are not near me anymore. I love growing older. I feel so much fuller. I also was touched to the core by his description of how Sayuri felt when the chairman finally proffesed his true affection for her. I enjoyed the analogy of the incident of the little boy hanging on for dear life to a tree limb,terrified and about to fall and finally losing his grip, to find that unbeknownst to him, his father had come and calmly stepped underneath him to catch him, just in time. In the mount of the Lord ,it shall be provided. God may it be true for all of us."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Did not want book to end. Loved the story and the history of geishas, but then I love historical fiction.Golden put a lot of love into his writing of Geisha. His passion for the Japenese culture was evident throughout the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What strikes me about this novel is the vast amount of information it contains. Western readers often have difficulty unterstanding the intricacies of Japanese culture, and Golden has wonderfully revealed the beauty, and reality, of a Geisha's life in an interesting and lyrical story. It's a must-read for anyone ready for a different type of fairy tale."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fiction does not appeal to me as much as non-fiction; but Memoirs of a Geisha manages to evoke non-fiction while weaving a novel about women, women and men, managing one's destiny and loyalty to one's pure spirit and intuition. The positioning of Sayuri's coming of age as a Geisha by Mameha is as cunning and imaginative as any corporate marketing strategic plan! How many of us have had Hatsumomo's in our lives? Aren't Mother, Auntie, and Pumpkin archetypes we could recognize in our boss, mother-in-law, or cousin and colleague? I learned a new way to be and think about the relationship between the geisha and her &quot;danna&quot;. In Western culture, the feminist movement has obliterated the more powerful feminism evoked by the Geisha when she thinks of managing the way &quot;he&quot; feels at all times. The irony of this realization is profound and liberating! The man who quit his job so that he would be free to be hired, and the Chairman's devotion to Nobu's contribution are occurrences which form the foundation of Japan's culture and its patience. This is the best work of fiction I have read in years. You will grow and learn as a result of reading it. I highly recommend it--just make sure you have enough time to read it because you might not want to be interrupted."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As you read, more and more, this book sucks you in. You become Sayuri, smiling during times of joy and feeling pain during adversity. It's astonishing that this is the author's first novel- i can't wait until the next one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My mother is from Kyoto and always told me stories about geishas. She told me how they walk, what classes they take, what they do...This book brought back lots of memories. I recommend this book because most of the situations that are told in the novel is true. I like this book because for one thing, the author clearly did his homework and did it well. Secondly, it doesn't have all these silly sex parts in it like those romance books that are without depth. I recomend this book because I can visualize everything that is written clearly...Just as if my mother was telling me about geishas again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A book like this only comes around once in a life time. Sayuri's story is something I now find myself thinking about all the time. This book made me laugh and cry, and it's made me think. I am now reading it for the third time. It is the type of book you do not get tired of reading. It sucks you into her story and when you are done, leaves you craving more. A book like this is to be celebrated. Mr. Golden has captured Sayuri's soul and made you beleave that she is dancing around you, watching as you read his book. Mr Golden is a true master, and I wish him much success in his next book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"For a first time novel, &quot;Geisha&quot; is fantastic. Golden's attention to detail and research of the subject really shows through. I really found it hard to put down once I started. I've read all of Clavell and Laura Joh Rowland's &quot;Shinju&quot; and this one is my favorite &quot;Japan tale&quot;. The only negative to the book is the ending. It's a bit too contrived as Golden seemed to be at a loss for how to end the story. If Golden's second novel (if there will be one) is as good as his first, I'm hooked."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At first I loved &quot;Memoirs&quot;. I could not put it down and found myself sneaking time to finish it in at all hours of the day. I found the view of Japanese geisha culture fascinating. The more I read, however, the more I felt that if the setting were less exotic that it would read like a formula Harelequin romance. The characters were either good or bad: the antagonist was all evil, and the heroine had all positive qualities, yet faced hardship and roadblocks to her eventual success. I prefer a book where the reader has to struggle a bit more, since in real life, most people aren't either all good or all bad. A great summer read nonetheless."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I picked up this book at the library, just because it sounded interesting. Now having read it I have to buy it. I felt drawn to Sayuri. Her life became my own for the time that I was reading. The only complaint is that I didn't get to see enough of Pumpkin. Hope the author has more great books under his sleeve."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are only a few books that hold you from page one; this is one of those books. I found that when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Mr. Golden has written a story that is so sensitive and insightful I felt I was reading a story written by a woman. Rich descriptions of the world around the main character are very nicely written. If you liked the English Patient you'll like Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS ASPECT OF ASIAN CULTURE AND PRE-WW2 LIFE IN JAPAN. WRITTEN BY A MAN WITH A REMARKABLY FEMININE SENSIBILITY."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden...all I want to know is...when is the next book coming out? Memoirs fully captivated me and did what any fine novel is supposed to do - take you away completely to another land, another time. I had stopped hoping years ago that any novel could possibly sweep me away as Shogun once did...this one did, and then some. It contains the cultural depth/magic AND a personal element that I've always craved in a novel. Couldn't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to say, I agree with other reviewers who couldn't put this book down. I was under pressure to make Xmas cookies and wrap gifts, but instead I spent an entire weekend immersed in Japanese culture. I thought the idea of a fictional &quot;Memoir&quot; was terrific - and I actually thought the Translator's Notes added to the whole. Many great authors of the past have done such things in an attempt to draw the reader deeper into a chosen world(for example, the foreword to Lolita, where Nabokov says the book could not have been written were the protagonists still alive). Clearly, this is a work of fiction - I mean, where did you find it on the shelf? So get over your idea that this somehow belittles &quot;real&quot; memoirs and enjoy the artifice, just another detail in a richly layered narrative. I think Golden's voice is terrific, literary, compelling and very feminine. As others have said, the ending is a bit of a letdown. But, with a ride like this - who cares if the end is bumpy? Enjoy it for what it is, an evocative description of a place and time we will never get to enjoy first-hand. Thanks Mr. Golden!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found the cleverness of this book, framed as a memoir of a real geisha including translator's note, almost outdid the content of the story. An enjoyable read as insight into a different culture, but a less descriptive book lacking the emotion of such writers as Amy Tam and Arundhati Roy. Certain chapters contain interesting moments, but overall there is a lack of connection with the characters."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book brings the story to life in a way that was unexpected.

I think the mark of a really good story is that the main character is somehow fundamentally changed by the end of the book. As a little girl, Sayuri dreams of being adopted by a rich, older man. As an adolescent, she dreams of becoming the mistress of a rich, older man. As an adult, she achieves her goal. Where is the story in that? World War II, which should have been a turning point in the story, appears to have absolutely no emotional effect on Sayuri. She clings to her small-minded dream and is rewarded with a fairy tale ending. Bleh."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's Memoir of a Geisha is a tour de force of narrative voice, cultural detail, and style. The author's painstaking research shows itself only in the believability of his story and never slows the pace of this novel which, at its basest level, could be called a historical romance. But there is so much more contained within these pages than a genre novel. Readers will find a richly described life with layers of history, emotion, and a coming-of-age story that lasts a lifetime. Although the final chapter seems tacked and the extra details revealed there are coyly supplied despite the previous forthrightness of Satuyi, Golden can be forgiven these last pages after having delivered his treasure wrapped in silk."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is, at least, mind stultifying to read an amazon.com review whose writer finds it necessary to explain that &quot;geisha&quot; does not mean &quot;prostitute.&quot; While the CBS smotherage of the Winter Olympics was wall-to-wall cultural arrogance and ignorance, surely America outside of the air-heads of the electronic media is more aware than you amazonians think!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book without too much previous knowledge of the book or author.

The story is incredibly interesting and I'm very glad that I read it. The only problem now is -- I can't begin another book again until I stop thinking about Sayuri, Mameha and their lives.

I found myself thinking about all the charactes at work, during lunch, dinner, and at the gym. Golden's writing is filled with exquisite metaphors and descriptions that transported me to Gion and into the lives of these wonderful and talented women. I WANT TO BE A GEISHA :-)!!!!I have recommended this book to everyone that I know and I will definately read it again. I was so sad to see it end. Matter of fact I hid the book from myself with only 20 pages remaining in hopes to make this pleasurable experience last that much longer. I was deeply touched by Sayuri's relationships with Mameha, Nobu, and her beloved Chairman. A MUST READ!!!! You will not be dissapointed! Cheers to Golden-san!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had serious misgivings when I got to know about this book early this year, thinking that life as a Geisha can't really be that interesting, can it?? Boy, was I wrong.... So, there I was in a local bookstore, paying my good money for a glimpse of this book. It was dreamlike from the first page and it really took my breath away. I haven't come across such an interesting book for quite a while....I can't put it down. Luv it and I'm recommending it to everybody out there."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was great. My kids accused me of zoning out and asked if it really was that good. but I really loved all the feelings and descriptions. I really felt like I was there."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes, to some extent (I liked Angela's Ashes better.) In Memoirs of a Geisha, the reader becomes intrigued with the way Japanese society accepts and uses Geishas to promote culture, artistry, social parties, etc. Although there is very little sex in this book (and what there is is not pleasurable), the training of the geisha-to-be and the life of the Japanese servant girl is tough. I was shocked at the way the young girl in this story was abducted from her home and sold. I never understood why she was sold, but made peace with that as the young girl gradually accepted her fate. The girls struggles through her later childhood and early teen years is remarkable and can only speak for an era gone by. This situation would probably not happen in the 20th century &quot;civilized&quot; world, but at the same time, the art and beauty of the early Japanese Geisha has faded so that the Geisha's of today are mere imitations. Mr Golden has a beautiful writing style - - very lyrical for a man and the eloquent thoughts of the girl were wonderful and made the reading all the more enjoyable. This is a very good book - astounding in thought and concept."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading newspaper reviews on this book all giving it high praise, I decided to give it a shot.I had a hard time putting it down, it was enthralling.It has been awhile since I read a book that has so taken me out of my day to day life, and to one so much different. It was so well developed and described I could see what Japan and it's people looked like as the character lived it. This book excels in details from the application of the Geisha's makeup, the wrapping of the obi, to the involved hierarchy of the Japanese culture at that time. These are not senseless details but brought out in a way that one things about things that catch your eye. It was so subtly done it was like you were in the character's mind, while they were thinking. I found the relationships between the characters well developed. They grew with each subsequent line as well. When I finished the book I was a bit lost, as it had so captured my imagination.It has opened my mind up to a small portion of Japanese culture that I had no ideas about.Besides just being a story about a specific type of person (a Geisha) this is a very involved story about how she became a Geisha, the people she knew and the formative points in her life. On just this alone the book would be captivating. Adding in the fact that so few Westerners have any idea what the Geisha culture was at that time, was a major plus.I really enjoyed the book and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a fiction in the format of an as-told-to autobiography about a little girl removed from her impoverished household and put in the service of a Kyoto teahouse. It is absolutely compelling reading because we can identify with the main character's struggle for recognition as she combats poverty, obscurity and jealousy among her rivals to become a popular and respected geisha.At the same time, we become aware of how very different the Japanese cultural context is, and just how the geishas filled out their role in that context. The book is set during the last flowering of the traditional geishas, the prewar 1930s and 1940s, when geishas were paid entertainers, not just party girls and certainly not prostitutes as is often thought.Memoirs of a Geisha makes compelling reading with human emotions that get the reader hooked and exotic period detail that fascinate all the while. Reading it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is an excellent story and very hard to put down. A fast read because it is not very challenging. Although I enjoyed the book very much, I was disappointed by the ending."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An interesting story on an arcane subject. However, accuracy is frequently sacrificed for the sake of literary license. 'Geisha', a documentary by Liza Dalby, is a much better book and should be read before 'Memoirs'.After reading both books, I find the geisha subculture totally demeaning. Despite their genteel facades, these feudal throwbacks are nothing but professional party girls who tease married drunks for a living. There's nothing glamorous about the monotonous charades they play."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have seen this book for a long time with its conspicuous cover (the geisha with pale blue-gray eyes), but I didn't buy it until a few weeks ago. One reason was that I felt AMerican novels (in English) generally project a narrow perspective on ethnical stories. Whenever you heard of Japan, it is always the kimono or the anime that everyone is familar with. But it is not only it... That's why most of the times novels dealing with ethnic related topics are often shallow or sentimental in a small area that loses the main focus (or often from a limited view)However, this book is great in dealing with every aspect of the traditional life of a geisha. It seems to me like a translation text of a original Japanese novel. ALthough there are still slight descriptions that show the author is not completely immersed in conventional Japanese culture, such as the way he described things that Saturi saw... which is apt to American sense of analogies instead of oriental.For those who consider this book as a porn book that reveals the disgusting scenes between the characters--Sorry, it is very true for a male-dominant traditional society in Japan, especially during that time. So the author is merely conveying this part of history in front of the readers.As I should say, this book is pretty exquisite in various aspects. It is colorful in literary technqiues and also faithful to the history. SOme of the true qualitites hidden behind the words cannot be fully comprehended under American values."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Though I knew going into the book that it was not a true story (as far as this character's life) - it was still hard to believe it wasn't true. I was amazed at Golden's skills for writing such a detailed, complete, interesting (! ) book. You felt as if you knew the character, as if she was your good friend pouring her heart out to you at many times during the book. The characters were very evolved, which so often doesn't happen. This made the book even more a pleasure to read begining to end in as little time possible. (I couldn't put it down!)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book is well written: the style and tone transport the reader into the world of Sayuri. It is indeed a page turner. It took me less than 2 days to finished the book as I was so entrenched and mesmerised with the characters and storyline. Golden's decription of the Japanese culture is interesting and true in many sense. His style of language and tone were in line with the culture and era of the time. Every word in the book makes you feel as if Sayuri is beckoning at you and telling you the story face-to-face in the same type of manner you would expect from a Japanese woman of the time. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I needed a good book to read over the holidays and to recommend to two girlfriends. I saw the reader reviews of this book and decided that with such rave reviews and 4 to 5 stars from so many, the book must be good. I was not disappointed. From the time I began to read I couldn't put the book down. I was up to 1:30 am on three nights until I completed it because I was so captivated by the story. I thought it was mature, insightful, and beautifully written. I too, was sorry for the book to end. I wish I could find more books that offered the pleasant experience this one did. Being enthralled by a book of this quality is what reading is all about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm a sophmore in high school and lately haven't been motivated enough to even think about reading a book. Yet when I was in the bookstore I saw this book and when I read the backpage preview I was really intrigued. Well I just finished the book and I can tell you that I was so engrossed in this book that at times I could read for at least three hours, non-stop. This book was so good because it was unlike most fictional books which read like a made-up story, this book reads like an actual, real-life story. I found myself cheering for the different characters. There were different aspects to the characters that drew you in and made you understand them and their emotions, perhaps because you could relate to them in some way. I finished the book within days, and I have already recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs or a Geisha is a great read and an intriging story of the life of a Geisha. Inside the story you learn the customs, politics and training of the Geisha from the eyes of a little girl sold by her father along with her sister. We witness their lonliness, humiliation and attempts to triumph over adversity."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the very beginning of this haunting and unforgettable story, you are drawn into a different time the world existed. Some complain of the language being difficult to comprehend, hard to read, etc., but that's part of the beauty of it. Even so, none of us is the perfect reader or writer, but each of us can enjoy a book that takes us to another level. How many books have we read recently where all of our senses are focused on what we are reading? Where we are at once a part of someone else's story. If you enjoyed this book, you'll know what I mean. I couldn't put the book down and read into the early morning hours. I wanted to know what happened to the rival geishas, I wanted to know if the characters were as fixated as I was on their own jealousies, tragedies, pity and weaknesses. I loved this book"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sad, lonely life of geisha. Beautifully described ..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story makes you realize the fact that time does pass, and with it the fantasies we've carried with us all along.

Arthur Golden has a great style! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden wasn't afraid to use all the raw elements in life in his writing, which made this novel what it is. His clear division of sex and love stuck me as flawless, and drew me closer to his characters.I felt he could have forshadowed or built up the ending a bit more, or at least given it a sad turn.Other than that, It was an excellent read and I'd read it again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have never read anything quite like this book. I found it very interesting. The main character Sayuri seemed to be talking directly to me. After finishing the book I wanted to know more about a Geisha's life. One thing I found insteresting was that all the men of wealth seemed to be very unappealing and the poor men were alway very passionate and sexual, I wonder why?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm so glad to see that I am not the only person in the world who didn't like this book. The descriptions of the geisha life were interesting (assuming they are true - after all, this IS a work of fiction), but the characters generally were one-dimensional (either good or bad), the dialogue unbelievable, and the plot was like a badly-written soap opera. I plowed through it, but it really was not a very good book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book to be one of those things that you come across once in a great while that just makes you take a deep breath and sigh with the satisfaction that you are somehow different after reading it. I think those of you who say the book is flat and unemotional are not reading it with keeping the context it's written in in mind. This is the Japanese culture, where 'saving face' is everything, and showing emotion is considered weak. So although you may not always learn the true feelings of Sayuri, you are not supposed to be reading this story as YOU would have told it. That's important to keep in mind. The story is true to not only the anthropoligical facts, but also the Japanese culture. It is wonderfully written and an enchanting tale. I completely recomend it to anyone who wants to learn a little about the Geisha's world as well as their own."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Ever since I heard about this book, I've been wanting to read it but I never read for fun. But one day my mom, who reads A LOT, bought it so I said I wanted to read it and I started! It was so good, I couldn't put it down. It definately portrays geisha life so much differently than what I thought it was. It's a really good but and even if reading's not your thing, cuz it definately wasn't mine, I think you should read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"this book was suggested to me by a friend who hates to read. I wasn't much of a reader myself, but i am now. Memoirs of a Geisha was the story of a young japanese girl whose life style was changed competely. Sayuri was a poor japanese girl who knew nothing but her own town and her own &quot;tipsy house.&quot; she was introdued to a world of knowledge and seduction and money. Her trials troughout life could only be survived by some one extremely strong. She survived the torture of hatsumomo, the loss of her entire family, and the depression of war. Her end was peaceful and happy, and the tortures of life turned her into one of the most successful geisha in all of Japan. Arthur Golden wrote a marvelous novel and an intriguing story. My family aked over and over, are you done with that book yet? I'd like to read it now? the only thing i didn't enjoy about the book was that it ended and i had to start a new one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could not put this book down. The character development was unique and right-on-the-money. I kept reminding myself that a male had wrote this book, yet it was so feminine written. The feelings of a geisha and the life lived was fascinating. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is a fascinating account of a real geisha &quot;working&quot; in Kyoto in the 1930's. The story is very moving and very real. Sometimes I felt if I were actually there feeling and experiencing everything along with the characters."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a geisha is a fascinating, well researched glimpse into the world of the geisha. Utterly absorbing and quite believable,the account of Sayuri is riveting, until after the denouement of the novel, (her mizuage(sic) and attainment of her lover), at which point the story is less interesting. This is due to the fact that Golden has failed to imbue her lover with life. He remains a one-dimensional character. The repressed passion which has been a strong charcteristic of Sayuri's life to this point is not understandable because of the weakness of this portrayal."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book in three days using all the spare time I had! Chiyo/Sayuri's memoirs are a wonderful insight into the hidden world of Gion's geisha community as well as her innermost thoughts and aspirations in the dog-eat-dog world she inhabits. I am recommending this book to many of my friends, which is not something I usually do, because it left such an impression. Mr. Golden's creation of his heroine was very well drawn; and my only criticism is that some of the other characters (the Chairman and Hatsumomo) weren't given the same treatment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book, transporting me back in time and to a totally different culture than ours. Unlike the reader from Nashville who disliked the metaphors, I really liked them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At first it was difficult to catch on at the begining of the book. It was only after a few more chapters that the actual story really began. I must admit there were a few boring bits, but all in all the book is intresting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read the entire novel in one sitting because I *had* to find out what happened at the end. I was disappointed. My enthusiasm slowed to a complete halt as the book started to resemble a soap opera (dashes of history sprinkled as necessary). The ending was altogether too &quot;convenient&quot; for my liking. If Golden had AVOIDED the neatly packaged ending, the story would have been more convincing and memorable. Loose threads leave you something to floss your teeth with."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal up until the ending which I found was hugely disappointing -- it was reading like a Japanese &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; where I thought she'd end up happily after all with the Rhett figure as her danna. Instead, out of nowhere comes Ashley Wilkes...not satisfying at all and almost hurried as if the editor had told Golden to end the book.Nonetheless, I enjoyed it all until the end and would like to learn more (on a non-fictional basis) about geishas."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I was 21 I went to the theatre in Kyoto and watched the Geisha dance. I remember a beautiful geisha sitting in the lobby and when she looked briefly at me I stopped and stared. Reading Memoirs of a Geisha was like sitting across a tearoom from the beautiful Sayuri and like all the others wanting something you can never have. I will save this book to relive it again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is especially fun to read not only because it's a such a compelling story, but also because it's fascinating to hear about the details of the geisha's life-style. You feel the drama of the beauty of the kimono, the giesha make-up, the training on how to entertain and satisty a client, the stark financial dealings of the owner of the geisha house, and the friendships and rivalries of the girls themselves. All this is played out against the backdrop of tradional Japanese culture and the effects of World War 2. One of the best books I've read in years."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is hard to believe that Memoirs of a Geisha is a work of fiction and not an actual autobiography. I found the book to be riviting. I would set out intending to limit my reading time to one or two chapters and suddenly find time flew by. I kept wanting to turn the pages to see what happens next and couldn't put the book down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The three elements of the novel, which impressed me the most, are the detailed descriptions of objects, deep understanding of the culture, and the delicate psychological interpretation of women.The words which the author used to describe the objects such as Kimono and paintings were not huge as SAT vocabularies, but were enough to deliver the message with impact.\\"...an orange silk with a silver waterfall pouring from the knee into a slate blue ocean. The waterfall was split by brown cliffs, with knotted driftwood at the base embroidered in lacquered threads.\\"This quote was one of my favorite descriptions of a Kimono; it gave me a very clear mental image.It was certain that the author of the book is more than an amateur about the Japanese Culture. The way he described the dressing of Kimono and the polite traditional Japanese way of dialogues impressed me. He also seemed to know the etiquettes and the manners as a Geisha, such as how to open the door when they are entering the Tea houses.I was very surprised to find out that Arthur Golden is actually an extremely normal man because of the feminine details he used in the novel. Especially in the part where Sayuri was about give up her \\"mizuage,\\" because of the way he described her emotion of fear and hidden curiosity, I felt as if I was at the room with her. Also Arthur seemed to understand the psychology of woman as a secret admirer as well. The description about the Sayuri's feeling toward Chairman was very understandable and imaginable.Overall, the novel was very satisfying and I am very certain that this was one of my favorite novels I ever read. However, I found the characteristics of some characters such as Hatsumomo and the Chairman in the novel are not fully developed. As one of the reviewers mentioned before (Shannon \\"elfaas\\") the reason for Hatsumomo's unconditional jealousy and the reason why the Chairman was so obsessed with Sayuri would remain as questions."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I recently read this story before I headed off to Kyoto for a conference, hoping for something to appreciate besides the temples, subway system and sushi. This book gives one a sense of what the neighborhood of Gion must have been like during the pre-WWII industrialization period, and what it meant to Japan in those years. I suppose there's some message about Japanese gender roles in general in this book, but I found the real question to concern the value of entertainment. Why is it so necessary to have women specializing in this form of entertainment, especially when it often devolves into silly drinking games? Is it really a sad thing, as some travel writers suggest, that these days there are very few geisha around? Is &quot;culture&quot; really worth donating girls at an early age to some sort of museum-existence?Nowadays one can spot glimpses of geisha in Gion hurrying to their appointments in the early evening (with some luck). I imagine that sometime soon even this will become a rare novelty for visiting gai-jin."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story has hills and valleys and so many emotional things happened throughout that I wasn't expecting. This is a great book club book because I wished I had someone to talk about it with when I finished!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a young reader and I am somewhat picky about which books I can read. &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; was the most incredible story I have ever received from a novel, and I have claimed it to be my favorite book ever since I read it last Spring. Never before have I been transported so completely into not only a setting, but the thoughts and feelings of a girl. I cannot really describe how completely Arthur Golden emersed me into his beautiful story. It is realistic in the fact that life is full of shocking twists and turns. After reading this book, I have not been able to read a novel completely through... Other novels just don't measure up! This was so great for me beacuse I love culture, history, life stories, and excitement."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is vibrantly and honestly written you find yourself feeling the textures, smelling the aromas and being lost in another world and time. The story of a girls journey to first a geisha and then to a woman is written in a form that is universal.The most amazing thing was that a man was able to write the in such detail the emotions and anxieties of a complicated woman with such accuracy. I could read this book time and time again and still find myself wistful for more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In my opinion, overanalyzing fiction is a complete waste of time - mine and yours. Put shortly, I read the story, and thought it was excellent. I left it on my shelf for a while, and forgot all about it.

Every page was well worth the time invested."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't generally read novels (except more historical), but I found that I liked this one more and more as I read on. The story captivated me. I developed an admiration for the author's ability to devise the convolutions in the various subplots. I also tend to believe that no matter how clever a person may be, 99% of what happens in one's life is out of our control, even when we have the illusion of having made a choice freely. As to the historical authenticity, I take it on faith that the author did a great deal of research. And I admit that I am a sucker for happy endings.Only one part of the story stood out in my mind as a faulty contrivance and awoke me from my reverie as I was reading. That was how Hatsumomo came to her end. Only then did I become aware of the author racking his brain as to how to accomplish this. Nevertheless, despite this one flaw, I felt the book was a beautiful work of art and Sayuri and Mameha both possessed the characters of what I would like to think the great geishas had.I read this book because my wife told me she thought I would enjoy it. I cannot begin to imagine the amount of time, thought and energy the author put into crafting this truly beautiful work. Can anyone ever write a second novel of such excellence? I would imagine not. If I were to write something which were of one-one-hundredth the intricacy of this novel, I would be totally spent for the rest of my life. However, the bottom line is that it was a real pleasure being absorbed in this fantasy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I was a little girl I lived for the &quot;stories&quot; told by my great-grandmother, grandmother, and great aunts. It was always such a treat and a virtual history lesson to hear of their experiences as youngsters.This book parallels those stories for me because it is of a bygone era told from a woman who has since aged. What a wonderful tale and what great lessons we can learn from our elders.Chiyo, or Sayuri as we later come to know her, tells the story of her life from childhood on the seacoast of Japan where she grew-up, through the time when she was sold by her father into what would now be considered slavery, and then into adolescence, adulthood and beyond. This is a story that envelops you in a way that makes you feel as if you are there, and more, that you want to be there.This story is about the story. Not the beginning, not the middle, nor the end. The whole story.I developed a deep interest in Asian culture after reading this novel as I am sure many other people have. This was an eye-opening literary experience for me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't know what I liked more...the characters or the history of the &quot;Geisha's&quot;. You really feel for these women, and the struggle they go through to become what the Japanese men deem to be desirable. I love the relationships between the women, with all the jealousies included. I even admit to some culture shock not growing up in a country with such ingrained customs. I felt bad for the little girl dragged into the life of a Geisha, but I rejoiced in the woman she became. Readable, and very enjoyable. I reccomend this book highly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden writes Memoirs of a Geisha after spending ten years studying the geisha culture in Japan. His knowledge of their lifestyle shines through in this captivating story of a young girl taken away from her home and forced to grow up.Memoirs of a Geisha can best be described as a &quot;Cinderella story with a splash of Japanese flavor.&quot; Golden has done a beautiful job in writing a tale about a Japanese girl's experiences before, during, and after she becomes a geisha. The novel deals with issues such as submissiveness, separation, suffering, and deception, but in the grand tradition of fairytales, the good guys win and the story ends happily.While Golden has successfully created an exciting story that is hard to put down, he also allows readers to become a part of the Japanese culture, clearing up any misconceptions they may have about geisha life. In addition, he manages to do this while successfully making us feel as if we are reading the true memoirs of a real geisha, and not the results of studies by an American man.Golden's use of metaphor throughout the book adds to the excitement and mystery of the young Geisha's life. Some major metaphors are played with throughout the extent of the novel adding flavor to the storyline. For example, the metaphor or water is mentioned several times, and is described as something that &quot;changes shape and flows around things,&quot;&quot;is the most versatile of the five elements&quot;, and that &quot;even wood, which is its natural compliment, can survive without being nurtured by water.&quot;(125) All of these statements are meant to symbolize the main character of Sayuri, who is said to have &quot;water in her personality.&quot; Smaller metaphors provide windows into the geisha's mind such as the &quot;tipsy-house,&quot; which symbolizes the &quot;lopsided life&quot; Sayuri has led.Arthur Golden's storytelling is so convincing that one would swear it to be true. His novel draws you in by the time you turn the front page. You will fall in love with some of the characters and absolutely despise the others. Both men and women will find Memoirs of a Geisha a novel that is hard to place back on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved most of this book. But I found deeply disturbing the one dimensional characters of the &quot;good&quot; people and the &quot;bad&quot; people. I would have liked to have seen Golden develop his characters more. It was a great book to learn about geishas, but if you know anything at all, the lack of character development is sorely missed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After giving up on finding a worthwhile book to read from being to end, I became completely enthralled with Mr. Golden's ability to capture my attention. The book put me in Japan as a geisha and I felt as if I had experienced all of her encounters. I could not put down the book ! This is one book that must be read by all !"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am usually a fan of science fiction and fantasy fiction, but this book took me by surprise! I'm fascinated by Asian history so it seemed interesting at first glance. The entire time I was reading the book I was captivated...What a compelling tale of such an interesting life...until the end when I relized it was fiction! It crushed me! I'm in love with this book. It is a satisfing read...if not slightly predictable in the end...but lots of fun!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"cont... The book is good, easy reading and very informative. It's fiction. And now: why not five stars?... I have to agree with those that said that the end of the book was a simply 'happy end', but this does not make it a bad book. The book has a soft tone of romance novel, but I think it was the intention of the writter to place it like this in order to be able to recreate geishas lifestyles, otherwise it would be only a bunch of facts of what geishas do: I think it was well placed despite of the end.To those who did not got it: geishas are not synonimous of western prostitutes, they act as artists. As one reviewer well said: the sex part 'is in there' but is not everything. Geishas are much more than high class prostitutes.The book was not written with the intention of give us a whole japanese culture lesson, it was written to give us a general -and deep idea at the same time- about geishas and what they are, it was written with the intention of give us a pleasant reading: and he definitly made it! .Come on! this is not a bad or ugly or bore book as some has said: this is a VERY GOOD book. It's sensitive, it's well written... it's a great book. And I don't say it beacuse it's a bestseller - I personally don't like every bestseller- but this one DID deserve to be one.To the one who said that Gordon is not Flaubert he certainly isn't, but he is a very good writter and much more considering it's his first book. Only the time will say if this book it's to become a real classic -and besides that I particularly vote for it- it's not gonna be you or me who are going to decide that, or have the last word. What is real classic?... this is certainly not the very best book I have ever read in my life but IS GOOD. Is not Madame Bovary, but it can become a classic.I am definitly encouraging Gordon to write his second book. I will look forward for it, and DON'T let you down for those silly comments of simply people."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"sometimes I think if enough people rave about a certain thing, others are hesitant to express a different opinion, lest they are seen as &quot;wrong&quot; or, worse, having not &quot;gotten it&quot;-- that is, the point of the book. Well, I'm sorry, but after hearing so many people proclaiming this novel as the best ever, I didn't expect to disagree. But, I do. This novel was okay. Period. The characters seemed shallow, the plot was... well, to be honest, I can't think of one. It was slightly on the boring side as well. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money on it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My Book Club chose Memoirs of a Geisha to read this month, so I was looking forward to the read, and was majorly disappointed. The little cat fighting and tricks the in-training geisha did to each other were so trite and sophomoric. It seemed like a man's idea of what women do to each other, and I found it insulting--not to mention shallow, flat and poorly written. I was hoping for a rich, many layered history and story of what, I am sure, is a respected and artistic endeavor unique to the Japanese culture. Instead, I read about silly squabbles a la Joan Collins and Linda Evans on Dallas! Too bad."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The world of the geisha-- children are sold into geisha bondage and forced into labour in a vain attempt to pay off their debts (including the cost of buying them, feeding & clothing them etc. at inflated prices). A few chapters about geisha make-up secrets (or how to get skin lead poisoning) and kimonos (they cost a mint, you need a special dresser to get into one, and they weigh a ton). The desperate business of making money and finding a rich patron to get out of bondage is couched in the silliest romance. Can a geisha really not know what sex is when her deflowering is up for bids, after witnessing sex couplings a few feet from her tatami sleep mat? Even respectable Japanese housewives use \\"pillow books\\" illustrating sex positions! This is just titillation for the American market. Can we really believe a geisha will give up her son's chance to inherit the business of his father who is her rich patron and who has no other male heirs? The end is a cop-out."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had my doubts and reservations, but Arthur Golden has made me a believer. His writing is beautifully crafted and truly felt genuine. He has treated the subject matter with class and came out remarkably interesting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Unlike a lot of other reviews, I found the book facinating. Yes, it focused on these women and their interactions with men, that being all they thought about, were occupied with. That's the POINT, they are geishas, men WERE their lives! I liked the author's writing style, I prefer to read first person, and I thought Golden's words were very readable. The ending was a little disappointing, but true to life, things don't always work out perfectly."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderful story. I was totally drawn into the world of Sayuri. The ending is not quite up to par with the rest of the novel, but I still give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sorry, but I couldn't finish the book. By the time I realized I was over half way through and I still wasn't hooked to the story line, I bailed out. There was one too many &quot;Oh, but the Chairman&quot;, &quot;Look what pretty eyes she has&quot;, and &quot;It was years later I learned&quot;. I really expected more of a cultural insight vs cat-fighting perspective. I had hoped for more insights to the &quot;artisan&quot; aspect of geisha life, vs the bidding war for the mizuage.....I must say on the positive side that there are many clever descriptive passages (but even these wore thin as the pages dragged on). (Ref below reviews: Can't believe it was written by a man either...)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A caveat to linguaphiles and general fans of meaningful prose: don't read it. Perhaps Mr. Golden should have spent more time learning how to write engaging text rather than trying to dredge up verisimilitude via errata. Tedious and time-consuming, this book makes Hemingway's work seem verbose. I'm sure the movie will be a runaway best-seller as well; I only hope that Mr. Spielberg takes the cardboard characters and animates them somehow. A final note to those who prefer Pynchon to Grisham: if you read it, don't say that you weren't warned!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Poor little Japanese girl is dragged off to be a geisha and she is so nice and is so mistreated but not to worry -- she meets some johns who are nice to her -- and she triumphs in the end. A university student goes abroad and picks up enough Japanese cultural tidbits to transport Dickens' tale of Oliver Twist to Japan. Why anyone thinks this male fantasy of geisha life has any resemblance to reality is beyond me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"why are people so impressed by the fact that golden can write in geisha drag but nobody ever says anything about, say, kazuo ishiguro's wonderful novels in the first person about upper-class, caucasian brits? read &quot;remains of the day&quot; -- it starts somehwat slow but picks up amazingly. &quot;remains of the day&quot; brought me to tears on the bus and i make it a point never to show any emotion in the public transit system. okay, golden writes well, and he obviously knows what he's writing about. that much i give him. and as a feminist, i think that his book (indirectly) critiques the oppressiveness of the geisha culture (and i suppose the larger culture, as well) at that point in time. however, sayuri still remains a flat character to me -- events register to her as though she were perpetually a child, and a stupid one at that. fashion gets more of a reaction out of her than tragedy. it's not because golden is a man -- there are quite a few male authors out there who write effectively in women's voices -- but because he's become so bogged down in the details, the mechanics of the daily life of the geisha that he forgets about making his characters human instead of cardboard cut-outs -- this is just like star wars: the phantom menace! i mean, come on! the hooker with the heart of gold, the greedy, conniving pimp, the prince charming (albeit a geriatric one), the evil witch. string that together, slap on some obscure cultural references and bingo! you've got a book ready for hollywood exploitation!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The writing and imagery were undisputably well-polished, but in every other aspect of good writing, this novel failed miserably. The characters are two-dimentional and predictable--even the main character never comes to any realization about the degrading position she has been put in all these year. Her self-retribution lies solely in a man's love, not something a feminist or any logical person would argue, I'm sure. I get sick just thinking about the way the main character throws herself at this man she reveres almost as a god. In addition, the author writes in a style that he believes to be &quot;eastern.&quot; I've never heard worse &quot;eartern&quot; writing in my life. Overall, this book was a very UNpleasent read, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As far as I can discern with my admittedly very limited knowledge of the subject, Mr. Golden did an admirable job of describing what it takes to be a geisha of the 1930's-1940's era. It is intriguing to read about the geisha lifestyle.However, the plot is REALLY contrived and difficult to believe.Perhaps this story-line perspective is what is required to make such a book a &quot;best seller,&quot; but it took a lot of the pleasure of reading away for me.One would think that a poor girl from rural Japan, particularly in a time period prior to ours, would appreciate the lifestyle of the geisha and all of the fringe benefits, but this is not the case. The heroine, Sayuri, does not appreciate her options, but chooses to disregard them so that she can have the possibility of being united with her &quot;true love,&quot; The Chairman.I agree with previous reviews that this book gives an &quot;Americanized&quot; view to the geisha life. It is difficult for most of us to understand what it is like to be truly poor but we should be able to read about the time period and the way women were treated then and extrapolate from there.Come on!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The NY Times got it right- if this was a non-fiction book it would have been a lot better. It already reads like someone's PHD turned into fiction at the last minute- with a few dramatic turns of plot and emotional motivating forces taken straight out of a Marvel comic and transposed onto the life of the otherwise believable girl at its centre. The ending was beyond disappointing- it read as if Mr. Golden was trying to imagine what the movie people would make of his book and tailored accordingly- 'happy' things happen at the end, but they seem tacked on instead of seeming natural consequences of what came before. It was a delightful book at the start because no one knows about Geisha and one starts out by judging its subject. It was terrible by the end because it was emotionally unsatisfying and hollow- one ends up judging the author. I would be very surprised if Mr. Golden writes another book people will actually read- this one is gimmick-based and so, one suspects, is his career."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Okay, so after 2,400 reviews there's nothing that I'm going to be able to say that will ad to plot, character or even writing style. but trust me when I tel you that if you want a read that will absolutely consume you for three days or more (depending on how fast you read), you HAVE to pick up Memoirs of a Geisha. The narrator's voice sounds exactly like a child's would if she was telling this tale, and matures as the girl herself matures into a stunning young geisha. It's the best read of my year so far, and I probably won 't find another book I like as much for several years to come."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished readingMemoirs of a Geisha. What an enjoyable and sweet story. I couldn't even BELEIVE the end. I also couldn't beleive a MAN wrote this book. The perspective is very much how a woman thinks or feels. I could barely put this down! I sat to finish it on a beach in the rain. Delicious read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read through many of the reviews before starting my own and found an interesting mix of opinions. One thing I do question however, and it is not specific to this novel, either. My question concerns the need reviewers have for giving plot summaries. Why? That's what the back cover is for, isn't it? And yet, the majority of reviews insist upon giving me their re-hashed versions of the story. It's the same with movie reviews, too. Ugh! Stop it already!!!Now that I've ranted, let me say that I enjoyed the book - for the most part. It wasn't life altering, but there were some passages and observations that were well done. It is a quick read, it will satisfy romantics, and it gives the uninformed a chance to dip themselves into a place and time they may never explore elsewise, however shallow that dip may be. The happily ever after ending left me a bit disappointed and the ending philosophical chestnut from Sayuri was rather hollow, but, like I said, this isn't one of those books that will alter your life. Additionally, it is hard to get mentally past the whole young, white, American guy writing as an older, Japanese woman to the point that I found myself struggling to suspend belief and allow my mind to escape completely into the story. I would most certainly want to read the true memoirs of the geisha that Golden used for much of his reference work, however! Also, for those looking for a follow-up to the movie, you will find differences, although nothing too major.Memoirs of a Geisha is what it is - a popular novel that will keep you turning pages and endear itself to you. I wouldn't recommend using it for a historical reference, but for a pleasing read it will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This novel is absolutely incredible. Golden is a literary master who uses the most amazing descriptions and paints scenes with just enough detail for one's mind to fill in the blanks. The characters come to life with dreams, desires, faults and assets. Not only was the writing impeccable, but the story itself enchanting. I hated to put this novel down.As any truly great book will do, Memoirs had me evaluating my own life and what I want to have spent my days on this planet striving to achieve.Golden did such a phenominal job capturing the thoughts of a geisha that I am left feeling I understand the Japanese and geisha culture in a way I most certainly never would have if I hadn't read this novel.As an aspiring novelist, I'm left encouraged by what can be accomplished by a writer who struggles to make every word, every scene, count.Memoirs of a Geisha is one of the best novels I probably will ever read. Absolutely breathtaking."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is an enchanting story of a beautiful young girl who was taken from her poor fishing village to an Okiya, or geisha house, in Kyoto. The book tells of her transformation to one of the most prominent and successful geisha the world has known.Her story and triumph take you back to the time of the Geisha, a word commonly thought of as meaning \\"prostitute,\\" but that actually is the word \\"artist\\" or \\"artisan.\\" These girls went to school to learn the arts of dancing, music, conversation, and charm, yet also, were forced to learn how to cope with humiliation, cruelty, envy, and competition that threatened to destroy them.This child was trained by the famous Mameha who was my favorite character. Her grace and elegance were what guided and led Sayuri, the young geisha, and through this apprenticeship, Sayuri matured and learned the cunning ways of the geisha. But Sayuri wasn't happy with her life and she was frustrated that it seemed to have no purpose. So the story follows her as she took it upon herself to fight to choose her own destiny.I was amazed by her story and immediately drawn into her life, which was wonderfully portrayed by Arthur Golden. I felt like I was suffering in her shames and celebrating her victories right along with her. This is a great read that I would suggest to anyone, but especially someone interested in romance, the arts, Japan, or an inspiring story of survival."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you liked the movie you'll love the book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a student of history so I am very impressed with the \\"feel\\" the author has for Japan during this time. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This remarkable tale is told as seen through the eyes of Chiyo, a strikingly lovely child who belonged to an impoverished family, and one day taken away and sold along with her sister, Satsu. The story takes place in a geisha district in Japan, during and after WWII. The author, Arthur Golden, wrote this story in such a way that we can feel as if we were experiencing everything firsthand. Also, Golden creatively uses descriptive language to illustrate events in the book. Chiyo's unusual beauty captures the attention of the owner of a well known Okiya (geisha house), who then grants her apprenticeship, thus, separating the two sisters. Chiyo eventually came to accept her inevitable fate. Meeting the Chairman brought meaning to her life. Chiyo unfortunately gains the mistreatment and jealousy of head geisha Hatsumomo. Chiyo is later taken under the guidance of Mahema, another renowned geisha. Overtime, and after much rigorous training, Chiyo finally made the transformation into a full fledged geisha, and later became known as Sayuri. Sayuri had overcome many obstacles and sacrificed all that she had achieved in hopes of someday being with the Chairman and attaining individual happiness.Throughout the story, we discover many things about the main characters. Sayuri is portrayed to be somewhat rebellious. Her constant struggle in pursuing her goals shows that she has much courage, determination, and perseverance. Hatsumomo was a beautiful, yet vicious geisha who hid her jealousy toward Sayuri through her cruel acts. Mahema is one of the celebrated geishas. Her unvarying guidance to Sayuri helped her become a successful geisha.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is influential to me because it taught me to always pursue my goals. Of course, this won't be easy, given that you may encounter many hardships along the way. So you must always persevere no matter now difficult something may seem. Prior to reading this book I always imagined geishas living the lives of royalty. However, after reading this book, I realized that behind their beauty lies a life of constant struggle. This book showed me that all people have different goals and dreams. We all have the potential of becoming something great. I also learned much about myself and others. We can all do anything we set our minds to as long as we keep on trying. We shouldn't do what other people want or expect us to do, but work hard in reaching our ambitions."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Yes, this novel could've been better and has some serious problems that should've been resolved before publication. Like another reader, I had trouble imagining these characters as Asian (especially the male ones- The Chairman kept popping up in my head as Caucasian and i had to constantly revise my mental image). The author captures Japan so vividly but fails to capture the Japanese people themselves. This book is sorely lacking in that depiction and everyone comes off as generic human beings wearing kimonos, IMO. I also resented him giving Chiyo the improbable blue-gray eyes, as if that European trait exalted her above everyone else. I was also kept very aware that a man was writing this book for the fact that he fumbles during Chiyo's puberty: The development of her breasts and her menstruation are quickly described in 2 or 3 (retrospective) sentences and dropped forever. Those milestones are a humungous deal to any girl, and will continue to be for the rest of her life, regardless of what she thinks of either throughout. Then, the author deprives Chiyo of any sexual feelings as a youth and teenager... That is simply impossible since children, yes girls included, get those feelings even if only by accident, and are going to experiment. The author doesn't go into any of this because its clear he simply doesn't know better. It has nothing to do with modesty, not after the blunt, believeable sex scenes he writes (through Chiyo's voice) later on. So I feel that this author failed to adequately become his subject in both gender and nationality. It was his burden to make me forget that this book was not being written by a native Japanese woman, which he usually didn't.World War II (a refreshing change in antagonists for Chiyo) is mentioned almost in passing. When Americans invade Japan, everything's fine, no prejudice on either side, no dead POWs being carted off, no allied soldiers abusing native women, no disfigured Japanese soldiers, no mourning families, no crying and bitterness, just a lot of laughing and drinking and singing and good chaste fun. Nanking, Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, all water under the proverbial bridge. Chiyo never hears anti-American or anti-Chinese sentiment though she entertains military men and is \\"so smart\\" that she talks everything from politics to cherry trees with them. Nazis do not exist. Chiyo moves to Post war US and even with her Japanese name, features, and kimono never experiences xenophobia, racism, or even \\"well-meaning ignorance\\", just quizzical stares from the occasional passerby. Pul-eeze.That concludes my criticism. In terms of prose, this one of the best novels I've ever read and probably ever will. The plot is absorbing and I got lost several times in it. So being one of the best I believe its flaws (some not mentioned in my review but done so in others') are going to be more magnified than your run-of-the-mill Sidney Sheldon novel. I highly recommend this book to everyone for the experience of something artistic and fresh in subject matter."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the first chapter of the book, I knew that this would be a great story. I wasn't disappointed. The author clearly has a gift. With great emotion, he tells the story of a young girl and how she goes from childhood through to adulthood, where she has to endure hardships to make her way as an accomplished geisha. The story of Sayuri is absolutely fascinating and the author does an absolutely fantastic job of portraying the culture of geisha and Japan at that time. I have read this book several times now and still continue to do so. I would also recommend that you read 'Geisha' by Lisa Dalby to get a great insight into the life of geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The world of a Geisha was new to me so this book kept my attention. I'm glad it didn't go into any more detail than it did because it probably would have become boring but as it is, it was good. It didn't dwell too much on history or culture and was mostly a story of one woman and her experiences in Japan around WW2. I liked reading about the Japanese culture and how Sayuri dealt with some of the problems she faced. I think most women could probably identify with Sayuri and her feelings for the Chairman. We've all had that one man in our life whom we've never forgot how he made us feel.

I purchased the book from an Indian woman at the Toronto airport, she said to me, &quot;This is a great book. I still miss the main character.&quot; The detail and description of the way of life of a geisha is extremely informative and interesting.The metaphorical language used by Golden flows through the book as water flowing down a stream.

Just when you expect a certain outcome, and long for another, you are surprised by what really occurs, and just how you feel about it.I highly recommend this book.

He does this so well that you are convinced that you are there and have a hard time snapping back to reality. The writing is so beautifully done!This book keeps you going page after page, and when done leaves you yearning for more. I just purchased even more books about Geishas. I can't wait until they arrive even though I know I may never read another book as well written as this. One of the best books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An interesting and haunting look into one aspect of the Japanese geisha culture. The world of geishas continues to disappear now, but this book provides a picture of the life of a geisha and a background to the emerging modern-day geishas in Japan these days. Human nature is also described in this book, in the context of the world of geishas and the Japanese society."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought the book was excellent. It showed the life of a girl growing up in Japan and becoming a geisha. This shows there tradition and culture which I thought was really neat. I think the author did a really great job on this and I recommend it to everyone. It is an excellent source to learn about japanese women and the life of a geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To me, the most incredible thing about this book is that it was written by a man! The author writes so well from a female viewpoint that I had to keep reminding myself that the book was not written by a woman. Learning about the whole geisha culture was extremely interesting, and the plot is well-developed. I was slightly put off by the ending - it is not quite as believable as the rest of the book. However, that did not at all diminish my enjoyment of the novel. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; to anyone, male or female. A great book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden takes one into a little understood and little knownworld, even for Japanese.

The story is a little slow at times but kept my attention with the anticipation of how her life will unfold next. I was so enamored of the book that I ran out the next day and bought the DVD.......while the movie is visually stunning, the storyline is weak. They glazed over too much of the important detail and changed situations to suit the boundries of a screenplay. The book is so much stronger than the film version portrays. A worthy read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is so beautifully written. It's hard to believe that the author is in fact an American instead of a Japanese since he did such a great job in explaining all the nitty gritty detail about Japanese tradition/culture. The characters feel so real, especially Sayuri, that I wonder again and again whether she was a real person. I couldn't put the book down once I started. Great book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"How can a simply story of a simple girl born in a dark corner of Japan who happened to be forced to take the life of a geisha result in such a beautiful eye-catching novel?It was only when I read the final pages (author's notes) that I came to acknowledge that Sayuri never existed and her character was based on true stories told by real life geishas from the pre-war period. Such is the intensity of this novel, we feel that Sayuri, Hatsumomo and Pumpkin were real persons and not fiction characters.I am ashamed to confess I've only decided to read this book after seeing the motion picture, but truth is the movie doesn't make the book justice in any possible way. After seeing a movie adapted from a written novel, we tend to read the book and visualize the characters according to the actors and actresses. Nevertheless, this book is so descriptive and emotional that the faces of all main actresses vanished from my mind and I found myself discovering a new world I thought I knew already.A beautiful romance, magnetic in its simplicity that takes us to a far away land and demystifies in a glorious way the glamorous and hidden world of a vanishing \\"race\\" ... the Japanese geishas."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Ages fourteen and up. The book Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful book about the journey of a young girl named Chiyo, and her life story. After being departed from her family and sent to an okiya, or a geisha house, Chiyo will encounter a whole new type of world. With dedicated training and practice Chiyo works hard to become a geisha. The author, Arthur Golden, uses such a magnificent detailed language that you will feel as if you are there in Japan, experiencing the events Chiyo goes through. The book shows the beautiful art of being a geisha and the struggles and effects from WWII. You are bound to love this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"'Memoirs of a Geisha' is an unequivocally extraordinary book. But there's almost nothing I can add, that the other 2000 reviewers haven't already talked about. But I felt I just had to say something about one of my most cherished books.It's the story of this little Japanese girl 'Chiyu' and her journey from a small fishing village to becoming one of the most coveted Geishas of her time.In the book, 'Chiyu', who later becomes - the Geisha 'Nitta Sayuri', talks to you about her obscure childhood, her trasition from her world to one completely alien, and her love for the one person in her life whose kindness and compassion gave her the courage to face anything that life decided to throw her way.Style of writing? Truly captivating.As you read the book, you find yourself, picturizing everything taking place in the story, extremely vividly, in your mind - be it the complicated hairstyles, the magnificent kimonos, the arduous rituals or the many, many other Japanese things that a person of a non Japanese origin would otherwise never be able to figure out.At the end of the story you just refuse to believe that its not a true story. And what's even harder to believe is that the author is not Japanese himself. Seeing the movie after reading the book is an added bonus. The movie just confirms what the book so beautifully makes you imagine, yourself.Do not miss reading this book for anything.PS People who say it's a book just for women - haven't read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After I saw the movie, I thought I should read the book. That was a good idea! The way the author writes, the details, every part about this book got me caught. The first time I opened the book, I was hoooked. I do admit, I watched the movie first, so I knew a little about it, but take my word for it: the movie has the same ideas, but not exactly the same as the book. I guess from what I have read, you should really read this. It's a really intersting book. Even me, being a 14 year old girl, was intersted in this book. Every second, every minute, every hour you spend with this book, you won't think twice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Seriously, I am still clueless why this book got so many folks raving about. This is one of the most boring books I have read. There is nothing in this about Japanese culture other than explaining how to stitch, press and wear a 'Kimono' (literally atleast about 50 pages of this book talks about kimonos). And if anything I would consider this book to be derogatory about the Japanese because the only way Japanese gents are shown in this book is idling, drinking, ranting while some poor girl (geisha) tries her wits on him for the money she has got. In fact I disliked it so much that my review might feel as if I have a grudge on the author. Stay away from this or read it yourself to see what I mean.-Santhosh."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this novel a full year before the film was releaed, having finally given into the pressure from many female friends of mine. Despite my initial hesitation of reading a \\"woman's novel\\" I soon kicked myself for not picking up this book as soon as it hit the shelves!This is not a novel for the light of heart. From the moment Chiyo is sold into slavery by her father the reader is plunged into a world that has remained mysterious for hundreds of years among Westeners. As we all know now, \\"Geisha\\" is not synonymous with \\"prostitute\\" and these women certainly do not live a charmed existence.Now named Sayuri, our young protaganist is trained in the arts of the Geisha, be it dance and music, or the art of capturing a man's heart (and wallet) in order to please the Geisha House. A bitter rivalry ensues between a rival Geisha who seems to be jealous of the blossoming Sayuri, though as the war approaches Japan, everything is drastically changed and Sayuri must rebuild her life all over again.The details and atomosphere in the novel are its strong points, and I do disagree with the editorial review of Amazon.com in one respect; Chiyo's ultimate journey is not for love, but for the inner peace and independence that she so feverently sought to obtain. And in the end, she does win.This tale is recommended for anyone, though I can confidently say it would appeal most to young women (of any ethnicity!)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book before I watched the movie and I'm glad I did because I loved the details of the book. Parts of the book, I must be honest made me angry because of the way the girls were treated, and the outcome might be fairy tale like, but it is not an American fairy tale, it's always nice to read one from a different country for a change."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am currently listening to the audio version of this book and I feel that even though I'm probably only about halfway through the book version, that I have heard enough to write my review.For starters, I know next to nothing about Japanese culture or geishas for that matter so I thought the story to be quite interesting. Obviously, the book is well researched and the tone seems fairly authentic. I don't think that I'd be able to actually read the hard copy of the book though because the manner in which the book is written is just too much. By this, I mean that it is rife with similes and metaphors so much so that it began to get very irritating to listen to. The main character Sayuri (aka Chiyo-chan) is constantly making irrelevant comparisons and takes forever to get to the point. The language used by the author is also extremely repetitive. I understand that the kimonos were lovely to the peasant turned geisha, but I just don't see the need to drum home the fact that each one was \\"the loveliest/most beautiful/exquisite/\\" that Sayuri had ever seen. Also, the constant references to her eyes were over the top. I don't think that this book is deserving of all the praise and accolades that it has garnered thus far and I'm fairly certain that I'd probably like the movie version better. Some people seem to think that the prose is phenomenal, but I think that if you use enough adjectives I suspect you are bound to appeal to someone. This reader was not did not find the story to be vividly descriptive, rather vividly tedious is more like it.

Of course, it did not hurt that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" garnered numerous positive reviews and kudos.Needless to say, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is perhaps one of the best books that I have ever read, one whose story continues to stay with me even after all of these months. I constantly find myself thinking about Sayuri and the rest of the characters, all of whom, thanks to Golden's brilliance in character development, added great life and passion to the story. That, in my opinion, is the mark of a timeless literary classic.Golden is an amazing storyteller with the ability to weave a web of plots filled with deception, intrigue and love. The emotions that occupy the pages of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" propel the reader to the depths of Sayuri's desperation and to the heights of her glory. It is a story that consumes you, that pulls you into the exotic, secret world of geishas."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I decided to read this book because of the previews for the upcoming movie, and I loved it!

The geisha culture was well researched by the author, lending considerable realism to the story. Paired with flawless writing, this novel is truly a standout in modern literature. I rarely read novels more than once, but I have read this one four times and will never part with this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is that rare kind of book that is able to transport you to a time and place you know anything about. As the story unfolds, you learn about the culture, the peeople and the world they live in. With Geisha, author Arthur Golden has created a rich narrative that is imaginative and affecting and that never disappoints. It is an extraordinary book that will leave a strong impression on the reader.When Chiyo is taken away from her family and sold to at the Nitta Okya, a Geisha house, she can't understand the world surrounding him. She misses her family and her sister and the life she kne. Everything is different from the small fishing town she has known all of her life. Beautiful and different with pale grey/blue eyes, Chiyo finds many admirers and many ennemies in this town. People are hard on her, she finds no love in her new life, no friends. Nothing.Her biggest enemy is Hatsumono, the house's top Geisha who loves no one but herself. She sees Chiyo as competition and will do everything in her power to ruin her Geisha education. But when a very successful Geisha, Memha, takes her under her wing, Chiyo's popularity quickly becomes notorious. Now known as Sayuri, Chiyo will become one of the most famous and popular Geisha of her time, reknown for her beauty and wit. But as she tries to deal with Hatsumono's hatred, her secret love for a man she barely knows and as the war quickly looms upon them, Sayuri will learn that life isn't all roses and wine all the time.Sayuri isn't a perfect heroine. In fact, near the end of the book, she becomes a bit winy as she has to suffer through the hardships of the war. She has been so used to getting all that she wants in her life that she isn't used to hard work. And because of that, Memoirs of a Geisha is a book you will admire. The fact that our heroine isn't perfect, that she can hate and love and be mean like the rest of us, makes this book very real for the reader.And being able to encounter and understand a new culture is incredible. I knew nothing about Geishas and life in pre-war Japan and this well researched book brings this curious and unknown world to vivid life.It is true that the prose is a bit too flowery at times and that the way the story is presented feels a bit fragmented at times, but these flaws never take away from the story itself. Memoirs of a Geisha is an incredible book you'll want to read time and time again."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I saw the preview for this movie a few months ago, and couldn't wait to read the book. The story was so wonderful, I couldn't put it down. The author really brings you to the world of Geisha.

A DEFINITE MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As others have stated, this book was a great read to me. I was so wrapped up in Sayuri's character that I had forgotten that it was fiction (broke my heart!). Another interesting point from reading this book, love was never mentioned, not once. It does seem that even where the emotions are involved with Sayuri, detachment from those same emotions are in effect. It makes one wonder how real Geisha function in their world! One last note, it was said that Mr. Golden gave up his source (a real Geisha) and that her 'business' suffered because of it! If that's true, then I consider that a really lousy thing to have done to someone, particularly someone that helped him in his research of the life of a Geisha. Every now and then, it seems that authors' must produce proof that they know what they are talking about - or people/critics will just dismiss their books as so much \\"hearsay.\\" Oh well...still...a great read...get a copy at a good price and enjoy it anyway!!!

Along the way, she falls in love with a man that, to most would seem out of reach. As the book progressed, I quickly found myself wrapped up in the story. The best way I can put it is that the novel was beautifully written. It flowed from start to finish and it was easy to be captivated in the plot. The incredible imagery and extensive Japanese culture described in the novel was so unique and interesting, I had a hard time putting the book down. The only flaw would have to be all the names of people, places, events, and rituals that could get a bit overwhelming at times. I ended up having to read some parts twice. However, it did not stop me from enjoying the novel and the story. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to read something somewhat adventerous and new, or anyone that is interested in learning more about the Japanese culture of the early twentieth century. It does have a few explicit parts, but overall the novel is absolutely wonderful. As silly as it sounds, I feel like a more well-rounded individual having read Memoirs of a Geisha. It is no wonder why it has been a bestseller."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought that this this book was slow paced and pretty much boring.

From the moment you open the book, you are hooked. And that Hatsumomo is a total bitch! I won't give it away but I just hope that nobody comes in contact with a woman like that. She will give woman and geisha a bad horrible name. Take Care!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Like other reviewers, I read this book quickly. It is definitely a page turner, despite its length. One of the reasons I kept reading was that, when I wasn't reading the novel, I was wondering what was going to happen next! The plot moves quickly, driven by the personalities and the foibles of the various characters. The story Golden weaves definitely draws the reader in.Unlike other reviewers, however, I certainly don't believe that the novel is thin regarding character development, and I definitely do not think that the protagonist, Sayuri, has \\"everything handed to her on a silver platter\\"! Nothing could be further from the truth! Golden, the author, takes great pains to show the reader the harshness of Sayuri's upbringing, and he frequently comments on how difficult the life of a working geisha could be, both before, during, and after World War II.One of the novel's primary strengths is the window into the life of a geisha that it offers. For me, this world was both foreign and fascinating. To learn about the details of dress, hair, custom, and daily life of a geisha in the context of an entertaining story was a welcome part of my experience reading the novel.Several reviewers have also noted that the end of the novel seems contrived or phony. I'll admit that I felt similarly, too, at first. However, I think that the ending in no way diminishes the power of the story. In fact, with the way much of contemporary fiction ends these days, it can be refreshing to hear a \\"happily ever after\\" once in a while."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is the best piece of Modern Fiction I have read in a long time. I had just finnished suffering through a handmaids tale when someone recommened Memoirs of a geisha my thought were only that it was modern fiction (like handmaids tale), had sex in it (reading graphic decriptions of sex is not my cup of tea) so I thought I was plunging head first into a handmaids tale set in Japan. My friend assured me that I would love it so I began. I am a very stubern person but I came out after finishing the book with tears. It is a magical book with characters that are so real I could almost hear their voices speacking. The sex in it is well done, with the story about a geisha it's kind of hard for there to be none, but it is tame. I know it happend and thats enough. I would strongly recommend this book to every one, it is a book you will love and read again and again. If you are thinking of giving it as a present I would not give it to anyone younger that 14."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book had me utterly fascinated from page 1. It surprises me that it's written by a man (no offense to the men out there) because it strikes me as a particularly feminine subject, and it's handled with the utmost of taste and decorum to the feminine sensibilities without being crude. Bravo to the author! I never once doubted his ability to take me deep into the realms of such a feminine story.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is the story of Chiyo, a young Japanese girl from a poor fishing village. When their family falls on hard times, she and her sister are sold off in Gion, where Chiyo enters into a geisha household because people find her looks fascinating, thanks to her unusual grey eyes. Originally a rebellious, sullen child, we see her transform into a promising, famous geisha under the tutelage of her Older Sister.I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but I didn't expect it to have such a dreamlike quality. The way Gion is described, and the lifestyle of the geisha makes it seem like a world very far away from our own -- it's hard to believe it's half a world away rather than galaxies away. Gion reminded me of a fantasy world, or perhaps even fairy-tale.There were a few things that I didn't like about this book, but they are very minor nitpicks -- you should read it anyways. Every so often, the author leaves the first person point of view to 'teach' you about a particular japanese custom. You can always tell when this is happening because the paragraph will start off with \\"If you don't know what ____ is, let me tell you about it.\\"Storywise, the only thing I really wished the author had included was more of the latter half of Chiyo/Sayuri's life. The entire book seems to lead up to her beginnings as a geisha, and then as soon as she becomes one, it feels like the entire storyline speeds to the end. I guess I would have liked to hear more about her lifestyle after she becomes the big \\"G\\" but perhaps that was interesting only to me."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was excellent - a real page turner! The descriptions were beautiful."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think this is a reasonably interesting and challenging read, though it is wordy. I thought the recollections of the World War II era and the other historical sidelights added to my knowledge. I thought the first half of the book, in which the girl is torn away from her family in her little fishing village (also from her sister),while very sad, was a little better- told than the second half, though this is actually a straight line success story, from abject poverty to great success, since in the latter half of the book her relationships are with notably successful Japanese businessmen. Her apprenticeship, beset by jealousies, was interesting, with its many informative pages about the geisha's necessary talents, such as dancing and tea-service. There are many scenes in teahouses throughout. Her elaborate coiffure, while not comfortable for her, also caught my interest. The book is tediously wordy, however. I thought the scenes with the baron were amusing."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An amazingly authentic voice is being projected here. As a quasi-student of Japanese culture, this seems to me to have all of the flavor of Kyoto and Edo without losing touch with their connections to contempoary Japan.History, story line and characterization evoke a level of empathy which can be felt only by someone who has spent significant time there, in Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although this is a novel, I felt as thought I was getting history lesson. And it wasn't the boring kind I had in school. It was riveting and quite detailed. The life of an early 20th century geisha was labor intensive. I was shocked to read how much training and skill goes into these women, and that most of the time these women do not voluntarily train. This was the case for the character we delve into, Sayuri.Just a poor fisherman's daughter from a small village, Sayuri (not her given name) is sold to an okiya at the age of nine. Her days are torture, from why all of these things were occuring in her life to the treatment she endured for years from the people in her new life. But then the winds change for her, and she becomes a geisha herself. This however, is not all fun and games. The reader follows her life througout the next twenty years or so. The narration is full of metaphors, which adds to the feeling of hearing straight from a Japanese women's mouth. The research involved in this novel must have been extensive, but well worth the authors (and readers) effort.A great read you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When my sister offered to lend me her copy of Memoirs of a Geisha, I nearly turned it down wondering aloud how good can a book about a Geisha be when it's written by a caucasian man.

It can't be!! =P Much of her life reminded me of another lady I know who told me her vague story about her life as a dancer in her country and why she gave it up. Very realistic. I only wished all books I've picked up were as interesting and fluid as this one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Who knew a geisha's life is that full, that complicated and also that empty? I make a comparison to the average woman's life today and I think is it any fuller, less complicated or any more meaningful? I don't have answers for these questions but that's why I loved the book so much. It begs you to ask these questions.A friend and I both read Memoirs of a Geisha about three months ago and I swear the book is still a part of our daily lives. For example, we referred to a beautiful, nasty/bitchy woman as a Hatsumomo. Times when I think this is a man's world I now stop myself and think is there a way to get my needs met with kindness, compliments or manipulation. And maybe I should re-think the word manipulation. Should it always have negative connotations? Also, have I kidded myself in thinking that beauty isn't that important but just a nice extra if you have it? You see, Memoirs of a Geisha has made me question so much about being today, especially being a woman.I like that I got a real since of yin and yang. How there are huge differences between rich and poor and a geisha and a prostitute. How men are men and women are women, and during peacetime there is abundance and at wartime people are getting killed. There's also a noticed difference bewteen spring and fall, it's observed in Sayuri's dress, the geisha's ceremonies, people's habits. I live in southern California where there is equality amongst the sexes, there has never been a war on our soil, and there's spring or summer most of the year. I'm not complaining but commenting on \\"what is.\\" This book has altered my perspective of 'what is' and I like that."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After living in Japan for 2 years, I found this book to be an excellent continum for me. I love the continual introspective dialogue by the main character and the final acceptance of her destiny. An Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a devout fantasy reader, and devourer of the occasional Western historical fiction, this was a huge step. I saw it in the library, and as I flipped through, I came across a few lines of beautiful prose that, I swear, made me see Japanese gardens. I have never been very interested in anything Oriental/Eastern, so, frankly, my head-over-heels fall in love with this book was completely unexpected.A response to the &quot;Westernization&quot; of the novel - don't forget, the &quot;memoir&quot; was &quot;dictated&quot; by a woman who had lived many years in New York, to an American man. Also, I think it was necesary, in order to open a door for Western readers to immerse themselves, to place some sort of Western plot to the story... hence the Chairman romance. Without some sort of &quot;Western&quot; focus, it would be almost impossible to have us empathize with such an exotic character in such an exotic world. So, critics, please!All in all, it's beautiful, detailed, an intricate explanation of this far-removed life, previously completely alien to me. I am not saying that it is completely accurate... I have never been to Japan, nor been schooled as a geisha, so I wouldn't know. But at the very, very, very, criticized least, we are left with a beautiful flavor in our mouths,of cherry blossoms and the soft rustle of kimono silk."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"China has banned the movie \\"Memoirs of a Geisha;\\" The nook is not about China, but Chinese actresses have prominent roles in the film as Japanese Geisha - professional entertainers. They have won respect and praise. It is hard to see why China should object to either the book or the film.\\"Geisha\\" is anti-American. It has much in common with \\"Teahouse of the August Moon, \\" a comedy about US blunders in Okinawa at the start of the US occupation. The GI's in Teahouse are likeable bubbleheads who get a lesson in Asian culture and laugh at their own ignorance; a teahouse is not a brothel nor does Geisha mean hooker.Americans in the movie Geisha are boors and barbarians. Historical Japanese condemned females to abuse and cruelty, but that cruelty inspired artistry and grit for some. In Teahouse Americans saw Okinawa \\"get up and go\\" at the invitation of Sakini - played by Marlon Brando. That's not the message in Geisha.Geisha reveals the beauty of Asian \\"soul.\\"The actresses are Chinese, not Japanese; there's the rub. China - today's new superpower - does not admit that females have \\"soul\\" (the word we use is African). The actresses in Geisha display artistry that conflicts with a political stereotype - racist and sexist. So it is banned in China, depriving the producers of a significant market.But coarse, fornicating American military conflict with another stereotype, turning away a larger market. The delicate beauty of Geisha will be denied its American due. Our world is not ready for soul.Wallace F.

While many would say this is a much to sexual and erotic book for a 15 going on 16 year old to read, i found it not as racy as many of the books i have read. What i did find though was a captivating beginning to the book but a rather let down of an ending. By then end of this book i thought that i should be happy for Sayuri but the character seemed to be so immoral and lacking that i couldn't feel happy for her.

Fortunatley, a used book store offered me a good trade.Poorly written and quite booring. Ten years of research may have provided the author with ample facts to assemble. but he should have spent more time developing a style with which to write it. It gave me no feel for the main character or her life. Lifeless and colorless best describes this book.I hope the screen writer is better with the movie than the author was with this book.

This book was recommended to me by a local book club and they all had read it and thought it was nonfiction (it's very easy to miss those last pages).

I even saw some spelling mistakes!If you're looking for a truthful, entertaining read, get Minkeo Iwasaki's book instead - written by a japanese woman, who was a geisha!A mildly entertaining book, until you realise that most of what is written is some middle aged, american man's fantasy!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"that way you'll feel and see what I felt and saw..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I ordered the movie Memoirs of a Geisha.

The plot is set in a picturesque Japan of pre-WWI until the end of WWII. Although the memoirs is Sayuri(Chiyo) describing her life, the supporting characters develop a life of their own. Golden's rich character descriptions and developments allows the audience to be in the streets of Gion, Kyoto watching the geishas.However, this book is not an accurate historical view in all the aspect of a geisha/geiko's life.

I enjoyed it and often found myself not wanting to get out of my car."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished after some marathon reading sessions. I want to do this review in three parts because I'm rather split brained about this book.Review #1: From start to finish I had this nagging feeling that I've read this book before -- or read a very similar story. I haven't been able to track down why this book seems so familiar. If I ever do, I'll append this journal entry. To some degree, then, this story feels derivative and cliche. Orphaned girl tries to make good with her new &quot;family&quot; and is harrassed by the jealous, spiteful bully. The story picks up at the 1/3 point and stops being quite so cliche as it is in the set up. The good news is that the details are so rich and the language flows smoothly enough to make this book a page turner, even in the rough start.Review #2: I happened to be reading this book at the same time I was reading the Chobits manga series. Both books are about Japanese culture and the relationships of men and women across classes.Memoirs of a Geisha is the fictional account of a girl aprenticing to become a geisha in the great depression era. As the book explains -- gei means art and geisha means artisan. It's an ironic/jaded pun for a society/class of expensive escorts. To stay a geisha, a woman cannot marry and should not fall in love with her clients. Chobits seems to be a sci-firetelling of the same tale. The underlying tensions are about what sorts of pairings are good/normal and who should love whom. Chi is an artifice -- an almost pun on geisha.In both cases, Chiyo/Sayuri (of Memoirs of a Geisha) and Chi (of Chobits), are seeking happiness, wondering if happiness can be attained. In Sayuri's case, her station is supposed to keep her dispassionate in her associations with her various clients. In Chi's case, she's a machine and not supposed to feel real emotions.Review #3: The final comparision I found myself making with this book is between Chiyo /Sayuri and Chihiro/Sen (of Sen To Chihiro Kamikakushi aka Spirited Away). Both stories revolve around young girls who are taken away from their parents through bizare circumstances and brought into lives that they would otherwise not have lived. In Chihiro's case, she ultimately is returned to her parents as is warranted by the fantasy convention. Mother in Memoirs reminds me of Yubaba and Mameha reminds me of Lin in her initial reluctance to help and her later tutorilage.Final thoughts: I think Memoirs of a Geisha has lots to offer. It may be a little rough at first but I recommend reading the book! You will come away enriched for reading it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was highly recommended by a few friends. It wasn't for me though.

I thought it over a few times before I finally said, with no hype or expectations, why not? The 7 days that I was in Tokyo I hardly touched the book, nor after I returned. So I find it rather amusing that in my downtime in transit in and around England that I truly found myself emersed in this book. Something that so rarely happens with reading. But Arthur Golden's novel I found to be absolutely captivating, that I found my old reading habits disapear. Its beautifully written. Wonderfully evocative and just absolutely heartwarming. What really impressed me was his knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture, society, and behavior. All of these elements combined just made for a wonderful read. It originally began as something of impulse purchase to pass the time, Memoirs of Geisha will probably go down as one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I've read this book several times in the past few years and am never dissapointed by the story I already know well.

Before reading this book, I knew very little about Geishas, so the book was a very interesting read from just an educational standpoint. Who knew they made the make-up from bird droppings. Ewww. What was also wonderful was the characters and their relationship with each other. I truly cared what happened to Sayuri.

This novel is vibrant, exotic, touching, authentic, beautifully detailed, golden and rich. I read into it as the Chairman sees through Sayuri's eyes to her soul.Books this good come along too rarely to miss this one.

I had heard about it before and seen it in the bookstore, which I frequent, but I had little intention of picking it up. Then, one night, my friend gave me a stack of books to borrow and said I should read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" because it was a wonderful book.Finally, I started it last week. For me, the beginning got off to an indifferent start, and by that I mean I was neither absolutely engrossed or bored out of my mind. I gradually began to get into it; once Chiyo got to the okiya, the story became fascinating. The characters are astoundingly good--Hatsumomo is the perfect nemisis! The plot is so great, so interesting, and so educational; I never knew much about Japan, but now Japanese culture amazes me. It has taken one of the top spots on my favorite books list. For years \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", \\"Watership Down\\", and the Harry Potter books have competed for the number one slot, now \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" steps into the ring with her gloves on.Read this book. I'm sure you'll love it, at least, if you love well-told stories, you will! Arthur Golden's a great writer!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The movie piqued my interest in geisha society and Golden's novel doesn't disappoint. It's related in the simple girlish language of an uneducated fisherman's daughter. However, her facile mind and proclivity for metaphor quickly charmed me. The author claims to accurately describe the geisha world, and I'm sure most Westerners will find it as exotic as anything that could be imagined.On another level, there's the actual story which is brimming with nobility, generosity, selfishness and cruelty. Most of the episodes could be drawn from Japanese soap opera if such entertainment exists. Frankly, this novel is about the sexual coming-of-age of a geisha told in great detail. However, women of all cultures have a way of being explicit without becoming pornographic. I would guess that most women will love this tale, while many men will grow weary of looking for the good parts among the scores of pages devoted to kimono description, cosmetics application and man-disarming language.While Westerners can easily fault the many contradictions in Japanese sexual attitudes, the author rightfully just relates the story. And, in ruminating about America's eternal quest for satisfaction, I'll not cast a stone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was actually recomended by my best buddy. I was a bit reluctant to start it right away because I thought it's gonna be another one dull book but hey...I was proved wrong. The writer has a unique way of expressing Sayuri's thoughts whereby many of them were pretty comical. It is not just a story. It is more than that as in it reveals the culture of traditional Japanese customs which is unkown to many of us. The story itself is entertaining. At certain point, it somehow makes you reflect on life itself. It tells the story of how a little girl struggles to get away from her fate as a geisha at a tender age. As she grown into a young lady, she begins to see how ambiguous and tough life would be if she does not become a geisha. Hence, she started a brand new struggle which is to become a geisha and a successful one. She met various obstacles along the way especially from her senior geisha Hatsumomo. She finally managed to overcome the rough paths and become a well-known geisha. A lot has happened on her way to become a well-known geisha. This book is really worth the time and money spent on it.

Picked it up after my wife read it and loved it! A close competition between this book and Gates of Fire for the best book I've read this year."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"****MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS****Arthur Golden's years of research and interviews with the last of the traditionally trained geisha, Miss Mineko Iwasaki (who receives the longest of the \\"thank you\\"s in his acknowledgements) were not wasted.Chiyo is a clever young girl with very little brightness in her future; her mother is ill with what she tells us \\"was probably bone cancer\\". Her father, this being his 2nd marriage, is much older than her mother and is unlikely to survive her for very long. So when a seemingly kind hearted villageman named Mr. Tanaki pays her father for both her and her sister Satsu, Chiyo thinks she is going to live with the Tanakas. Instead, she and finds herself in Gion, sold to an okiya (geisha house) as a maid, while Satsu's situation is less fortunate- she is sent to a brothel to work as a prositute (Interestingly, many Westerners think of geisha as prostitutes, but they are actually trained entertainers. Chiyo gives insight on this when she tells us that you can tell the difference, too, by how an obi is tied around a kimono; geisha wear theirs tied elaborately in the back, whereas a prostitute, who is in and out of her clothes constantly, can't be bothered with complexity, so their obi is tied in the front).Some okiya maids are intended to be apprentice geisha, if it seems profitable. And Chiyo's okiya is profited most by evil hearted Hatsumomo. Beautiful as she is cruel, Hatsumomo can see Chiyo's beauty and unusual gray eyes may one day be competition for her. Reluctant to give up her position as the okiya's cash cow, Hatsumomo sets out on a path to destroy Chiyo from the very start. When Hatsumomo's greatest rival, the famous geisha Mameha, takes a shine to Chiyo, we see some light at the end of the tunnel. Chiyo is finally made a \\"younger sister\\" to Mameha and changes her name to Sayuri. But even though she's finally left the drudgery of being a maid, her life isn't as wonderful as she'd expected. Her quest to find \\"her destiny\\" in a businessman she calls the Chairman is thwarted when his business partner takes a shine to her, causing potential conflict. And then, World War II takes it's toll on Sayuri and everyone else in Gion. Geisha districts are closed. Sayuri is forced to be a laborer once again. Even after the war ends, things still aren't ideal in her life.Interestingly, the one part of this amazing book that struck me the deepest came in the last chapter, where Sayuri, now living a better life, remarks, \\"I must admit I lived in a contented state long before I was finally able to look back on how desolate my life once was. I'm sure I could never have told my story otherwise; I don't think any of us can speak frankly about pain until we are no longer enduring it\\".I was surprised to read some reviewers talk about how \\"boring\\" they found this novel to be. It's been a long time since a book grabbed my attention from the first page and made me hurry through everyday tasks just to be able to get on with the next chapter. I have not yet seen the movie, but realize you can't fit the brilliance of an entire novel into 114 minutes! I heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in a detailed account of a true geisha's life, or of a girl who is able to turn tragedy around into something resembling happiness."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book kept me up nights not wanting to put it down! I couldn't wait to see what was to happen! Golden writes well.. Excellent eye for detail and melodic writing style, especially for an American male living through the eyes of a Japanese Geisha. I liked that the heroine was not flawless, yet still you sympathized with her every dilemma. As another reviewer stated, a small weakness is in the speaking of her love interest, as Golden does not go into much detail as to why the sweet narrator loves him so. But, what seems to be hidden between the lines in her love for this stranger is that it was only he who gave her any kindness in such a harsh world. Sold into slavery when her parents were old and ill and unable to care for her, the main character has a terrible time trying to regain an indentity and place to call home. I suppose it is just when she has lost all hope that she has a brief encounter with this much older man, who instead of treating her like common peasant, sees her as a real person. For this reason, she pines for him. A little oedipal, maybe? But, this is not the main point of the story. We go through many years of her Geisha-hood and learn just what it is like to live solely to entertain and be perfect, while in the country as a whole one cannot find a place to call home. Excellent reading material. Kept my interests and then some."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished the book a week ago and I must say that this is a very good book. I will not say &quot;I love it&quot;, &quot;I couldn't put it down&quot;, etc... like others reviewers, in an attempt to give a truly objective perspective as for the swung critics this book has received.First of all, I think that Mr.Gordon did made a great job with this book, very well informed about Japanese culture and certainly about geisha's lifestyle. I must say to those who made the negative and ugly commments below, that you know nothing about Japan or its culture, and much more less about good reading. Even the japanese readers had different perspectives about this book and we may ask: why?. There are some aspects about traditional japanese lifestyle that not even all japanese are aware of how exactly 'are' or 'functions' this practices: for example: everybody knows what is a kimono but NOT all women in Japan wears them. Even more, before a woman can wear one, she must go to a special school just to learn how to put it, this takes several years (and I am not talking about becoming a geisha, just wearing a typical silk kimono in today's Japan). I once wore one and it took 1 hour to the Japanese girl just to put it on me (and I am not fat to those who may be thinking how to destroy my comment). More: every japanese know what is a tea ceremony and everyone can go to one, but NOT everyone can take stage in preparing the tea because once again, japanese women must go to a school to learn every little movement they had to make with their hands to have the privilege of participating in one. Like these examples, a lot of things are like that in Japan: how they put the food on the table it's art, how they wear the kimono is art, everything has a deep meaning in japanese culture. So, this way not even all japanese can explain everything about geishas because NOT all men can afford to visit one. As simple as that...! Most japanese will never see a geisha in real life.As description of japanese culture and its deep and intrexicably meanings, the book is VERY good. That some....readers cannot understand this because of their very narrow mind that's something else, that others don't like japanese culture that's something else too.As an educated academic researcher, and as an avid reader from long time of real classics of 19 and 20 century good novels, good latin american and european literature (and not as a dump reader of 'rose novels' or garbage books) this is a good book: this is not japanese pretty woman or a soap opera book as some has said. To those people who said that I'll tell: it's a very different sensation of writting a book than reading a book: last part is much more easy and more to those who never had written anything in their lifes.Gordon DID made a very long a deep researh to writte this book(of course this solely fact does not make it a good book) and you are trying to put it down as garbage: to those who said they did not learned anything about geishas or Japan with the book, I don't think that was the intention of the writter: if you want to learn something more, go to college to study Japanese. To that who said the author is a storyteller and a typer more that a writter: I bet you had never wrote anything; and to that very silly and ignorant girl who said that she never saw the word 'love' in the book: this word is not indiscriminatly used in Japan, as we do in the rest of the world... cont...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must admit that I'm confused about the appeal of this book. I'm reading it as part of a book club, and never have I struggled so much to get through a single volume. I'm generally open to works outside of my normal interests, but I find this tedious book so overburdened with period detail and misplaced epochal reverence that I don't think I can finish it. While the general subject may be somewhat interesting, the story becomes obscured by the obsessive adoration the author has for the phenomenon of geisha. I'm afraid I'll have to learn the ending from my book club mates, unless, of course, they feel the same way I do and don't finish it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought this book was a poorly written, trite, and sillyCinderella story; that its main character was shallow, selfish,ungrateful, disloyal (especially to her poor sister) and needlessly cruel; and that it romanticized and glorified kidnapping and sexual exploitation of children and women by wrapping them in pretty costumes (imagine your reaction if this book didn't have an exotic setting). And I have to laugh at all the protestations that geisha life isn't about selling female-subjugating sexuality, it's about art and conversation: then why are all the customers men, and all the geishas women? Don't women like art and conversation, too? And what about selling virginity?Okay, that's just my opinion. Look at this excerpt from a Washington Post article....:\\"I am indebted to one individual above all others. ... To Mineko [Iwasaki], thank you for everything,\\" Arthur Golden wrote in the acknowledgments of the English version of the book, a stunningly popular novel that stayed on the New York Times best-seller list for 58 weeks.The feeling is not mutual.\`HE GOT IT WRONG'\\"Basically, what is written in Arthur Golden's book is false,\\" says the retired geisha, in her first interview since the book was published in Japanese in November and she was able to read it. \\"He got it wrong.\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There are too many words to describe this book. I read it as an english project not knowing what to expect. It was introduced to me by a friend. This historical fiction is beautifully written, describing every posible detail.It takes you through the life of a young girl who grew up in a fishing village.Through some unusual circumstances, she finds her self in Kyoto, Japan, asspiring to become a Geisha.Though many might say that this story does not accurately describe modern life in Japan,well, it wasn't supposed to. This story was written in the early 1900's.(1920's - 60's) Life and morales are different over there, so what some may see as extreme and unrealistic, are acutually normal, common, occurances. Of course not everyone lived like a Geisha, but this book gives you an insight on how those select few did live lives full of traditions almost dead. This is an outstanding book, with historical accuracy, romance, suspense, and drama. A great read that you should not pass up!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book begins with Sayuri, a former geisha, recounting the story of her life beginning with her humble beginnings in a small Japanese fishing village. Sold to a geisha &quot;family,&quot; Sayuri is at first sad and lost in this strange new environment. However, her will to survive and persevere is stronger than her grief and she accepts the cards that fate has dealt her, vowing to become successful geisha. Her obstacles and triumphs are chronicled, as well as her various adventures as a geisha.However, the annoying and irritating thread running throughout most of the book is Sayuri's irrational and unbelievable infatuation with the Chairman. This is a character that is never developed, indeed, readers are never even privy to his real name. Sayuri's attempts at establishing a romance with the Chairman eventually become pathetic and detract from what could be a courageous and memorable character.The ending is so abrupt and innocently simple it seems that the author finally got tired of writing and decided to wrap everything up in a neat, little package.Despite these criticisms, this is still an entertaining and worthwhile read. Because it does have merit, I believe readers and the story itself simply deserved better."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book until the last twist. Up till that last part I still expected Sayuri to grow up from her girlish crush of a dream. I guess the author really wanted to give us a surprise ending, and therefore we saw Sayuri using her body as a last ditch effort to get the Chairman, and even though the chairman saw that she did &quot;what first class geisha wouldn't do&quot;, he justified it for her.Furthermore, throughout the story, we felt all the feelings Nobu had for Sayuri, and really got to see him as a loyal, dependable, dignified person who can take care of Sayuri. In contrast, we never learned in depth about Chairman as a person, except that he was kind and affable. Consequently, I felt very cheated when he got the girl. In summary, I would say this story is &quot;Scarlett O'Hara gets Ashley and never figured out Rhett was the one for her&quot;. If I were still a sentimental teenage girl, I might like this ending. But I didn't think the teens were the intended audience.On the other hand, until the last part, he story was unusual and intriguing. The life of a very little known group of that faraway time and place seemed to come to life. For that reason, it was still a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Simply delicious!

I had waited so long to read this book, dont ask me why, and I am truly happy that I have experienced everything it has to offer. For me, I was totally ignorant to exactly what a geisha was or is. This book is so touching in the way that a reader who has no idea of what a geisha is learns more about them as the main character encounters them and becomes one herself! I felt like I was learning all about geisha just as Chiyo/Sayuri was learning and experiencing it for herself! Wow....I just dont know what to say about this book. Everything is beautiful in this book.....the descriptions, the words and the twists and turns along the way are just dripping with emotion and truth. I am just truly impressed with this book and can't imagine anything more beautifully tragic!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I could hardly put the book down. You can't help but root for the main character to win in the end. The book was compelling, heartfelt, full of detail and imagery and worth every cent.I wish it had been set in an earlier time period, and knowing that the war was coming was not pleasant, but it was handled adequately.The sudden switch at the end was expected, which is always a let down in any book. Also, so many loose ends were not tied. Perhaps there will be a sequel book for the sister?Regardless, the book was great!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a poetic depiction of a young woman drowning in the vague abyss of poverty and tragedy, brutally forced to pierce through the murky and secluded world of being a geisha. In this groundbreaking book, we can peer into the life of Chiyo, a girl who survived adversities because of her stunning and beautiful features and acidic wit. A revelation of a forsaken Japanese culture and a quite remarkable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When my wife gave me this book I didn't want to read it because I thought I knew what a Geisha is (I was very wrong), when you start reading this book you'll get amazed of how cruel could be some parents, and even if the parents were good (like pumpkin parents that were dead, her uncle was the bad guy). But in this story you see how even a kid could survive in a good way even if she had almost everything against. The story is a pleasant one when you read it, nothing is boring, and you really learn about the Geisha's life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was disappointed by this book. In terms of giving me insights into a geisha's life, I think it delivered. But the plot development was lacking and I could not relate to the main character. The main character falls in love with a chairman after a brief (and I mean, very brief) encounter with him, he doesn't even remember her. She becomes obsessed with him and the plot is driven by her quest for his love. Then there was there was this other plot line where there was a bidding war for her virginity. I just couldn't care less. Basically, I don't like it that she was made into this Cinderella character where everyone around her was either ugly, mean, or vengeful and she was all pure and beautiful. Give me a break. I can't relate to characters like that. They should be flawed like real people, not all self-congratulative, the best in dance, the best in wine pouring, the best this and that. It gets boring after a while. The only thing I liked were the geisha details, but I'm sure I could have gotten that from another book. It was not worth reading over 500 pages for that in this disappointing book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Wow! This book really prompted some fierce emotions. The story was beautifully written, enlightening, and particular. So believable was the story that parts of it made me really angry. It's absolutely worth the time to read this unique work.

It simply failed to live up to all the acclaim : while parts were fascinating, by and large the narrative tone struck me as flat and monotonous, and the plotline was far too thin to be stretched over 400-odd pages. I kept expecting a deeper immersion in the unusual rites and rituals of the geisha life, but in the final analysis the immersion was only shin-deep (and I'm only 5'10!) I simply wasn't captivated, and I finished the book with a sad, but solid, lack of enthusiasm, hoping for richness that never came."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My mother lent me this book when I last went home to visit and once I started, I couldn't put it down.

Geisha is strange to contemporary Japanese just like westerners. So I'm not sure I have different impression. But the atmosphere of this novel is not peculiar to me(Some American-made stories or movies laid in Japan amaze us). Of course this is pre-war story, the time before I was born. I know selling girls due to help their family was not uncommon (though not so much) in those days. The heroine is about my parents' age( I am mid-40s). Japan's society has extremely changed after the war --- richer, Americanized, less exotic to foreigners. If you are interested in &quot;exotic Japan&quot;, I recommend you to read this novel rather than coming to Japan.

The women are not the only characters sold short; a doctor reduced to a sweat whilst treating a cut on the thigh of a 15 yr old ...please!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Much has already been written about this perceptive insight into an aspect of Japan about which little is known in the West. Today I wish to touch upon another interesting aspect of the novel about which nothing has been said to the best of my knowledge. Apologies if that is not the case. I read the interview with Arthur Golden by Amazon after reading the book. I do take issue with statement made in that interview that all the characters in the book are based on fiction.Any student of Japanese business will be familiar with the story of Konosuke Matushita the founder of the National Panasonic group, known formally as Matsushita Electric Industries. Those of you who have done your homework will be aware that Matsushita started his company by developing a new type of socket after working for Osaka Light. After the war National Panasonic was classified as a zaibatsu by the occupation forces just as Iwamura Electric was. Similarly, the occupation forces after much lobbying from Matsushita and co agreeded to reclassify the company and thus ensured its longevity following the war. This part of National Panasonic's history is almost identical to the story of Iwamura Electric, also an Osaka based company.Golden has altered the birthdates, the chairman is born in 1890 rather than 1894 and married in 1912 rather than 1915.The other interesting fact about Matsushita is that he had a child by his mistress a widely known fact about which little is written. On this particular issue I am unable to comment on whether the mistress was a geisha and later lived in New York. Perhaps I should do some asking around.For those of you in doubt about the parallels between the Chairman of Iwamura Electric and Matsushita Konosuke of Matsushita Electric Industries I suggest you read John Kotter's book &quot;Matsushita Leadership&quot; and see for yourselves.None of this detracts from Arthur Golden's novel which as I stated above is an excellent account of a subject about which little is known. I would i! nvite the author to elaborate on his use of real figures in his novel and open up the story to readers who are not as familiar with Japan as I am."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think that &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is highly overrated. If you want to write a novel, write a novel, but don't try to pass it off as a memoir. Suggesting that this is actually a memoir is a disservice to the reading audience. I was particularly irritated that Golden inclued a &quot;translator's note.&quot; That just pushes the memoir idea too far! To suggest that the book is a memoir is to suggest that the reader is given unrestricted access to the perspective and insights of a Geisha. However, because this is a novel, the reader hears only Golden's voice! I think that the publisher and author have both tried to cash in on the popularity of memoirs to promote this book. To do so diminishes the importance of true memoirs that are on the market."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book detailing the life and times of a young girl's journey through childhood (abruptly ended) and then into years of difficult training to become a successful geisha. Being told in the first person by Sayuri herself leads the reader into the fascinating world of Japanese culture. It's possible that I found this exceptionally well written and researched since I have been living in Japan for almost six years now;however, I have never been to Kyoto and could easily picture each village in my mind. I was amazed to some degree to learn this novel was written by a man because it was so detailed and beautifully worded! I don't mean that to sound sexist...you'll just have to read it to understand what I mean!

The author sets up some interesting relationships, but ultimately disappoints. I had two main problems with the book. First, the author does an excellent job of making the reader hate Hatsumomo because of the way she treats Chiyo over the years. You long to have her get her just desserts, and she does, but it's done in such a way it leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Where was the big climax scene between her and Chiyo? The author leads us up to it and it never happens. Second, Chiyo does something at the end of the book that's revolting, and we're supposed to believe this sacrificial act is what ended up giving her what she wanted all along. I didn't believe the motivation, nor did I believe it would work. It made me think the author didn't know how to get Chiyo to achieve her big aim in life. All in all, it was an interesting book, but it wasn't one I couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden\`s \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is an intriguing insider's look at a world we Westerners have only (and crudely) made assumptions about. Golden masks himself as an NYU Japanese history professor whom the now-elderly geisha, Sayuri, has chosen to tell of her long, successful career as one of the last and most-renowned geisha of the 20th century. As such, the narrative is told in first person, this voice being that of a sensitive woman who has lived a harrowing orphan's life during the momentous decades before and during WW II in the geisha village of Gion. Momentous global events are muffled and distant in her highly stylized and ritualistic existence.The rich detail, varied characters (clients and rival geisha,) chronological sweep of time and place, plus hidden schemes and revelations all combine masterfully to make this an ideal \\"lose-yourself-in\\" read. It became my haven when 9/11 was casting its darkest cloud over us all. Pick it up to be swept away."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I admit I was caught in the web spun by the author and was very curious to know how the story of Sayuri turned out. But I didn't like the writing style at all. It was too mature for a young girl (in the beginning) and too pedantic later on. Also the fact that she remembered every exquisite kimono she saw, (in detail) since she was 9 years old is quite incredible.I also did not like the very heavy use of metaphors which seem to try too hard to be Japanese. I do not appreciate so much help in thinking and making my own connections.Despite these shortcomings, the story itself is very gripping because it opens the fascinating inside world of geishas. The very existence of geishas however, is a deplorable statement about the way women are viewed and treated in Japan, but that is besides the point.Overall, it is a good book and worth reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Sorry to say BUT this book is a poor imitation of Jane Austen and MM Kaye -- a very poor imitation. I do not think that GOlden really understands why Austen/Kaye are such important writers nor their characters development within the book. Instead his attempt is lacking in so many respects that I found the book disappointing.BUT it's an accurate portrayal of Shintoist philosophy and the life of a geisha. It on this level that I found the book compelling; unfortunately our Memoirist is a poorly drawn character who never manages to be more than a caricuture.The book itself is better in the first part (prior to WWII) than the second.

I love both historical novels and intimate looks at foreign cultures, and Golden's first novel fit both bills.

In fact, it made me want to read the book, so I did. And I enjoyed the book so much better.The book filled in some confusing blanks for me about traditions and origins. It also put a more literary poetic sense to the whole story. The movie was poetic too, but in a visual sense. It's not worse, it's just different.I write my review this way because after I read the book, I recommended it to a conservative Christian friend. She said, \\"I saw the movie and I don't want to read a book about that.\\" I thought about that statement for a while, and I realized there is some truth to that. There is some graphic material. And yet it is not written to shock; it's just the truth, written simply, but not sickeningly. And those few parts are not the point of the book. Therefore, if your objection is similar to my friend's, know that it's just the truth, and no more. Though the book is fiction, it was the result of years of research. These stories and situations did happen to people.This is a story of a journey of a girl, a lifestyle, a city, and a people.

While the basic story is relatively simple yet the detail of the time and place are fascinating. I am in awe of the ability of some guy from Brookline, Massachusetts to write such incredible detail. I have not heard how this book was received in Japan, no doubt many inaccuracies were noted but this does not reduce the achievement of Arthur Golden in transporting his readers into this Japanese sub culture of Geisha in the twenties and thirties.Most of the characters of Memoirs of a Geisha were described in great detail on the appearance side yet remained largely cardboard like, we have the \\"beautiful & hateful geisha Hatsumomo\\", the \\"beautiful & good geisha Mameha\\", the \\"greedy Mother\\" the consistently wonderful Chairman. One or two characters such as Nobu San and Pumpkin were developed beyond a simple goodies and badies. Even Sayuri the central character remains trapped in traditions & fear and mostly reliving one instance of pre-adolescent infatuation.

As a young girl, Chikyo faces many obstacles, from betrayal of trust and unthinkable spiteful tricks from Hatsumomo. As she does take the process of becoming a geisha, with the assistance of her older sister [Mameha], her love for any man is looked upon as an illusion. I remember clearly when Mameha tells Sayuri that they dodn't choose to become geisha; they are force to become geisha. As the story takes its course, friendship and trust is lost for love. Betrayal seems so vivid. A geisha's love was abstract. It is as if love is looked down upon. Geisha are just there to entertain and please. Sayuri's memoirs reflect the most beautiful thoughts of a geisha. Golden depicts every thing as if it were surreal but lyrical in the most astonishing ways."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I picked this book up at the aiport hoping it would amuse me for my four hour flight. Little did I know it would take me on a journey far beyond my original destination, to a world I could never have imagined and won't soon forget. I so enjoyed the book that I bought it on tape so I could play it for my mother on a cross country drive. I was extremely disappointed that the tape cut much of the important details of the story and the subtle prose that made the characters come to life. Read it, don't listen to it, it is a remarkable trip!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book. An absorbing story outlining the life of a young girl groomed for a life of servitude. A dramatic account of her struggle to survive and succeed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the very first page it was difficult for me to believe that this book was fiction. I could almost hear Sayuri speak! I wanted so much to read for endless hours and was thrilled. I am anxious to read the next book authored by Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The best way to describe this book is to say that it ran out of steam toward the end. Golden's research on the life of geisha is terrific. But after the book shifts into post WW II Japan, it tails off. Sayuri was delightful when we meet her and watched her grow up, but then she sort of melted into a character with no soul toward the end. Still, a fine read for those who want to see the world of geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I really enjoyed the book as it had an unbelievable amount of information about the life of a geisha and the training that is needed to develop the young girls. It was so real that at the end of the story I still was wondering if it were a true story or not. The love story and the triangles that made up the novel could have been trashed as it was a little too 'soap opera' for me. All in all a very good book to educate those who thought geishas were &quot;hookers&quot;."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't wait to receive this book but after reading fifty pages or so found I was disappointed. I was hoping to learn more about the geisha culture than was presented. I tried to get involved with Sayuri and the other characters but they were too shallowly portrayed to generate much interest. I'm not a fan of romance novels and felt this was more in that category than general literature. All in all, even though I finished the book, I kept feeling it could have been so much better. Perhaps it would have been a more effective novel if the format had been other than that of &quot;as told to.&quot;"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I didn't expext to be drawn into a man;s story of a geisha. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Well, I'd like to thank the author for doing all of the historical research that I would have had to do if I wanted to learn about the lifestyle of a geisha. I learned quite a bit.But when I got past the history, there was nothing else there. I could never emotionally engage with the characters. I didn't really care what happened to them (and only stuck with the book because I was curious about Japan during World War II)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Geisha is a souped up romance that carried me along because I enjoyed reading about a culture that was all new to me. The writing was competent and the use of the geisha as narrator kept the cultural info from sticking out like a sore thumb as it would have in an actual novel instead of a novel-memoir. But to compare it with its silly-sweet metaphors to Underworld is like comparing a lightning bug to lightning. But I digress. I enjoyed Geisha but was waiting for the main character to outgrow her infatuation with the Chairman and get out of that narrow world. Oh, well. Another problem with this book is that all the awful things that happen to geisha are presented without any outside viewpoint to note that the life was oppressive, dangerous and male chauvinistic. What about the wives of all those men who spend their evenings getting drunk at tea houses? END"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I wish I could have liked this book as much as others here. It just never drew me into the story, although I felt the prose was rhythmic and the viewpoint decidedly female.Maybe I'm just not interested enough in Asian culture to savor the long story.However, the book is certainly impressive for a first effort, no matter the subject."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put the book down and stayed up all night to finish this masterpiece. I felt terribly sad at the end at the thought that Nitta Sayuri is a fictional character. Golden portrayed her life so vividly that it's hard for me to imagine her stories and experiences are not true. The only complaint that I have is that the ending seemed a bit rushed and abrupt. Perhaps I just didn't want the story to end."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Not only is this book a fabulous story, it is full of educational information. As most westerners, I'm sure, do, I always thought a Geisha was a prostitute. This book cleared that up fast! It also taught a lot of Japanese customs and history. The story itself was captivating and I didn't want it to end. The only loose end that I wish they had tied up, was with regards to her sister."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and watching the road Sayuri's life took. It was beautifully written and did wrap me up completely in the world of Gion. It was very contradictory of Golden, however, to so eloquently talk about fate and the hard life of a geisha and then give us such a slapped-on... ending. Sayuri learns as she grows up that the life of a geisha is to be full of disappointments and few choices of her own...Golden needn't have added such a glamorous ending, Hollywood will do it for him when the movie comes out!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A lovely, complex, and engaging tale which was never dense or dull and often extremely moving. Though Golden's specialty is the small details in each scene, they come together to tell a story whose momentum is powerful; I found this hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I saw the book in an ad and knew at once I had to get it. I finally did and read half the book in one day. The Asian culture is a subject that interests me and Memoirs of a Geisha is a perfect example. I was caught up in Sayuri's life, and I kept wanting to turn the pages just to see how it would unravel. I think that Arthur Golden has accomplished a great feat in creating this masterpiece...a portrait of a geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Interesting characters and a memorable love story. Very informative as to culture and life of geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the first book I have thoroughly enjoyed in a long time. As soon as I finished the last page, I started it all over again and enjoyed every word of it just as if I were reading it for the first time. Arthur Golden writes a beautiful, poetic sentence that touches you to the core. His research of the art of the geisha gave me an insight to the life of a geisha which I had never before ever been curious about. This book has me rummaging through all my old copies of National Geographic for mention of geisha. I've also been burning all the search engines of the Internet to find out all I can about geisha and their lives. I've never read Authur Golden before, but you can bet I'll be looking out for more of his books."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I not only consider myself a femanist, but I also consider myself to be fiercly independent. I was not sure how I could enjoy a book about a woman whose role in life is to entertain men. I LOVED it. Its one of the few books that when my eyes became too weary to read and was forced to put the book down, my mind wandered back to the characters. I can't think of the last time I thought about any character unless I was actually reading the pages. I also learned many things from this book. The most important lesson was about the role of the Geisha. I now belive they were not necessarily submissive/subservent to men. Sayuri was often in control - not controlled. Best book I've read in a long time!!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A real page turner. As an old timer living in Japan who thought he knew everything, I was surprised to be enlighted about so many facets of Japanese culture that I had never taken note of. Absolutely lyrical in its prose, it takes you away to another time and place every time you open it. Must read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book to be totally engrossing. I cared about the characters, and was fascinated by the life of the geisha. But most importantly, to me anyway, was how the author did not take the low road, or sputter out in the end, as so many authors do.How many times have I read a book, to become involved with the story, the character, the events taking place only to have the author seemingly run out of energy or ideas and simply end the story the easiest way out? I appreciated the way the Mr. Golden followed through with his ideas, thoughts and characters, and allowed them to find a satisfying conclusion.Also, I had to keep reminding myself that a man wrote this book....so few seem to be able to portray women in any kind of realistic way."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A truly enjoyable story. I delighted in the cultural history and geisha tradition presented in this book. Fascinating experiences throughout. I was sorry to reach the conclusion."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is a fascinating tale of Japanese culture that little is really known by most. Once I started reading, I was unable to put it down until the last page was read. I have always been in awe of how the Japanese culture views the simplest things, especially nature. I learned much more that I expected to learn from a novel. It is a well written book and the author is to be commended for his work!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Even tho I knew going into the story it was fictional, by the end I was asking myself the question 'If I go to New York will I see her on a street corner?' - that's how involved I became in the story. I thought it was a wonderful 'read' and I have suggested to everyone I know who enjoys a good story to read it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was lucky enough to hear Arthur Golden read from his book, and his melodic soothing voice let me know that this book would be a lot more than it seemed. When I finally started reading it, I couldn't put it down. As an Asian Studies minor with a profound interest in Japan, I found this novel both historically accurate and a good read. When I finished reading the book, I searched for anything else to read so that I wouldn't be finished so soon, I even read the note on typescript. I was profoundly saddened by reaching the end of the book, yet my faith in humanity was redeemed by knowing that everything happens for a reason, which is the point stressed in the novel. Best book I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is rare for an author to bring us so completely into another culture and time, but Mr. Golden has done it this time. *Memoirs* brings you completely into the life of a nine-year-old Japanese ophan sold into a foreign world of her own -- the upper-class Gion Geisha District of Kyoto. The multiple culture shocks of class and urbanity that little Chiyo experiences as she transforms into the elegant geisha named Sayuri bridges the culture gap that an American experiences in reading about the artisans skilled in music and conversation. Warning -- this book can take up a lot of time -- don't open it unless you are ready to finish the 430+ pages soon."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought the book was well written, informative and interesting. But then it changed tone at the end and turned into an unbelievable romance novel! It didn't flow. Could it have been edited to appeal to the masses?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This text of Memoirs of a Geisha is as nicely paced as the measured stroll of a geisha. It moves in smoothly flowing rhythms that seem never to let up. Beyond the pleasures of the read, though, is the sheer excitement of learning about a culture so mysterious to westerners. This is not an &quot;exciting&quot; book, in the sense of a thrill-a-second, but it is truly exciting in the deepest sense of engaging ones head and heart. I found myself reading page after page and only stopping when absolutely necessary. I understand Golden spent ten years working on this novel, and he did not waste a single moment."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book certainly weaves a rich and captivating tapestry of Geishas' lives. The book should have been more adequately named as &quot;Everyday life of a Geisha&quot;. I certainly learned a lot about the geishas' job descriptions and their roles and responsibilities. However, I finished the book without learning more than just the names of the characters in the novel. The ending is especially trite. You are not going to find out why the Sajuri's chairman is smitten by Sajuri, because the author is more interested in detailing the Geisha rituals than in writing a memoir."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"a VERY satisfying read. The story held my attention, and some of the cultural details (such as Geisha superstitions about having a spark struck on them before going out for the evening) were delicious! And, best of all, the story has a wonderful twist at the end!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Entertaining and rings true. Golden has a great eye for detail and keeps the plot moving briskly. Very absorbing. I thought the ending was a tad gift-wrapped, but never mind - the book is a nice find."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to admit that I found the beginning a little slow, but after the first couple of chapters, I was hooked. I found myself making time to read even a couple chapters a day. The story flows very nicely and the descriptions make you feel like you're part of the story. Amazingly, this wasn't even written by a Japanese geisha, but by a Caucasian male."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I absolutely loved this book. The characters were so interesting and the story was just as compelling. I had no idea how the book would end and was totally surprised. My mother read it and recommended I read it - I've now told anyone I can think of to read it. All descriptions were realistic, beautiful, and easy to imagine."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a very worthwhile novel to read. Full of passion and longing, torment and bitterness, you feel as if the narrator and protagonist, Sayuri, were relating her story directly to you in the flesh. The novel takes you on a journey through a world where appearance and manner is everything and where love is shunned. It's really quite interesting. Not only is it very enjoyable but it will also expand your cultural horizons. Most people who read this book will have a hard time putting it down the first time. The language is very lyrical and easy to understand but at the same time very poetic. Therefore, when you are ready for your next book, choose this bestseller novel which will do everything but disappoint you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Found it to be a riveting piece but would like to have more of knowledge of the credibility and understanding of the the author before I rave. How real is it/he? Did he earn this intimacy?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought that Japanese culture and that of the geisha was captured in an amazing manner. I was impressed with the way the author explained the various traditions and practices of the geisha. The author does this in a way that captures Sayuri's personality ingeniously."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A richly detailed, well written, but ultimately pointless &quot;memoir.&quot; The intricacies of a geisha's life are interesting and give this novel whatever uniqueness it has, but there is little plot to speak of. In the final analysis, it seems not much more than an exotic Harlequin romance."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I feel ashamed to admit this, but I bought this book for two reasons. 1) The Cover - It's not the same as pictured above. I wont even begin to try and describe it for fear of doing it an injustice, but I assure you it was beautiful. 2) Madonna was raving about it an interview. However I'm glad I was swayed by those superficial stimuli. The story had me hooked from beginning to end. I lost all track of time. It was an educational and emotive journey through the world of a geisha. I've just read it for a second time and it was just as powerful and entrancing as the first time!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I felt transported to a different life that could never be imagined. It was magical and tragic! To be treated so royally and so poorly all at the same time is amazing. I found this a book hard to put down, always wanting to know what would happen next. I read it in a few days. It was pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a beautifully written and highly imaginative novel. But is it a translation, as averred by &quot;Professor Jakob Haarhuis, Arnold Rusoff Professor of Japanese History, New York University&quot;? Or is the so-called translator a fiction also? Can someone please answer my question? Thank you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I saw the title I had some misgivings about this book which were happily unfounded. The story was both absorbing and extremely convincing. The only problem I had with the book was the endless similies the heroine utters. They were a little annoying. But this minor quip aside, reading &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; was a wonderful experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book really gets you to feel the way the geisha-world used to work. It is amazing how the author can decribe a woman's feelings so well, without sticking to the clich&eacute;s men seem to share about women. Even if you're not interested in the Japanese way of life, this book is an absolute must."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found this book really intrudging and well written in many ascpect... For all you know, that a Geisha life could be so much more of suffering hidden under the cloak of white powder. Author Goden really gave us an experience, alway meant for to tell the world about the most reknown artist around.A splendid surround!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"My mother bought this book and lent it to me, knowing full well of my obsession on Japanese traditional culture and pop-culture... after starting &quot;Memiors of a Geisha&quot;, I couldn't put it down, and finished it in less then a day. The storytelling is remarkable, and the events so detailed, without being heavy... It's almost impossible to believe that the story isn't being told by Sayuri, but by a male author... I recommend this book to all who love the Japanese culture, or just wonderful fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although this book will probably not be remembered for knock-your-socks-off writing, it was a fantastic story which captivated me until the end.

What upset me about this book was that it had to end ..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Geisha...such a strange word rolling off the tips of my tongue, intrigued me to buy this book, and obviously, I was not dissapointed. I kept wondering whether or not this book was a fiction or not, the cat-fights, the battles for men, and lovers. The ending was beautiful, you just gotta find out what happens to this beauty of a Geisha. Buy this BOOK! You won't regret it, this is one of those books you'll be pulling off of your bookshelve quite frequently to read every once in a while."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was gripping. However, it draws the reader into such a state of deadly fascination that at the end of the book, one feels terribly melancholic, sad and lost in wonder. It is a perfectly well-written book, but doesn't make one feel enlightened, satisfied or happy after putting it down. The success of the author works against him; read it only if you are prepared to emerge strained, exhausted and feeling lost after putting it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From several friends I heard that reading this book was necessary for both the betterment of me and my offspring. O-V-E-R R-A-T-E-D! I'll use a horse racing analogy for this book. Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautiful horse to look at with the capable Arthur Golden as its jockey. Memoirs is the horse that I received a &quot;tip&quot; on. This was the horse that couldn't lose. Based on this &quot;tip&quot; I bet $25.00 on this horse to win, place, or show. It did all three. It won a place at the glue show! Memoirs was fast out of the gate with images flying across my mind like furious stallions galloping around a race track. Unfortunately, Memoirs never made it out of the first turn. The book quickly became boring. Instead of finishing the race it seems as though it started walking backwards. It was a lot like reading this review; entertaining at first but leaves you wondering....where's the rest?"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was undoubtedly the best I've read this year. I found myself immersed in it and carried it everywhere I went. Engaging story and thourough character development made it seem real. I had to keep reminding myself it was fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The world described in Geisha is fascinating, largely because so little is generally known about it. However, what we are left with at the end is a fairly superficial look at it and the people in it. The character development that could have made it a lasting work of writing, is so thin as to render it little more than an extended &quot;TV show&quot; experience."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you're looking for a fluffy romance novel, this is a good book for you: there's even the added benefit of feeling you're getting educated in another culture. The plot moves quickly and the story is absorbing.If, however, you're looking for good literature, I have to say that Geisha falls very short. Mr. Golden's prose is awkward and cliched. His style is to pummel you with one cliched metaphor after another. In fact, if you consider yourself a connoisseur of good prose, you might have a hard time making it through the story.Overall, fun story, miserable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I felt like I was there with Sayuri the whole time. I could feel her pain. What an amazing woman written about by a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to agree with many reviewers that the ending of this book was a major disappointment. For about 90% of this amazing detail-rich read I was completely engrossed - but the end was a cop-out and all &quot;wrong&quot;. I really believe the author rushed the ending and was thinking of movie rights. This is the biggest shame as without the major flaw of the ending this could have been a classic piece of literature. As it stands I felt cheated."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Never has a book caused me to suspend my daily routines such as this book has. Once into the book, I had to take a vacation day from work to continue through the saga. I often felt as if Sayuri were dictating her memoirs directly to me. This book renewed my thought that we all must remember where we have come from, inorder to get where we are destined to go."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Everything in this book was great!

Why should people be so amazed that a man can actually write a woman's character?The implausibility of this well-written, but for me, finally unfulfilling book, is that no geisha would ever even think of spilling her secrets out to anyone. That's what surprises me, since the author is obviously extremely well-versed in Japanese and Japanese culture.It does not rank up there in my list with the great novels of recent memory. Read Delillo's &quot;Underworld&quot; to find masterful modern writing at its best."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"read this book over a year ago and I am still recomending it to friends. A very informative book which helps one realize the demands and eccentricites of different cultures. Golden achieves his goal of being &quot;the young geisha&quot; with amazing acuity!

However, the characters are pretty one-dimensional."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"In &quot;Memoirs...,&quot; Mr. Golden relates the life story of a girl who becomes a woman in the male-dominated society of early century Japan, where a woman is valued for her beauty, virginity, submissiveness to men, and often feigned innocence. Sayuri, the heroine of the story, is sold by her father to a geisha house, while her less attractive sister is sold to a prostitute house. Sayuri believes that she has only one path to survival: to become a successful geisha, one who sells her virginity to the highest bidder and attracts men who will pay for her sustenance to have a long-term, sexual relationship with her. &quot;Memoirs...&quot; raises interesting questions that aren't answered in the book: Did Sayuri have other choices for survival besides becoming a geisha? How would Sayuri as a modern woman view her life as a geisha: as one to be celebrated or ashamed of? Overall, I recommend this book for its historical memoir of the life of a geisha, although it doesn't address some of the modern issues that are interesting in understanding women of Japan today."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"'Memoirs of a Geisha' is a fascinating look into the Japanese Geisha culture during the years leading up to and immediately following World War II. The book follows the life of Sayuri from the time she is nine years old and enters the highly-competitive world of the Geisha. It kept me reading into the wee hours. I was a little disappointed in the Danielle Steele type ending, but other than that, it was a magnificent book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautifully written. Emotionally sensitive. Humor, tears, tender fears and blue wishes. Sounds almost as if Mr Golden is accessing a previous lifetime.

It's magical, it astounds me!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I spent two days reading this book and an average of 3 hours sleeping during that time.

The author brought these characters out so dramatically that i will never forget them."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a high school student who has become enamored with this book.

It was written beautifully, kept me interested the entire time. Hope to read more books by Arthur Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There was so much hype surrounding this book that I almost didn't read it, being afraid MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA would be worse than I expected. Surprisingly this book did not let me down, it was literally lyrical, and I mean it. A gaze into the cultures of early 20th century Japan."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It is hard to express in the same simple tone the magnificence of this book. Golden has captured a culture I think I know well better than anyone since Clavell's Shogun, Murasaki or Reischauer. However, he has done this without overt drama, ploys, or other distractions. Sayuri's single line of narrative tells us more through its plainness, in the best sense of the word, than any number of dramatized tales. For his courage to distill the story to this single brush stroke across a wonderful piece of rice paper, Golden deserves not only our praise but also our respect. In the end, I was not sure whether I had consumed this book or it me; I was emotionally overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"So many people from so many walks of life rhapsodized about this book that I'm afraid it was overhyped by the time I got to it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good book. The fact that this book was written, not by an Asian woman as it pretends to be, but by a white man is astonishing. His knowledge of Asian culture and scholarship will make you feel as though you've been to Japan. I think I may have to agree with the other reviewers who said that the books sense of Asian reserve may be what kept it from being a deeply emotional ead."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book first caught my attention when I saw a young Asian woman reading it on the subway. That same evening I went a a friend's apartment and saw the book on her shelf. When I told her I had just seen someone reading it on the train, she said, &quot;That's it! It's a perfect subway read! A mixture of Sideny Sheldon and history books&quot; I took the book and didn't think much of it. Sidney Sheldon is not among my favorite writers and I am by no means an expert in Japanese culture. What a surprise! My subway read turned out to be much more intriguing and fascinating than I could have ever thought. The bad news is that I'll be done with the book in 4 days and will have to look for another book to read on my way to work! Stayed up until 3 AM last night because I couldn't put this book down. Brought it to the office, so I can read another chapter whenever I get a chance. Have already recommended Memoirs of a Geisha to most of my friends! Beautifully written, easy to read! Hard to believe it's fiction!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Golden does a good job introducing us to the world of the geisha with this &quot;page turning&quot; novel. However, the exoticism of the geisha proves to be more interesting than the characters he's created. I think what attracts us to this book is the discovery of the &quot;hidden&quot; world of the geisha that is forbidden to most Westerners (just try taking a picture of a real geisha in Gion!) Sure, the narrator is an interesting girl, but her life is ultimately a tale of success piled upon success. I would have liked to have heard the book from the point of view of Pumpkin, perhaps, or one of the less-successful geisha. What disturbs me is that it seems somehow wrong to depict the geisha life in the fairy-tale like manner Golden has done, when it seems (by his own account) that a geisha's dreams rarely came true. This leaves us with a false impression of reality and does little to clarify what being a geisha actually meant. Of course, if one is interested in just a good story, then my criticism can be put aside. As everyone knows, this is an excellent tale, but it is just a tale."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden delivers a well researched readable first novel astounding in how well he captures the narative of a japanese woman.That said, the phenomon that is this novel is hard to understand. While the character is interesting, she is far less so than the environment she inhabits. What makes the book worth while is not the main character but the way Golden introduces us to a world that had vannished in fire and smoke, leaving little more than a shadow of its former self.For all of that praise, Golden too often makes the mistake of many first novelists by falling into tired cliche' and over used plot devices. It seems when ever he finds himself stuck, he falls back on a sort of Jackie Collins coincidence to keep the story moving. That is unfortunate, because it detracts greatly from what would have other wise been an extraordinary novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm not a fan of useless verbosity unless the prose shines so brightly I wanna keep reading it. Golden shining brightly, I like the metaphor, but it just doesn't apply.In this text, bulging over at 400+ pages, Golden begins by creating a gorgeous picture of Sayuri and her life. I give him this. But the guy keeps wanting to paint -- it's like Da Vinci keeping his hands all over Mona Lisa. Why? Golden isn't even close to being a master wordsmith to begin with, and verbosity and a love affair with his own words makes the latter parts of the text even worse.Plus, the ending is simply a stab in the back to those who followed the characters throughout the pages. Golden apparently reached a point where he tired of the story, and fast-forwarded Sayuri 50 years in five pages.Memoirs isn't without merit. As I say, the beginning is drawn with flair and gives hope for an engrossing read. But trim and tone, man...Your girl has gotten flabby."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Es sumamente interesante c&oacute;mo el autor utiliza un personaje como veh&iacute;culo para entrevistar a la protagonista, creando una atm&oacute;sfera de reportaje cuando en realidad todo es ficci&oacute;n. La historia es simplemente bella y adictiva. Si acaso se desea saber si se tiene un genuino gusto por la lectura, ESTE es el libro que te har&aacute; un aficionado constante de este gran pasatiempo."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There's no way I'm going to recommend this to anyone I know. Golden couldn't seem to decide between writing a travelogue or a cheesy novel and ended up failing at both. He's got a few moments of smart dialogue or interesting factlets (the old lady's chicken-neck thing...eww) but those only seem to highlight the rest of the book's shortcomings (like the thin plot and the pathetic, one-dimensional characters). The highest praise I can give is that it's a decent time-killer and I wouldn't smack it out of someone's hands if I saw them reading it. As for me, I'm going to try to forget I ever saw it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The information was fascinating but the groaners!

Like the hummingbird dipping at the nectar of a beautifully blooming flower...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought this book was trite, contrived, and poorly written. Even though I am not very acquainted with things Japanese, it smelled false and exploitative to me.I realize that it's difficult to &quot;novelize&quot; a cultural tradition--especially when it's targeted to readers outside of the native culture--but I think the author used every Western convention to make this book appeal, and therefore it suffers from a romance novel-type whitewash that, in the end, just doesn't ring true.Read this if you want some mind candy. It works on that level. As something that might provide insight on Geisha history, it's pretty fishy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"...those are just a few words that I would use to describe Memoirs of a Geisha. The narration is stunning, and the character of Sakamoto Chiyo/Sayuri Nitta completely believable. I couldn't believe that this was a work of fiction written by an American man.The writing draws you in; once you pick up the book, you literally cannot put it down. But when you're done, it feels like everything was over too quickly; the last few chapters and the ending definitely could have been longer; it also wasn't the way I would have liked it to end, but that's life, I guess. Besides, critics of the book have made that a major point, and I won't go into it. If you want criticism, read another review; this one gives only praise for Memoirs.The plot is engaging and interesting, and the details more so; it interested me enough in geisha to buy Liza Dalby's book, Geisha, and to recommend the book to all of my friends.Sayuri's life is interesting; characterization is good. The writing is also excellent, and very descriptive; by the time you're done, it feels as if you've met Sayuri. The novel is now one of my favorites, and I heartily recommend it. Buy it now!Also recommended: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Have you noticed how many of the readers reviewing this book compared the story to &quot;Cinderella,&quot; and how many complained about the author's overuse of metaphors?Gosh, and there's a character named &quot;Pumpkin&quot;! And the evil woman with whom Sayuri goes to live is her &quot;[step]mother,&quot; complete with some wicked stepsister types hanging around! And Sayuri's big crush, who &quot;rescues&quot; her, is called &quot;[Prince]Chairman&quot;! How many more can YOU find! Mr. Golden, your overall metaphor was painfully obvious enough without such &quot;clever&quot; clues.It is just appalling to realize we live in a world where so many people love a book like this. But I guess it shouldn't be a surprise -- look how many Harlequin romances sell. I wish these women who adore this romaticized junk about submissive, helpless women would give really good books -- including well-written romantic fiction, if that's what you like; there's nothing wrong with that! -- a chance."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"i went into reading this book apprehencious because i didnt know if i would understand it or be interested.

He excells in paying attention to the details. Damm good love story as well!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Along with the other virtues everyone has mentioned, I must add this is a very witty novel with some of the humor rendered in a deadpan, ironic tone.

This is a time-travel tale."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I found that the writing in this book to be lacking. The author tries to pull off some descriptions and imagery seen through the Oriental eye, but fails: there were too many cliches. He should seriously take some lessons from Amy Tan, who is truly a master of this art. I felt that the author could have included more Japanese terms to make the novel a little bit more authentic (again, Amy Tan does this so well!). Also, this novel went back and forth from being a soap opera to a documentary...this just doesn't work. The author doesn't do a good job of converting his research into fiction. It seemed like that in order to make it seem authentic, he took the research, pasted it on to paper and called it a novel. A little more editing would've been useful...Positively, I learned a lot from this research, even though it wasn't well presented. I'm looking forward to watching the movie..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book conjures up a vanished world, when rituals are performed daily and elaborate costumes worn. When men in Western suits talked to white-faced apprentice geishas, and kimono can earn a girl her independence. The protagonist is a strong-willed person, aided by a cunning and beautiful senior geisha who is adept at subtlety and tiny tricks which these artisans employ everyday to help them ascend to the top of their trade. This book is a fascinating insight into an extinct existence, and all the intricate details of old Gion is recreated lovingly and with much authenticity. Absolutely riveting, charming, piquant and alluring."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was the most interesting and enjoyable novel I have read this year. I am looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book takes you to a time and place that is as far away as Asia itself.Yet somehow it is familiar.Human nature ties us all together and this is what makes you love the book. To the author I say only, Domo Arrigato."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Right after I finished reading this book, I learned that Steven Spielberg would be directing the movie. The prospect of seeing the Geishas' world brought to life by this director in particular is one I greatly anticipate. This bittersweet story, along with the sumptous descriptions of people, places, and clothing make this novel ripe for translation into the visual medium. I urge everyone to read this addictive novel before the academy awards are won."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a truly captivating book - Golden obviously was thorough in both his research and also the Japanese use of language. The descriptions in the book really give us insight into both pre-war Japan and also a different cultural mindset. Although Amy Tan writes about the Chinese and Chinese-American culture, this book reminded me a bit of her work, as I had the same sense of learning about a woman's role in Asian culture. The main flaw with this book is the trite ending - the love of her life, which is someone she met in passing as a girl, is the least developed character and unworthy of Sayuri. The novel deserved a less story-book ending, after such a realistic portrayal of the Geisha lifestyle."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story fascinated me, especially the portions concerned with the training and rituals of the geisha world. It's a very involved society, with intricate rules for etiquette. The conflict between Sayuri and her rival keeps the reader immersed in the story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was such a great book! I don't know if this is really how geishas lived, but it is a wonderful story. I felt like I was a geisha myself, going through all the rituals and training. It is hard to believe that this book was written by a man because he seems to get into the inner pysche of women. I was sorry when I finished because I just kept wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"At first when i saw how thick the book was i felt it would be a long and arduous read. Suprising after the first couple of pages it sorta pulled me in. I was hooked. I was taken into the geisha world. Behind the scenes of beauty and the mystery that geishas have. I was shown that geishas are bound like the japanese courtesans and were completly dependent on men to buy them their freedom.The main character(chiyo) started life in a small fishing village called Yoroido. Her family was poor. Her father was very old and her mother was soon to die. Chiyo was nine at the time when she and her sister were sold into a sort of slavery but at two different places. I won't say where her sister was sold for that may ruin it for some people. Chiyo must learn to be a geisha under the cruel hand of her new house's income, a popular geisha named Hatsumomo. It is a diffiult path for her and in some ways she ruins it but she makes it. During the war the geisha districts struggle and it shows you a whole new kind of great depression. So cry with chiyo when she crys and laugh when she laughs. I remember blushing greatly and smiling when she had her first custumer.This book shows that geishas do not sell their body like the great courtesans of japan's past, but they sell their arts. This is a book you want to read again and again.It is a true work of art that you cant miss. So do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I picked up this novel because I saw a trailer to the movie and I thought the movie looked interesting and was thereby convinced the book was worth the read.This book is compelling in many ways but I think the thing that makes it most compelling is somehow Golden manages to make the voice of the character feel translated without making it an overbearing experience.He does not give rationale for each activity that Sayuri participates in because it is her life story and he is very good and just leaving it at that, an inexplicable want of the person who's story is being told.If you want a traditional, all ends tied up, everything completely satisfying, all comes together in the end type of book don't choose this one. If you're looking for a well-written fictional biography that does not attempt to be formulaic I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Simply put, I loved Memoirs. It was a beutifully told story that delves into the mysterious world of Japan's geisha culture. Once I got past the very beginning (which is a bit slow) I couldn't put the book down. I must admit that until I saw a trailor for the upcoming movie version, I had no interest in reading the book, though I had heard about it before. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed by it.Some might say that the story was a bit shallow, that it lacked any thing really powerful, but I must disagree. No, it wasn't the kind of book that leaves the reader with a whole new perspective on life but the story of Sayuri's life will leave you feeling both intrigued and slightly melancholy.I'd recommend Memoirs of a Geisha to anyone, it was an enjoyable quick-read that I think anyone could like."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I first read this book when I was in high school when I was 15 years old, and I feel in love with it. I finished the book in 2 nights, almost unable to awake for school the next morning.You follow little Chiyo from her girlhood, her innocence of course didn't last long, and that brings us to the story of Sayuri. ( I don't want to tell you more for I will not do it honor in re-telling it)It is a fablous novel bringing the reader closer and closer to all the characters in the book, you will learn to love every character, even the evil ones. You will want to learn more even when you finish. I sure felt sad when I knew I was reaching the end.I am re-reading the book again in anticipation for the movie, and the books is still great, even after so many years.

This story has many thrilling and excting parts, and I have never read a story as exciting. I found it quite strange when I took the book off the shelf at library. I picked it up and it had a picture of a japanese girl- and my head started to think. I loved japanese stuff. Why hadn't I ever heard of a Geisha? Well, I checked it out, started to read it, and couldn't put it down. I found it so cool how the author wrote it in first person through the eyes of a woman. How on earth did he manage to accomplish this so well? I am glad to have had the chance to read this. This a book that should be a classic someday. Enough said."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" was truly enjoyable. I believe that if you read the novel, with no expectations but to learn a little bit about another culture/society and its rituals, you will enjoy it. I knew nothing about Geishas and found that learning about the actual practice/art form, or purpose of the Geisha, was interesting. We see the main character from the time that she is sold, to loosing her virginity. This novel weaves a wonderful tale over several years of her life, until the end where she is symbolically and literally standing on a street in New York. Therefore, the ultimate question after reading the review of her life is \\"Was she a victim or survivor\\"? And I think that in itself was enough to make this novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think this book is overrated. Too much of the plot relies on unconvincing coincidence or chance. The narrator even starts many thoughts by declaring she doesn't know why something happened or warning that a particular event may seem unbelievable. If this occured only once or twice I could deal with it, but it occurs repeatedly... and beings to become quite annoying as the ending of the story approaches. I was even more annoyed as I read the last few pages of the book. I definitely agree with another reviewer that the ending was too \\"Hollywood\\" (the upcoming movie will probably be good though). Although I found the ending dissapointing I do believe this is generally an enjoyable read, particurlarly if you enjoy reading about other cultures."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fascinating book! If you're looking for a complete and total escape from your own reality and unlike anything you've ever read before, than Geisha is the book for you. It's one of my top 5 books ever. I wish there were more like this."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Framed as a biography but actually a work of fiction, Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written story. The story follows Sayuri's life from a small fishing village, where she lived with her family in a \\"tipsy house,\\" to Gion, a town of geishas. There, she becomes a successful geisha through the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. Many Westerners assume that geishas are like prostitutes, when actually they are more like kept women. The most successful geisha are supported by wealthy businessmen.Sayuri leads a difficult life. Other geisha, Hatsumomo in particular, view her as competition and try to thwart her rise to financial success. In spite of the challenges she faces, Sayuri realizes that she has no way to escape the life into which she was sold as a child.The intrigues and relationships of this novel are similar to a novel of manners: Sayuri survives by polishing her tea ceremony, dance, singing, and witty conversational skills. But some of the recurring images in the book are deep and strong: the scene in which Sayuri drops leaves and flower petals into a river that passes her beloved's office is a powerful metaphor for the life over which she has so little control. Golden does a wonderful job of adopting Eastern imagery for his Western audiences.But the book is worth reading for the story itself. You'll find yourself rooting for Sayuri, cursing her detractors, and celebrating her concluding success."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was a good book. It was interesting and captivating. But I think that it's very much like a play. While the characters are compelling, I didn't relate to their plight and I couldn't put myself in that situation. The Geisha of Gion: Memoirs of Mineko Iwasaki is a much better book. It's set in the 1950's to early 1980's and I think that it's more more lively than Memoirs of a Geisha. In the Geisha of Gion, the heroine shows that she's more than just a geisha. She has private thoughts and emotions and they're a lot like what you would think them to be. Innocent, yet petty. She's a strong character who doesn't let people walk all over her. But she still manages to keep your sympathy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Chiyo is just a child when her world changes forever. Her mother is dying. Her father is so overcome with grief that he feels he cannot care for Chiyo or her sister, Satsu.

She is hated by the powerful and cruel geisha that lives in her house, Hatsumomo. At every turn Hatsumomo is scheming and finding ways to ruin any chances for Chiyo to have a future as a geisha.

The house mother is furious and condemns Chiyo to a maid's life; Chiyo believes she will never be a geisha.But the fates bless Chiyo with another chance. When Hatsumomo's arch-rival, Mameha, takes an interest in Chiyo, things begin to turn around.

Like a butterfly emerging from its coccoon, Chiyo is reborn as the geisha Sayuri several years later, but her problems are far from over. Hatsumomo is actively trying to destroy her reputation in Gion. Mameha believes the only way to topple Hatsumomo is to auction on Sayuri's virginity, which is a dangerous game to play and only time will tell for Sayuri if it was the right move.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a fantastic novel. Arthur Golden deftly creates a beautiful, entertaining, and exciting novel. It is hard to imagine a male author creating such a delicate and believable female voice, but Golden does just that with Sayuri. This novel is one that stays with the reader for a long time after it have been returned to the shelf. Highly moving and spellbinding, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a must read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Easily one of my favorite books, has to be read to be appreciated. Below my review, reviewer Zack brings some interesting points to the table, some of which I agree with. But overall I find this book has great depth and provides a broad yet detailed description of the culture in which Sayuri develops. I know I will read this book again. Just like Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevski. You always find something that you missed on the first read of a great book! And it always moves you, no matter how many times you read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book got off to a rather slow start, but if you stick with it, you won't be sorry. This is an excellently written book. I never knew anything at all about geishas before reading this book. I had only ever heard the word and didn't even know what a geisha was. Through excellent story-telling, this book follows the life of Sayuri, a young girl who is sold away from her family to be trained as a geisha. I learned a lot reading this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Ideally, anyone can read this book. You have to have patience at the beginning, it can be hard to follow. It then has so many fun twist that no one could ever predict. Memoirs of a Geisha there is many different characters that are different from everyone. You really start to want to be in the book and be some of the characters at points in the book. The characters are all very strong and bold. You can see exactly how they are structured, just because of the detailed description you read. Some of the other characters you wonder why they are in there because they might seem thrown in, but in the end they are there for a reason. The books theme is basically about someone's culture and how it was. The tough struggles that one faces when put into challenging situations. Some of the emotions that stirred up people was really when the characters went through hard life struggles. Some of the struggles they had to do to survive were shocking. Then again you have to remember that's someone culture. I was extremely impressed with this book. It shows you when you read, exactly how you are supposed to read it. You read a good book, and you get a lot of cultural information. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a book to keep them interested."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Memoirs of a Geisha is the sort of story you want to savor. Some readers may have anticipated a super fast-paced book (which may have led to their disappointment), but the beauty of this story is that it takes its time, so that all of its splendor, sadness, and grace may sustain.Like the story, the main character, Sayuri, has understated charm. The story begins with her childhood (and her given name Chiyo) as she leads her ho-hum existence in a poor village in Japan. The novel progresses, of course, with her rise to becoming a Geisha. Memoirs covers nearly all of Sayuri's life, and by the last page, I really truly felt that I was THERE for the entire ride.The only disapointment about Memoirs is that it's fiction---the story was so believable, which simply recognizes the storytelling talent in author Golden. He intertwines fiction and history expertly in Memoirs, making it a truly memorable read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It has been a really long time since I read a fiction book cover to cover so fast...I just couldn't put it down.I could relate on many occasions while some harsh &quot;truths&quot; of life were being revealed in Sayuri's story. I cried and I laughed.I'm sorry that this story came to an end for me just a few hours ago.Thank you Arthur Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha was a fiction novel, the very realistic situations and Japanese detail made it read like a non- fiction book. Memoirs of a Geisha explained the interesting life of a geisha in great detail including the different ceremonies involved with the profession. Before writing this bestseller novel, Golden interviewed one of the last geishas in Japan. Using these interviews, Golden was able to reveal the stages in becoming a geisha such as the famous tradition of becoming a \\"younger sister\\" to a more experienced geisha. Golden constantly used different Japanese terminology which emphasized the detail. Many of the Japanese terms were unfamiliar to the average reader like ekubo, which is a type of Japanese desert. Since these terms had to be defined and explained, it sometimes took away from the flow of the plot. Despite the terminology, the way Golden used metaphors and similes to describe various incidents enables the reader to imagine a vivid picture of the scene in their mind. In one scene, Golden described the face of one of Sayuri's (the main character) suitors like \\"poorly sculpted clay.\\" Along with the wonderful descriptions, Golden offered numerous different perspectives of many charachters which added to the intriguing storyline. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The Geishas' world in the early Thirthies and their hard way until they really become a famous of their kind is described in a very detailed and authetic way, so that the reader really gets to know the situation of that time. However, I found that the main-character was not well developed and you hardly get to know the real feelings of the narrator. The story told from the main-charcter's view is not the best way for the plot and the book sometimes reminded me of a cheap and trite novel, which basically is not the case. Sometimes - in the middle of the book - it was quite longwinded and it also lost it's spirit in the end, which is indeed far too romantic to be true - life is not made of this, specially not a Geisha's world. On the whole I can say that the author has done a lot of research and that the book is entertaining you during the whole weekend, but it can not be compared with really good literature."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a selection for our book review club and my personal &quot;best book of the year&quot; for 2000. It paints a haunting picture of a young, poverty-stricken girl who is sold into the geisha profession and what becomes of her.

Truly a most enjoyable and informative read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Even if you live in Japan, lives of Geishas are not commonly known. Though I could only make out a part of the exclusive culture, the book clearly visualized what I knew(from history classes &amp; TV shows! these things are hardly left in Japan). I was amazed at the emotional descriptions of Sayuri revealing the traditional Japanese way of thinking (also hardly left nowadays) both beautiful and evil."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden, author captured Sayuri's entire life as a Geisha. From the first page it was very difficult to put down and the words spun a story in my mind--- of a poor young child determined to succeed as a woman. I personally would have been honored to meet a business women like Sayuri.I am also appreciative of the book-review from the Washington Post Book World. They also gave it 5 stars which provided me confidence to purchase this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It flows and entertains with careful attention to period details. But it feels a bit like a good Hollywood production: think of Anna and the King or Titanic. Polished, enjoyable. Not an insult to your intelligence due to perfect form, yet it doesn't challenge it either and leaves a satisfying aftertaste. A good summer read.

I was lost in this book &amp; did not want to find my way out! I still have not found a book that matches the beauty of Memoirs."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"To know what a geisha's life is like---or indeed the life of any person in a culture different from our own---there are four possible categories of writing one could choose to read. First, a book by a geisha herself. This would be translated from Japanese, but would be couched in purely Japanese terms; a view from within the experience and within the culture. I don't know if any such books are available in English. Secondly, a book about geisha life by a Japanese writer who lived within the culture, but did not experience geisha life first hand. Although such books may exist in English, most of them might be parts of wider novels translated from Japanese. Thirdly, you could choose to read Liza Dalby's 'Geisha'---the examined experience of an American anthropologist who became a geisha. Though she entered the world of geisha life, she did so as an American and as one who knew her position there was not permanent. And finally, you could select a novel about geishas by a non-Japanese, a novel like this one. These four varieties of writing each offer a certain truth and a certain flavor, each unique in its way. If you find intriguing a novel about a Japanese woman in a traditional occupation, set in the 1930s and 1940s (for the most part), written by an American man in the 1990s, be sure to read this book.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA might not be the greatest novel I ever read. No. But I really enjoyed the feeling of 'an inside look', even though I knew that Golden had never been a geisha, nor was he writing from a Japanese point of view. It is his excellent effort to do so that captures me. A lot of the novel really portrays the feeling of a young girl's gradual transformation into a sophisticated geisha, her hopes, fears, and the catty rivalries that must have prevailed in such a life. The last 80-90 pages cannot sustain the steady revealing of customs and behavior that make most of the novel so interesting. We descend into a soap opera, albeit of a good class. I sympathised with the author in that he had to present a story along with his fascinating description of geisha life. Also, he was forced to choose between American dialogue that resonated with largely American readers and a more Japanese-based dialogue that would have reflected more realistically the tone of what geisha might have said. Though he decided in favor of the former, I think he made the right choice---witness the success of his novel. The story of the geisha, Sayuri, is not especially gripping; suspense is a minor element in this novel, and perhaps the ending is a little trite, but if you enjoy walking in other worlds, if you want to imagine what geisha life was really like, then I strongly recommend that you get this novel"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book had me glued from the very first page. I didn't want this book to every end. Spent a weekend doing nothing except reading this wonderful book. I recommened to anyone interested in being totaly transported into another land. Best of the year!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story of Sayuri and the lifestyle she lived drew me in and kept me wanting more...just like the art of a Geisha. I feel newly energized to read again. What inspiration."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The reviews and hype on this book were so wonderful that I picked up a copy and made my way through about 1/3 of it, until it became a slog. After that, I was so bored, I picked through the rest of it to find out 2 things - if her cherry was ever picked (yes, eww), and where she ended up (NYC).Much of the praise is about a man writing a book that takes you inside the life of a woman. &lt;sarcastic gasp&gt; Background - Arthur Golden wrote one book then threw it out and rewrote the book after interviewing Mineko Iwasaki. He spent decades on his rewrites while living off his substantial trust fund -- the guy comes from old &amp; big money -- and what for? So his hobby gets published? I ask you, why aren't we supporting a real woman writing her story? Aren't there real women out there with things to say who need publishing money to write more than he?More background - Mineko Iwasaki is in the process (Oct. 2000) of suing Arthur Golden for breach of promise. He said that he would keep her conversations with him confidential, but then entirely rewrote his book based on information she gave him, and credits her with being his inspiration. She claims people mistakenly believe that they are reading her life story, and is about to starting to work on her own book to tell the real story. I say skip the snooze Memoirs of a Geisha and wait for the real geisha to write her book, which will probably alot more interesting than Mr. Golden's."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am Japanese and I do not like Memories of Geisha much. Golden portrays our culture well, but this story really is a fairy tale and I hate its ending. He knows (studied)about Japan, but he does not really know how Japanese people really are. Considering the fact that this, after all, is an American novel, it perhaps does not matter how Japanese people think of this story. Yet, I do not accept his story, and I don't want Americans to consider it to be the truth about Geisha. My grandmother and her mother were geisha and I know the fact more than Golden does.As a fairy tale, this story is well done."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I finished this last night and still can't believe I wasn't reading an autobiography. This book had it all...exotic location, grief, unrequited love, despair, poverty, war, deceit, intrigue, wealth. I initially didn't consider the book until I realized it was a novel. Despite its title, it's not a chick book, but a compelling look at a life virtually no one in the West is aware of. Buy it, download it, borrow it, but don't start before you go to bed unless it's a weekend!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of those excellent books that thoroughly transports the modern reader into a world so very different from his or her own experiences. The amount of research and detail that the author used in crafting this single novel is almost hard to wrap your mind around.It is so very interesting, to me at least, to be exposed to such different lifestyles."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was amazing. I borrowed it from a friend of mine and I just couldn't put it down. It was an easy to follow story, lots of suspense, and drama. Even better was how the author gave insight to the artistic lifestyle of a geisha and how I really cared for and connected with the character. I even convinced my husband to read this book, and he too, enjoyed it very much. The book was 100% better than the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I adore this book. This was my second time reading it and I had forgotten how moving it is. I loved Sayuri, Mameha, Nobu and the Chairman and loved to hate Hatsumomo. The characters are all so complex and real and wonderful. I am amazed that this is written by a man, because he captures the thoughts and feelings of a woman in this time and place just exactly how I imagine they really were.Dear Arthur Golden, could you please write another book already? It has been 12 years and that is wicked ridiculous."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book is beautifully written with rich and evocative language. One can almost feel themselves in Japan, viewing the many forms of dress and make-up. This is a gift that many writers lack. Arthur Golden transports us in time and place to another world. However, I found it to be a bit lacking in certain areas of character development and for that reason I rated it a '4' instead of a '5'.The book is about a Geisha's memories of her life. Sayuri and the people she comes in contact with as she is groomed and mentored to become a Geisha serve as the center of this novel along with what it is to be a Geisha. To be a Geisha one must be able to please a man in special ways - socially, sensually, culturally.I never did find out what Sayuri was really like. The closest that the book came to me feeling like I knew her was the trauma of her mother's death and her later yearning for 'the Chairman' who becomes her obsessive love object. Perhaps that is how a Geisha is supposed to be - all learned behavior and repressed sense of self.The book is a literary page-turner. I can only imagine the research Mr. Golden spent writing this book. I highly recommend it. It provides almost everything one might want in a good book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was thrilling and quite detailed. While it may not be considered an accurate depiction in the views of a true geisha it is still quite entertaining and very well written. Hard to put down once you start reading it. The movie did not do it justice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Prior to reading this book, my understanding of a geisha's life and duties was limited to a few tidbits I'd heard over the years. My understanding was that these beautiful women were mainly trained to entertain men in high-end, private clubs in Japan. The book is entertaining, interesting and educational.The young girl's journey to become a successful geisha is filled with heartache, passion, disappointment, shock and surprise. From the very beginning, I found myself captivated by the little girl who had been forceably removed from her home and trained to become a geisha. Despite the fact that the story is basically fiction, I can't help but wonder whose life it is based upon, and what has become of the young woman. This story will not only touch your heart, it will leave you wanting to know more about the somewhat secretive world of the geisha. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Japanese culture or to those who wonder just who these women are and what their lives are all about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Having read a number of beautiful stories this summer, I became fascinated by this lovely, yet sadly provacative story of the tranquil Geisha! She came out of the saddest Yoroido village as a Buddhist family of Father and two daughters following the death of her Mother. She and Satzu were sold to a wealthy man named, Takana. She was delivered to the Home of Mother and Auntie where she was trained to become a Geisha or an \\"Artisian.\\" Her schooling included the serving of tea, dancing and playing of the typical Japanese string instruments and percussions which accompanied the dancing.Her chance meeting of the Chairman one day along the park street as she sat peacefully gazing into the waters of a fountain changed her life! This wealthy Japanese executive of the Large Kyoto conglomerate continued to interest and confound her for many years. This sadly, circuitous and finely detailed story lasts for many years as the Geisha, Sayuri, becomes famously well-known, develops into one of great love and loss. She matures into one beautifully gifted unique compassionate friend of other young Geisha girls.This consuming, dramatic narrative will live in my mind and heart for a long time. Gratefully...Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This books blew me away by all the intricate details about the geisha lifestyle that it could have passed off as a biography. Arthur Golden spent ten long years to researched everything geisha so he could give us this excellent book. Because of this book I have been completely obsessed with learning a lot more about this mysterious tradition that most people don't have a clue about. People outside of Japan, including myself, have this idealized image of what a geisha is and that is as a prostitute. Truth is they aren't. Sex may be involved but that isn't the whole point of what a geisha is and that is what I have learned from Arthur's book. I hope some day we can stop stereotyping other people's cultures and actually attempt to learn and understand what they are truly like. Perhaps this book could be a good starting point in the right direction to ending cultural stereotyping."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book! Right from the start it drew me in and held me spellbound as young Chiyo was sold to the Kyoto geisha. The meat of the novel is the early years--the time spent as a virtual slave to the mistress of the geisha house. Though she is beautiful, it is determined that Chiyo will never become a geisha. She is cunning, and her attempts to escape cost her &quot;house&quot; much. Chiyo will never be able to pay her debts.But the inspiration of a gracious businessman and the intervention of a mentor-geisha (bent on revenge toward a competitor)change Chiyo's bad fortune. The beautiful geisha, Mameha, proposes a business offer to Mother, Chiyo's housemother--a bet that Chiyo, under Mameha's tutorage will pay her debts by age 20. The greedy Mother accepts the bet and Chiyo becomes a geisha apprentice.There is a love story here as Sayuri, nee Chiyo, strives to win the affections of the kind businessman, the Chairman. The trials of war and the rebuilding of Japan nearly ruin the geisha trade, but Sayuri makes a come back, along with her country.In the beginning I feared the cultural differences would cause me to lose interest. Quite the opposite! I was fascinated with the geisha culture. I'd assumed that geisha were high-class call girls. While they did strive to be &quot;kept women&quot;, geisha were so much more. They were trained entertainers, party hostesses, and escorts. They were welcomed in businesses for the clientele they'd attract. Very rarely did they sell themselves for sex--except to their danna (their benefactor).I loved the economics of geisha: who got paid by whom, who owned what, and oddest yet, the value of kimonos. The art of dressing the geisha, the training, the discipline and obedience--it was an enlightening look at a culture I'd know nothing of. So glad I do now."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A commentator has said that this is a book that seems to stay open. It's absolutely true! I first had an interest in reading &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; because I have never read a novel about Japanese culture before, and I wanted to learn more about it from an author who had studied it in-depth. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it a few days later. The story of Sayuri's life as a geisha in Japan around the time of WWII is engrossing, fascinating, and at times disturbing.&quot;Memoirs&quot; chronicles the life of Sayuri (as narrated by her to a fictional biographer), and how she goes from rags to riches, from riches to rags, and back again to riches. The plot is truly a page-turner; Golden also writes in lush detail about every aspect of Japan's geisha culture. However, Sayuri's development throughout her life, while believable, was disheartening. Here was a woman with so much potential--she's beautiful, intelligent, insightful--and she is trained to be manipulative, deceitful, and opportunistic. Not that this is surprising, based on the environments and upbringing she experiences. It could be argued that she made the most out of her circumstances; she took the hand she was dealt and then beat the dealer at his own game. Still, the reviews that compare Golden with authors like Austen and Dickens ring hollow when you examine the progress of a David Copperfield or an Elizabeth Bennett, who rise above their circumstances and whose individual characters are refined and brought to a higher level of integrity and morality--the opposite, in my opinion, of Sayuri's.As other readers have commented, the ending was a little to &quot;neat&quot; for me. I felt betrayed by the Chairman's reaction to Sayuri's last desparate act; indeed he seemed to condone the notion that the end justifies the means--go for what you want, and break the rules of ethics if necessary. Sayuri's lowest, most contemptible moment with the Minister is rewarded with a happy ending. Now I sound now like I'm not recommending this book--I do, heartily! But be forewarned, the ultimate message of this book is one that is very lonely and spiritually devoid: rely on yourself, because God and man alike will fail you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" several months ago and was captivated by the characters and the world of the geisha. As I read, I continually forgot the fact that this novel was written by an American man. The voice of the writing truly speaks as though from the character herself, which is probably the hallmark of this book.In reading the online reviews, I am quite intrigued to learn the opinions of Japanese readers. It is here that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" might be judged most objectively. It is really not appropriate for most Americans to say whether or not the story or subject matter ring true, since in general we still have much to learn about Japanese culture. Many Japanese readers have championed this book, which stands as the best testament to Arthur Golden's work.I was highly amused by some readers who were convinced that the story was a true memoir dictated by a geisha, and then were offended to learn the story was fiction. Although the readers might not admit as much, this too tells of the authenticity of Golden's research and writing style.If there is one criticism I have of this book, it is that the story climaxes so abruptly that I barely enjoyed it. All Sayuri's yearnings, hopes and dreams come to a denouement in a handful of pages. It left me yearning for some of the earlier parts of the book, and searching for a somewhat more satisfying conclusion. Nevertheless, it did not truly detract from what is otherwise an engrossing, enchanting novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Extremely well-written, this is a tale of the making of a country girl into a powerful geisha, and the exacting standards she faced. I'm amused by the marketing ploy of the testimonial on the back cover that proclaims it to be erotic, the gist of the book is pretty much of showing how restrained and regimented a geisha's life was. (Presumably whoever wrote that hadn't read the book, and knew nothing of the culture.) The book is well worth reading for the writing and the immersion in the Japanese culture of an era now past, and it's easy and pleasant to read. It was a terrific achievement in terms of recreating atmosphere. The ending is sudden and contrived, but I didn't mind that so much. I did feel that the research shows through a bit too much, as if after having gone to so much effort, the author wanted to use as much of it as he could, and the plot feels as if it's been pasted onto a thesis. Still, it is rich in style and finely drawn detail, and distinctly different and better than most of the novels out there."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A captivating well-told tale of a young woman in mid-century Japan who is sold into virtual slavery as a girl. She tries unsuccessfully to escape but eventually resigns herself to the fact that her past is gone forever and her only chance to escape unendurable drudgery is to devote herself to becoming a geisha. The details of the geisha training, their public faces and private worries are compelling and seemed very real. As some have pointed out, the characterizations do not go too deep but I believe this is intentional on the part of the author, after all, he is telling the story as if it were a memoir. Sayuri and the other characters are all people who had to keep their very souls secret, not just from the public, but from themselves, too. In the world of Gion, especially for a geisha, better not to dwell too much on the true self. I agree with the reviewer who called it a fairy tale. Chiyo/Sayuri is the put-upon Cinderella, Hatsumomo is the quintessential evil stepsister and The Chairman is the virtuous Prince Charming. Under those terms I believe it only fitting, if a little disappointing, that Sayuri, a lively, intriguing woman, ends up with the bland Chairman. For a geisha, it is the ultimate success. If Sayuri has mixed feelings, she's not telling."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Several of my friends recommended this novel to me, so I went out and bought it. I was enchanted with Sayuri's story from the first chapter. Golden somehow got into the mind of a geisha and is telling her story. I don't know how he did it, but I am in awe of his talent.When Sayuri longs for the Chairman to recognize her, and dreams of one day being with him, I felt the pangs in my heart. When she lived in fear of Hatsumomo, my own stomach clenched. This novel is full of emotion and so wonderfully written."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have to be honest. The only reason I initially purchased this book is because I read that Madonna was playing the character Hatsumomo in her video &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; and that she loved the book. I figure, she has good taste, I'll pick it up. Well, despite what others may have said in the past, Madonna does indeed have good taste.The book follows the story of Sayuri, who becomes a 'geisha-in-training' if you will. She lives with some other girls in training along with some geishas. One of whom is Hatsumomo. She is one of the most evil characters I have ever read about! She is easy to loathe and the things she does to Sayuri (who you are rooting for throughout the whole book) are just terrible!But you know what generally happens to baddies in books, so I'll just leave that up to you. This book is so compelling, heart-wrenching, and so well-written, it's very hard to put it down. I recommended it to all of my friends, but they're not 'readers' so they are really missing out. Please, do not make that same mistake!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The good: Fast reading, solid writing, impeccable rendering of geisha life. Pace is fast, plot never lets up. Characterization of Sayuri, the protagonist, is well defined; what stands out the most are her numerous metaphors, scattered all over the book. I never tired of these metaphors, which were equal counts moving, funny, and beautiful.The bad: Even though Sayuri was aptly realized, I did not learn anything about who she was as a woman. I learned everything there was to know about geisha life, but who was Sayuri, really? I guess I wanted something beyond the lovelorn girl, something more real, something that made her *really* seem human.The ugly: Nothing ugly here. Golden's faux-autobiographical novel, complete with a fake introduction, is a complete account of geisha life told through an entertaining and eye-opening story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Curiosity of the world of geisha made me read this book. The writing was superb, I could hear the streets of Gion, I felt like I was experiencing everything. Not to sound corny, but I had a hard time putting this book down, and my mind salivated for it when I was not reading it. This book is satisfying on many levels: it is well written, it is educational, and highly entertaining. I have been enriched by reading this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I absolutely loved this book, despite how cruel a portrait it is for women to read. It will draw you in immediately and keep you reading till the last page. However, I agree w/ the other reviews, the end seems rushed and far too pretty for this raw and honest book. Nonetheless, bravo to Mr. Golden for the precise detail and narrative that Memoirs of a Geisha holds. If you want a page turner, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I thought this book was one of the best I've ever read. To learn about the Japanese culture from the point-of-view of a geisha was a wonderful way to gain insight on the country itself.

So take my advice and quit reading before the last chapter!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I slogged through to the end of this book because I found it historically interesting, though I myself couldn't speak for its accuracy. I found the language stilted, much like a great deal of the technical and scientific documents I have edited. Worst of all, though, the characters seemed as flat as paper dolls.

The characters were interesting, their lives and situations good material for a book. Then came the character of Hatsumomo, and from then on I couldn't put the sucker down. This book is good, and worthy of all the praise and bestseller lists. The reviews are right though, it does lose its spunk near the end of the book. After Hatsumomo leaves the book is loosely constructed and dwindles away to the hollow romance we really didn't care about in the first place though. But, while the fire is there, it burns strongly. I still strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book gave me a chance to learn about how a geisha sees the world she lives in and how people see her for what she is.

You will experience her many tragedys and her fleeting moments of happiness. Golden has created characters you will love and hate. I thought this book was a great love story. Golden has put the sterotypes of a Geisha to rest in this novel.I could not put this book down. I spent all my free time reading it and thinking about the characters and what would happen next.

It is unbelievable that this was written by a MAN from the US. I felt as though I had been immersed in this world.

If I didn't know it was fiction and that the writer was indeed a male, I would have thought it a work of non-fiction written by an actual geisha.This is a must read for all sexes and ages. It has something for everyone: romance, drama, suspense, a loveable main character (Sayuri) and a wonderful villain (Hatsumomo). I learned so much about a world that held very little, if any, interest to me. I only bought the book because it received such high praise. It will definitely become a classic."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book only 3 days ago, and read it over two evenings. Every time I came to the end of a chapter, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, and continued reading. The story itself is amazing - the reader feels as if they are finding out the most intimate details of the character's thoughts, but so much is still hidden - just like the &quot;act&quot; the real Geisha played for their clients. I believed that I was reading about a real person's life, and though the author's first person account made Chiyo sound as if she always said something beautiful, it only added to the mysterious quality of the geisha.

But like its heroine, it is just a construct of pretty illusion, made only to entertain, never enlighten or challenge. The characters struck me as uninvolving and as thin as rice-paper, the so-called &quot;elegant&quot; writing as serviceable and sometimes distressingly cliched. The plot kept me turning the pages but &quot;suspenseful?&quot; Sayuri's tale was as predictable as a mediocre romance. In fact, if this novel had been packaged as a romance, I might not feel so betrayed by its lack of emotional resonance and complexity. As for Golden's attempt to capture the female voice, well, he's no Flaubert. He's not even Michener. (See Mariko in &quot;Shogun&quot; for a more three-dimensional heroine).

Written by a young, white American male in the late Twentieth century, it brilliantly depicts the life of a geisha in Japan during the 1930s and 1940s. The novel has been appropriately described by one reviewer as an act of ventriloquism because of the author's ability to get inside the mind of the book's female protagonist and write a novel of sustained versimilitude and historical and cultural accuracy. The achievement is even more notable when you realize that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is Golden's first published novel.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" tells the story of Chiyo, the poor daughter of an elderly fisherman and his dying wife. When Chiyo is eight years old, she and her older sister, Satsu, are sold by their father, both designated to become geisha in Kyoto. While Satsu is unremarkable and she ends up as a common prostitute, Chiyo's striking eyes, diminutive beauty and resilient intelligence make her a suitable geisha in training. She soon finds herself in conflict, however, with the resident geisha in her house, Hatsumomo, a beautiful and mean-spirited woman whose antagonism runs through the novel like a thread.Hatsumomo makes life unbearable for Chiyo and seemingly destroys her future until she is taken under the wing of Mameha, a beautiful and accomplished geisha whose motives are uncertain. Through the efforts of Mameha, Chiyo becomes a succesful and avidly sought geisha, taking the name Suriya and becoming the favorite of a war-maimed, wealthy patron named Noru. All this time, however, Suriya's romantic obsession is a business partner and deeply-indebted friend of Noru, a man simply known as the \\"Chairman\\", a man who had once been kind to the young Chiyo when he found her crying by a stream.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is, thus, an historical romance set in Japan during the Depression and the years during and following World War II. As a romance, it is a somewhat lacking because of its fairy tale quality, its unbelievability, its departure from realism. However, while its romantic aspects fall short, it is remarkably successful in depicting the geisha culture of the period--the extensive training of the geisha, the incredible physical and mental demands of the geisha profession, the cultural milieu, trappings, beliefs, and superstitions of the geisha in day-to-day life, and the place of the geisha in Japanese society. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is also remarkable for the way its author succeeds in imagining, and expressing, the intimate life and thoughts of the young Chiyo and the mature geisha Suriya.While \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" does not rise to the level of classic status and can, at times, be somewhat tedious, it is a remarkably well written and imagined first novel, a stunning and sympathetic fictional portrayal of an aspect of Japanese culture that is often misunderstood in the West."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a good book. Also, I feel that when Chiyo becomes Sayuri, it is more than just a change of name. She becomes a totally different person. She even says herself that it feels as though Chiyo has died.

Would recommend to anyone who just wants to get lost in a great book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Chiyo/Sayuri is a woman who puts a lovely turn of phrase onto everything she says, and this is almost enough of a reason in itself to read this book. The language is so beautiful and evoking that it conjures up in precise detail everything Chiyo/Sayuri beholds.Not only this - or perhaps because of it - the story is engrossing and fascinating to read. Although I have known for some time that Geisha are not merely high class prostitutes, but elegant, highly skilled women who entertain with charm, wit and talent, not exchange favours, I did not know the details of their life, how they come to this profession or what it means to them. Although an individual's experience cannot speak for all, Sayuri's account certainly gives compelling insight into the world of a Geisha.It is hard to believe - for at least four fifths of the book at any rate - that this is work of fiction, for it is so convincingly told. The research has been painstaking, and the characters are brought to life with delicious detail. At the beginning of this tale, Japan is still an ancient and beautifully fragile world and the realm of the Giesha an exotic and desired place. But as the story continues Japan becomes a world jaded by war, and as the Geisha melts away with many other ancient traditions, it is revealed that the life of a Geisha is like any other: one searching for meaning and a place in the world where they are necessary. And although, at the close of the war the entertainment and beauty of the Geisha is needed once more, its quality has had to be modified for a changed audience. Even those who remember Japan before the war can no longer be content with a shadow of the past. Apart from the beauty and poignance of the tale and its richly realised characters and story, I was dissapointed with the final fifth. Not because it came to the clich&eacute; faery tale finish, but because it was made so apparent that all of Sayuri's happiness depended on whether or not she ended up with the Chairman. Her whole life was spent anticipating that moment, and as she herself said, if it had never come to pass, she would've missed out on the richness and beauty of everything else around her. Her life would've been a mockery of living.I can understand a young girl clinging to a childish crush in a world in which she was isolated and expected to effectively wear a mask, but for her entire existence to rest on whether or not she ended up with this man as her danna seems to me a sorry existence indeed. Overlooking the fact that the Chairman had a wife - for in this culture that was the norm and both Sayuri and the Chairman were brought up to this - the fact that she waits and builds her entire life up for a man she encountered for only a few moments is a better portrait of a lonely life than any other nuance of the book. What distresses me is that male and female readers alike will be thinking &quot;aw...how romantic&quot;, and seeing it as a dream ome true - getting the much longed-for, seemingly ever out of reach prince, as though it is right for her to feel her life is void of any meaning without him. It is not romantic, is a tragic sign of a life deprived for the most part of true friendship, love and communication with other human beings. This may not be the case of every woman raised to the life of a Geisha, but it is with Sayuri. One has the feeling she sacrifices her own identity for one she feels would be pleasing to the Chairman.On the whole though, this is an immensely entertaining and involving book, with it's beautiful language and fascinating insights sure to intrigue many."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book and I have never been particularly interestedin the Japanese culture. It was a captivating book which took youinto the mindset of a Geisha. Although you learn a lot about the Japanese culture you mostly learn about the similarities that exist among women.

My sign of a great read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't even know where to begin... _Memoirs of a Geisha_ is one of those books that will truly leave you breathless. I'd been hearing about this book ever since it came out, but it wasn't until one of my very good friends forced it into my hands that I actually read it. I'll spare you a summary of the plot, because others have done it better then I could, and frankly there's so much to this book that you could hardly describe it to it's fullest. _Memoirs of a Geisha_ is a book that you will want to read slowly and draw it out as long as you can. The way Arthur Golden describes Japan and the world of the Geisha is amazing. All western misconceptions of this world are put to the test and the truth about Geisha really come out. You are swept into their world and Mr. Golden's prose. Sayuri is character that you feel you know from the inside out and it is hard to believe that Mr. Golden is an American man, for the book flows perfectly from a Japanese woman's perspective. There is never a dull moment and I often found myself re-reading many sections just to get the full affect and power of his words. _Memoirs of a Geisha_ is masterfully contructed to the point where you can close you eyes and see Japan. Honestly, I would be surprised if you haven't heard of this book until now, and if you havn't read it yet, don't waste another minute. You will be blown away by this epic, amazing book. Bravo, Mr. Golden- I can't wait to see what else you bless the book world with."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is the best novel I have read in a long time. I cannot praise it enough. The pictures that the author paints are wonderful. He provides a vividly detailed (and many times disturbing) view of the geisha world.

This is a must have for any library."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am Japanese. I have a gradfather who often played with geisha. I have to tell my loving American frineds that this story is only a fairy tale, much of which is not the truth. We, Japanese people, can tell this is written by someone who only knows the surface of Japanese culture.Please read other Japanese novels that are written by Japanese writers. I feel as if this book is manupulating innocent American people who simply like to know about our culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The central fictional device of Arthur Golden's novel is that it presents itself as an \\"as told to\\" oral memoir of a former Japanese geisha. In a nice touch, the book has a forward by the fictional amanuensis, who describes his experience taking down the words of the protagonist.As a page-turner, it works. The read is generally brisk throughout. Not so much because the reader is dying to know what comes next, but because the author has a graceful style that gently moves the reader along.The book reads a little like Charles Dickens transplanted to Japan. All the Dickensian elements are here: a poor child loses the support of his/her natural family, and is thrust into nasty circumstances, a result of the peculiar institutions of the surrounding culture. In this case, it's a geisha house, not the orphanage that Dickens might write about. But the other Dickensian elements are all there: you meet mean, avaricious adults in the novel's early pages, and the poor child is required to scrape and to labor and to serve those around him/her in a way that no child should be required to do.Also, as with Dickens, salvation comes in the form of unexpected kindnesses from randomly encountered adults in positions of authority.The most notable aspect of the book is the care with which it details the life of the geisha: the appearance and significance of the clothing, the training in the seductive arts, the manners that determine both her reputation and that of her danna, and much else. I won't pretend that I can vouch for the accuracy of these details; but the author succeeds in giving them the credible feel of truth.A few minor nits about the novel: one is that there are places where the \\"as told to oral history\\" conceit doesn't really work. The narration goes into minute details of feelings and sexual encounters that are fully in place in a typical first-person novel, but which are hard to imagine coming out of someone's mouth in this way. It sounds more written than spoken for much of the book. Which is fine, it doesn't make it any less pleasant to read, but it makes the basic story feel a little less believable.The other aspect of the book that I found lacking was the hinging of so much on the protagonist's lifelong romantic attachment. The main character is motivated by a love interest throughout much of the novel, but it doesn't seem substantiated enough to perpetuate itself amid the novel's other more substantial events. Hence, the resolution of the love interest (I won't give away how it turns out) did not feel terribly satisfying. I found myself wishing that the author had found another central plot hook on which to hang his very impressive cultural detail.If you're looking for a book that is a perfect literary whole, that you'll put down with a sigh afterwards and reflect to yourself about its perfection, you won't find it here. But if you're looking for something that piques your interest in a subculture of another society, this book succeeds quite well."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Once in awhile there comes a story so completely transporting that, from the exhilarating experience of reading it, you emerge almost wordless. A review cannot fully describe what is indescribably beautiful. But I will say this: Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha is among the handful of works that come to my mind when confronted with the question: What is the best book you have ever read?This is the fictional tale of a geisha, the high-class counterpart of a Japanese prostitute, who rose to fame in the city of Gion in the late 1930s. Plucked from a tiny fishing village when she was nine, Nitta Sayuri relates her painstaking training to become a geisha; her encounters with an exquisite but vicious archenemy; and above all, her lifelong struggle to win her great love, a prominent but sensitive man whom she refers to only as \\"the Chairman.\\" From the little seaside town of Yoroido to the exotic allure of Gion, from the heady glamour of the geisha life to the stark hardships of World War II, we follow one woman's heart-wrenching but determined journey toward her own happiness and fulfillment.The book reads as though you are sitting across Sayuri herself, listening to the cadence of her voice. The metaphors she uses are panoramic windows into a larger-than-life world. She also introduces the other characters in such a way that, while their motivations have been retold time and again in countless other books, they are rendered with a thoroughly human face. There is Mrs. Nitta, the money-grubbing employer; Mameha, the ethereal, perfect mentor; and Nobu, the cynical and pragmatic suitor. But most of all, there is the geisha Hatsumomo, Sayuri's nemesis. She stands out as one of the most venomous villains in fiction, and yet the poignant conclusion to this phase in Sayuri's life attests to Golden's genius in sympathetic characterization.The book is peppered with upsetting changes and new conflicts. But stripped of its relentless pace and distracting twists, Memoirs of a Geisha is essentially a love story - one that is occasionally frustrating, yet thoroughly compelling. From the very beginning, you can't help but cheer Sayuri on in her attempt to grasp the barest tail of that elusive happy ending, a struggle that is made all the more agonizing by its sheer uncertainty. Very few books compel you to keep turning the pages as much as this one does.My only quibble about the book is its extremely vague reference to the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At least the Doolittle raid on Tokyo is de-glamorized, as the book retells it from the perspective of the victims. But the geisha's post-war fraternization with American soldiers - portrayed here as unwaveringly friendly and generous foreigners - still hints of a Westernized lens.This is surprising because the author, a scholar of Japanese history and culture, otherwise masterfully portrays the geisha life. You'll learn that a geisha goes to school to hone such arts as dance and tea ceremony. And while she entertains men at various functions, she does not provide sexual services (which are reserved for only one man, the geisha's danna, who must be able to afford the price of long-term financial and social commitment).While all this sounds glamorous, Golden doesn't romanticize the work of geisha. Through the words of Mameha, the author writes, \\"We don't become geisha so our lives will be satisfying. We become geisha because we have no other choice.\\" There is a tacit edict that all geisha must be content with their lot in a patriarchal culture. Their role is all about obedience and passivity, a mold against which Sayuri continually (if not always successfully) rebels. So many novels implicitly valorize a patriarchal definition of femininity, a fantasy where the so-called heroine derives pleasure and fulfillment from being pursued. But Memoirs of a Geisha tells the story of a woman who, given the circumstances in her life, undertakes the pursuit herself.Whether or not Sayuri eventually wins her beloved becomes academic, because as a heroine in the strongest sense of the word, she remains the single most compelling reason to read the book. When it finally closes, it's hard to tell which is more real: her bittersweet musings about the changes in a lifetime, or the almost unconscious flow of your tears."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I had one encounter with a geisha during the 4 years I lived in Japan. And it&#8217;s not what you think! (Honi soit qui mal y pense.) It was during a visit I had to the police captain of a small village during a kendo (Japanese fencing) training trip. The captain couldn&#8217;t speak English but there was one lady in regular dress who confessed she could speak only &#8220;a little&#8221; English. All night long, she enthralled me, and six other guests of this police chief, in pleasant conversation. She had almost nothing to say of her own, but she could take even the simplest of utterances from me or any one at the table and turn it into a ten minute conversation filled with laughter and innuendo. Only later, after I returned to Tokyo and had a chat with my sensei, did I realize that I had fallen under the charms of a geisha.As YOU read the book from one page to the next, you&#8217;ll find that you too will have an experience similar to the one I described above.The whole Western concept of the geisha has been one of elegant prostitution. And certainly the controversy about the selling of a young geisha&#8217;s virginity (mizuage) to the highest bidder (which figures prominently in this book) underscores this aspect. But this does little justice to the fascinating life of a member of this reclusive and talented profession.Golden&#8217;s book succeeds where no other book on this topic does because you, the reader, through its 400+ pages, become a member of an evening party with geisha in attendance. It is as if you had a geisha sitting next to you whispering some of her most intimate observations in your ear; only her voice is slightly loud enough that others next to you can hear. Not only is Golden&#8217;s book provocative, but it is seductive, pulling the reader into a world in which no MAN is supposed to enter.I can&#8217;t say the book is for everyone. It&#8217;s certainly not for anyone not interested in the topic. But if you give the book a chance, you too might discover something about our own personal need for human interaction. If the prose doesn&#8217;t hook you right away, make the effort to get through the young girl&#8217;s apprenticeship, which is about half of the book. The story is subtle at the beginning (some would say slow), but the end is a fascinating and compelling read. Certainly a story worth telling in film, as Ron Howard is about to do.This book has affected how I interact in my most personal moments. It&#8217;s made me discover that the art of company is the art of conversation.Nick Jamilla, author of \\"Shimmering Sword: Samurai, Western, and Star Wars Sword Fighting\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha was book of the month for May 2002 and the one word all of us used to describe it was excellent.

The wording is clear, elegant. But what makes Memoirs of a Geisha truly astonishing is that it is unlike any other book I have ever read. Arthur Golden, in the words of fictitious geisha Sayuri, relates the tale of the lilfe of a young Japanese girl, from when she is wrenched from her childhood home through her life as an entertainer.First-person narration allows the reader to experience the events of Sayuri's life through her eyes, and to watch her grow and change. For example, the young girl Chiyo makes very innocent and naive gestures, such as whistling Mr. Tanaka's name over and over to herself (16). Later, there a fewer such instances as Sayuri matures. Another remarkable element of Memoirs of a Geisha is Golden's use of characterization. One memorable moment is when Chiyo first meets the intimidating Mother. Describes Chiyo, &quot;Instead of being white and clear... her eyes had a hideous yellow cast, [like] a toildet into which someone had just urinated. They were rimmed with the raw lip of her lids in which a cloudy moisture was pooled, and all around them the skin was sagging&quot; (42).I also loved the succinct dialogue in Memoirs, exemplified when Chiyo expresses her liking of Mother's kimono. The latter responds, &quot;Do you have any idea what it cost?... More than you did, that's for certain&quot; (42). However, the most important asset of Memoirs was its unique plot. While many romances, mysteries, and horror stories follow a rigid sequence with litle deviation, this tale shatters the mold. Based upon the life of a single character, the plot is abstract; descriptions and characterization are the key to the tale. This is what captivated me, and it will astound other patient readers as well.In future generations, Memoirs of a Geisha will be considered a classic, much like Jane Eyre is today. To all readers who are fans of Oprah's Book Club novels or who simply enjoy a well-written book, I highly recommend Memoirs of a Geisha.

Of both Cinderella, and of your typical romance novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I began this book with great exictement, and the first three quarters of the book did not disappoint me. Golden packs the beginning of the novel with wonderful descriptive prose and fascinating detail. Unfortunately his early promise falls flat. The protagonist, Sayuri, is an Asian Cinderella, orphaned by circumstance, left in the care of the okiya's cruel 'stepmother', tormented and betrayed by the wicked 'stepsisters' (Hatsumomo &amp; Pumpkin), while longing for her 'Prince Charming' (The Chairman). This in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make the story predictable. The ending is rushed and lacks the luxurious prose that marks the early part of the book. Despite these flaws, Golden creates wonderful characters who are interesting, and sympathetic. The novel is ripe with information about the mysterious world of the Geisha and offers the reader a fascinating glimpse into Japanese society."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I want to tell non-Japanese people who think that geishas are prostitutes that Japanese geishas are NOT prostitutes. Compared to western prostitutes, for example, geishas are completely different. The Japanese geisha world is a closed, mysterious one even for the ordinary Japanese people. This, probably, makes many people including foreign people wonder about geishas' real-lives and imagine that they are prostitutes. In a way, I feel it is a shame that I, a Japanese woman, don't know anything about the geisha world, therefore, I'd like to say thank you to the author for his hard work to reveal this hidden world. I still, however, feel sorry that some of the comments here show that even after reading this book, people still misunderstand the geishas and their culture. Reading people's comments here reminds me of how very difficult it is to understand different cultures without having enough background knowledge. A. Golden has described the daily life and culture of the Japanese geisha in great detail and reading his book has greatly increased my basic knowledge of them. I know, however, this is probably because I am Japanese, or because I live in Japan and know Japan from my soul. Actual geisha history is a history of a special group of Japanese women who lived in that time in a very unique environment, which was hard, sad, miserable, and sometimes ambition-filled. I always want to remember these points, to cherish their culture, and have a true understanding of their lives.

Upon finishing the book, however, I was utterly speechless. The book drew me into the deepest emotional dwellings of Sayuri, and oftentimes I feel I am her confidente, with this book as a confession of sorts.

There is great value in learning about other cultures and by studying occupations that do not exist in your own country. The challenge is to keep an open mind, not to get caught up in the misconceptions and disbeliefs in our own traditions. I kept remembering anecdotes and examples in THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION about the problems that traditions, disbeliefs and misconceptions cause. We are fortunate to live in a society where flexibility and change are considered good and where books like THE 2,000 PERCENT SOLUTION are valued for teaching how to identify our &quot;stalls&quot; and make rapid progress, both personally and in business. And yet, I found myself in awe of the training , arts, self-control and social skills that geishas must learn. There is beauty in some of that tradition that we would do well to remember. Combining some of these skills with today's knowledge of achieving the best possible practices for important activities would help us improve both business and society."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I stayed up all night to read this great book.It was beautifully written and I thank Arthur Golden for all the years he put into it and his wife for the help and support she gave him.Let's see more of your work John."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"While a bit superficial in character development, Memoirs of a Geisha is a treasure trove of information on the ladies of entertainment of Japan's history.

You want to take it in , in one sitting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Although this book begins with a fascinating portrait of a young geisha-in-training, it ultimately disappoints. Why, after all she survives, does this woman long only to dress up, get men drunk, and make them laugh? Although she is said to excel at music and dance, she gives no impression of devotion to these &quot;arts.&quot; She doesn't appear to learn anything during her wartime exile from the geisha world or from her associations with powerful men. She never gains any perspective on the strange profession into which she was sold as a child. At the end of this book, I felt I had spent my time reading a romance novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The first two-thirds of the book is mesmerizing. But the end of the book is so romance-novel conventional (and creepy - pedophilia is not romantic in any context), that I felt terribly used, as though I had been duped into reading a Harlequin romance disguising itself as literature. The ending also felt rushed, like the author realized his deadline was looming and had to finish the novel right away. There's no doubt that this book is very well researched, but that research might have been put to better use with a non-fiction account of geisha life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"_Memoirs of a Geisha_, by Arthur Golden, is a gripping biographical novel about the geisha Sayuri. It chronicles Sayuri's life from when she was sold as a child, until the end of her life in New York City. _Memoirs_ is a fictional account of a real geisha, but make no mistake: when you find people named &quot;Mr. Snowshowers&quot; or &quot;Doctor Crab&quot; they were real people, but their names were changed so as not to embarrass their families.This book reveals to the reader the world of the geisha - a universe foreign to western civilization. Even though geisha are sometimes seen as Japanese prostitutes, this is not always the case; geisha means artist, and they are trained in music, dance, and tea ceremonies. The complexities of the ritual, and ceremony associated with being a geisha is mind boggling. For instance: kimonos come in one size. Every time a geisha wears a kimono, it must be tied by a specially trained person, so that it looks as if it were custom tailored, and an ornamental - not to mention complex - knot must be tied with an obi (a long strip of silk) around the geisha to hold the kimono together.The thing that makes this book most desirable to read, is the vividly written passages. The story is told in the first person - through the eyes of Sayuri. The voice is that of experience, but in no way condescends the reader. The narrator keeps a comfortable psychic distance from the reader and feeds a desire in the reader to learn more.Nota Bene: A close psychic distance would be when the narrator talks as if to a friend, and provides an air of familiarity, while a farther psychic distance is when the narrator talks with an air of formality, as an observer outside of the story to a stranger."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I admit that I was reluctant to read this book because of the &quot;hype&quot; that surrounded it; but being curious and trying to keep an open mind, I did finally read it. I was extremely disappointed -- although it is not a terrible book, and it does strive to capture the aura of life in Gion in the 30's, I find Sayuri completely unbelieveable (and unlikeable) as a Japanese character. I realise that there is &quot;dramatic license&quot; in fictional novels, but I still find that (in my opinion) she is just too &quot;western&quot; in her thinking and mannerisms to try to pass as a credible Japanese character. While I do commend Mr. Golden on his extensive research, as evident in the details, there are still a few small factual errors (e.g. pineapples do not grow on trees) that he has missed. All in all, although Mr. Golden may have done a fair job of trying to relate the details of the life of a geisha in Gion (I do applaud his efforts here), I think that he could never fully comprehend the Japanese psyche and personality, let alone try to emulate one in his novel. As such, I find it impossible to empathise with the character of Sayuri (or to even care about what happens to her), thus making the novel very difficult for me to enjoy."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After seeing the preview for the upcoming movie, I was instantly hooked. The very next day, I bought this book frrom Barnes and Noble and read it in one day. I have never read a more interesting and captivating novel.This novel, based on the true story of a famous Geisha of the past, yet twisted to make it a fictional read, is unlike any other. It tells of the story of a 9-year-old girl (Chiyo) sold by her family to a Geisha house, where she works as a maid for a few years before she begins her own training as a Geisha. At the time, one of the famous Geisha (Hatsumomo) is determined to see Chiyo fail by accusing her of stealing, and various other acts that only increase her debt and decrease her chance of becoming a Geisha, which is really the only option for success in her life now.One day, believing the world is filled with only hardship and cruelty, she meets a man (the Chairman) who stops and treats her with kindess. From that point on, she is determined to become a Geisha in order to meet him again.Her struggle is absolutely captivating. She is trained by Hastumomo's rival and main enemy, Mameha, another very popular Geisha at the time. This novel describes, in detail, the life of a Geisha, destroying the idea that they are mere prostitutes (as Westerner's tend to believe).In Chiyo's (now Sayuri, for that is her Geisha name) Geisha-life, she is pushed by Mameha into a life with President Nobu of a famous company, while the Chairman is mere inches away as Nobu's business partner. It is not until the end of the novel, past her Mizuage, losing her only childhood friend, Geisha school, Hatsumomo, her first danna, the war, and her struggle to ultimately be with the Chairman, that she realizes the Chairman has known who she was from the first time he saw her again as a Geisha and has wanted to be close to her.I wish I could go into more detail about the novel, but becaus of it's length, it would be very difficult. This novel takes the reader from the very first step - even before Chiyo is sold - to the very end of her life. I would suggest this novel to anyone who is fascinated by the Geisha, or Japanese culture in general. It's a novel that will be impossible to put-down, or ultimately forget about."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha, had to have been, for me, the most captivating book i could have ever read.I foud myself drawn into a world of sadness, happiness, jealousy and exotic surroundings all at the same time. Because I couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next chapter, i said up till 4:00 or so in the morning to finish it. This story follows the life of a girl named Chiyo-chan who was ripped from her family and way of life in a small, poor village, to be transported to a new and modern town. In this town she will learn to become a geisha and goes to live in a okiya( a type of apartment).There she is tormented by an older geisha, and tries to run away, to no avail. She looses all hope as the mother( or leader) of the okiya fails to believe in her, and very soon, Chiyo believes she is doomed to be a maid the rest of her life. Till one day she meets a man, who would forever change her life. Chiyo was only 9 she was taken from her parents. i'm 13, and the thought of living chiyo's life is terrible, and it makes me thankfull that i live in this time in this place. Memoirs of a Geisha will make you think, with its vivid imagry and the rich history, it will soon turn into a book you will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book after seeing a middle-aged businessman devour the book on a flight to Chicago. He was so completely engrossed in the novel that he didn't acknowledge the stewardess prompting him for his meal. By the end of the flight, he had finished the novel. The constrast between the concinnity of subject matter and the bulky stature of the businessman in an awkward airplane set made me curious. What made him so enthralled?After I read it, I knew why. The novel was an absolute delight! I read it in a single sitting despite my attempts to put it down so I could savor it. Mr. Golden delves deep into the character of a credulous child maturing into a woman jaded by the Machiavelistic ways of her lifestyle. He has an exquisite manner of depicting stirring detail and feeling so that you actually feel the high sash of the kimona digging into your ribcage. The book is sprinkled with jewel-like analogies such as as describing love as a stone dropping into a well.If you like to be educated while you are entertained with elegant (yet concise) prose, this is the book for you. It reminds of &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot; in a way, because you learn the culture of a society, while you befriend (or at least emphatize with) the main character. At the same time, you learn tasty bits of trivia (whether it be ribolitta or waxed hair).After reading the book, the character names ring familiar as if they were your own friends.Gobbled up by me and a random American male businessman."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm convinced this book has gotten so much attention because it was written by a man about a woman; not because it's a great book. I enjoyed reading about the details of life as a geisha. In fact, I think I would have enjoyed the book more if it had stopped there. I like love stories, but this tried and failed to be one. It's obvious throughout the book that Sayuri will end up with &quot;the Chairman&quot;, but why should we care? The contortions the plot had to go through to bring it off were sometimes awkward and far-fetched, particularly Sayuri's method for ridding herself of Nobu, and the Chairman's explanation for why he'd never pursured her. Sayuri starts off as such an interesting person, but that fizzles once she becomes a geisha. It's understandable that her behavior would have become more conservative at that point, but she would have been a more interesting, and believable, character if her thinking had remained as full of spirit as it was in the beginning of the book. Read it if you want to know about the life of a geisha, but don't expect a believable plot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm going to assume that most everyone has the details of the book already that you can get from the cover, so I won't go into that summary again. You can get that from the title. But perhaps ' Memoirs of a Geisha Reflecting Upon Her Life Many Years Ago as Told to a Westerner Also Late In His Life As Told By Arthur Golden' would be a much more appropriate title. ( Although it just isn't as catchy, I agree.) This novel is full of the kinds of details that one would expect from an author who has all of the appropriate titles and credits of Mr. Golden, not to mention the 10 years of study. The devotion to his topic is evidient in the copious details. The world in which he takes us is that of a curator, walking through a dreamlike museum of all of his highly prized objects, found in the deepest corners of the earth, from a land and time that we cannot fully comprehend and never visit. His details are exquisite, the devotion to the subject unwavering, but were his story a rare and highly prized silken screen, it would be no less two-dimensional. Sayuri could be any Geisha. Her Chairman any businessman. There is so much in the events of their lives and the details of their surroundings that you can almost forget that we learn very little about the actual people. The reader will do well to forget the word 'Memoirs' and remember that this is fiction, perhaps of the purest kind: A fairy tale. A Western fairy tale in an Eastern setting. Cinderella, teahouse style. Only on paper can a villan be so purely evil, a heroine so unquestioningly long suffering, a hero so valiant by his mere existence. But the silken threads of good and evil, great beauty and unspeakable hideousness are so eloquently woven that we do not mind that it takes hundreds of pages to arrive at our glass slipper ending."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is one of the best books that I have ever read, it is beautiful, very well written and realistic. It intrigued me so much, that I do not think I could put the book down once until I had finished it! This is not one of those books which you have to read 100 pages to &quot;get into the story&quot; - it throws you into the tale of a country girl, who is sent off to become a geisha. It is so convincing, that it was hard for me to believe that it is not an auto-biography, but fictional. The descriptions of details amazed me; the clothing, the tea houses, the clients, the other geishas, the environment, the places... it was as if I was there. I wanted more as soon as I had finished the book, I could not get enough of it. There are not words worthy to describe this masterpiece! A recommendation for anyone with an interest for culture!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"That's a good question. I absolutely enjoyed this book, and was amazed at times with the writing and the detail of it. At other times, however, I felt the author sacrificed the story for style.Golden sets up a strong, consistent character in the heroine Sayuri, and in doing so, also gives us a clear vision of the city of Gion, and Japan in general, during the time period. Though I was impressed with the detail, clearly well researched to be as true as possible, I still had the nagging feeling that the view of Japan presented was based on many stereotypes. Just when I began to think I was getting a glimpse of a world few people had ever seen, I realized that it was exactly how I would've imagined it. Beautiful, but sometimes predictable.Another problem I had was the over abundance of metaphors that seemed typically &quot;Asian&quot;. In the beginning these were well-placed and clever, but as the story went on I wished that Sayuri could see something just once without comparing it to leaves or butterflies. This is the manner in which I think the author failed the story--he didn't let Sayuri's voice change along with her character.The bottom line is that this was a wonderful subject to take on, and a great feat of the imagination to conjure this story. The writing of it is done less than perfectly, but admirably nonetheless."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"With his obvious expertise in the subject, Mr. Golden will immerse you in the exotic society of the Geisha. Against this backdrop the author draws you into the heroines struggle first for bare survival, then for her place in this circle and her self image and finally for fulfillment and success. The prose matches the mood of the subject and the pace is just slow enough to dwell on the details that fill the images with color, scent and sound.If there is one minor annoyance, it is Sayuri's infatuation with the chairman. It is barely motivated and not supported by any deeper analysis of his character. The ending too seems a bit abrupt and unrefined in comparison to the rest of the novel. Nevertheless, this book is enchanting and a promising debut for the author."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I came across this book when I traveled Australia.After I read this book completely , I understood why this book was published only in English, oversea. I am age 39, but even I, could found out names of customors of Sayuri and they were well-known people in Japan, we can easily see their names at primary text book. Especially, Sayuri's danna was famous man. My american friend doubted it was a fake story but I know it is a true story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book provided a fascinating account of a very unique part of the Japanese culture - that of the Geisha. It provided vivid detail about lives of Geishas that were hard, peculiar, manipulative (to the extreme), bazaar, exotic and stunningly beautiful at the same time. It certainly sparked a keen interest in me about the rich and contrived Japanese culture.I was partly intrigued and partly disappointed at the author's almost stereotypical treatment of some of the material. This characteristic is particularly apparent in the author's depiction of men. The men in this book were either God-like figures with heavenly appearances that spark affection or strange looking creatures whose peculiar physical treats and personalities invoked disgust. The portrayals of many of the geishas in this book were less apparent but equally simplistic. They were either stunningly exquisite or ugly in some ways to the extent of grotesque. To me, such drastic depiction of most of the characters in the book borders on exaggeration and compromises believability of the work. I cannot help but wondering whether there were hidden messages in such treatment that eluded me.The vast account of the details of the main character, Sayuri's life as a geisha revealed the extensive research behind the work. It is remarkable for a Western scholar to amass such rich and in-depth material about any aspect of a foreign culture, let along that of the highly secretive lives of geishas. But the construction of the characters in this book also was plagued by simplicity and stereotype. The author spent most effort to create the inner world of the Character Sayuri. But even this character felt, thought, and behaved almost the same when she was about nine or ten as when she became an adult. You cannot really tell how she progressed psychologically throughout the book. The rest of the characters turned out as contrived as puppet in a puppet show. Hustumomo was depicted as the master of menace, cruelty and manipulation. Mameha, a near saint with all the right connections. Mother, the Japanese version of a shrewd miser with all the typical heartlessness and gross looks. Every character carried a message without any depiction of a matching inner-world in this book. As a result, these characters turned out to be merely two-dimensional and had a hard time to convince me that they were actual real people that lived as geishas. Without constructing their complexity as human beings, the book failed to bring them alive. They appeared just like the geishas when they put on their mask. You cannot tell what they were, how they looked. They were fakes.Maybe that is exactly what the author tried to convey. Maybe that is the hidden message that I missed. But as a person who was raised in another Asian culture, I expect a lot more subtlety and complexity than the book was able to deliver."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the wistful, yearning notes of the &quot;translator&quot; to the final glimpse of an elderly lady in a kimono on a New York street, this book utterly captivates the reader. I was unable to put it down, staying up most of one night to finish it. (I recommend a long weekend, if you're the slow, savoring type, or a regular weekend if you view books as consumables).Sayuri and her &quot;biographer&quot; look unflinchingly into the past and deliver a story that does not spare the reader the realities of a geisha's life. The emotional, physical and spiritual path of glass walked by Sayuri has been crafted with exquisite grace. Those who shape her life, from Mr. Tanaka, to Mameha, to Pumpkin and Mr. Nobu, are as fully realized and deeply crafted as the central figure. There are no ciphers here. They are, perhaps, more enigmatic, more hidden within the layers of action than one tends to expect from characters in a western novel, but that is part of the fascination of this story.Few occidentals can truly know whether the book is &quot;true&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;, but I felt I had been priveleged a small glimpse and understanding of Japan and its culture. But in any period, in any place, these people, this story would be enchanting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Assuming this book would be an American's fantasy of a geisha's life, I avoided this book for a long time. When I finally bought it, I read it while waiting for my luggage in the airport, while at the gym, and at 3 o'clock in the morning when I couldn't sleep because I wanted to find out what happened next in the book. The main character is as endearing as the heroine of a Jane Austen novel, and far more complex, fascinating and funny than I ever would have thought an American male writer would allow. This book defeated all the prejudices and cynicism that kept me from buying it for far too long."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden has revealed a new and mysterious world to us in 'Memoirs of a Geisha'. The book debunks all the popular myths about these women of Japan and provides an insight into the life, thoughts and angst of a geisha in Kyoto. Beautiful imagery and a fine attention to detail brings Sayuri to life for us. Although the thoughts and feelings attributed to the young Chiyo seemed rather adult. It was a pity the book focused so much on her early life and glossed over Sayuri's actual experiences in later years. The sense of yearning and the question of 'Will she really get to be with the Chairman she dreams of so much' kept me engrossed till the end of the book. The characterizations of Hatsumomo, her nemesis, and Auntie, her friend and mentor, were vivid and helped in understanding Sayuri. The reproduction of the Japan of the 30's and 40's was excellent and each minute detail well researched. On the whole, a good book, although the completion of it leaves you wondering about her later years. You are also left feeling sceptical about a teenager having such intense thoughts and profound mental imagery when faced with challenging circumstances in life. A good read, the book draws you in."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book provides a fascinating look at the enigmatic lives of the geisha during their peak of popularity, beauty and grace. The author has done an excellent job of detailing the rituals and practices of the geisha, as well as the world in which they were forced to compete.The characters are engaging and true to life. Sayuri, the main character, is a mostly believable heroine. Her ambitions were not always rational but this creates a more imperfect and human character.My main criticism of this book is the decline of story tension after the World War II section. And Sayuri does not attain her goal herself; how it is obtained is silly and flat.Nevertheless, this book is still an excellent choice for anyone interested in this almost forgotten Japanese culture."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book two years ago and it still remains one of my all time favorites. To be able to be taken to a world that I could never even dream about and make it feel so real is quite a compliment to the author. Having said all that, if you liked the book, you will ABSOLUTELY LOVE the audio. The reading by English actress Bernadette Dunn with all the different subtle accents of all the characters both male and female is nothing short of remarkable. How she is able to bring life to Sayuri and The Chairman while talking about the teahouses in Gion -- believe me I thought I was there instead of driving around in my car. This audio is a definite must for the true Memoirs' lovers."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a novel, there is no question that &quot;Memoirs&quot; is extremely well-written, pursuasive and enjoyable. My opinion is that it is important to not confuse the feeling of authenticity with actual authenticity. Mineko Iwasaki's strong negative reaction to this book (which is based largely on the author's interviews with her) cannot be discounted out of hand."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am not typically drawn to books about Japanese culture, but my friends convinced me to give this book a try. I found myself totally caught up in the characters and the story. My only criticism of this book is that a life-long relationship with a much older man (obviously a father figure) which begins as a child's crush is a little too far fetched. It's the only hint that the book was written by a man!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was there. I was in the heart of Gion with all of the characters. I was rooting for Sayuri. I felt the pain. I shared her tears. I sunk in my chair with sadness and shot out of it with gladness. Make sure you have the time to read because you won't want to put the book down until you reach the final page. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a great book that I just happened upon. Normally, I would not read a book about Japan, but this book just jumps out and grabs you! I'm glad it did. I bought it on Saturday and finished on that Monday. This book will make the rounds in my circle. My only disappointment was the last 100 pages of the book, they seemed rushed and not as carefully crafted as the beginning and middle. Still, a must read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"You will become part of the scenery in this vivid book. You will feel like you are there as a guest in a teahouse. You become Sayuri's mind as she talks to you and as you feel life through her. A love story, a survivor's story and a magic carpet ride all in one."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have never read a book that was as intriguing, informative, or well-written as Memoirs of a Geisha. I couldn't put the book down! At times it had me in tears (both from laughter and crying) as I related with Chiyo-san. The entire book kept me on a winding path where I had no idea what I'd come across next. The ending both pleased and upset me, but I wouldn't have changed a thing. I give this book an enormous 5-star rating! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I enjoyed this book every bit as much as I'd hoped, but it's true that the final third does not live up to the promise of the first two-thirds. Golden has clearly done a great deal of research and has created a credible world with interesting characters, at least in a Dickensian sense. Even given it's considerable charm and entertainment value, though, it's hard not to be appalled that this will be regarded by many as an authentic representation of another culture. No matter how well researched, it's still fiction, and fiction about a tiny, highly circumscribed segment of a society. More interesting are &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (a tough read, though) and, especially, &quot;The Confessions of Lady Nijo&quot; (the Karen Brazell translation is, lamentably, out of print)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am grateful that my book club chose this book - otherwise, I might never have. I didn't have any particular interest in Japan or in geishas, and the book's title sounded to me like a cheap novel.But, I must say that I was overwhelmed by this book. I found it touching, fascinating, and a very enjoyable read.My only real criticism was the hasty exit of the character, Hatsumomo. She was such a prominent figure throughout most of the novel that I felt she had been given short shrift at the end. I expected some type of major confrontation between her and Sayuri, and when that didn't happen, I was a bit disappointed.Also, I would have liked more information on Satsu, Sayuri's sister.I agree too with some of the other criticisms printed here. The novel did end rather abruptly, racing through the last years of her life with breakneck speed.I do not want to reveal what eventually happened between Sayuri and the Chairman (as I know some people read these reviews before reading the novel!), but there was a part of me that wanted something more for the two of them, and a part of me that wanted something less.I found the writing to be excellent. The tone was conversational and warm. And Golden offered a great many philosophical insights that I found myself reading again and again.Anyway, to sum it up, I enjoyed this novel immensely and am very very happy that I read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that this book will still be read and enjoyed in 50 years. Ignore the 1 and 2 star posts here: they are either politically-correct or never actually read the book (especially the person who works in the bookstore and tells people not to read the book-give me a break). I have lived in Japan and have an extensive academic as well as business background on many things Japanese; this book is as good as it gets for both lovers of Japan and lovers of excellent literature. I agree the ending is a bit forced (as done Golden in his Amazon.com interview), but cut him some slack: he writes in convincing first-person female for a Japanese woman from another era and social class. This book is not at all pornographic or Harlequinish-I feel bad that I have to defend it. The story was great and the Japanese expressions brought great beauty to the story. Buy it and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It's been a long while since I've been so entranced by a book. Golden spent close to a decade writing this novel, and the quality of his research clearly shows in his attention to details and the accuracy of the historical background. Seldom have readers been completely transported to another world with such ease, and made to experience so intimately the triumphs and trials of a protagonist.The writing of the first three quarters of the book is exquisite and tightly controlled. My only complaint is that the ending tends to be a little pat, and perhaps even contrived. While we celebrate with Sayuri her life and achievements, the neat ending strikes one as being too perfect, and hence a little vacuous and anti-climactic.But what an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I would take issue with those (thankfully few) reviewers on this site who found so much fault with this book. While it is true the ending IS a bit forced, the book is supposed to be a MEMOIR written in HER voice, HER experience; if it were technically perfect in that sense, would it seem so authentic? So RARE to have such an engrossing female presence to experience. I believe this book will still be read and enjoyed in 50 years."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of my first introductions to japanese culture, and it really helped answer a lot of questions I had about the cultural traditions in Japan.

I didn't really know what to expect when I first bought this book, thinking it was a memoir on a non-fictional account. The book is just that good. This book flows like an artist. At the beginning you have the idea of the big picture. As you read more and more, the detials start filling in and before you know it the picture is done being painted and you are amazed that this simple novel came to be something much more beautiful than you ever thought.I really enjoyed this book and reccommend this book to everyone who wants to enjoy a good story. The countless detail and imagery that gets painted inside your head as you read is priceless."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I wanted to read this book before the movie comes out and it didn't take long to finish the 400+ pages. The writing is easy to read and the pace of the book goes quickly. Even when the plot slows slightly toward the end, it still moves well. There is excitement throughout the entire book, from the dueling geishas to preparing to entertain men.At times, I had to remind myself that the storyline was fiction.I didn't have any interest in the subject matter before reading the book, but was still unable to put the book down.I'm now reading \\"Geisha, a Life\\" by Mineki Iwasaki, who was a real-life geisha that shared her story.

Chiyo is sold to a geisha house by her poor father after her mother's death. She is a maid at first, tormented by the evil geisha Hatsumomo, until she is taken under the wing of another geisha, Mameha. A subtle war ensues, as the young woman (now re-named Sayuri) and her mentor fight to rid themselves of the evil influence of Hatsumomo.When they finally triumph, all the spirit seems to leave the book. The part about Sayuri's residence in the country during World War II was stilted, and the conclusion with the Chairman I found unbelievable.

Not only are the characters real, but the authors use of language allow the reader to delve into the main character's emotions of love, wanting, and suffering.

Read this book, trust me you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This story of hope and disappointment is a true masterpiece. A tale that is half fiction, and half historical, is one of the best reads Iv ever had. Sayuri, a.k.a. Chiyo-chan, is the perfect heroine since you never stop loving her. Throught her blue eyes we see the world of the Geisha. We see the good and the bad and what it takes to be in that life. I love how she tells the reader that Geisha are not prostitutes (which is what the americans think). They are artists, and this book is a real piece or art. I found myself wanting more by the end and I was even sad that it was over. I liked how even when things worked out the way sayuri wanted, she still found that life wasent perfect, and this is a good message to people that they should just be happy with what they have. This is a must-read for all people. I cant wait for the film and I hope it will serve a justic to this brilliant book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book probably \\"borrows\\" from various actual memoirs of former geisha a bit more than the author is likely willing to admit (e.g., Autobiography of a Geisha and Geisha, a Memoir), but the embellishments of the underlying stories is simply beautiful and enjoyable to read. Golden's Sayuri is intelligent, feminine, manipulative and conniving all at once. The book spends an extensive amount of time on Sayuri's life before she becomes a geisha, from early childhood through her time as an apprentice geisha. The book is frank without becoming vulgar. Enjoyable to read as a fictional accompaniment to the above autobiographies or on its own. Sometimes it was difficult to remember that the story was fiction and not fact."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden does a great job in capturing history, culture and a good story into this book. Another \\"must read\\" novel that kept me under its spell until the end."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite novels. First of all, it has an enormous cultural depth of Japanese life. To a person that knows nothing, like I did, it is amazing; Things such as the tea ceremony are described with great detail and passion. The story and plot are interesting, and maintains the reader focused until the end; one really falls for this geisha and wants her to triumph. The character development is phenomenal, you get to know who your reading about, and I found myself knowing what they would do next. The other fascinating thing about this novel, which makes it so, is the great explanation of feminine nature and love. It may sound cheesy or corny, but when you read the book, you'll understand a lot better how a woman thinks and acts with love (though this may not be your traditional style of love...)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"From the beginning I was captivated by this story. Golden does such wonderful job of telling Sayuri's story, I was disappointed when I actually found out that in real life Sayuri does not really exist....But this book has truly sparked my interest in the history and culture of geishas. In fact, after reading this book I even visited Japan and went to Gion to see where this story took place. I went to the Gion shrine and even dressed up as a geisha and had my picture taken at a studio. It was so much fun! I can't wait until the movie comes out!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This, more than anything, is a loving and beautiful evocation in simple, but skillful prose of Japan at the beginning of this century, coupled with a likeable and highly intelligent central character and a very, very good plot of hope, endurance, suffering and love.

(true, i didn't know what a lot of these terms meant but i felt talked down to). lengthy descriptions of kimono patterns seemed to me a waste of time and not at all interestingly written enough for me to care. to top it off the story line so far has been very cliche. i'm so glad my copy is borrowed.i'm hooked though."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"After reading this book, I gained a much better understanding about the way the middle eastern countries were run before the modern ages had dawned on it.

But after wandering aimlessly around chapter by chapter, the ending was fantastic. I was sitting there wiping my eyes and blowing my nose (I was sick). This is a great story to read when you're sick or feeling a bit down, I even forgot about my nasty headache! Really brightened up my day."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I simply couldn't put it down! It has made me reevaluate my life and position in society -- am I, are we, as women, so different from the geisha just because their behaviors are more frowned upon, more illicit?

In format, it is a memoir, and the author's use of this mechanism is nothing but masterly. Mr. Golden's attention to detail and fluid, almost lyrical writing style, has me waiting for his next work. His descriptive style gives the reader entre to world that certainly is unknown in the west. The book takes the reader from an impoverished family with daughters to a highly regarded geisha that holds court in New York City. This is her story and is completed in stunning style. This is a beautiful book and I congratulate the author on his success. I look forward to more work from Mr. Golden. I recommend this book to others without reserve.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was a bit sceptical about this book, since I'd read so many wanky books about Japan by Westerners, plus this was Arthur Golden's first book, not to mention that they'd made a movie about it starring non-Japanese (why would you make a movie about Japanese geishas with a cast of Chinese actresses when there are so many fantastic Japanese actresses our there?).The story was quite amazing, if a bit implausible (a geisha plucked out of the deep countryside? a Japanese girl with blue eyes?). The characters are great, although the description of the skills she had to learn to become a geisha were somehow less developed than descriptions of the hardship of life in Gion. Some episodes that describe how geisha entertain were good, but the gleeful enymity between main character Sayuri and Hatsumomo is neither explained nor properly developed - and then, just when you think that the evil relationship is quite central to he book, Hatsumomo is discarded and all but forgotten as a character two thirds into the book. The ending of the book is one of the worst I've read, it even makes \\"Ransom\\" look like a masterpiece in terms of how it is concluded - while that book was not as good, the ending certainly was a stunner (albeit a bit pointless).The last fifty pages of \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" could have been deleted. Golden has somehow perfected the airy tone of a flighty geisha, who nonetheless has a poetic elegance, and he does it by writing complex similes. I don't know how he picked up the knack, but he does it well. I was very impressed initially, until I found it becoming a bit over-wrought. For example, he writes \\"That startling month made me feel something like a pet crickes that has at last escaped its wicker cage. For the first time in ages I could go to bed at night believing I might not always draw as little notice in Gion as a drop of tea spilled onto the mats. I still had no understanding of Mameha's plan, or of how it would lead me to success as a geisha, or whether success as a geisha would ever lead me to him. But every night I lay on my futon with his handkerchief pressed against my cheek, reliving again and again my encounter. I was like a temple bell that resonates long after it has been struck.\\" Three similes in five sentences, not bad. And typically any chapter would begin this way."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The author does an incredible job at keeping the reader \\"hooked.\\" i could not bring myself to put it down....when i finished the book, i wanted to learn more about geishas and their cultures.....this is a must read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Absolutely one of the best novels I have ever read!!!

A fascinating and emotional story that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" certainly deserves all the hype and praise it has earned from critics and fans alike. I finally read it recently, and found it impossible to put down, concurring with those who regard this huge novel as one of the best literary debuts of the last decade. Golden has done an admirable job in conveying his knowledge and interest in Japanese culture and history in telling a spellbinding tale about a young Japanese geisha living in Kyoto, Japan in the 1930s and 1940s. Virtually every word he has written has a tremendous air of authenicity to it, as if he himself had been an insider looking on the sequestered lives of Japanese geisha in Kyoto's Gion district. Moreover, Golden's crisp, poetic prose is replete with Japanese metaphors and nuances, which is truly unexpected from a Western writer who is spinning a tale set in the Imperial Japan of the first half of the 20th Century.Young Chiyo is the daughter of an impoverished Japanese fisherman who is forced by circumstances to sell her and older sister Satsu to the mysterious wealthy Mr. Tanaka into involuntary servitude. Both sisters are sent to the old Japanese imperial capital of Kyoto, destined to earn their livelihoods as apprentice geisha (Chiyo) and prostitutes (her sister). In Kyoto, Chiyo endures unspeakable hardship, including wanton episodes of excessive cruelty from the two elderly women running Nitta okiya (Chiyo's newly adopted geisha \\"family\\"), and especially from Hatsumomo, Nitta's senior, most successful, geisha. Chiyo finds salvation unexpectedly in the form of Mameha - Hatsumomo's bitter rival - and Kyoto's most famous geisha - who successfully mentors Chiyo in the subtle nuances of geisha sisterhood. Taking on the geisha name of Sayuri, she will become Mameha's successor as Kyoto's most celebrated geisha in the late 1930s through the 1940s, eventually realizing a new life for herself, in - of all places - New York City. Hers is a most memorable path for a Kyoto geisha to take, and it is that path which makes \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" such an engrossing, delightful novel for anyone fortunate to read Golden's fine literary debut."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was a great book. I will admit, that the first chapter was a little slow for me. Once I got into the story, however, I was hooked. I strongly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I began &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; with many reservations. I was certain that this would be another Western man's tepid little fantasy about a specific facet of Asian culture. But happily, Arthur Golden surprised and delighted me.&quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is an imaginative, superbly researched, and well-written book. From the opening pages I was quite convinced that I was reading an actual Geisha's autobiography. The details of the geisha's life were compelling and quite believable. From what I understand, Golding performed quality assurance tests on his original manuscript by running it past several Geishas whom he had previously interviewed. Apparently, they faulted so much of the original manuscript that Golding rewrote the entire book. I applaud his persistence and integrity to that end.The book does have its imperfections. For one thing, I found the protagonist's constant use of similes to be a bit superficial and fake. But who knows, perhaps Geishas used this sort of lexicon out of habit. I also found the story's resolution a little disappointing. It capped a superbly written story off with a Hollywood clich&eacute; and detracted a bit from the believability of the characters. But even with these flaws the plot was still superb.I highly recommend this book for its imagination and attention to historical accuracy. Among other things it tears down a lot of Western stereotypes of Geishas as prostitutes. Contrary to some complaints that I've heard, very little of this book is sexual in nature."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It seems rather pointless to submit a review of this book now, so long after all the fuss and gushing have subsided. But I only recently read it, and felt a brief comment was called for.Initially, the story of Sayuri, a geisha in pre-war Japan who begins life as a peasant girl sold into slavery, seems both rich and insightful. And the fact that the book is written by an American man, a quiet bit of genius.However, on closer inspection, and further reading, Memoirs of Geisha is little more than a traditional paint-by-numbers plot, planted into a competently depicted foreign culture, and period. Golden has obviously done his homework on the geisha, and the book is packed with informative descriptions of their lifestyle and accessories.But instead of making the reader feel immersed in the Kyoto of the 1930's, one feels like a tourist. Worse, the heroine feels equally much like a tourist in her own story. The fact that she ends up in New York by the end of the book, tucked away in the Waldorf, seems to underline this point.I found the book satisfactorally written, but the plot dull and predictable, and the characters so intensely two-dimensional they could quite easily have been the cast of your average sunday matinee cartoon. The evil geisha that terrorises Sayuri; the good geisha that helps her; the strong, male hero, hovering in the background. And so forth.The first third of the book, during which Sayuri's early life is described, is strongest, and the horrors of slavery are rightly moving and disturbing. But the pervading sense that \\"it's all going to be ok\\" breaks any serious intentions this novel has, and renders it a pallid, easy-reading piece of lightweight storytelling that is disappointing and perhaps, even offensive to the culture it seeks to portray.This is not a terrible book -- but the endless rave reviews are hard to understand. This is an instantly forgettable westernised story, transplanted into an intriguing culture which is left as opaque to one's understanding after the book as it was to begin with."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Why should I bother to add another, especially when I think the book was a readable mediocrity which I read merely because i'd run out of other books on hand? But then, I've lived in Japan, studied Japanese music and theater, learned enough of the language to be embarrassed by how poorly I speak it, and read quite a few of the best modern Japanese novels in translation, so i suppose I ought to comment on this portrayal of Japanese culture by a \\"gaijin\\" -- an outsider/foreigner like myself.There are two sides to Arthur Golden's \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\", the fiction and the fact. As a piece of fiction, narrated in the first person in the manner of 19th C English novels, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is dreadful stuff, a 'Harlequin Romance' bodice-ripper such as you might find on a super-market book rack at the check-out counter. Beauty survives various assaults and degradations, Beauty eludes Beast, Beauty is rewarded by the Kiss of her awaited Prince. As a factual (or at least plausible) depiction of the bizarre culture of pre-contemporary Japan, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" has a lot to recommend it. Arthur Golden has really done his research, and he uses the voice of his fictional Geisha effectively to describe both the economics and the ethos of the \\"floating world\\" of traditional Japanese cities. There are portions of the book that read a lot like textbook sociology, and those portions were, for me, the most interesting. This is a book in which you SHOULD read the notes; in fact, you'll scarcely be able to follow it unless you do so.As fiction, one star. As sociological history then, five stars. The novels of 20th C Japanese authors -- Tanizaki, Kawabata, Ooe, and others -- are vastly better in artistry but challenging to the 'sensibilities' of Western readers. If you've been able to meet the challenge of \\"foreignness\\" in a novel like Tanizaki's \\"Makioka Sisters\\", you'll find this gaijin romance pitifully trite and thin. But if you haven't been able to make sense of the aesthetics behind the paper doors of Kyoto's Gion 'Pleasure District', you'd do very well to read these fictional Memoirs in preparation for 'the real thing.'"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I almost find it hard to believe that a man wrote this book. We are so realistically placed in Chiyo's mind, in her world. It is a very eloquent novel about faith and patience with life. Chiyo is said to be like water - put an obstacle in water's path and it will flow around; but over time, water can carve stone. It also brings the reader through the transformation of Japan during the war - as the very culture, so perfectly constructed and tightly followed, was cracked open.

I found it nearly impossible to put down and read until my eyes felt as if they were about to burst out of their sockets.It's hard to believe it was written by a man, even harder still to believe that the character of Sayuri never really existed."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I must say many factual parts were well-researched, and the author succeeded in portraying a life of geisha who survived in the early 20th century. Overall, the story is entertaining and enjoyable even to Japanese. I was very impressed by how well the author described beautiful kimonos and how Japanese people behave.However, as a native of Japan, I found some awkward descriptions here and there. I found it hard to believe that so much use of poetic metaphors from someone like Sayuri, a geisha. My guess is that the author elaborated most metaphor parts based on the facts in order to make the story more romantic. Some elaboration was O.K., but the author did too much of it and made the story less realistic. The author attempted to convince readers that all geisha are not prostitutes by explaining that there are classes of geisha ranging from lower class prostitutes to higher class successful geisha who had privilege of luxury and more freedom supported by their \\"Danna\\". It was nice of the author that he makes efforts to correct many foreigners' \\"misconceptions\\" about geisha to protect their dignity, but his novel failed to do it. Why \\"mizuage\\" was involved in exchange of money and the geisha's feelings are the least of concerns? Owned by \\"Danna\\", whom the geisya does not necessarily love, provided main source of income from him that allows luxurious life in exchange of her sexuality is no different from a definition of prostitute. Since it is a fictional story, I should not expect too much accuracy and understanding of Japanese from an American after all.The movie was disappointing though I know many westerners loved it. I admit, the scenery and music was extraordinarily beautiful, but frankly, I was disgusted by Hollywoodization of the original. Ironically, the movie only strengthens my \\"stereotypes\\" of how western males think of Japan ( ;-P)."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was the book that made me start to read.So I hold this book very close to my heart.This book actually had me crying like a little girl and I don't care because it's one of the best books I've ever read.I think the only thing i would change about it would be the way it ended, it was like hitting a brick wall.

I was very pleased with the way the characters and places come to life with every detail.

Though the book may infuriate some Western readers who are not used to championing for a character who seems to possess what they may deem an anti-feminist regard, the more aware reader will learn to follow and ultimately support Sayuri despite the differences in outlooks. A fantastic read for an open-minded person, eager to absorb the intricate and meaningful traditions and ceremonies of geisha. Those who are all-too-willing to wrongfully assign Western standards and expectations to this novel will be sorely bewildered and irritated by Golden's rather candid look into this ancient practice."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The plot is refereshing. However, besides the scheming Geishas who all want to reach the top, there is not much more in the story. After reading near 2/3 of the book, it becomes a kind of drag and you'd wish it would end quickly. A good book to skim through. Definitely not one of my favourites."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I bought this book just because Amazon.com customers rated it so highly; I was a little embarrassed to order it, but figured, why not? This book turned out to be such a pleasureable read. In fact, it's the kind of book you are still thinking about days later. I would recommend it highly! The characters are highly developed by the author. I will buy anything this author writes."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was really great in the beginning, but I was very frustrated towards the end. I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on how the chairman part was dragged out and annoying. Golden took his time in the first 2/3 of the book and rushed through the last third. Maybe the publisher said it was too long, so he cut out the whole big climax of the book's end. I liked it, though. It passed the time like I needed it to. People might as well read it to see what all the hype is about!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is indeed an impressive first novel -- as many have already stated. The reason it didn't earn five stars from this demanding reviewer is because Arthur Golden missed many chances to write a book that was more than simply entertaining. Hatsumomo, for instance, is a cardboard villain. The novel would have been literature if Artie had explored -- even hinted -- at why Hatsomomo was the she was. Instead of portraying her as the villain, he could have created a character that was simply honestly reacting to the intense and established sexism that women were accepted to honor. Artie, baby, you missed a huge chance. You coulda been great."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book starts out well, but in the later stages, it starts to decline. Instead of satisfaction at the end, I felt hollow about Sayuri's being together with the Chairman at last. Nonetheless, Chiyo's first meeting with the Chairman was totally enchanting and signifies what she was to be in her life. Plus, the book was really rich in Japanese culture. It was also at once horrifying and expected when Pumpkin eventually becomes the heir apparent to Hatsumomo's cruelty. Not to forget, all the memorable characters: our protagonist, Mameha, Hatsumomo, Nobu, Dr.Crab, Pumpkin and of course, the Chairman. Overall, a worthy read with rich details."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't put this book down!

A rather enjoyable, easy read that imparted a wealth of interesting cultural information. One learns the details and history of a Japanese sub-culture that shed some light, to the Western eye, on the Japanese mind. But does it really? Golden effortlessly takes the reader to Kyoto and we willingly go along. It's like a free vacation (of the virtual variety) that passes the time pleasantly enough but in the end is unsatisfying, forgettable and leaves us curiously ...unfulfilled. Did we see all the \\"must see\\" spots, and missed the \\"real\\" Japan? This is a book that we begin to resent, having asked too much of it. Things like, why this book? Why now? The deficiencies in plot and character development (and their disappearance), the \`Romance' ending, lead us to ask: Why did we come here in the first place?

I enjoyed the world that the author created, and the detail of the culture was extraordinary. The story has a couple of weak spots. One, I felt that the older geisha was not thoroughly believable. I just didn't feel the author explained well enough why she would be so against the protagonist as a little girl. The other issue was how quickly and neatly the story wraps up with the chairman, and her living in New York. I understand that the book was based on a real-life geisha, and perhaps I'm finding fault with the legitimate outcome of her life, but I just felt that it was a bit abrupt a wrap up. But these are small issues given the overall beautiful tapestry of the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"There's been enough said of the story and such, so I am just going to give a brief few things that I thought about this book.First of all, regardless of any \\"complaint\\" I might give, this was an awesome read. It was one of those books that I found myself not wanting to read towards the end; not because I wasn't interested, but because I didn't want it to be over. This book really brings you into a mesmerizing world that most people now can only imagine. I loved the authenticity. I'm not an expert on Japanese culture, but it seems that Arthur Golden really is quite knowledgeable and did appropriate research to make this book feel authentic. My only complaint, and this is just a tiny one, is that it is supposed to be a memoir and there is one major flaw with that - Sayuri (who's \\"memoir\\" this is) recounts everything - even every single kimono - with stunning detail. Of course, it is great to be able to have the detail in the book for the sake of the reader's imagination, but it's not realistic. I don't believe that any person that ever lived could recall such detail from throughout their life. So to me, in that way, it is flawed - it's not a believable memoir. I might've preferred it written as a novel about a girl, but it really doesn't matter. This book was awesome, and I find myself really wanting more.The only other complaint, which is a slightly bigger one, is that I really did not like the ending. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but there is such great detail getting to a certain point in her life, then from there to the present it is just like a brief snapshot. If it is supposed to be like a memoir, why would she talk so much about the first half of her life, and then give such a measly explanation for the rest of it? But again... I can forgive that flaw, and still give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What an amazing story!!! So wonderfully written. I am looking forward to Mr. Golden's next book. Im still searching for a book that can compare."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Two of my friends recommended this book and both swear they read it within 48 hours.

The novel features vividly drawn, vibrant characters and tells the fascinating story of a young girl, forced to leave home following the death of her mother to become one of the most highly regarded Geishas in pre-war Japan.The novel provides wonderful insight into Japanese culture and the world of the Geisha. I appreciate that Golden did not opt for an overwrought, overly sentimental ending to his novel (like Khaled Hosseini did in the Kite Runner). Memoirs of a Geisha is extremely well written, filled with genuine emotion and fully realized characters.I highly recommend this excellent novel, a story that will linger with you long after you have read it."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Many reviewers expressed disappointment that Memoirs is not a biography. I feel like it is an exceptional tale because it feels so much like one. Beginning from the impoverished life of an idealistic girl, I enjoyed the twists and turns that her life took to lead her to the life of Geisha. Nothing felt coincidental or forced to make the story flow to its exciting conclusion. I found myself pulling for Sayuri in a way that I had never pulled for another character in a novel. Golden's vivid description of settings, costumes, and characters is nothing short of spectacular. I have reread the book three times and each time I have gotten just as lost in 1930's Japan as the first time that I picked it up and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book is amazing. I was a little skeptical going in, especially because it is written by an american man of all people. But I could not put it down! You are immediately sympathetic to Chiyo, a little girl who's mother is dying. She finds herself in the attention of a man who she believes will adopt her when her mother dies- but instead he convinces her father to sell her and her sister to an Okiya, where they are separated for the rest of their lives. From that point on, the book tells the story of how she becomes a geisha, and the heartbreak that she endures even when she attains the goals she set for herself. Very well written, with fabulous attention to detail and characters that really capture your attention."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It was so good that I had to keep reminding myself that it was a novel and not real.

We have to remember it is not easy putting the whole story into a film-some parts have to be edited out. I enjoyed reading every page of the book and go enticed into all that was happening.

Can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a Japanese woman in US, I have been asked about geisha forso many times. Everytime I try to explain geisha is not prostitute. Ihave read this book, and now heard that this will be a big motion picture by Spielberg, I feel so powerless. How could I convince people if what Sayuri and other geisha do in this story is just like those of prostitute? Yes, they went to school and learned many arts, but that just make these geisha looks like the prostitute with art degree. The author failed to show readers how these skilles and knowledge were utilized in their life. The author did a nice try to tackle with this sensitive subject, but PLEASE, fellow readers, read more books about Japan, look for other infomation in any means. Try some Japanese literature by Japanese author. This book is a real fiction, and you can't possibly see a true picture from only one fictional story.And this is not well-written even as a fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a literature scholar, I have read hundreds of books. Many of those books have contained one or two interesting elements - a unique point of view or unusual vocabulary, some ideas worthy of thought, a well-developed character. After I finished reading Memoirs of a Geisha, however, I thought - for the first time in my long career of reading - here is a book in which only one single sentence feels out of place. The story is paced perfectly; the characters are real, richly portrayed, sensitively considered; the prose is simple and straightforward, with a startling sort of poetry that perhaps befits the culture it describes. The best part of the novel is the fascinating contrast between Nobu - a man whose brilliant and magnetic personality is offset by his gracelessness and rigidity - and the Chairman, whose deliberately gentle nature becomes by turns his weakness and his strength. Sayuri makes a bold and perceptive protagonist, and I had no trouble following her journeys, whether of action or thought. I hope those who are considering this book will trust my recommendation, and believe me when I say that Memoirs of a Geisha is a flawless work of fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I almost feel like I read two different books. I would rate the first two-thirds of it 5 stars, but the final third, only 3 stars. Like another reviewer said, this novel had the potential to be a classic, as close to perfect as a work of fiction can be, but sadly missed the mark.I found the first part of the story utterly gripping, with a main character, Chiyo, that I completely sympathized with. By the end of the book, I had not only lost all sympathy for her, I was totally turned off by the character and found her actions selfish and cruel.What makes it such a shame is that this novel is exquisitely researched, realized, and rich in character; it truly transported me to life in Japan in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s and taught me more about the life of a geisha than I ever thought I would know. Golden creates characters that are so multi-dimensional and that make us care so much, it's a letdown when they are discarded for his narrative convenience. The ending was improbable, sloppy and trite. It's as if Golden was hurrying to meet his publisher's deadline and just tied all the ends together in a neat little package. But by that time, I didn't even care that the heroine had achieved her dream, because I had come to care about the people that she trampled on to reach it. I also would have liked to see some sort of reunion or resolution having to do with her sister and other characters from the early part of the book, but maybe Golden felt that was too cliched. Who knows, but it was another thing that left me feeling strangely unsatisfied. How can a novel fall so short of its potential? Almost brilliant."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Arthur Golden's novel is a remarkable achievement, reading like an actual memoir, and so thoroughly researched you must keep reminding yourself that the jacket says it is a novel!Chiyo is a young girl sold by her father into slaverly, along with her sister, not long after her mother dies. Told from the innocent view of a 9yr old, the story does an excellent job of showing us how the truth of her situation is gradually revealed to her. (She truly thinks she is going to live with a nice family for a little while.) Actually, she has been sold to a slave-trader who then sells her to an \\"okiya\\" (like a roadhouse, except they \\"own\\" her until her debts are paid off)...the shocking part is this was totally legal. Geisha actually registered at an office of the government which had guidelines as to their \\"wages\\". She begins her tenure as a simple slave doing household chores and heavy cleaning, and the okiya mistress changes her name to Sayuri.Many people think a geisha is just someone who is a professional dancer or entertainer, they don't realize these girls were actually slave-cum-prostitutes whose only hope was to secure a very rich exclusive customer, called a \\"danna\\", in the hopes of someday buying their freedom. To do so was extremely difficult...they had to pay back the price of their \\"purchase\\", plus all the expenses of their education and support...and the okiya gets a cut of their income to begin with. Of course, they train as an apprentice under an accomplished geisha who not only gets a portion of their earnings, but will do so for the rest of their lives or until the apprentice geisha should manage to buy her freedom.The next-best scenario was to be legally adopted by the okiya mistress, in which case everything (including the okiya) will pass to them when the current owner dies...but they will not have their freedom as long as they are the adopted daughter of the okiya mistress.Mr. Golden does and excellent job of portraying, as the official review here says, \\"a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism, a too-revealing (or not revealing enough) glimpse of flesh under the kimono, or a vicious rumor spread by a rival.\\" Indeed, the constant struggle during Sayuri's heartbreaking transformation from pre-teen girl to adult woman is almost totally defined by those things. Her hope and strength is fanned by a chance meeting with \\"the Chairman\\" of a local company, who instantly wins her schoolgirl heart by treating her kindly on the street. Indeed, we could almost, in our fantasy of a modern world, believe he is a true revolutionary until we are reminded that he has a wife and children.But perhaps the best proof of Mr. Golden's shocking talent for putting himself totally inside the head of a fictional 9-year-old girl of pre-war Japan is \\"her\\" (the book is told in the first person) \\"explanation\\" of the supposed difference between a geisha and a prostitute, and Kyoto geisha's almost snobby self-elevation above geisha from the rest of Japan. Even early on, the young girl does not see herself and other geisha as prostitutes, even though their virginity is auctioned off at 13, and though after 18 they are allowed to service their customers in exchange for money or goods and services...although a high-class geisha is supposed to \\"save herself\\" for a wealthy, and hopefully powerful \\"danna\\" (regular and exclusive customer). Of course, the vast majority of a geisha's time, even one with a danna, was spent in the fine arts and entertainment, mostly in the form of attending social gatherings, drinking and telling dirty jokes or gossiping with the men, or just escorting them to public functions.The ending is slightly dissappointing--slightly--and that's a good thing. One could see how Mr. Golden would be tempted to \\"sew things up\\" nice and clean (e.g., \\"they lived happily ever after\\"), or to have some tragic dissappointment. Sayuri is not portrayed as some highly moralized girl lightyears ahead of her generation, but rather as a strong and resilient girl who is a product of her time, but nontheless rises above her circumstances by holding onto her dream and through sheer grit and determination not to bow to the circumstances. Sayuri has her version of a \\"happy ending\\", and indeed, her life has become wonderful so far as a girl growing up in her situation could possibly imagine it. Exactly how this comes about is somewhat of a surprize, if just a hair contrived.I think Arthur's realistic portrayal of what a \\"good life\\" would be in the eyes of such an unfortunate young girl makes the entire story far more realistic and powerful. The novel brought tears to my eyes on several occasions!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book when I was on a plane to Japan in 1998 (it's a long flight!) There has been a lot of controversy over it, mainly due to the fact that the source of most of Golden's information came back later and said he'd fictionalized too much of it. It is a very good read, and quite interesting, and I think we have to give him some literary license for this work. While many people push the notion that geisha were/are not prostitutes, could it not be perceivable that such actions did in fact take place from time to time? Try to focus more on the hardships that she faced, the nastiness and cattiness of the other geisha and her life at the end of the book. I'm sure the movie adaptation of the book due out shortly will start all the controversy once again! Don't read this book and take it as gospel for the history of Japan and it's geisha, but do read it nevertheless!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read in my life.

The young girl is then sent off to be a geisha and the other girl is sent to a whore house. It is a very touching, descriptive account of what it is like to be a geisha.

Again I read it only because it was a best seller for so long. It is a wonder that a caucasion is able to write so beautifully about a subject not well know by an American.

This is a well deserved winner."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Am I missing something? Review upon review praises this book. It's been a best seller for forever. So my expectations were high, but I felt a bit let down.I don't feel comfortable commenting on how accurate the historical aspect of this story is, because I know very little about Japanese culture.Instead I'll focus on the storytelling.The story certainly is an interesting one. Told in the first person, it is a fictitious geisha's account of her beginnings as an impoverished, orphaned child and traces her route to fame and fortune. There are despair-filled pitfalls, fateful coincidences, evil villains, mysterious benefactors, generous heroes. The story has all the ingredients of a rip-roaring success.The author's painstaking attention to detail tells me that he put considerable effort into researching this piece. His writing is seamless and beautiful.With all this, I should have adored the book. But I simply didn't. My main problem was the characters and their relationships with one another. The characters seemed underdrawn and hollow. I wonder how the main character became such a success.Her personality, as drawn, does nothing to help me figure that out. I do not understand her love affair with the chairman. Her love for him reeks of teenage infatuation. Is that the way things were back then? In fact, alot of the characters' behaviors seemed a little, well, juvenile I guess.I felt very detached from the action. This piece was beautifully written. But I felt that passion was sacrificed. This did not seem to me like a real woman telling the story.I was also disappointed that the story referred very little to the historic setting in which most of it took place. We learn about shortages and working in factories during WWII, but we learn very little about the psychological toll the war took on the Japanese. I guess I was hoping for more.While this was a superbly written piece, I've read better stories."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm a rare voice of disappointment: Geisha intrigued me early on - I'm fascinated by Japanese culture.

It follows a geisha from her sale to an okiya or geisha house as a child to her triumph over a competitive housemate and ending at her retirement to New York City.

Let's not mention Mother and Granny's cruelty. Hatsumomo is a very hateable character, she gets what she deserves. It's a story that you get attached and learn to know the characters (evern though they're real people) and feel for them. My personal favorite, besides Sayuri/Chiyo that is, is the geisha Mameha.

Sayuri's changed fortune, told with such expressiveness made me believe when first picking up the book and flicking through, reading the foreword, that is was a true biographical account - a credit to its author, Arthur Golden. Several subplots were lost along the way, for instance, what became of the Baron, Uchiro the painter,and of Auntie; what was Mameha's ultimate interest in the destruction of Hatsummo?, and perhaps the conclusion was a little too polished and abruptly ended - did we really all believe in this relationship Geisha Sayuri had with the mysterious chairman? The culture and grace of this Japanese history, however, was not lost within the novel, the elaborate and feminie details of traditional dress, customs and details of the life that these pampered women lead. The girlish heart of Sayuri and even Mameha allowed the reader to see the humanity beneath the painted expressions. Although being commercially pushed when it was released, this novel is a treasure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I have read this book three times and I still can't get over how good it is! Golden's recount of geisha life absolutely immerses you into their cultural world correcting any misconceptions one may have of these amazing women. He manages to paint Sayuri in a beautifully delicate light. I have recommended the book to all my friends and those who have read it agree with me in saying that it is an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I purchased this book a year ago, and it sat on my shelf until this summer when I realized it was on my summer reading list and decided to give it a try. I am so upset that I did not read this beautiful book sooner. Arthur Golden's debut novel is absolutely stunning. Memoirs of a Geisha enthralls you, whisks you away to another time and place. I became so involved in the story of Chiyo, a young Japanese girl who eventually becomes the reknowned geisha Sayuri after a long, difficult journey, that I forgot that the book was written by a man, and had to keep turning back to Mr. Golden's bio to remind myself. Arthur Golden writes so convincingly as a female, it's astonishing. This book sucked me in instantly, with the beautiful yet gritty descriptions, and I am still captivated with it. There's a reason why this book was on the best seller list for so long - it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Beautiful book that I could not believe was fiction.

I became so wrapped up in the story, I couldn't wait to get home from work and continue reading it. I do agree with a previous comment that the ending was a little abrupt - but it did not leave you disappointed. The world of a Geisha was illustrated so well. It made a foreign culture very understood and not so strange - all the while weaving in an amazing story about an intriguing woman.

Simply enchanting."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"CoverI absolutely adore this cover! The actress who plays Sayuri in the movie is one of my favorites and a stunning beauty. I am mesmerized by the Geisha culture and this cover fits the feel of this gorgeous tale.CharactersSayuri is such a great character. She starts the story being an afraid child and ends it being someone girls can really look up to. I found myself wanting to be her. I even used Sayuri for a username online for a while. I know, ridiculous. Each character brings their own personality to the story and none of them were created without their full potential shining through.StoryThis is still my favorite book, ever. Being obsessed with Japan helps a lot but even without that, it's an amazing tale of love of triumph in Japan pre American takeover. The only thing I don't like about this book is the inclusion of the US. Japan was such an outstanding place back then, and even though it's still a fantastic place, I would have liked it to stay the way it was in this book. This is my favorite period of time in Japan and I would have given anything to live in that time and place. This book is my dream come true. It's deep and memorable, and will be hard to pass in my opinion. Arthur Golden is a magical man.Quote(s)\\"If you aren't the woman I think you are, then this isn't the world I thought it was.\\"\\"He was like a song I'd heard once in fragments but had been singing in my mind ever since.\\"\\"I don't know when we'll see each other again or what the world will be like when we do.

I bought the book intending to read it over summer break, read a few pages, and never picked it up again. Fast forward to 2012, and I can't for the life of me figure out why I didn't read this book sooner. Wonderfully written, this book follows the life of Chiyo who later becomes known as the geisha Sayuri. Such a great read - finished the book in 3 days. You could often catch me reading a few pages here and there at my desk at work. I couldn't put it down!The character development was phenomenal and the vivid images used to depict Sayuri's feelings as she experienced the ups and downs of life helps the reader feel as though they're walking the streets of Gion alongside the main character. Even the side characters are depicted with enough detail to be painted clearly in one's mind, but the reader is never bogged down with too many details.If you want to learn more about Japanese history with a beautifully written story this is it.

This is the first time I actually felt that the changes made in the movie were acceptable. obviously a condensed version not full of holes as movie versions tend to be."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is a beautifully written book that takes you inside the fast-disappearing Geisha culture now nearly as exotic to Japanese as it is to Westerners. It transports the reader behind the paper screens of the Gion tea houses in Kyoto and underneath the makeup to experience the highly ritualized and secretive \\"flower and willow world\\" of the Geisha firsthand. The opening of this door to the West would be incredible enough on its own, but what makes Memoirs of a Geisha truly amazing is that it was written by a man, Arthur Golden, who was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee (albeit to a member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family, owners of the New York Times) and who graduated from high school there. He went on to earn an M.A. in Japanese history at Columbia University and to work in Tokyo.In the book, 9 year old Chiyo and her older sister are sold by their poverty-stricken father to a wealthy patron, who in turn takes them to separate geisha boarding houses in Kyoto. Chiyo works for many years in abject conditions before becoming a geisha herself, changing her name to Sayuri and working her way up the ladder of pre and post-WWII Japanese geisha society. The story is told pitch-perfectly in the first person, and you will believe Sayuri is sitting in her New York apartment in the present day, ever the perfect hostess recounting her fascinating life just for your ears.In writing Memoirs of a Geisha, Golden interviewed several actual Geisha for background information, including Mineko Iwasaki, who later regretted her cooperation and sued for breach of confidentiality. She reportedly was offended by Sayuri's virginity (mizuage in the book) being auctioned to the highest bidder. Iwasaki held that mizuage was more of an initiation party where a geisha's hairstyle would change, symbolizing her passage into womanhood. Iwasaki went on to write her own autobiography titled Geisha, a Life in the U.S. (Geisha of Gion in the U.K.), which went on to become an international bestseller in its own right.To clear up a misconception, a geisha is not a prostitute. Geisha are elite female entertainers and hostesses hired for parties and gatherings who specialize in Japanese arts such as traditional dances and songs. They undergo a very extensive training from an early age, and have a complex ranking system. During the American occupation of Japan following WWII, many prostitutes catering to servicemen wore feigned geisha clothing, thus becoming \\"counterfeit geisha\\" and confusing the term for many foreigners.Memoirs of a Geisha is an unforgettable read and is nearly impossible to put down.

I came to understand that the geisha was not a high priced call girl. This book also gave me a new perspective and respect for these women.

It was like an escape to another world, namely a small town in Japan called Gion. It taught be about the lives of a geisha. It's truly a love story that grasps you in the end (especially). The words as described in this book delve into the meaning of life as you will learn form a few of my favorite lines from the book: I felt as a bird must feel when it has flown across the ocean and comes upon a creature that knows its nest.------ Was life nothing more than a storm that constantly washed away what had been there only a moment before, and left behind something barren and unrecognizable?------ The swan who goes on living in its parents' tree will die; this is why those who are beautiful and talented bear the burden of finding their own way in the world.------ We lead our lives like water flowing down a hill, going more or less in one direction until we splash into something that forces us to find a new course.------ I did nothing more useful than to kneel there, feeling as much out of my element as a pigeon in a nest of falcons.------ Grief is a most peculiar thing; we're so helpless in the face of it. It's like a window that will simply open of its own accord. The room grows cold, and we can do nothing but shiver.

While reading this book, Golden creates such a vivid scenery for you, right in Japan, and with each further reading you grow fonder of the main character Sayuri.

This job provided women a certain independence from the everyday life of the world, and at the same time, it bound them to the whims of men. This role was that of a geisha, a woman whose job consisted of entertaining men.This is the world that 'Memoirs of a Geisha' takes place. In the years before WWII, a young girl named Chiyo is orphaned and taken into a geisha house (okiya) as a maid. Years later, Chiyo takes on a new name, Sayuri, and becomes one of the most well-known geisha in Japan. She falls in love, combats a vindictive and cruel geisha named Hatsumomo, and lives a lifestyle that many of us can hardly imagine.I thoroughly enjoy reading this book. I put this in present tense not because I am not finished, but because I have reread this story several times since I was first given this book, and I enjoy it all the more each time I read it. The allure of Gion, the magic of the geisha, and the vividly colorful characters in the story make this book appealing to all people, of mostly all ages (I received this book last X-mas at fifteen).Growing up as half-Japanese, I found the book even more interesting as an exotic part of my culture. By reading 'Memoirs', I was learning more about my Japanese heritage. Descriptions of the preparations of a geisha, of Sayuri's thoughts and emotions, and her perception of the emotions of others were so realistic, it seemed as if the author had been in the room snapping pictures of everyone's expressions of anger, delight, jealousy, or attraction.In mentioning attraction, one especially interesting factor in the character Sayuri was her blue-grey eyes. Probably 98.9% of Japanese people have dark brown eyes, so giving Sayuri the standout quality of having oddly colored eyes made it more interesting to read about how others reacted to her eyes. Yet had she had blonde hair, I doubt so many would have been impressed as much as they would be horrified!There is a certain sadness about this story, in that the traditions of the geisha are slipping away, and that the magical world of Gion will soon vanish altogether. Read 'Memoirs of a Geisha', if not for the sole purpose of learning about a cultural tradition that is unique of Japanese society, and is more in danger than the spotted owl of becoming extinct."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This morning I finished Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden.

The characters are very distinct and real; they make you feel like you're living in the book. The book almost reads like a fantasy novel because the culture is so vibrant, so different.Personally, I was hooked from the beginning.

Iwasaki's claim that the novel is a distortion of her life story did little to diminish my attention span as I read this book. I simply could not put it down. In fact, I used the People magazine article about her as a bookmark.Anyway, I thought this novel would be all about feet-binding and sex, but it's actually very tastefully written and focuses more on the intense competitiveness between Geisha than on their sexual lives--competition for security in the form of a wealthy danna, or sponsor. This novel was much better than I'd expected. I think the author did a great job considering he was writing in a woman's voice and dealing with such a mysterious and private world."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Never in my life have I read a book that so thoroughly immersed me into a subject and society which I knew next to nothing about (and half of what I did think I knew was wrong!).You get a full education into what the life, the society and the behaviors of geishas was. You also get a great feeling for life in pre-WWII Japan, particularly among the upper classes. And, during the course of the book, WWII comes to that country, and we see its effect on the world we've come to know and appreciate.But don't think this is a dry text book. NOT AT ALL. We get totally caught up in the lives of our heroine, as well as with the political machinations of the world of the geisha. It's a juicy novel, full of twists and turns and tricks and treachery. It's a fast read, too, and when it's done, you'll be sad that you can't spend more time with these characters.If you're thinking this book will have lots of sex, then you'll be disappointed.

But it holds SO many pleasures for the reader, and it gets my highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time--and probably not the last.

I only used to read suspense-type books. After reading Memoirs, I have opened my mind to more books like this and have found another favorite because of it.I very highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden is an extraordinary novel that discusses the journey of a young girl in a quest to become an honorable geisha. Golden describes the main character, Sayuri, which is her geisha name, her trials and tribulations from childhood to adulthood that help shape the kind of person she is in the present time. During Sayuri's adventures she learns many priceless lessons that cannot be found anywhere else. This fascinating novel that describes Sayuri's strong will and determinations to become a respectable geisha are characteristics that make this story worthwhile.Sayuri is the main character of this novel who learns she must go through rough times in order to become successful. Along with Golden's brilliant writing techniques, Sayuri's situation in the novel is intriguing. A quote from the end of this novel that proves these two aspects are, \\"Whatever our struggles and triumphs, however we may suffer them, all too soon they bleed and wash, just like watery ink on paper,\\" (428). By reading this quote and expecting many others as these makes the reader want more. This quote, just like many others, also makes you feel the character as well.The story brings a description of Sayuri's life through her obstacles. Golden's writing techniques are very intriguing and interesting to the reader as well. His commentary and descriptions in the novel pulls you into the story line. I am impressed by how well written this novel turned out to be. Golden uses his vivid imagination to bring his character to life. While Sayuri is talking about her fascination with Mr. Tanaka, a man she has encountered, Golden writes, \\"The difference between the life here at the Tanakas' house and life in Yoroido was as great as the difference between the odor of something cooking and a mouthful of delicious food,\\" (27). Golden's writing wants to pull you into his story. With his creative descriptions of his character in his writing, it makes you not want to put down this book. Trust, when you read this book, you will like it so much you will not want to put it down.The author also uses many similes throughout the novel that are impressing to the reader. By using these it makes the reader imagine how the comparisons relate to each other. These certainly brought me into the book even more. When Sayuri describes some pain that she experiences during her training to be a geisha, she says, \\"I felt as sore as a rock must feel when the waterfall has pounded on it all day long,\\" (34). Reading this one line made me imagine that actual scene. It was very descriptive, but vague. This is why I admire Golden's writing style. There are many other lines such as these in the book that are as descriptive as this.This novel is definitely a novel that I would recommend for any reader. Not only does this book contain many intriguing phrases, but it also has a good story line. If you are the type of person that enjoys novels about overcoming obstacles, then you will love this book. Also, considering this novel was written by a man, and described the narrator as a woman is very impressing. I believe that that is something hard to do. Memoirs of a Geisha is a great novel that you will never want to put down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I loved this book because it makes you feel like you are in Gion with the beautiful Sayuri. Arthur Golden has done a great job describing in detail the geisha world of elegant kimonos, extravagent hairstyles, exotic makeup, and the geisha's busy schedule, moving from teahouse to teahouse. The silly lives of these materialistic, splenetic, yet, heroic geisha. Many westerners believe that these women are prostitutes, but in reality they are artists. They regale the men at business parties by dancing, serving saki, and engaging in conversation. Women did not choose to be geisha, but they had no other choice. During the 1930s, there were on average 80,000 geisha; today, about 10,000 due to the westernization of the Japanese culture. Today, women choose to be geisha. Golden allows you to learn about these artisans by introducing Chiyo Sakamoto at age nine. Chiyo later is Sayuri Nitta after she becomes an apprentice geisha and the adopted daughter of the Nitta okiya. After reading this book, you learn to respect these artisans."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I read this particular book there were some preconceived ideals in my mind pertaining to geishas. I always thought geishas were prostitutes, but I was so wrong. I discovered geishas were much more dedicated to the arts and that they have to actually attend school in order to become a geisha.However, the story of Chiyo (Sayuri) and her sister Satsu, being sold from their fishing village in order to become geishas. I never thought of Sayuri as a prostitute, but rather as a slave pretty similiar to plesage realationships in New Orleans. Yes Sayuri did not have to cook and clean once she became a geisha, but she had to surpress her feelings for the man whom she truly loved and could not really express her feelings. I hated and cared for the character Hatsumomo who was basically jealous of Sayuri and made Sayuri's life at the Okyia pure hell. What really bothered me was the rivalary that was placed between Sayuri and Pumpkin which cost both of these young girls a very valuable frienship. This book had so many twists and turns in it that I became engrossed and learned so much about geisha.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about geishas, but I also know that the author of this book has been sued by the geisha in which gave him this particular memoirs. So the geisha that sued Arthur Golden has decided to tell her side of the story which I will read in the next couple of months. I would like to discover what a real geisha has to say as opposed to an American giving us a second hand story of something he may never fully understand."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha is certainly one of the best books I've ever read, the author so fully captivates the reader that by then end when I realised that it was not in fact written from a geisha's actualy memoirs I felt decived and surprised. This feeling of deception has turned into an enormous amount of respect for Arthur Golden."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"If you want a good example of the depravity of the current &quot;Oriental&quot; (Orientals are rugs, not people as R. Lee has said) craze, this is the book. A good example of how things Japanese (and other Asian cultures too) are romanticized and fetishized. I dare you to go to Japan and ask (or even ask some Japanese Americans) whether this picture is relevant in any way to their lives. Don't mistake this book for reality in any way. Don't believe that this gives you a true picture of Japanese culture. This is literally a white man's fiction, no matter how beautifully written. Just keep this in mind even if you do read the book."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story behind the book is all too familiar now, and reads like a played out mantra. Guy who majors in Japanese studies in an Ivy League university seeks out an ex-geisha who decides to provide an expose into the water trade.That much of the actual circumstances was intriguing enough to be incorporated into the novel. The rest is supposed to illustrate the author's ability to vicariously chronicle the tale of Sayuri Nitta.Or is it?As a historian, I doubt any can fault him on accuracy. After all, he did gain access to two reliable sources on the profession and the historical events. (one being the ex-geisha, and the other is Liza Dalby, an anthropology student who trained as an apprentice or maiko).The story itself starts out interestingly enough. Child leaving behind the remnants of idyll family life to eke out an existence in the city, after losing her father. There, she is exposed to life in the west, and eventually settles in America. The story is set in the turbulent post-restoration years in Japan's history. Readers of Japanese literature would recognize the general outline as somewhat similar to that of Daughter of a Samurai, by Etsu Sugimoto.Once the girl Sayuri arrives in Kyoto, she gains an instant enemy in Hatsumomo. Adopted by another well known geisha, Mameha, they stoop to no less than destroying Hatsumomo. Mameha then reveals that it was the Chairman whom Sayuri desired some 20 years prior who led her to adopt Sayuri as a &quot;little sister&quot;. Golden paints a strange picture of Sayuri fixated with the same man for some 20 years starting at barely 10 years old.The flawed Nobu would have made a better man for Sayuri and made for a more interesting ending. He seemingly embodies the traits that make him all the more human. The Chairman's character remains undeveloped despite the seminal role he plays in the events.The book probably wouldn't receive many harsh reviews if it didn't allude to something greater. An unexpected twist or a hint of giri-nijo (duty/loyalty against the morally right decision) so prevalant in Japanese literature to offset all the &quot;machiavellian scheming&quot; (as one reviewer puts it) might have been the solution.The most troubling aspect is that Golden - for all the pretensions of cultural accuracy and authenticity - would stoop to chronicling a catfight for interest, hints at pandering to the lowest common denominator.As an aside, it was slightly humorous to find groups of tourists clutching &quot;Memoirs&quot; while wandering around in Kyoto last year. ...."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I am a psychoanalyst and have for years been fascinated by people's responses to literature. Here's something well-known in my field but talked about very little outside it: the response of a reader to a book like Memoirs of a Geisha is a test of the reader's ability to tolerate a certain kind of psychic stress. This certainly doesn't suggest that people who don't like the book have something wrong with them. But the novel is an indisputable tour de force, and even the Japanese are fascinated by the author's ability to project himself into this unusual world. Are there problems with the book? No doubt there are. But if you're puzzled by some of the strongly negative reviews, just keep in mind that not everyone is capable of responding to a book like this one, because not everyone brings sufficient empathy to the task. I don't mean to suggest that these are people who kick their dogs, but, well, you get the idea."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I tried to read this book for my book club, but gave up about midway through. I wish I could see in this book what most others seem to see. Something was missing. To me, it was only too evident that it was a male author trying to write from the perspective of a woman--clearly fascinated by all the little trappings of femininity, but somehow missing the heart and soul of a woman. (And for the record, there are some men who write successfully from other points of view--that's not the issue.) He also clung to the historical details at the expense of creating a memorable protagonist.I thought I was just being my usual curmudgeonly self, but my husband recently read this book and felt the same. So disappointing!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Most of the book has been changed. And not for the better. It has taken on a totally different perspective and lacks in most areas. Listening to this for the first time made me laugh in disgust. They went as far as changing the ending.

By the time I finished the tape, I tossed it in the trash where it belonged."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"the good points: well-written book, clear and good to follow, a sympathetic main character, an engrossing view into a world about which i previously knew nothing, and some spicy and unique characters...the bad points: a whole book about emotionally shallow people in almost entirely duplicitous relationships, everybody's got something up their sleeves, and as for the women, especially the young ones, they're trapped in their generally miserable lives... now of course, it could be argued that this doesn't make the book itself bad per se, because it's just what the book's about, but i could also argue, why would someone (even me, much less the writer), be so engrossed in a world that's hardly one iota devoted to true honesty and open, real and equal communication? now granted, the main character's goal throughout the entire book was to be honest with and accepted and loved and cherished (and supported) by a rich businessman (essentially an emotional stand-in for her idealized father, who abandoned her and sold her into slavery, a vein which never gets explored), but my take on that is - if that's the whole purpose of a person's life, to be loved by another, then YUCK!what a shallow goal! (and incidentally, how &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;middle-class American&quot; is that goal?! - &quot;true love&quot; and &quot;romance&quot;!!) what about deep inner exploration, being true to ourselves, having honest friendships not based on duplicity and power and money?i guess i just question why an author chooses to write such a stellar book about such an emotionally shallow topic...unless at some level that's where he himself is at..."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The book has some good parts, but overall, the book is weak in character development. The development of the main character, Sayuri, was poor. The book kept mentioning that the main character was clever and had a &quot;water&quot; personality, but did very little to protray these qualities. In addition, the majority of the supporting characters were one dimensional and extremely predictable, except for Nobu, who was excellently protrayed.The book was informative on the life and society of geisha. However, the book seem to concentrate the character development around the informative aspect of being a geisha. Once there was nothing else to write about being a geisha, the book sped to the ending.If you want to read this book, borrow it from a friend or the library. The book is definitely not worth owning."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The novel starts out as an enjoyable read, and it was very interesting--I couldn't put it down. Until I got about two-thirds of the way through, at which point it seemed to be penned by Danielle Steele. from the point when the war ended, and American troops went through Japan, smiling and giving out candy, the people realized the Americans weren't the bad people they were made out to be,(to paraphrase book). Ugh, I don't think people are so stupid that they can be won over by chocolate! From there, it turns into a Danielle Steele novel, pur formula, in which love conquers all and a penthouse in New York helps, too. It will make a great movie, I'm sure."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Cover was torn, writing inside book, dog-eared pages, cheap edition - book was NOT in good condition - too much $ for the value."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I knew what I wanted, and I am glad I found it for a price I could afford!

At first I thought it was going to be boring and nothing but an old man rambling on but I was wrong! The author did a vey good job of portraying Sayuri's life. very well, in fact, that if it wasn't on the fiction shelf , you might have thought that this was the biography of a real person.

I wasn't surprised to hear he had read it because he reads anything on Japan. I was shocked to hear him tell me though he was disappointed with it. By the end of the book, I understood, but I still say this is an excellent read.The problems are 1. it is a sappy love story much like a harlequin novel, BUT it is set in exotic japan full of history and culture you probably don't know about, so will enjoy. old japan hands probably won't. I equate this to the movie Titanic, a sappy love story that everyone should see. 2. if the author writes another book (and please do), please stop using metaphors so often. by the end of the book, this overused literary technique was nauseating.Lastly, my compliments to the author for getting the japanese culture and daily conversation of the men and their attitudes toward women spot on."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I read this book on vacation last year. Upon finishing this book, I could not believe that it was a work of fiction. The characters were so real and I got so caught up in their stories and what motivated them to do the things that they did.

It sat around for two or three weeks on my desk untouched because I didn't think I had any interest in Geishas. But when I started to read it, I couldn't put it down. It is the story of the heart of a young girl, from childhood to old age, and it crosses all culture lines. Though written by a man, it beautifully paints the feelings and thoughts of most women as they learn to deal with love and duty, which often are so far apart. A must read for women of all ages!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I don't know anything about the life of a geisha, or Japan, but as a woman I found that Arthur Golden's voice rang hollow in his depition of a woman in the latter part of the book. The continued 'girlish' behaviour of a thirty year old woman, who had experienced more challenges in her life than most members of a book club put together made me doubt other aspects of the book as well. The narrative suddenly seemed rather flat and empty as Mr Golden appeared to tire of his task and wrapped up the book in a couple of chapters."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Fantastic storytelling! Explores the life of an individual isolated in a world that cages women into a perpetual state of inconsequence.

After the first couple of chapters I was hooked. It is amazing how a man can go with research , and memoirs and get a good grasp of a woman(especially of Japan in that period, or a woman period) might feel in various situations. A truly enjoyable read. For those that feel his writing was too American prone at the end, or that it was one demesional, please do your reasearch on Japan right prior and afterWWII and you will see where much of this comes from. Also I have lived in Gion, and Japan in general is a complex place, where men emotionally(as in the chairman and etc) are not always 3rd dimensional."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was like a geisha; lots of superficial beauty, but nothing substantial underneath. The cultural details (how to wrap a kimono, when to flash the underside of your arm) were enough to keep me engrossed, but I still have no understanding of the role of a geisha. Excuse me for being cynical, but I don't understand why anyone would pay lots of money for a geisha's company if he couldn't sleep with her at the end of the encounter. It certainly wouldn't be for the scintillating conversation; not if the dialogue in this book is any indication."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I couldn't help but be sucked right into this book. It gives the reader a deep look into the soul of the main character Sayuri. If you just read the book without looking at who wrote the book, you would not think that a man wrote this book. Simply because the actions, feelings, and thoughts of Sayuri are expressed so clearly as if written from the heart of a woman. This book also teaches the reader that the Geisha were an established class of women who worked hard to entertain the upper class gentleman. They were not what some Americans perceive them to be. Instead they are the upper class woman, with the know-all to entertain with class."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"What makes this book so dramatical and interesting is probably the exotic incidents and exceptional events going on in Sayuri's life. It's something you can read anywhere without being interrupted or annoyed. At least, if you're a great fan of Asian fiction and history (or rather the country itself) this is a great choice for you.I love pretty much everything there is about Japan, so this book was not an exception for me. I read the entire thing in a few days and was hungry for more.I appreciate the fiction in the book, although I dislike the fact that it has not actually occurred.I felt rather deceived midst in the book where I found the name of a \\"famous painter\\", whom I searched for on Google. The individual was no such thing as an artist (probably not even an individual), and I then found plenty of forums confirming my theory that it wasn't really the story of a young Japanese woman's life as a geisha in Gion. This was something someone made up.Anyhow, I decided not to care whether or not it was fiction. The only thing I felt annoyed about was the fact that the author put that deceiving note in the beginning of the book. That's what made me feel more infatuated with the story.I do recommend you buy and read this book as it is, it's a lovely tale full of romance and drama. As a Japanese all-fan you don't want to skip this one!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I can't tell you how many times I prefer the book to the movie. The book itself is written just the way I would have expected from a Geisha of that time period. It is much like a historical documentary told from the first perspective and that makes it even more indulging.Reading it as a woman I could relate to Chiyo's/Sayuri's emotional ups and downs throughout the whole novel. The array of characters are so life like that I often forgot I was reading a piece of fiction."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was wonderfull.

It is beautifully written and very entertaining."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Back in college, I was taking 18-23+ credit hours a semester, which meant many late nights for me.

When telling Nitta Sauyri's story, Golden uses exquisite language to describe the beauty of kimonos, lets us in on the intricacies of a geisha's beauty regiment, and discloses the secrets of entertaining rich and powerful men."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"It has been a long time (a year or more now) since I read this book, and still I think of it.

I highly recommend this to anyone, and it will definitely be on my children's home school reading list when they are old enough. I did not watch the movie, so I can't compare the two.

Six months later, her parents are dead and she is in Kyoto, far removed from her fishing village, to begin a new life. Far from the smell of fish and poverty, she is introduced to the world of silk kimonos, flirtations, conversations and tea.She is a novice geisha at 14 years and her name is changed to Sayuri. To the age of 19 her whole purpose in life was to win the affections of a businessman she calls The Chairman. He appears never to notice her and she realises the danger of focusing only on what isn't in her life.She is forced to leave the okiya during the war to look for work sewing parachutes. After the war she resumes her geisha career where she again meets The Chairman. She eventually attains her goal and becomes his mistress to serve him three or four days a week.The meticulous layers of the geisha kimono depicts the \`onion-life' of her persona; the layers that cover her true self to present a desirable image in a world of pleasing, teasing, desiring and acquiescing. It is also a competitive, business-like and manipulative world. The novel is a fluid, but factual, account of Sayuri's life of subservience yet respect, of confinement yet refinement. It is neither emotive nor adventurous. It is as orderly and as methodical, but nevertheless as interesting, as making tea.Martina Nicolls, Author of \\"The Sudan Curse\\" and \\"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\\""},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"An amazing book, I couldn't put it down- all my friends enjoyed it.

I felt she was really talking; it doesn't read like a novel, yet it does have a good plot. However, I only give it four stars for I felt the plot fell apart at the end. A good story should balance out at the end, and as a reader i like the people to get their just deserts in a book, since in real life they don't - at least, not as far as we can see. in this case everything was lopsided at the end, smugness and deceit getting rewarded, those who were truly good just vanishing without a second thought.

I liked it, don't mistake me, but I felt that it was in some ways like looking at the world of Sayuri through a dark glass, or a layer of thin silk. She goes through many travails, but despite lengthy descriptions of her life, I didn't feel pulled into it, quite. This may be due to the author being male, and trying to describe the life of a very female woman, I'm not sure. It was certainly full of much detail and description of the lives Geisha lead, but I didn't ever really feel drawn into a depth of emotion for the protagonist. It all seemed rather remote."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I couldnt put it down.

She is a master of the proverbial turning lemons into lemonade. She takes devestation and conqueres it with beauty and grace and eventualy aligns herself with people who love and appreciate her. I know that the characters are fictional, but I still keep my eyes open for a kimono clad woman on Fifth Avenue with blue eyes on a tranquil face to tell her thank you for her story."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Seeing this book week after week on the best sellers' lists I thought it would be worth a good read. Well, it started off fine enough but I was bored by the end. Her character never rang true to life for me. She gave the same bad treatment back to people that she had received from some. The ending was trite. I think Mr. Golden didn't know how to end this story so he just wrapped up loose ends. My bookclub read this book this month. Glad I wasn't the one that recommended it. This could have been a truly grand novel. Too bad."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"with Golden's demand for Metaphors with Extra Velveeta. Memoirs does not have one redeeming quality. Cartoonish characters; trite plot, tedious dialogue; contrived ending. It took Golden over 400 insufferable pages just to say that Cinderella-san lived happily ever after. I feel like a reader adrfit in a salty sea of really bad writing. (Mr. Golden, PLEASE don't use my metaphor in your next book!)"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"As a long-time fan of kimono history and the images of geisha, I was really looking forward to this book. For what *I* wanted (day-in-the-life geisha stories, history), the book was a great deal of fun. For those looking for a romance, torrid or otherwise, try another book. While it was interesting to know that the female main character was the creation of a male writer, I don't think his achievement is as amazing as some reviews have made it seem. The narrator, although very likable, has little real depth and her devotion to her (boring) dream love is silly and tedious - and it should not be surprising that a man can depict such a creature just as well as a woman writer! I did like the book, however. I loved the description of the steps involved in becoming a geisha and the descriptions of the kimono. Anyone who is interested in Japanese cultural history or a somewhat decorous view of the &quot;floating world&quot; will enjoy this story because these historical points are so well-written and richly drawn. It is when the author is shaping the &quot;story&quot; part of the book that things bog down. The characters are a flat lot who act more in the service of plot than of character. Rather than following naturally from situation or personality, their motivations serve only to further the author's desire to impart interesting facts about geisha. The (thankfully limited) portions of the book taking place after WWII and the effective end of the geisha as anything but cultural curiosities are cursory and dull. Many readers will be able to anticipate the ending from early on in the story and will be bracing for the influx of schmaltz as they near the back cover. Thankfully, the end is surprisingly quick and thus relatively painless. It also has surprisingly little impact."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I think this story might have worked if it had been written in the third person. It takes a much better author than Golden to pull something like this off. In third person there would have been some opportunity (and real challenge) to draw the narrator in more detail, but as it is she comes off as papermache. There is never a deep emotion from her, everything happens on the surface. Of course a male author can write a female character well -- but not in this case. Golden took the convenient way out, and the result is stereotype that is (at worst) offensive and (at best) boring."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I'm not very found of novels, but when I started this book I could not put it down until the end.

I was drawn into the plot."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a novel that should satisfy any reader's appetite for characters who live and places that are real. The protaganist is Sayuri whom we follow from her involuntary servitide to an 'okiya', a sort of boarding house for geisha, through her training as a geisha, to her position as one of the most adored in her profession. Through the author's simple prose and ample, but not overstated, use of detail, we are able to be in Sayuri's world; we are in the Gion teahouses with her while she displays her subtle graces to her wealthy customers and we come to understand the often intricate relationships between customer and geisha. Sayuri is a strong character who has aspirations even in the midst of the hardships of her servitude, the depression of the 1930s, and WW2. She is not perfect and I frequently thought her unlikeable; she is not immune from jealousy and treachery. But one very easily admires her strengths and is able to empathize with her actions in the setting of another culture. The author, who is male, has done his research well. He has succeeded in placing the readers in another culture and letting them enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This was one of those books you just could not put down.

I hadn't realized that it was fiction, and it was presented in such a way that fidning this out at the end was almost jarring. I have read since that there are some inaccuracies, but some of that may be just from the fact that the floating world is so secretive. As another reviewer noted, the characters did seem to have more American, or at least Western points of view, which initially lead me to identify with them, but later made me realize that this sacrifices the realism I would have preferred. As this is from another culture in another time, it's very unlikely to find modern western thought. I'm still glad I read the book and continue to love the movie."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha after all is a novel.

Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden was truly a wonderful novel to read from beginning to end. At first I was skeptical about reading the book because I was scared that the reading experience wouldn't give me the feeling of reading from a Japanese geisha. However, through the course of reading the story I was pretty convinced that I was reading an actual memoir. The story starts off slow but gradually quickens the pace once Chiyo (later known as Sayuri) is thrown into the world of geishas. Chiyo's character as first seems weak but the author is clever on building on her strength through her actions. When the antagonist of the story is presented, the conflict between the two is atypical nonetheless, readers can sympathize with Chiyo by the pains and struggles she must go through to beat Hatsumono. While the dialogue in the novel could be a bit dragged out and pointless there were a few moments where the dialogue was clever and interesting. Golden makes an effort to include information about geisha that average people wouldn't understand, it's helpful yet at the same time it seems out of context. Although that is true, this book gives an exceptional insight into the life of a geisha and clears the stereotypical thought of a geisha being a prostitute. Overall, the storyline flows beautifully and the book ended on a perfect note. Some may not be inclined to read this book because of the Japanese culture or the time period it is set in but this should not stop them. If one wants to enjoy a book full of plot twists and understand the harsh life of a geisha this book is definitely the one to pick up and read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This book was one of the most addicting and smooth reading books that I have read. It opened my mind to a small part of the Japanese culture. I was really surprise by the different views by which the people lived there lives. I was astonished at how well the writer explained the cities, the people, and the mindsets to someone who had no background knowledge. The story was places in a time period surrounding War World II, which gave a view from a Japanese civilian perspective of the war. The book was a good mix of learning a new world and being pulled to keep reading from the story line."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I just finished this book and I am tempted to read it again right now!!!! I have not read a book this good in so long and feel any other book I read will be a let down. I felt so attached to the charecters and still think of Nobu-san and the Chairman and Sayuri multiple times a day!!! I would highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"When I was younger, I was obsessed with Japanese culture. I tried to learn Japanese, read every book set in Japan I could manage and even made my mom take me out for sushi in the cultured city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, years before sushi was \\"hip.\\" Since then the obsession has died off considerably, but I still feel something for Japan. I had heard that \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by Arthur Golden was a fantastic read from just about everyone, including my mom and hair-dresser, but never managed to pick it up. Finally last week I decided to stop procrastinating and re-visit my childhood obsession.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is set in Japan in the 1930s and '40s. It tells the story of Chiyo Sakumoto who becomes Sayuri Nitta, one of the most famous geisha of her day. Chiyo is sold by her ailing parents to an okiya (essentially a geisha house) in the Gion area of Japan. She works for the Nitta \\"family\\" - Granny, Mother, Auntie and the house's sole geisha, Hatsumomo. In an okiya, the \\"family\\" isn't a real family at all; Granny, Mother and Auntie are all former geisha who now live and work together in the okiya. Chiyo is chosen by Granny because of her unusual eyes, which are a strange mix of blue-grey.Hatsumomo immediately realizes that Chiyo will grow up to be a very famous and successful geisha because of these unique eyes and her natural beauty and sets out to ruin Chiyo's chances of becoming a geisha. For years Hatusumomo tortures Chiyo while she works as a maid in the okiya and even convinces the Nitta's to pull Chiyo out of geisha school, cementing her future as a maid. Chiyo hates living in the okiya and feels trapped in her life as a maid until she meets the Chairman. She meets him when she is only a girl, but she is completely infatuated with the Chairman and this infatuation drives her to become a great geisha. Perhaps if she becomes well-known enough, the Chairman will one day take her as a his mistress, which is the most a geisha can ever hope for.\\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" completely rocked my world. Not only is a heart-breaking love story, but Chiyo's determination is inspiring. Golden creates a beautiful creature with Chiyo and really utilizes the geisha's transformation from apprentice to full-fledged geisha to show Chiyo's development into a mature woman. Reading Golden's style was also a treat. His writing is amazingly poetic, but not pretentious. I imagine that \\"Memoirs\\" took him years and years to write because all of his metaphors are so clever and well thought out. I'm usually not one for description, but Golden's was wonderful and only added to the elegance of the story.But this book is about more than the story. The reader also passively learns so much about Japanese culture! I love to travel, but have never really been into Japan. All I used to associate with Japan was big buildings and technology, but now that I have learned about its history, it has definitely made my shortlist of must-see destinations.If you appreciate a good, intelligent love story, then \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is a good choice. It's a beautiful book and story that will totally capture you."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The story is indeed, very well written, as many have said, and well detailed, giving an interesting insight into every day life for a geiko (Kyoto geisha) in training. The only problem is that not all of his facts are straight. While he does detail things very well--their costuming, their hairstyles, their traditions, etc.--he portrays the geisha from the Western point of view, bordering on prostitute. As the geisha he interviewed and got many of his facts from states, this is a book about a prostitute. Geisha are entertainers, \\"people of art\\" or \\"woman of art\\" as geiko means. They, as Arthur Golden put it himself, \\"sell art, not bodies,\\" yet he goes to portray them all as not becoming true geisha until they have sold their virginity. This never happened in geisha history, and still does not today. A maiko, or apprentice geiko, has a ceremony called \\"mizuage,\\" as her sort of coming-of-age ceremony, but for a maiko it is simply that; a ceremony. There is no selling of their virginity. And the parties, known as ozashiki, have more to do with a good time and talking about the arts, rather than being a bunch of playful banter. While a geiko may elude to something, guests know never to expect anything more.As for the plot and the story, other than a Japanese girl having blue eyes, which is genetically impossible for a true Japanese, I found the story very engaging and exciting. It is a unique tale, set in a very romantic period. A very wonderful love story, but I was a little disappointed to see some of the flaws about accuracy. I would still recommend it as a good read, but not as a true \\"historical fiction.\\" And I certainly wouldn't recommend it as a good read about geisha! Fiction, yes; actually historical, not quite. I would rate this book 3.5 if I could, but I can only do whole stars, so I will give it the benefit of a doubt and give it a 4."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The first time I read this, about a year after it came out, I was not aware of the controversy that surrounded Mr. Golden's work due to the inaccuracies in this book. I'm sure that by now most people know of the controversies and what not, so I won't get into that. I didn't learn of the mistakes/inaccuracies until after I read the book a second time, and even then, Mr. Golden has a fantastic and smooth writing style, with good details and dialogue, so this book is still a highly enjoyable read, just don't use this book as a completely accurate factual source on the world of geisha."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is one of my all time favorites because it mixes love, scandal and historical fiction all into one book.

This is a good book for vacations and lazy rainy afternoons."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"The writing style of this book is prose-like. Chiyo (soon to become Sayuri) speaks with humor and pathos as she tells her story. Her life story spans from 1929 until the 1960s, as she and her sister are sold to a Geisha house by their Father as their Mother lays near death. The girls are separated, however. The older sister is sold to a house of prostitution because she lacks Chiyo's delicate beauty.Chiyo's life is dismal and unhappy under Hatsumomo, the reigning geisha, a cruel young woman who sees a threat in Chiyo. She shares space with another orphan, nicknamed Pumpkin. They are eventually turned against each other by Hatsumomo's mischief. Soon, Chiyo loses her status as trainee due to Hatsumomo's maneuvering and she can now look forward to a life of drudgery as a maid. However, Chiyo is taken under wing by Hatsumomo's archenemy and main rival, the beautiful Mameha, who transforms her into a first rate geisha in which her name changes to Sayuri. In fact, events between Sayuri and Hatsumomo come to a head and a decision is made regarding them. This story tells about the life of Sayuri and her secret love, the Chairman, a man who shows her a kindness when she is a child. His kindness to her turns into love on Sayuri's part.The story is well written but has a rushed feel to the ending. There were some loose ends that could have been addressed, such as what happens to Hatsumomo once she and Sayuri have their final conflict; and a more in depth look at her relationship with the Chairman. Still, I recommend this book to anyone interested in a geisha's life."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"A fantastic book !

It's stories about Japan's struggle during the war were incredible and seemed quite real. It was a great mixture of fact and fiction.

It's hard to find artistic writings with sense, especially because English is not my first language, but this is the one. The author researchs so much details of the specific Geisha world (Gion) in depth, which is amazingly wonderful- I couldn't believe the author is non-Japanese and, furthermore, &quot;male&quot; creature. It could be said a &quot;well-done&quot; writing. However, as a story, it's nothing more than ordinary one- especially the ending. Is it a fantasy of the author? It's far from sense of reality- at least to me. I was very disappointed with the ending; nevertheless, I give the credit for the writing style, the author's effort and enthusiasm. It's worth to read in any way."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"Like many Amazon customers, I enjoy reading other reader's reviews, especially the reviews that give one or two stars to a book that most people give 4 or 5 to. I just finished reading Memoirs and I am limp from it- I found it beautiful and seductive, extrememly difficult to put down. And while most of the reviewers that pan it speak of what they deem to be a lame ending, I must confess that I personally liked the ending. What's wrong with a happy ending? While I'll agree that the character of the Chairman was somewhat narrowly developed, so what? The writing is extraordinary and the story fascinating and the fact that a man wrote it makes it even more wonderous. This goes up high on the list of my favorite books- a highly recommended read, especially to romantic types!"},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"This is a wonderfully engaging novel, despite the fact that the ending falls a little flat. By the time World War II ends in the novel, the author has so drawn you into the world and life of the protagonist that you expect more from the rest of the story, but what follows seems to be half-hearted compared to the rest of the novel. Not that the end ruins the novel, it just seems to lose steam after a certain point, and the end seems contrived after so many struggles and hardships. This book is definitely worthwhile because it offers a unique glimpse into a world that is so exotic, foreign and archiac to most of us. Part of me still can't believe it was written by a western man instead of the geisha described in the beginning. His insights into the world of the geisha in Kyoto and involving prose make it a very good read."},{"Title":"Memoirs of a Geisha (Signed)","review":"I was glad to get to the end of this book. It was too long, and I had the feeling that when the author got to WWII, he thought, &quot;All right, I have to bring this to an end,&quot; and whisked through a few decades toward closure. It was depressing, and no doubt accurate. I do suspect, however, that since it was written by a man, that he did not fully understand or explain a woman's point of view, unless he meant that the geishas are so traumatized by their training that they become neutered emotionally. I am glad I read the book, but I don't feel compelled to read another one on the same subject.

I believe that anyone who stated sincerely what was in his heart, could not only write a song, but get it published, because it would be sure to be a good song.\\" (More words of advice from the greatest 'theatrical' lyricist in a moment.)Look, forget the \\"rhyming dictionary\\" part of this book (I have several of those). What sets this book apart as \\"essential reading\\" for would-be song-writers is the first 50 pages: the best advice frustrated song-writers (like me) will ever find -- anywhere!As I type this I have two 'classics' of the genre in front of me: Oscar Hammerstein's book, titled simply, \\"LYRICS,\\" and Ira Gershwin's \\"LYRICS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.\\" If both those giants of the art were still with us, I'm certain they'd agree that Gene Lees has written the best book of its kind. And, whether or not your \\"one great song\\" ever sees the light of day, you'll have much fun reading what Mr. Lees has to say. Just one example:There was a night in 1967 the Canadian-born jazz writer 'crossed paths' with Nancy Sinatra (even if they didn't actually meet). I close my eyes and imagine Frank Sinatra emerging from a night-time session with Claus Ogerman's stellar orchestra (for Sinatra's album with Antonio Carlos Jobim) and immediately starting work with another, much smaller group of musicians, assembled by his first-born, Nancy, for the duet with her Dad that would sell a million copies.I imagine Gene Lees feeling so lucky, that the stars had finally aligned in his own life; sitting off to one side by himself, perhaps, watching and listening in amazed silence, (pinching himself to make sure it was true?) as Sinatra brought to life, as only he can, the English words Lees had composed for one of Jobim's loveliest songs, QUIET NIGHTS OF QUIET STARS (\\"quiet notes from my guitar\\") And there was Mr. Jobim himself, Brazil's Cole Porter (as I've always thought of him) plucking the strings of his own guitar, while the greatest singer of them all worked his magic.Recalling that moment, Lees said: \\"After Frank had rehearsed 'Quiet Nights' a few times, he said, 'There are a lot of esses (S's) in this song.' And so there are. I had never noticed it before.\\"----I know what it's like to treasure every word Sinatra says to you (he once directed 50 words my way) and so it seems perfectly natural that Lees never stopped thinking about what Frank said: That seemingly throw-away remark prompted Lees to reflect, deeply, years later in his advice to those of us who'd love to write at least \\"one good song lyric.\\"\\"Recording engineers,\\" said Lees, \\"don't like the letter \`S' because it presents them with an equalization problem. If they boost the high frequencies, the \`esses' become exaggerated.\\" (Sirius Radio can sometimes be terrible for this, when your reception is going a little \`funny' just as Lees wrote, in the days before satellite radio: \\"Turn up the highs (treble) on your stereo - you notice the attenuation of the \`S'.\\"Then, going further into reflection (remember, all this stemming from a 'chance' remark by Frank Sinatra) Lees said, \\"The prejudice (against using a lot of \`esses' in song lyrics) seems to me now, to date back to a time before high fidelity recording: Ira Gershwin wrote \\"'S'Wonderful\\" in the 1930s - and he used esses all over the place, apparently having fun with them, if not poking fun at the prejudice.\\"Which set Lees to \\"wondering about the source of this bias? Scholars tell us (or at least hypothesize) that the letter was (given that shape) like a snake to designate the sound a serpent makes. And . . . if that's so . . .the fear of snakes may underlie the prejudice.\\"Which brought Gene Lees back to his 'Whatever made me think of all this?' moment . . . that long ago evening in a recording studio with Sinatra, by way of an anecdote about 'The Bard.'\\"The \`S' problem is a problem only in overuse,\\" he says, recalling the line from Mcbeath's soliloquy, \\"If the assassination, could trammel up the consequences, and catch with his surcease, success.\\"\\"That's pretty bad,\\" said Lees. \\"In four syllables Shakespeare gives the actor a phrase that is hard to pronounce and quite unattractive when you DO get it out.\\"\\"As for whatever reservations recording engineers may have,\\" said Lees, \\"I am reminded of what Sinatra said to his engineer at that (same) session when the latter asked him to stand further from the orchestra since their proximity was creating a \`separation' difficulty.\\"\\"'That's YOUR problem!' Sinatra said pleasantly.\\"I believe Oscar Hammerstein would declare this book the best of its kind. Even as Hammerstein provided the best (and simplest) summing up of what is required to write your own \\"one great song.\\"\\"The most important ingredient in a good song,\\" wrote Hammerstein, \\"is sincerity: Let the song be yours and yours alone. However important, however trivial, believe it. Mean it from the bottom of your heart, and say what is on your mind as carefully, as clearly, as beautifully as you can. Show it to no one until you are certain you cannot make one change that would improve it. After that, however, be willing to make improvements if someone can convince you they are needed.\\"-- Oscar Hammerstein II (1949)"},{"Title":"Modern Rhyming Dictionary Edition","review":"I have used this book extensively in my search for the proper form and rhyme in my lyrics.

The original version featured a bit-by-bit approach, taking 36 pages to introduce the reader to the Arabic alphabet as used in Persian; this book merely provides two charts of the entire alphabet, one for tracing purposes, and then appends a bit over one page of exercises in combining the letters. After that, apparently, you're expected to have it down cold. The approach by Mace was certainly more user-friendly to readers with no background in the alphabet.The book then proceeds at a quick pace; the vocabulary lists can be dauntingly long for learners, and transliteration is used sparingly, sometimes leaving any reader not fully accustomed to the Arabic script at a disadvantage in terms of proper pronunciation. In contrast, the original book by Mace included transliteration for all vocabulary items and example sentences. Farzad's order of presentation is a bit unusual; the present tense of verbs other than &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to have&quot; is not presented until page 127, for example.I am no longer as innocent of Persian as I was 30-odd years ago, but when I think back to my situation then as a total beginner, the original book by Mace strikes me as being much more suitable for someone working on his/her own to learn Persian. (It is still readily available through used-book channels.) I would thus recommend that people indeed looking for a &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; book for Persian get a copy of the original &quot;Teach Yourself Modern Persian&quot; by Mace, if possible, and then perhaps use the latest &quot;Teach Yourself Modern Persian&quot; by Farzad as a follow-up book to solidify the basics. Another useful book after getting the basics down is &quot;An Introduction to Persian&quot; by Wheeler Thackston, which would likely be fairly hard slogging for most true beginners."},{"Title":"Modern Persian/Farsi","review":"I am not new to Farsi and have been trying to learn it for atleast 5 years, i am getting good at it and am going to Iran this summer.well, I picked up this book as a refresher and whilst Its one of the better Farsi books out there its NOT the best and I found a few things that are hampering when using this book.for one, I ntoiced in the exercises in the sentences you need to translate often she uses words that HAVE NOT been introduced previously...not in the vocabulary or anything like that so its necessary to go to the inadequate dictionary in the back and try to find the word.another thing is that again in the exercises often she will write, say something like \\"i have friends in Tehran\\" and then you need to translate it into Farsi. well, when you go to the answer key the answer would be \\"I have friends in Iran\\" or soemthing of this sort!!!So there is quite a bit of disunity between the exercises, answer keys and words chosen to be used for the exercises.It would of been far better if she'd of either put ALL the new words used in the vocabulary pages OR of not of used words she hasnt used before keeping things very simple.all this is exceedingly frustrating...even for a non-newbie like me.on the other hand I do like how she transcribes Farsi into English and I also like her formatte, what she introduces...its really good."},{"Title":"Modern Persian/Farsi","review":"In terms of the print, the new edition of the Teach yourself Persian is a lot better than the old one, but the content is not.

So if you want to teach yourself, I'd suggest to try out different books, among them, I recommend Thackston or John Mace as basic reference; tackling Lambton if you are interested in classical stuff,if you'd like to learn more about different varieties of Persian, Baizoyev's Beginner's Tajiki is a quite good book, if you just want learn some Persian phrases to travel or impress your Iranian friends... forget what I just said, get lonely planet Persian phrasebook."},{"Title":"Modern Persian/Farsi","review":"In an effort to learn the Persian language I ordered this course because it came with a CD to help with pronounciation of this difficult but beautiful language.

Besides, as other reviewers pointed out, there are problems with material used in exercises, which was not previously explained.Perhaps it's good for learners who like extra stress."},{"Title":"Modern Persian/Farsi","review":"As a first course for Persian, this book is really not too bad. However, it does suffer from flaws in its organization, particularly in the early chapters, that could well discourage many learners from going any farther with it.The first few chapters of this book are really little more than vocabulary lists. There is a chapter on greetings (a bewildering number of them) and then a chapter dealing with time expressions (the months of the Iranian calendar, for instance, which are named after Zoroastrian archangels). Working along with the accompanying CD, these lessons can give a beginner a quite good pronunciation early on in the game, which is fime, but you are four lessons in before you are forming even the simplest sentences.The pace does pick up after that, and the subsequent chapters do have some interesting dialogues. One of the interesting and challenging aspects of Persian is the ezafe (the long strings of nouns and/or adjectives that are built up with the concatenating particle 'e'/'ye'. The author's treatment of these somplex structures is particularly good. The different tenses and moods of the Persian verb are also well covered.One negative, though, is that although most of the material in the book is everyday conversational, the language that is actually used is not colloquial and the book does not devote much space to illuminating the difference between literary and colloquial pronunciation. In particular, verbs are considerably simplified in the spoken colloquial language. A serious student of Persian has to be able to be at home in both these facets of the language.Better treatments of this essential aspect of understanding spoken Persian are available in the Living Language Course (geared to the colloquial language) or Thackston's 'Introduction to Persian' (more literary)."},{"Title":"Modern Persian/Farsi","review":"This book is great for beginners.

I've read a lot of Ludvigsen lately, especially in Hemmings Sports and Exotic Car; where his writing is top notch...and I remember his work at Sports Car Illustrated [now Car and Driver] and Motor Trend. It appears that he only wrote the introduction to this particular book...it really doesn't go into much detail, just a few short lines on each page, below a full-page photo.Karl has a way of making complex mechanical concepts clear, colorful and easy to understand, and I was hoping he'd go into detail regarding some of the innovations that the early 1960s brought to auto racing, especially those involving the advent of rear engine cars and wider tires, and while there is documentation of those events, it's brief and concise, with very little that hasn't been covered elsewhere in more detail, as in Roger Huntington's book, Design and Development of the Indy Car, which is woefully long out-of-print.I was hoping for information on the 1964 Mickey Thompson Sears-Allstate Specials with 3-wheel steering, but there is virtually nothing about these cars in the book. The 1962 cars are covered, and the 1963 predecessors to the 1964 cars are, too...but there is nothing on the car that caused so much controversy and tragedy at the Speedway in 1964.There are some rare photos, including one of a 1965 front-engine Ford DOHC powered roadster that didn't turn many laps at the track, and several photos of the STP turbine cars that are interesting, but overall, the book is a little thin. Not much detail, and not as much Ludvigsen involvement as the title may suggest.If you're a hard-core fan of Indy in the '60's, the book is of merit...if not, you might want to give it a pass.Dan Bolton"},{"Title":"Indy Cars of the 1960s (Ludvigsen Library Series)","review":"Excellent photographic and direct text overview of the last great decade of innovation at indy.

Urquhart writes with such grace and mastery that one is often compelled to re-read large sections just to absorb her words.The story is very compelling, about an Irish family who immigrate from Ulster during the Great Famine. But there have been many other books written on this topic, none of which are remotely as enjoyable to read. It is the unique strength of Urquhart's voice that makes this novel so fine.A novel certainly for any reader interested in Irish and Irish-Canadian heritage, but also very worth reading by any who enjoy good language and style."},{"Title":"Away","review":"Extending backwards and forwards in time a hundred and forty years, Away, a novel by Canadian writer Jane Urquhart, begins with one of the female characters discovering the shoreline near her Irish home has been changed forever. Stones resembling new potatoes have replaced the sandy beach, a grim joke in this impoverished area. Then &quot;thousands of cabbages nudged one another towards shore,&quot; followed by many silver teapots and barrels of whiskey, a semi-conscious young man the final offering. Thus begins this amazing tale, weaving together the lives of four generations of women, Ireland and and Canada, past and present, land and sea. Water becomes a character in itself, each of these women drawn to it like lemmings, lives unfolding near a stream that ebbs and flows with the seasons, a Great Lake, and the Atlantic Ocean. For readers who appreciate lyrical writing, a compelling story, and subtly evoked magic realism, this book is for you"},{"Title":"Away","review":"I discovered this beautiful book whilst on holday in Canada, and became entranced with the world of Celtic/Canadian literature.Jane Urquart's writing transported me into the depths of Irish-Canadian femininity with a powerful sense of tragedy, beauty and imagination. I could not put this book down, and when I finished it I felt as though I had travelled decades and miles beyond the 20th Century world of modern-day London.Her capacity to relate the magnificence of 2 of the most beautiful places on earth is truly impressive, as is her ability to weave together history and mythology.I would recommend this book to any other dreamer who can allow themselves to be transported into the other world."},{"Title":"Away","review":"After reading &quot;The Underpainter&quot; by the same author I was urged to read &quot;Away&quot;.

Jane Urquhart weaves a tapestry of language that forms vivid images in the mind of every reader . We are transported onto the coffin ships to make the long voyage to Canada, that most unforgiving of lands. Following the lives of Mary and Brian and their children, as seen through the lense of memory, was my daily gift to myself.

The writer's lyrical prose traverses both literal and metaphysical landscapes with equal skill. A well-crafted plot moves the novel along briskly, intriguing characters come vividly to life, and brief detours into ethereal regions of the spirit seem perfectly natural. Away is a delightful read."},{"Title":"Away","review":"I'm sure there are lots of readers who will love this novel, and I resolutely recommend it to them, but they'll have to self-identify. There's a little of every genre in it: a novel of \\"generations\\", a immigration tale of hardships, a 'poetic' romance with a demon lover, a fervent protest against progress at the cost of cultural identity, a historical rebuke of English brutality in Ireland, and an overarching despair that the triumphs and catastrophes of the pioneers generations will be obliterated along with the ecology of their lives. It's a \\"potboiler\\", in short, or what some people call a \\"sweeping romance\\". I can aver in good conscience that, as such, it's crafty in its language; that's the rationale of my four-star rating, an attempt to be fair and helpful to readers with different tastes from mine ...... but I didn't enjoy it much at all. I had to struggle to keep reading. It's too rhapsodic for me. As a gothic romance, it falls way short of the Bronte Sisters. As an immigration saga, it doesn't come close to Willa Cather's \\"O Pioneers\\", or Ole Rolvaag's \\"Giants in the Earth\\", or the greatest of all frontier novels, the immigrant tetralogy by Vilhelm Moberg. And as a portrayal of real human joys and sorrows out on the empty expanses of Ontario, it doesn't have the potency of even one short story by Alice Munro, Canada's finest fiction writer ever. Actually, the cover picture gives a clearer impression of this novel than anything I can say about it, so I'll bid it adieu."},{"Title":"Away","review":"Jane Uquhart's novel Away, is about Mary and Eileen, a mother, daughter duo who have their lives changed by romantic, yet tragic encounters, at different times. The novel begins in Ireland, where Mary is possessed by the spirit of a sailor who dies in her arms on Rathlin island. People of the island believed that Mary was possessed by a deamon lover, who took her away from herself, society and her family. After staring death in the face, from the potato famine, Mary and her realistic husband, Brian, migrated to Canada. Even though Mary had left her country, her deamon followed and took her away, forever, leaving behind her son Liam and her daughter, Eileen. After being told the story of her families abandonment by Exodus Crow and former landlord, Osbert, Eileen falls passionately in love with the fiery Irish patriot dancer, Aiden. Uquharts novel is full of the political and spiritual drama of Ireland, and the Irish people. Jane Uquhart is blessed with the ability to write with such magic and lyrical composition, that at times she make the interesting, even more interesting, and consequently the tedious even more tedious. Jane Uquhart's melodious language is both her greatest asset and worst liability."},{"Title":"Away","review":"\\"The women of this family leaned towards extremes [...] They were plagued by revenants. There was always water involved, exaggerated youth or exaggerated age. Afterwards there was absence...\\"Esther O'Malley Robertson, now in her eighties, and by her own admission \\"the last and most subdued\\" of these extreme women tells the family's story one last time \\"to herself and the Great Lake, there being no one to listen.\\" The story, she muses, \\"will take her wherever it wants to go in the next twelve hours, and that is all that matters.\\" And what a story it is! Like her protagonist, Jane Urquhart \\"paints a landscape in her mind\\", so rich in colours and shades, and so full of life - real and imagined, large as the ocean, minuscule as a tide pool - and so intimate in the depiction of its human inhabitants with their deep connection to the land and the waters that sustain them.Spanning some one hundred and forty years, Urquhart creates a intricate multigenerational portrait of a family, starting out on the island of Rathlin, at the most northern coast of Ireland and leaving with Esther at Loughbreeze Beach on the shores of Lake Ontario. Mary, Esther's great-grandmother, stands tall at the beginning of the story, but, overwhelmed by what she experiences one early morning on the beach, changes into somebody that the locals refer to as being \\"away\\" - living in an otherworldly reality. She eventually returns to \\"normal life\\" thanks to the dedicated gentle care of Brian, her new husband. Urquhart's subtle and sensitive description of the young couple's evolving relationship, set against the increasingly precarious circumstances of the farming communities around them, pulls the reader right into their reality and creates an intimate empathy that only grows as the story unfolds. The contrast between the poverty stricken tenant farmers and their English landlords is stark, yet, even when portraying the latter, the author is perceptive to their limited efforts to help those dependent on them for their survival.Urquhart touches on major historical events over the novel's time span. With heart wrenching intensity she describes the impact of the Irish potato famine, the subsequent wave of Irish immigration to then \\"Upper Canada\\", and the challenges faced by the early settlers and would-be farmers in the harsh landscape of the Canadian Shield. The struggle of the Irish immigrants goes beyond their claiming and cultivating the land and the political realities compete with the domestic; Urquhart interweaves the two component with great skill and balance. Yet, her central force are always the individuals, vividly portrayed, and their attachment, and often fascination, with the landscape they find themselves in. For Mary this deep connection is with the sea; her need for touching it will eventually dictate the rest of her life. For her children, Liam and Eileen, and all those who follow in this family tapestry, Urquhart's poetic and beautifully flowing language captures the diverse characters' deep emotions, at time haunting and heart wrenching and at others sensuous and exuberant. Some of the men are wanderers and capture the attention and love of their women in fleeting visits, others, especially Brian and his son Liam, are earthbound and provide the solid support to those who are torn between the land and the water - the 'here' and the 'away'. Esther, being the last in the line, knows that \\"Over the years the women of the family who have ventured out into the world have carried pictures of Loughbreeze Beach with them in their minds; its coloured stones shining through water, the places where fine pebbles give way to sand, certain paths the moon makes across the lake's surface on autumn midnights...\\"The characterization of one person that he can twist \\" a sentence into a song\\" could not be a better description for the author's talents. Whether evoking the diverse emotions of individuals, the inner or outside landscapes they are connected to, the changing seasons with their atmospheric transformations, Urquhart's rich prose carries the reader into a mystical world that is both very real and richly imagined. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Away","review":"Most of this magical novel hovers in the space between two worlds, tied in fact to one but inhabiting the other in spirit. Literally, it spans two continents; the book begins in 1842 on Rathlin Island, off the most Northerly point of Ireland; it ends 140 years later in Canada, on the shores of Lake Ontario. As the Washington Post described it, the book is an \\"Irish ballad sung on foreign soil, its words and music all the sweeter for being heard so far away from home.\\" Its song has a special resonance for me, here in North America reading of my birthplace in Northern Ireland; the setting of the first part of the book is where my parents used to take me for holidays as a child. Urquhart knows the cliffs, the moorland, even the smell of a turf fire; her poetic fantasies are anchored in detail.AWAY spans the centuries also, five generations of mothers and daughters: Norah, Mary, Eileen, Deirdre, Esther. It opens with Esther as an old woman, lamenting the surrender of her family house to encroaching industry (a theme that Urquhart would revisit inA MAP OF GLASS), labeling pieces of furniture and keepsakes with hints of their stories, and recalling the story that her grandmother Eileen had told her as an old woman herself, the tale of her own mother as a girl in Ireland, the potato famine, and their new life in a forest clearing in Ontario. Mainly the book is about Mary and Eileen, but the double time-warp of the opening is essential to the atmosphere, suspending the story in a web of hints and deliberate ambiguities; the first 21 pages could stand being read a second time. Esther's labels are significant: 'On an old copper boiler she had written the words \\"I wept for joy. The lake was calm and light engorged the kitchen.\\" [...] Attached to the metal case of a gold pocket-watch that rests alone on the dining-room table is a luggage tag, and on this is written, \\"There was often one of us was away\\"....'\\"Away\\" is the Irish term for being possessed by the spirits, and the spirit world is never far from Urquhart's tale. Near the opening of the book, Mary watches the flotsam from a shipwreck wash ashore: a prodigious number of cabbages, silver teapots bobbing in the brine, barrels of whiskey, and carried on them like a raft, a half-drowned young man. In trying to restore him to life, Mary becomes possessed, and although she will eventually marry, move to Canada, and bear children, she will never be free of that pull of the water. It is a spell she bequeaths to her descendants: \\"They were plagued by revenants. Men, landscapes, states of mind, went away and came back again. Over the years, over the decades. There was always water involved, exaggerated youth or exaggerated age. Afterwards there was absence. That is the way it was for the women of this family. It was part of their destiny.\\"I am amazed by Urquhart's ability to balance fantasy with fact. This could so easily have been a fey, whimsical subject, but it is rooted in harsh reality. Nothing could be more different from the barren Antrim headlands than the forest in Upper Canada. Urquhart is as detailed in describing the difficulties of pioneer life as she had been in depicting subsistence farming in Ulster, but her scene has undergone a sea-change. She recreates the magic out of other materials -- forests, streams, Indian neighbors -- even her language shifts from poetic Irish lilt to a more down-to-earth tongue. One of the most striking moments in the second part is when, after a first night in the forest filled with despair, \\"men with wild hair and unkempt beards began to emerge from between the trees\\" carrying axes and saws, neighbors come to fell a clearing and build a house. The moment is a miracle of savage grace, but its fierce magic is worked out in totally real terms. The poetry of this novel may rest in its metaphors, but they are metaphors that are lived.Most of the characters are quite ordinary people whose lives nonetheless touch something universal. The final section, however, introduces an offstage personage who was very famous indeed. This is the Irish-Canadian politician Thomas D'Arcy McGee, an orator with a silver tongue who preached an end of sectarian strife in the confederation of the new Canada. This message is an appropriate conclusion to Urquhart's themes of deracination and reintegration, and for Canadian readers McGee's larger-than-life status would sustain the almost-mythic quality of the novel. But for those of us who are unfamiliar with him, the change from the universal to the particular makes an awkward gear change that rather weakens the conclusion of a book that seems too short as it is. All the same, this merely reduces a seven-star marvel to a still-extraordinary six stars. Read it!"},{"Title":"Away","review":"The troubles in Ireland have the roots in centuries of turmoil.

Urquhart's rich, magical prose, especially in the novel's opening with Mary and her lover from the sea, is wonderful. However, the language is not enough to sustain interest. Urquhart's prose dilapitates into a passive, lazy drawl (which DOES NOT convincingly pass for style) as the &quot;magical&quot; parts tests the reader's patience. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Away","review":"Away is a wonderfully written novel- Urquhart's skill and competence as a writer is unquestionable. but wouldn't call this particular novel one of her best. i must admit, it was a pleasure reading it, from a literary perspective, but the events and decisions made in this story are very peculiar and unlikely. in the novel, a young woman from Rothlin, a fictionary island in Ireland is 'posessed' with the spirit of a young sailor who dies in her arms after being washed ashore from his drowned ship. the events following are odd and created solely by the superstition of the narrow minded islanders, and the girl's own over-active imagination. overall, i thought that the novel was incomprehensible in some parts, and the characters were impossible to relate to."},{"Title":"Away","review":"A single sentence in this book encompasses the highest of art and spirit that the muse of writing holds out before all writers. Many produce volumes over a lifetime and never achieve the beauty, elegance and balance of Urguhart's writing. It may be a tale but it is the writing, the exquisite telling of the tale that matters here. This is a treasure."},{"Title":"Away","review":"after i finished Away i thought it had been worth the read-although it took me a month to finish. somewhere after the first quarter of the book i put it down-i was tired of the plot line, nothing seemed to be happening. eventually after eyeing it for about 3 weeks i picked it back up and started again. it was highly imaginative and not what you'd expect, yet sometimes hard to follow. it is worth the time if you stay with it...especially if you don't neglect it...i just wouldn't recommend it when you're tired."},{"Title":"Away","review":"I enjoyed the historical aspect to this book, particularly the description of the potato famine in Ireland. I read up on it a little on the Internet while going through the book and it seems Urquhart describes it accurately. The story, although partially fictitious, of D'arcy Mcgee was also interesting. I thought the obsessive love Eileen had for Aidan was over-emphasized and was dwelled upon for too long. I got the point long before she wrapped up the story. Considering we had already encountered an obsessive love through Mary in the first half of the book, it seemed somewhat redundant to go into that much detail of this obsessive type of love again through Eileen."},{"Title":"Away","review":"I want to say at the outset, that I did enjoy this book. The trouble is, I hoped to enjoy it much more than I did.The language of this novel, especially throughout the mystical parts, was beautiful. Like poetry or song lyrics, they created a wonderful atmosphere and a continuing theme that followed the women of the O'Malley family through generations.But I found that many parts of the story that could have provided some substantive meat to the story, were given a quick gloss over. In part, I picked up this book because my husband's family emigrated in the same time period, and passed through Grosse Isle quarantine station. But I found that the quarantine station was given half a dozen words (they knew some people who died there), and the immigrant ships the same (it was crowded). While pages were devoted to the dwellers of tide pools, shelves of dusty puffins, and the detritus of shipwreck on a beach.I think that the poetic language and focus on mysticism, while lovely, in some ways prevented me from connecting to the characters. while I could empathize, I couldn't really understand why they acted as they did, made the choices they did, or even got to where they were.That said, there were gorgeous lush moments and pages that I wanted to read aloud for their beauty.So at the end of the day, I am glad that I read the book, but I am disappointed that I didn't \\"love\\" the book, when I really really tried to."},{"Title":"Away","review":"This is a beautiful book, combining solid research with a very compelling use of language. I find her writing far better than the so-acclaimed Margaret Lawrence and Alice Munro. The language definitely carries this intensely imaginative book. A lot of contemporary details for the time are interspersed too and this generally meshes, except that I think she gets a little too carried away with an ill-defined mysticism in the first part of the book. We need to know what these people living in a cabin in the forest bought at the store six miles away and include some details of catching fish and collecting berries to sustain the idea that they truly could live in such a self-contained isolated way. The parts about Mary blending with nature are fine, becoming one with the water, flitting among the birches and becoming a part of forest life, as well as Mary being part of Irish myth involving fairies and those not of this world. But, then adding Native American religion to this mix goes over the top into a New Age mess the fine lyrical language is far too good for.I don't think we need Exodus crow or a bird that talks to Eileen.It's a beautiful passionate book though, a strong book, and one I truly enjoyed. I also became very involved in the solid history the book was built on and felt a new sympathy for the Irish. Many British people have bad memories of the IRA and I thought the point of the novel towards the end regarding the politics involved was to say this violent Irish nationalism was wrong and I wish she could also have made this point more strongly."},{"Title":"Away","review":"This book was recommended to me by an English major.

I would recommend this book to any of my friends or realtaives or to anybody."},{"Title":"Away","review":"This novel is ultimately a disappointment because it starts off with such potential. Indeed, if Ms. Urquhart had simply made a novella out of the first chapter and entitled it A Fish On A Pool, it would be a first rate artistic achievement. Instead, she drones on in two subsequent chapters in a lyricism that eventually fails through repetition, a plot that grates through being, well, the same blasted plot repeated three times and a theme that becomes not a little over the top in its literary feminism.This review is not the place to go into all of Ms. Urquhart's gifts and how she has wasted them after the first, astounding chapter. She has a lyrical gift that owes much to Yeats. -In fact, the words \\"changed utterly\\" occur twice in this book-which, if you are a lover of Irish poetry and, ergo, a lover of Yeats, cannot fail to strike a chord. Hint: Read his Easter 1916. There are also passages like these in the first chapter, \\"Dark morning birds lifted away from the earth she walked on, her words spinning in the sky then flying over the fields to the shore\\". The first chapter is thematically wild and entrancing and lyrically virtuosic.But then......who knows? Maybe her publisher demanded a certain number of pages. In any event, she goes on in two flat, pat chapters about the same thing with less magic and more of an axe to grind. She flirts with feminist propaganda near the end. Only the woman can receive the enchanting gift of being \\"away\\" it would seem. And men turn out to be destroyers of themselves and/or the land around them, unless, of course, they happen to be American Indian and go by the none too subtle name of \\"Exodus\\".Still, the book is worth it. Just stop after the first chapter while you're still enchanted and before disillusionment has set in, while you're still \\"away.\\""},{"Title":"Vicious Circles (Center for the Study of Language and Information - Lecture Notes)","review":"This book discusses recent advances in the general field of set theory. The authors study a variant of ZF in which the axiom of foundation is replaced by a new axiom allowing non-well-founded sets. Just as the naturals can be extended to the integers, and the integers to the rationals, and the reals to the complex numbers, in each case by positing new numbers that are the solutions to a class of equations, so this book posits an extension to any model of set theory consisting of the solutions to a class of (systems of) equations having no solutions in ZF. The simplest example is the equationx = {x},whose solution,x = {{{{...}}}} (infinitely deep)is not permitted in ZF, but exists and is unique in the authors' theory.The purpose of this extension to ZF is to create a set theory in which certain circular or infinite phenomena from computer science and other fields, e.g. cyclic data streams, can be much more directly modeled than is now possible in ZF. Currently in ZF in order to represent a cyclic data stream one has to develop the aparatus for natural numbers, and then represent the stream to be a function from the natural numbers into some suitable set representing the type of data. But in the author's set theory the stream could be represented as an unfounded set that is the solution to a simple equation, and many of its properties could then be more easily deduced without resort to arithmetic.I found this book absolutely fascinating, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has had a course in set theory. The theory in the book is quite elegant and satisfying.I was delighted to learn that there is still room for new variations of the axioms of set theory, a subject I thought (probably naively) had been fairly static for 60 years."},{"Title":"Vicious Circles (Center for the Study of Language and Information - Lecture Notes)","review":"As the title suggests, this is the first systematic exposition of classic set theory without the axiom of foundation. What replaces it, the anti-foundation axiom, allows sets to be members of themselves and it is this type of circularity that, as the authors claim, lies at the heart of understanding knowledge in interacting systems (like computing machines or game-theoretic agents or Liar-type sentences that refer to themselves).What makes the whole endeavour work is that this new axiom is still consistent with the rest of ZF theory (a fact that is proved in the book) and in this sense the new theory can be thought as an \\"extention\\" of the traditional hierarchical construction of sets.The book is written in textbook style in that it presents the material methodically and it is reasonably self-contained (a basic understanding of set theory and adequate motivation are enough).I would have given 4 stars for poor binding and some typos (nothing serious though), but the quality of presentation and the fact that it includes answers to all problems more than make up for it."},{"Title":"Loop's End","review":"It took me over a dozen years to track this book down, but it was worth it. I had thoroughly \\"gotten into\\" the first two volumes of this trilogy, _Loop's Progress_ and _Experiments with Life and Deaf_, at a point in my life where I identified with the characters- especially with the main character, Jarvis Loop. You see, Jarvis is a garbage man and an intellectual. That isn't unusual though, for the entire world that Jarvis moves through is one of working class bohemians, intellectuals, and mystics. That is what gives it its surrealistic tone, for everyone here is far more than you would ever assume to be living in a working class neighborhood in Erie, Pennsylvania in the 60's- and for me that was refreshing. When I was a kid I wanted to believe that the average people around me were living rich intellectual and artistic lives behind closed doors- that there must be more to them than normally met the eye and ear...This is a place where street gangs of philosophers debate the nature of the universe for years on end while playing cards in attics, where the dead have a disturbing habit of casually crossing the veil between the worlds, where spaceships and submarines are built in basements, where religious statuary routinely moves of its own accord, and even Jarvis' borderline psychotic father takes a year to read and comprehend 200 great books- just to prove that he can. There is a story sandwiched into one of the chapters about a City of Light and a City of Dark that reads like a gnostic creation myth. But there is also so much more going on here in this metaphorical, existentialist, nihilistic, surrealistic stew. At the very least, this trilogy is so unlike almost everything else that you've read that at least you will not be bored. There is just so much here- all of it playing off of each other until the result is a gestalt greater than the sum of the parts alone."},{"Title":"Innocence Deceived","review":"From beginning to end this book keeps you wanting more. I found it hard to put down once I started reading. I really connected with the characters, and at times cried along with them. It is so uplifting to see that the main character is such a strong women and able to cope with life's challenges and still move on and be a role model for her children. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs inspiration in their lives. I hope there is a sequel in the future because I would love to see how all the characters have survived and gone on with their lives."},{"Title":"Las Vegas- Your Way","review":"Lots of information written in an easy to read format.

It is one of the classics of modern art, of interest to artists, teachers, students, theoreticians, historians, and fans of Paul Klee. Pedagogical Sketchbook is the distilled essence of Klee's concepts of art production. Created in 1923 as a teaching tool for his students at the Bauhaus, it was the second of fourteen Bauhaus Books edited by Walter Gropius and L. Moholy-Nagy. First published in England in 1953 and the United States in 1960, it has been an important influence on generations of practicing artists and theoreticians.An abstraction of his ideas on teaching and creating art, it can sometimes be difficult to follow, since it assumes that some narrative and examples will be added during classes. However, Sibyl Moholy-Nagy writes a narrative introduction that explores Paul Klee's aesthetic ideas related to teaching, and a concluding note with brief suggestions as to how the sketchbook can be used for teaching or artistic research.Titled \\" Initial Plan for a Section of the Theoretical Instruction at the German Bauhaus\\", this book is a set of working notes that are the basis for art instruction at the Bauhaus - you can almost see Paul Klee presenting the ideas in a class. Beginning with the primary graphic element of a point moving forward to create a line, it is a course on how to make art based on Klee's deeply considered artistic process. It consists of step-by-step lessons, with abstract written concepts that analyze artistic process, and drawings that are examples of how those ideas can be put into practice.Although it was based on the then-current 2D graphic arts of painting, drawing, and printmaking, it is also valuable for current artists working in time based and interactive forms since it considers aesthetics and structure as the result of process. In a relatively short space, it investigates a wide range of practical and conceptual approaches to art making, from line, to plane, to structure and composition, to materials, physics, symbols, and motion. Its well-considered concepts enable artists of any aesthetic persuasion to apply its ideas and lessons to their own work. It requires concentration to understand, but it is truly worth the effort."},{"Title":"Pedagogical Sketchbook","review":"I found this book to be a wonderful tool, once understood... and that may take some time!!"},{"Title":"Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Liquid Crystals","review":"I Want get copy of this book on my e-mail!

The story holds together well enough and it's a super fast read. As I've read more Ruth Rendell novels, I am disappointed in the rushed pace of the novel. A story like this needs to unfold slowly. Not that I want to make a novel overly long, but I feel a tad more background information on the recurring characters and the current suspects would work to her advantage. It's not her best. It's not her worst. It's a serviceable mystery that is over before it starts."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"Young girls gone rather bonkers hence, this is a rather haunting tale.

Fans of mystery writer Ruth Rendell will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"This is the 13th Inspector Wexford adventure, who with his side-kick Inspector Mike Burden, solve crimes - usually murders - and keep the citizenry of Sussex, England safe. Although these books are murder mysteries at their core, the author excels - and where she differentiates herself from the \\"pack\\" - in painting psychological dramas. The term thriller is a bit overblown, as Rendell's tales proceed much too slowly for that label. (Not a knock just a description, and enjoyment of this series will depend on a reader's preference, i.e. adrenaline drenched action versus the cerebral/analytic approach utilized by Wexford/Rendell.)The author's books are very reminiscent of the Dagliesh series by P.D. James - I understand the two authors are buddies - and Rendell has influenced the likes of Minette Walters. Rendell blurs the line between victims and villains and has an uncanny ability to populate her stories with very real, but also very unpleasant/unlikeable characters. Our two heroes, Wexford and Burden, wade through the damaged psyches of their suspects to solve the crimes, piecing together past history and motives - rather than uncovering inanimate clues, i.e. connecting the dots of fingerprints, ballistics and DNA. And there's usually a Wexford/Burden personal situation, which one or both of our protagonists is wrestling with while pursuing their police work.An Unkindness Of Ravens follows this formula when a neighbor of Wexford's - a \\"family man\\" - disappears. Reluctantly our hero begins to investigate - a simple missing person case not being part of his job description nor his preference. Over the ensuing months - the case drags on that long - he uncovers a very tangled web indeed; interviewing and re-interviewing concerned parties, all of whom are more than a little annoying i.e. self-centered, overly-dramatic and/or sullen. In the background side-kick Inspector Burden and his new wife are expecting their first-born - a first class soap-opera in and of itself - and the point of which I missed.When all is said and done - with a lot more of the former versus the latter - Wexford solves the mystery and Burden becomes a new daddy. I don't mean to sound overly-critical, but this tale drags on and on - even more so than the past books. Not up to par with the previous Wexford books."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"Unconvincing, improbable little fantasy posing as a mystery, with cardboard characters you never really care about. Reads as if the author was more interested in the construction of the novel than in its execution. My first Wexford-Mystery, and probably my last. Not as bleak as her other books, but nowhere near as convincing either."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"An \\"Unkindness\\" is the collective noun for a group of ravens. They are not particularly predatory birds, but neither rare they soft and submissive. Now, the Raven has become the symbol of a militant feminist group known as Arria, whose attitude to the male gender is, like the nature of said bird, far from submissive.When Chief Inspector Wexford was asked to investigate the disappearance of his neighbour Rodney Williams he was certain it was just a case of another middle-aged man having run-off with a young woman. All the signs pointed that way. A waste of time to concern yourself with, his thoughts tell him. However, he would be shocked to his core when, weeks later, Rodney's disappearance turns out to be the centre of a violent and bizarre murder.As reliable as ever, this is Rendell - and Wexford - once again on fine form. If you want an entertaining, intelligent and realistic with piercing insights into society, Ruth Rendell is the author to whom you should turn. The Wexford series remains the best example of the English detective story currently being produced. It stands out not just for its layered intelligence, but its unflinching social observancy, its piercing insight into human nature, and its warm (sometimes!) and nostalgic centre in the form of Reg Wexford.This novel is a very strong addition to the series. Rendell's mystery is intricate and dramatic and original and very intriguing, with a plausible solution that will shock if not surprise. An Unkindness of Ravens is an excellent book of detection as well as being a vehicle for Rendell's unerring observational insight into society and its constant shifts and changes. It is well worth anyone's time."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"An Unkindness of Ravens (1985) is the first Rendell novel I have read for four years, and it shows her gifts&#65533;characterisation and plotting&#65533;at their best, as she combines a scathing look at political extremism, the psychology of adolescent girls, and a gripping police procedural, with themes of feminism, extremism, teenagers vs. parents, women vs. men, poor vs. rich, and paedophilia.At the heart of the story is Rodney Williams, a missing bigamist, &#65533;two different men&#65533; One middle-aged, set in his ways, bored maybe, taking his family for granted, the other young still, even swinging &#65533; making the grade with a young wife&#65533;, and suspected of having paedophiliac tendencies. It must be noted that the fine revelation of his true character is a genuine surprise. Williams&#65533; murder&#65533;stabbed through the heart, most probably by one of his two wives&#65533;seems to coincide with a series of stabbing attacks carried out on men approaching, or approached by, young women&#65533;&#65533;an extraordinary picture Budd&#65533;s story had created and one which appealed to his imagination. The dark wet night, the knife flashing purposefully, even frenziedly, the girl running into the rain with a sack slung over her shoulder. It was like an illustration in a fairy book of Andrew Lang, elusive, sinister, and other-worldly&#65533;. It transpires that these women are all members of the feminist organisation A.R.R.I.A., whose emblem is a &#65533;raven woman [with] a face like Britannica or maybe Boadicea, one of those noble, handsome, courageous, fanatical faces, that made you feel like locking up the knives and reaching for the Valium&#65533;. It is the raven emblem&#65533;and its followers&#65533;that gives the book its title, for ravens are &#65533;not soft and submissive. The collective noun for them is an &#65533;unkindness&#65533;. An Unkindness of Ravens. Appropriate, wouldn&#65533;t you say? In their attitude to the opposite sex anyway. They stab at us with knives rather than beaks.&#65533; Despite her liberal politics, Rendell is clearly against extremism, although she makes the point that &#65533;revolutionaries are always extreme. Look at the Terror of 1793, look at Stalinism. If they're not, if they compromise with liberalism, all their principles fizzle out and you're back with the status quo&#65533; That&#65533;s what's happened to the broader women&#65533;s liberation movement.&#65533;Chief Inspector Wexford, as always, is actively detecting, showing his human side as well as his intelligence, as he tracks down clues and suspects, continually making comparisons to literature and to history. Although the surprising ending, well-clued, shows Rendell&#65533;s interest in psychology, with terms such as solipsism, folie &agrave; deux, and Freudian seduction theory being tossed around with gay abandon, there is not too much psychology, even though Wexford feels &#65533;he sounded like a psychotherapist, though any interrogating policeman was one of those&#65533;, and Burden&#65533;s familial problems do not intrude.Quite simply, a modern classic of detective fiction, tense and gripping, a book genuinely &#65533;unable to be put down&#65533;."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"This is a fine addition to the Wexford series. Rendell rarely fails in her ability to provide timely social commentary in the middle of a complex investigation. Wexford is at his best in slowly, steadily uncovering what happened to a neighbor amidst a number of various clues and motives. The mystery keeps a reader engaged even as it becomes largely apparent what happens about midway through the work. Moreover, the plot elements on feminism and racial inequality worked well and weren't overpowering in an obnoxious way. This is solid and entertaining fiction."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"The title of this installment in the Inspector Wexford series is beautiful. However, that is pretty much the only thing that is good about the novel. Rendell very rarely misses the mark in her work, but here she unfortunately did. AN UNKINDNESS OF RAVENS is extremely boring. There is a wealth of characters who are extremely similar in a very tedious sort of way. The point of introducing so many similar characters is probably to make it harder for the readers to figure out what happened and who committed the murder. That goal, however, is not achieved. The novel simply drags on forever while Wexford and Burden go through a series of excruciatingly repetitive conversations with a very boring cast of characters.In order to spice up her boring narrative, Rendell introduces a quasi-feminist organization into the story. Her attempts at creating a credible parody of feminism are nothing short of constipated and, once again, painfully boring.Now, if you thought that Rendell could not have possibly created a character more annoying than the uptight and judgmental Mike Burden, guess again. Burden's second wife is a lot more annoying than Burden ever was (even in that novel where he wished the woman he loved lost her child, so that he'd have less mouths to feed.) In AN UNKINDNESS OF RAVENS, the Burden household descends into the kind of insanity that lacks any credibility whatsoever.I usually devour Rendell's books in one or two sittings. She is a beautiful author whose books I will never tire of reading. This novel, however, is one of those rare mistakes that any great writer makes from time to time. The characters in AN UNKINDNESS OF RAVENS are cartoonish, the \\"mystery\\" is transparent, and the story develops extremely slowly."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"Chief Inspector Wexford's neighbor Rodney Williams is reported missing by his wife and what he thinks will be a typical &quot;husband running out on wife&quot; case proves otherwise. As the search for the missing man resumes, Wexford soons finds that Williams was a man of many secrets. The man's penchant for young girls coincides with the popularity of a local feminists group called ARRIA which seems to include every young woman in town. Rendell does a masterful job here of layering new elements to the mystery with every concluding chapter and the outcome eventually turns out to be surprising yet sensible. Rendell is also an expert at molding three dimensional characters with only minimal details (what was the other reviewer reading? ). Overall, well written, literate and satisying."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"A women's rights group populated by high school and college girls and led by a virulent feminist, with a stylized raven logo. The mysterious disappearance of a secretive businessman who's often out of town. Everyone in the neightborhood seems to know about both. It's up to Inspector Wexford to tease apart the disparate threads and solve more than one murder. There are other crimes, equally reprehensible, that contribute to the tangled mess. It's fairly easy to figure out who did it. How, when, and why are questions more to the point, with more obscure answers.Rendell is a literate author whose Wexford series never fails to please and intriguing. And her books are even better when the victim deserves his fate.Note: This book was written in 1986, a long ago time before cell phones and word processing. Though this does not affect the mystery itself, a typewriter is one of the major clues, a blast from the past!"},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"This is the first of Rendell's \\"Inspector Wexford\\" novels I've read so far, and this one wasn't quite as impressive as most of her other endeavors, in some ways. What I did enjoy was the secret society of man haters, or perhaps the uber-feminist group would be a better way of putting it. I found all that psychology fascinating and very compelling. I also had no idea who on earth was perpetrating these murders, so it's not like I had figured it out and was all annoyingly smug. Maybe it was the lack of enough appropriately psychotic characters, or the lack of insight into them throughout the book, as is the case with most of Rendell's other efforts. Still, Rendell on a bad day beats most other contemporary authors on a good one, so I'm not really complaining. Too much."},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"Rendell is obsessed with long, overly descriptive details of dress/appearance, landscape,implied feelings, attitudes & manner.

Version, read by Davina Porter.When a neighbor of Chief Inspector Wexford is reported missing, you just know that this is the murder required for this mystery. Sure enough, a dog sniffs out the body of Rodney Williams, shallow grave!, and Inspector Wexford begins to track down the last days of his neighbor's life.But, who would have thought? In England? There are two Mrs. Williams, each claiming not to know about the existence of the other. Bigamy! And then, incest! Rodney's two daughters, separated by miles but so alike in genes. Was Rodney Williams involved in incest with his oldest daughter, Sarah? And preparing the other daughter, Veronica, (by the second Mrs. Williams, Wendy) for a turn in the incestuous bed?Did he deserve to die? The autopsy shows that Rodney was drugged before he was stabbed to death, which leads to the secondary murder,(a necessary cover-up), of the daughter of the local pharmacist. All young ladies were members of the local feminist group. Inspector Wexford investigates this feminist group, whose logo is a raven with the head of a woman, hence the title of the book. As the Inspector uncovers more and more, it seems that Joy Williams, the first Mrs., has to be guilty. But, so much took place at the home of Wendy, the second Mrs. She had to be guilty, or they were working together ...which they deny. At the end, everything comes to nice and surprising conclusion, but you still have to wonder: all this in modern-day England? Who would have thought?The book is well read by Davina Porter, who has the capability of developing an individual, almost unique voice for the Inspector. Of course, every time the Inspector asks what a person was doing on April 15th, the night of Rodney's murder, I would say to myself that I knew exactly what I was doing. In the book, in England, the alibis were always weak. In the United States, however, the usual answer would have been a very acceptable alibi: \\"I was doing my income taxes!\\""},{"Title":"An Unkindness of Ravens (Inspector Wexford S.)","review":"I picked up the audio version of this book hoping it would keep my interest for a cross country drive.

It' all here: questions of the possiblilty of the hermeneutical enterprise, the beginning of aesthetics, cross-cultural encounters, and comparative poetics. Saussy is quite stunning--while his argument is always one or serveral steps ahead of the reader, his mind is several leaps beyond his prose, which makes sometimes for excruciating and thorny reading. His philology will make the sinologist wince, and his implications set the comparatist fluttering."},{"Title":"Speaking Industry Trends 2000: A Report on Professional Speakers, Speakers Bureaus and Meeting Planners.","review":"This is it!

Many dentists have started sedating anxious patients in their practice with oral benzodiazepines. According to the ADA, as many as one out of 4 patients avoid the dentist out of fear, so the needs for sedation dentistry are considerable.I took one of the oral sedation programs and implemented it into my practice with mixed success. I knew some patients needed more sedation. At other times, I wanted more control over the sedation situation. I enrolled in the program in Dayton, and this was the textbook for the program. The program was intense, and we covered most of the book. It has excellent chapters on local anesthesia and pharmacology that are must reads for every practicing dentist. The patieint monitoring and medical emergency procedure sections are very good. The authors cover the advantages and disadvantages of sedation options very well, and the reader will have a thorough understanding.Would I recommend implementing oral sedation into your practice after studying this text? No. I would urge you to take a class or two in order to provide it in a SAFE manner.

The words are fairly simple, so the series is great for kids ready to tackle chapter books - they won't get frustrated by having too many words they cannot sound out.

For us, This story was particularly engaging. I expected it to be a little dull, but Ms. Osborne really brings Shakespeare alive in this tale. Because of this story, my children have a knowledge of who Shakespeare is, and they are much more interested in his works now. The story follows the same format as the other books in the series, and provides a broad overview of how theater might have worked during the renaissance period. My daughter, particularly, was fascinated to learn that women were not on the stage, and what followed was pure shock on my son's part that men and boys had to play the female roles.

The story was well-done, and the concept of the tree house time machine reminded me of when I was a kid with a tree house in the woods with books strewn across its floor. In a way, many of us did or do have a tree house time machine to carry us away on wings of imagination, and I guess that's one of the reasons why these books are so popular. Osborne is a skillful writer, and I liked that she was realistic about the medieval culture that the siblings visited while still remaining a children's fantasy. Many young adult books set in medieval times shy away from the fact that civilization smelled horrible in those days and life was lived unhygienically by today's standards. A modern person entering the culture would be shocked by the smell, and most time-travel books ignore this, even the adult ones. But it adds to the suspension of disbelief that in this story, Jack and Annie notice such things.I also learned things about Shakespeare and his era from this book, even though I've taken classes on the Bard in both highschool and college. Osborne includes facts in an unpatronizing way that really supplements the story. The extra facts listed in the back of the book are a great added bonus, and I'd be willing to bet that most kids read and remember them as well as the story.I'll be ordering more of these great books next time my kid brings home the old Scholastic form for sure!J.

A small boy copies animal behaviors on his farm...great intro to, well, animal behaviors, and to get your own kid to emulate the behaviors as well. Even non-farmy animals are presented- a squirrel, a turtle, and a snake; I like that because it adds even more interest to the subject and you can engage your child in a conversation comparing the animals- which ones seem farmier, is there a such thing as a snake farm; which animals live in water, eat nuts, have feathers, etc. In the end the boy runs/behaves just like himself in order to get to Dad fast (hence the title \\"Just Me\\"), and the boy and his dad hop onto their boat (\\"went to sea\\") on their pond. The prose is on level with small listeners, with just enough detail to bring smiles and interest. The illustrations have a woodcut/lithograph feel. They are black and white with soft detail and depth, and are sweetly appealing. Purchase, please.

They wrongly regard their contributions as dollars spent towards saving lives and promoting virtue. The real story of government, indeed, the real story behind any socialist enterprise, is that the power given to the state is always power wrenched away from the people. Where Leviathan reigns supreme the rights of the citizenry are irrelevant and dismissed for the \\"good\\" of the whole as disinterested clerks and functionaries determine the fates of millions.Regardless of this historically evident truth, for a public nurtured on sound bytes rather than study, many are in no position to recognize how pernicious the lumbering, corrosive micromanagement of our lives actually is. Yet, awareness could quickly be gathered upon reading the recently released, Getting America Right: The True Conservative Values Our Nation Needs Today by Edwin Feulner and Doug Wilson. It is a muscular condemnation of Big Government while also being concise enough to ensure the focus of those with television attention spans.In these pages, the authors do not propose an end of government, but they do offer up a six prong test to be used in regards to the efficacy of state action. These tests take the form of questions and are explored within individual chapters. Citizens are encouraged to make sure that federal \\"help\\" promotes self-reliance, is responsible, makes us more prosperous, makes us safer, and in some way enhances national unity before they should consent to its implementation-so perhaps my analysis was a tad bit premature as, were we to utilize their template in relation to current and proposed federal programs, it would mean the end of government as practiced today.One of strongest features of Getting America Right is that it cannot be pushed aside as a polemic as its narration is calm, objective, and avuncular. The body of the book is dedicated to reviewing the numerous, yet characteristic, failures of government as our Fedrocracy promises everything but delivers precious little.I suppose there are those who will greet such a work with the statement, \\"We've heard it all before.\\" Well, if they did then they should have started to hold their Representatives accountable immediately. The financing of Ponzi schemes because \\"I deeply care\\" does not mitigate the felonious nature of them. Ignorance is not an excuse. The entity that is supposedly to be watching out for us must in turn be watched."},{"Title":"Getting America Right: The True Conservative Values Our Nation Needs Today","review":"GETTING AMERICA RIGHT is a most useful book when considering what it is to be a conservative, and how that ideology is releant in governing America today. By posing six, thoughtful and thought-provoking questions, the authors' are able to succesfuly probe the activities of our government of late, shwoing them as clearly out of tuch with true conservative values. The six questions: (1) Is it the government's business? (2) Does it promote self-reliance? (3) Is it responsible? (4) Does it make us more prosperous? (5) Does it make us safer? (6) Does it unify us? These questions sare especially relevant as the nature of politics in the nation changes, with \\"big-government\\" becoming ever more popular. Feulner and Wilson do a great job in showing that if our nation is to be as succesful as it can be, we cannot lose sight of what it means to be a conservative, and what government can do to be a little more true to those principles."},{"Title":"Getting America Right: The True Conservative Values Our Nation Needs Today","review":"\\"Getting America Right\\" is a political, not a partisan, book.It sets forth the vision of its authors for a six-point plan that they believe would put America back on course. Of course, what America's course should be is a legitimate topic of debate.All too often, though, that debate degenerates into noisy, angry diatribes in which both facts and logic are quickly lost in a cloud of name-calling.Here, without a partisan tone, the authors lay out what they clearly label conservative views of what the nation --- more appropriately, the citizens of the nation --- need to do in order to alter the course of the United States.Each of their six points is set forth in essentially neutral terms. They give profuse examples of what they think is wrong and then propose remedies. No partisan sniping. No name-calling. Exposition and argument (in the classic sense) to make their point. I wish every book on political issues took the approaches of these authors. Political discourse would be greatly improved and we all might become more civil as we address the problems our nation faces.The authors pose six questions:1. Is it the government's business?2. Does the measure promote self-reliance?3. Is it responsible?4. Does it make us more prosperous?5. Does it make us safer?6. Does it unify us?Each question is addressed by first setting out problems perceived by the authors (i.e., the waste engendered by a 60,000 page tax code; the inequity of a woman with a $5 million annual income paying less in taxes than people earning $50,000). They then set forth their proposed solution. And finally, they set forth the counter-arguments raised by opponents of their views and explain themselves.It's a terrific approach, clearly Socratic and not given to ad hominem.I would hope that Americans of all political persuasions, but who are motivated by their concern for the future of this nation not only read this book but discuss it as well.Jerry"},{"Title":"Getting America Right: The True Conservative Values Our Nation Needs Today","review":"If education is about learning to think (as opposed to fact-gathering), then this book is a crucial educational component for anyone--conservative, liberal, libertarian, etc.--wanting to understand what has gone awry in our country.The authors present a framework of six questions: \\"Is it the government's business?\\"; \\"Does it promote self-reliance?\\"; \\"Is it responsible?\\"; \\"Does it make us more prosperous?\\"; \\"Does it make us safer?\\"; and \\"Does it unify us?\\" Answering these questions honestly--without reference to a particular agenda--suggests that many of the policies undertaken by government today are ineffectual, divisive, and wasteful. Look at the headlines of any newspaper and follow this framework through on only ONE issue; you'll see the usefulness of this work.My only quibble with this work is that I would like to see it more carefully documented -- but it's a small complaint compared to the service that it provides by teaching us to ask the important questions that our political leaders often seem unable, or unwilling, to ask themselves."},{"Title":"Getting America Right: The True Conservative Values Our Nation Needs Today","review":"This book, moreso than any other book of the past few years, is utterly effective in showing not just what the basic tenets of conservatism are in this country, but also how politicians are so egregiously straying from those principles. By carefully citing a multitude of expenditures, like bridges to nowhere, that clearly show a government which is simply out of control, the book is a great read for people of any political persuasion.

You will be dismayed at how our national unity is being eroded. You will be angered at how politicians sell out our military for personal gain. You will be sickened at how American citizenship is being devalued and how even illegal aliens are voting in our elections.The only way we are going to retain our position of strength in the world is if citizens get involved and demand change in Washington. This book is a call to action for Americans who love their country. Legislators must be held accountable for the mess we are in and we must make them understand that we will no longer tolerate the back room deals, the favors to the special interests, the pork barrel spending, the namby pamby immigration policies and citizenship requirements.

In other words something in me opposes this simplistic way of operation, and the presumption that one side is simply all right, and the other side always wrong and stupid.Isn't it possible that the Liberals are more right on some issues, and the Conservatives more right on others?On the whole as it is biased with a conservitive agenda telling me what and how to think,I would not accept it all blindly .

An receipe for destruction.The author does a very good job of juxtaposing the current Republicans with the \\"Reagan Era\\".

(page 23)I reply:If it is impractical, too late and politically impossible to again constrain the federal government to the powers enumerated by the United States Constitution as meant by the framers, then there is no Getting America Right.The authors write:Conservatives do not dispute that government should provide assistance to society's weakest members. (page 74)I reply:This conservative subscriber to the Constitution does absolutely dispute that role for government. It was said of the late Senator Paul Wellstone that he was \\"the most-generous person I ever met . . . with other people's money.\\" Government has no constitutional authority to rob from Peter to pay Paul.

The accuracy and depth of the historical reconstruction give a keen insight into the times of italian Renaissance, providing an extraordinary and original portrait of the great genius and his lonely wanderings through late 15th century Italy. The insight the author manages to give on the artistic and scientific thought of Leonardo are unique, and rival any scientific text.

I've since seen only 3 other copies of it. This is a great pity, as it is surely one of the best written novels any where in the world.

I remember liking the book but not being too thrilled with hero. Thought he was a bit of a jerk at the time.Now, umpty years later, I find myself loving the story and not really hating the hero anymore. I think my 20 years older self reads a little more critically and find that I can't just fit characters in a 'she's awesome' or 'he's an ass' slot when the author has made them much more than that.Catherine Anderson is a young college student who lives in an incredibly dysfunctional and abusive family situation. Clay Forrester is the son of a pair wealthy and loving parents. After a fight with his girlfriend that leaves them broken up for a hot minute, Clay goes on a blind date with Catherine where they get drunk and have sex that results in a baby. The sex and the girl were forgettable for Clay, but worthy of a dissertation in Catherine's diary.The diary is found by Catherine's drunken, dissolute lazy father and he at last thinks 'his ship has come in'. He plans to bleed the rich Forrester's for all they have in an effort to make them support the baby. But Catherine has other plans. After an awkward and humiliating meeting with Clay and his family, She is determined to be beholden to no one. Clay is freaked out. He doesn't remember Catherine at first but it becomes quickly clear that she is indeed pregnant by him. Clays gets pressure from his parents to make things right, Catherine is determined to thwart her father's plans. The two strike a deal where they will get married just until the baby is born.But things don't quite work out the way they plan.In my earlier reading of this book, I was squarely on Catherine's side. She was after all the heroine who was a virgin and got knocked up by a rich, privileged jerk who didn't even remember who she was. Clay was largely just said jerk in my head.But on this reading, I felt the nuances in their characters and their situations more keenly. They were both trapped in a situation that was of both their makings. So while I blame Clay for being forgetful and casual of his sexual partner, I can also blame Catherine for believing that being a virgin makes it ok to know nothing about birth control.The fact of the matter is Catherine was such a damaged soul, that any relationship she had with anyone was doomed until she healed. This was made very apparent throughout the course of the awful marriage where because of her upbringing she had no idea how to relate to people comfortably. She was aloof, guarded, protective of herself. She constantly pushed Clay away because she felt more for him than he did for her and she wanted to make sure she didn't get too attached. At one point she and Clay are arguing about love. Catherine is adamant about a marriage needing to be based on love and she is determined not to have what her parents have. But Clay point out that 'on order to be loved you have to be loveable'. I had been very frustrated with Catherine at that time and was in full agreement with him because all the time in her head she was blaming Clay for not loving her like she loved him, she was also constantly cold and pushing him away.On his side, Clay's crime was full on egotism. He felt resentful and trapped. He didn't choose Catherine on his own so he felt thwarted and self pitying. This was especially evident with his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Jill. She was the one he wanted and he couldn't have her so he blamed everyone for his supposed loss. Meanwhile he longed for her. Again, it is Clay who makes the correct observation. At one point he and tells Jill that they only wanted each other because they were told they couldn't have each other.What worked really effectively for this book is how each character grows and changes. After the birth of their child, Catherine begins to heal and finally learns what Clay was saying about accepting & giving love. Clay also learns what is it to be guarded and uncertain and protective for of getting too close to someone. They each had to step into the other's shoes for awhile in order to finally come together in the right way.The book was written in 1985 and initially I was concerned about it feeling dated. In some ways it did, with Catherine using a typewriter rather than a computer to write papers. But the story holds up pretty well for the most part. The most jarring thing was the total lack of concern with drinking while pregnant. Catherine had wine for dinner a few times and also drank champagne during her wedding. That, and of course the total lack of automatic condom use, just felt weird to me in this day and time."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Spencer is swiftly and surely becoming one of my favorite romance authors! Her ability to craft real and likeable characters surpasses your usual blonde, statuesque, defenseless heroine rescued by savage, rogue-like, insolent-yet debonair-man of the hour types.This story is one that you won't be able to let go of--not even for a second. You'll want to keep reading each word until the very last page until you can no longer see straight!There are so many things that go unsaid between Cat and Clay because of their insecurities and Cat's inability to show affection. Clay is so amazing for coaxing Cat's initial responses. He shows her how easy it is to love--how good it feels to give your heart to another without fear, distrust, or doubt. Cat, however, doesn't make this an easy feat for Clay; he practically fights her tooth and nail for a simple sign of affection.He is the quintessential example of what love should look like. His love for Cat eventually breaks all boundaries between them, even when he has to let her go. And-although it's extremely cliche-their love is \\"proof\\" that if you love enough to let it go, it's probable that love will always find its way back to you.Kudos, Spencer; yet another amazing, can't put it down, my-heart-is-going-to-surely-break kind of read."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It was supposed to be a marriage of convenience - not of love. But, someone once said that the heart has reasons reason never knew. Liz Dykhouse gives a warm, understanding reading of this emotionally charged story of two people who learn a great deal about life and love.Catherine Anderson is a rather intense, studious undergraduate student. Clay Forrester is handsome, a law student who turns many a girl's head. It's unlikely these two will ever meet, let alone have a conversation. Fate steps in with a blind date that brings them together.It's a gorgeous evening, the wine is superb, and they spend the night together. Surely a one-time happening - that is until a few months later when Catherine discovers she is pregnant. The two agree to marry, purely for reasons of convenience which is fine with both of them. Or is it?LaVyrle Spencer fans stand in line to read her next romantic opus. They'll not be disappointed in &quot;Separate Beds.&quot;- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was a pretty good read. I like the idea that both Clay and Catharine come from different social circles. The fact that Catharine was a strong willed, young woman was also great. I like female characters that are strong individuals and can survive without the need of a man although it is quite nice when they do come together in the end. Clay was a person with a good heart. He owned up to his responsibility from the beginning. What I didn't like was that Clay's parents pushed the issue of the marriage. I don't think it was their place to do so. They really didn't know each other at first. I think the parents were being selfish. Also, why didn't Catharine push the issue of her true father's identity. I know I would've if I were her. But, other than that the book was good."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was wonderful. I got this book about mid-way through my second pregnancy and hoped that after work this would be a nice relaxing thing to do. Well, this book was so unbelievable it barely made it through the weekend. Also, it did nothing for keeping calm and relaxed, I felt every emotion just as though I was the main character."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read many of Lavryle Spencer's books and this is the first time I have really been disappointed. The story starts out great but then just moves too slow, and like the other reader mentioned, Clay and Catherine just can't seem to get around their problems and grow up. And so much of the book focused on her problems instead of the growing attraction between the two characters, which is usually what you get from Lavyrle Spencer novels. Definitely not worth the time I spent on it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"SEPARATE BEDS by Lavyrle SpencerMay 1, 2005(Rating 3.5/5 stars)Catherine Anderson is in her early 20's, and she finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with Clay Anderson, whom she met on a blind date through her cousin Bobbi. The opening scene has Catherine with her belligerent father Herb Anderson, her mother Ada, and Clay's parents Claiborne and Angela Anderson. Clay's family is wealthy and successful, while Catherine's family can tout Herb as a chronic alcoholic and abusive husband and father. When Herb finds that his daughter has gotten pregnant by this wealthy young man, he decides he's going to get what's coming to him, which is any money he can coerce from the Anderson's. Catherine doesn't want any of the money, but wants her father to drop the whole thing, and let her take care of this situation herself.The book then goes into Catherine's attempt at fixing her mistake. She moves into a single mother's home while telling her family she's run away and moved to a different state. Clay finds out that Catherine is still in town and hunts her down. When he proposes to marry has as a business proposition, Catherine does not know what to think but she does not want to be in a loveless marriage like her parents.Although a lot of this book is dated, I still enjoyed the plot and as always enjoyed Spencer's writing. She always seems to write these stories that start out so-so, but by mid book, I cannot wait to find out what happens next. The characters may at times seem stereotypical, but it did make a good story. As always I look forward to reading another one of her books."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've enjoyed all the other Lavyrle Spencer books that I've read, but this one just frustrated and annoyed me.Spoiler alert.Throughout the book Catherine is stubborn about resisting love. This goes on for 320 pages out of the 340 page book. Immediately after Clay gives up, she does a 180 within a page or two and suddenly is open to being loved. But it's still not good enough, and Clay has to continue to do all the work. The author does give her reasons for what she does, but let's be honest: just because someone had a traumatic childhood, that doesn't mean you really want to be around them. THis was like spending WAY too much time with a whiner and a bore. I just spent the whole time feeling sorry for Clay; he deserved better than her."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was great! Awesome book, read it in a day, it was so good! My Best friend had the same experience, could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Separate Beds is well written and the characters and their motivations are well drawn out. My problem is that I pretty much hated the heroine, Catherine. I understand that she had a traumatic home life and feel badly for her in that respect, but the way she treated Clay was basically cruel. Even from the start, she wouldn't even give him any info on her pregnancy and her decision on whether she would give their child up for adoption or not. As if he had no say or input or any rights. He is just as responsible for their child as she is and she kept saying she had made her plans and wouldn't deviate from it and she even hid from him! I was disgusted by her behavior. Clay's parents were wonderful and he was basically a Prince Charming and she could barely bring herself to smile at him.She met a perfectly well-adjusted, happy, loving, affectionate person and destroyed him. It really irked me how at the end of the book she was SOOOO happy without him and just went out with other people. She told him more than once he was free to date Jill and go do whatever he wanted and then kicked him out and asked for a divorce b/c she 'thought' he did hook up with Jill. What a ridiculous hypocrite. Catherine was cold, manipulative, selfish and mean. I could not root for her at all. Clay was ever a gentleman to her and respected her inane wishes and she couldn't ever swallow her pride and let him know how she felt. If she was so crippled emotionally, I didn't understand how she all of a sudden transformed into such a \\"wonderful\\" mother. She told Clay she couldn't love properly b/c no one ever taught her how, but as soon as she had a baby she was 100% cured? I don't buy it. And I just couldn't take her constant rejection of Clay. All the guy needed was a damn hug after everything he'd done for her!Even the first time they met, Clay repeatedly asked her if she was sure she wanted to go all the way, he set her up with everything she needed, was always there for her during all her emotional breakdowns, was kind to her friends at Horizon and her family. And he had dated Jill his whole life basically and then lost her b/c he has to ask Catherine to marry him and still he tried to make the best of it. So I didn't blame him one bit when after months of trying to make the marriage work, he kissed Jill. I didn't blame him one bit. Especially since his WIFE gave him permission to date Jill AND refused to let him come near her. Ugh, Catherine really ticked me off.Lastly, I thought it was out of character that Clay, who is extremely affectionate and loving, had no connection with his daughter. It made no sense. I felt the author was inconsistent here. At the end of the book I honestly did not feel Catherine deserved Clay anymore. She wrecked his life, his career and his relationship w/ his family. All for what? B/c she had the emotional maturity of a 12 yr old and couldn't express that she was scared to lose him? Grow up.I can't believe this book is described as a romance, b/c any romance in here is one sided on Clay's part and she never reciprocates. Even to the point that the only time they even make love is the very last scene of the entire book! I would have rated this 1 star but I did like Clay and his family so I added another star."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really love the way Lavyrle Spencer wrote most of her novels--too bad she is retired. Although the subject matter and some content is a bit out-dated in \\"Separate Beds,\\" I still thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read it twice and both times I was completely entertained. If you enjoy well-written romance than this is well worth the read.The story is about a lower middle class college student that gets set up on a blind date with a wealthy (hero) college student. He gets her pregnant during the date and they wind up marrying, with the intention of divorcing after the child is born.The plot is nothing out of the ordinary but Ms. Spencer really knows how to draw the reader in. This is the kind of book that you hate to put down."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I discovered LaVryle Spencer when I was at the tender age of fifteen, and my grandmother gave me her copy of Home Song. Well, I devoured it in about two days and never went back to Young Adult books. Since then I own everything that LaVryle has written, and I've read each book at least twice. She is literally on the top shelf of my bookcase, and I don't think that anyone is going to bump her from that position.Seperate Beds was a wonderful book. I just could not stop reading it. The characters were just so wonderfully developed. Even Catherine was so loveable by the end, even if she was a little bristly and prickly to start with. I just identified with her so much. Granted, I didn't come from an abusive household, but I had struggled with feelings of inadequacy, and even worthlessness for most of my life. I could completely understood how she felt. Her love for her unborn child was so touching, considering how much her life was being derailed because of it.The scene when Clay comes to her bed when she's crying and holds her and tells her that she's not worthless . . . (sigh) I was crying so hard that I could hardly see the page enough to read. I must have gone through half a box of tissues that day. It still brings me to tears every time I read that scene, even if I don't share Catherine's feelings any more.Granted, this book is a little dated with its fashions, etc, but keep in mind when it was written. As a child of the 80's, I cringe at the memory of how we used to dress, but the reminder doesn't at all detract from the book.I highly recommend all of LaVryle Spencer's books (except maybe The Fullfillment), especially Years, Forgiving, Morning Glory, The Endearment and Vows."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I loved this story! LaVyrle Spencer is an awesome romance writer. Whenever I'm looking for a book to just take me away, something to really entertain me or something fun, I read one of her books. The stories are usually simple enough, but they just pull you in.It's about a one night stand that turns into a marriage of convenience. It's only for show and for the baby, and it's set to only last a year. That's until they discover maybe there was something to the one night of passion they shared. Both Clay and Christina are likable characters and it's easy to sympathize. The ending might be predictable, and some of the problems along the way annoying, however the love story is heart-warming."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. The characters were well defined and I found myself wanting to know more and more about them and what would happen next. I don't like to give away any details, I just like to put in my two cents about whether or not it is worth someone's time. This book was definitely worth the time. The characters were realistic and the story line was not at all predictable. I was not distracted by anything and the writing style was very clear."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I agree with the one reader about Catherine's alcohol consumption. Perhaps Spencer had a reason for including this, but if she did it remains a mystery to me. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

Matrin's &quot;Winter Dreams, Christmas Love&quot; third, Danielle Steele's &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; fourth).

It was absolutely breathtaking and by far my favorite. (Like many of her fans, I've read them all!) I couldn't escape any emotion...I laughed...I cried...and yes, even got angry!!!! Immediately, I shared this book with my mom. I anxiously awaited every year for Lavyrle Spencer's new novel to appear. It's sad to see she is retiring.

It was nothing romantic about this book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After suffering from one horrible paranormal/vampire series to another, I decided to go back to the good ole best selling authors. I'm more of a historical or paranormal romance readers but there are few contemporary novels that I like. A friend of mind suggested this book to me and I gave it a try. I mean why not? What can be worst then the genre I was currently reading?I have to say it was heaven sent, a breath of fresh air! What a wonderful story and I'm not at all surprise with all the ratings it recieved. I laughed, I cried (I really did!), and at one time my tempers even flared. Seperate Beds is seriously a wonderful story. It's one of those story that can actually happen and when it does, you really do pray for happy ending. This is one of those stories where you can read anytime of the year. Whether it's during the winter, bundled up in your favorite throw tucked in your most comfortable chair or on a hot summer day out in your backyard with a glass of fresh ice tea or strawberry lemonade.This book will seriously be among my top 10 most favorite romance novels."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am the same person who wrote the critical review below (the one with only two stars). I picked this book up again this week for lack of anything better to read, and was very surprised. I enjoyed the book much more this time, and decided I was too hasty in my comments before. From now on I'll read a book twice before I review it. I really admired the character of Clay, he really owned up to his responsibilities throughout the book. I just wished he'd fallen in love with Catherine sooner. I think that's what disappointed me about this book before, was that she knew early on she loved him but he was only interested in her for one thing. Also, the first time I read it I got tired of reading about all of her problems, but this time I admired her for overcoming them in spite of the family life she had. I still don't think this is Ms. Spencer's best work, but it's definitely not as bad as the review I gave before."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"One of my favorite books. I read it once or twice a year. It is a classic romance."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This romance tale of a bickering couple finally coming together to let bygones be bygones has the required happy ending but the stubbornness of Catherine Anderson leaves a bad taste. The young woman makes an unappealing heroine because of her intractable, inflexible and inforgiving nature, making it difficult for a reader to side with her, in spite of the bad breaks she's had in her life. Clay Forrester's every attempt to support the unwed mother with emotional support and financial aid is rebuffed at every turn, and her only concern is to maintain control over a difficult situation. Ms. Anderson seems determined to punish her suitor to get back at her abusive and alcoholic father and gives little thought to the consequences of her behavior. Ms. Spencer is a great romance novelist but she stuck by this heroine a bit too much, giving her an undeserved happy ending."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I can't say enough good about this book. Catherine and Clay's story was bittersweet and sad for the most part, but it had a happy ending and I cried. What can I say? It's a keeper. I read the paperback and then later bought the hardback just so I'd always have it and I've NEVER done that before. The only thing I would have changed was Catherine's overly pessimistic attitude, which wore thin at times. I kept wanting to be able to shake her and say &quot;give the poor guy a break&quot;. She did have a pretty sorry childhood though, compared to Clay's glorious one, so I gave credit for that. Buy it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Great read. I've read this book about a dozen times.

He cooks and does the laundry!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There was a blind date. They came from \\"the other side of the tracks\\" - Clay Forrester, the rich little spoiled boy and Catherine Anderson, the poor little working girl. He was on outs with her girlfriend/lover. It was a \\"first time\\" for her, but that didn't matter. The unexpected/unwanted still happened. What were people going to say, how could they keep the talk down. Then Catherine reluctantly agreed to Clay's \\"marriage of convenience\\" for the family's sake and she and the child would be taken care of in the end. They became husband and wife... in name only. The wedding of Clay Forrester and Catherine Anderson was the social event of the season. It seemed like a page out of a fairy tale. But everything about it - from the formal vows to the magnificent reception - was a lie. But then feelings got in the way, changes started taking place. And love's face threatened the \\"agreement.\\" Good story, hard to put down. There will be times you will feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster. Highly recommended to read.

She takes an almost unbelievable &quot;what if&quot; situation and makes a strong workable romance. My only complaint would be that the pregnant heroine drinks alcohol while she is pregnant within the story. I hate to think that a young fan might think that this would be Ok for her too. I know that perhaps one drink is fine from a medical viewpoint, but the heroine drinks more than one time. The hero of this romance is realistic, even though he is incredibly wealthy. I'm sure that's not an easy character to create. Kudos to Lavyrle Spencer"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I remember reading and really enjoying this book many years ago and was looking forward to re-reading it when I recently came across a copy. This time around the story didn't work for me, and I think it's because the premise - young adults have single night of passion, are forced to marry, live together celibately and eventually discover that they are in love - doesn't ring true for today's audience. Other authors have made this work in more recent books, for example Susan Elizabeth Phillips, but it's just too simplistic here. Spencer is a very accomplished writer and I continue to enjoy many of her books, but this one hasn't stood the test of time. However, I do think that it might appeal more to younger readers who are just discovering romance novels."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I tried my hardest to finish this book, but just couldn't. I gave it until half way through the book to see if it would start picking up, and it had still failed to gain my attention. To point out a few reasons - This book supposedly takes place modern day, but the characters still talk like it's the 1800's. Also, the main character, Catherine, was just so unlikable to me. She doesn't even give Clay a chance and decides to take matters into her own hands when he is ready and willing to be there for her. I understand she has had a bad past with her alcoholic father, but when Clay is there to man up, she still refuses and is selfish. It bugged me to tears.The book just moved at a horrible pace for me. Clay continuously picks Catherine up at the home for girls, they go out and discuss things, and he drops her off. I did notice some progression of their relationship, which is why I'm not going to give this book a one star rating. I just couldn't finish. There wasn't much character development and the female main character was obnoxious and annoying.I'm usually a big fan of Spencer's books, but this one is probably the lowest on the totem pole."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I realize this is a book written in the mid-1980s. However, one of the things I judge a romance by is how well and realistically I feel the male dialogue is written. Generally, female authors do just fine with women's dialogue, but can be hit or miss with the men. WHen is the last time you heard a 30 year old man use the term \\"davenport\\"?? I was about the age of the hero in this book in 1985, and I swear that the only person I ever heard use that term was my grandma and she was born in 1900. I also got annoyed with the heroine--you love the guy, quit giving him such a hard time, especially when he's being really nice. For me, the book was way too long in the build up and way too short on the resolution."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I love all of Lavyrle Spencer books, however I have two favorites.

I will read this one over and over again!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read all of Ms. Spencer's work and this is one of her best. It is a true Cinderella story with a few unlikely twists added. A wrong-side-of-the-tracks girl meets an unlikely Prince Charming and what they do together will impact their future.Ms. Spencer does an excellent job of making the reader feel the emotions of the characters. I was sad to read in her last book that she is no longer writing. That is a huge loss to romance readers everywhere."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I've never read a book by this author before and probably never will again. First off, a pregnant woman would NEVER (in real life) be doing all that drinking of alcohol while pregnant. 2nd, Clay has to be the most selfish person I'd ever read about. Seems he's not very interested in his daughter even toward the very end of the book. 3rd, What's with his parents anyway? Grandparents don't just go away because a couple separate. Why didn't they attempt to even visit Melissa? Way too unrealistic for me and a total disregard for the realistic facts when pregnant."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was a gripping novel, one I didn't want to put down, as the characters were so realistic. But there were so many problems:-If Clay and Catherine had been any younger I doubt I'd have read this book. I have no interest in teenage love.-I commended Catherine's values at first, but then it became frustrating. It was so obvious she and Clay were beginning to care deeply for each other, yet Catherine continued to reject him, and not just in the bedroom.-Then I worried these two weren't compatible at all because there were so many awkward silences between them; they could scarcely think of a thing to say to each other, and often it was forced.-And Clay, this nice, handsome guy, was so emotionally tortured it hardly seemed fair. I'm glad he had to eventually work things out with Jill; otherwise we would have been left wondering about the past love between these two.-Clay's parents and grandparents were great. I didn't like to see them hurt. Although I don't think Catherine purposely kept them from seeing the baby, she should have offered them a chance to see their grandchild on a regular basis.-Like his parents, Clay was a very affectionate person and it seemed out of character for him not to have held his own newborn baby.-Catherine's mother, Ada, was a pitiful case. I know she was afraid of Herb, but I despised how weak she was. Short of shooting the creep, which he deserved, she should have put her childrens' welfare first rather than neglect them just to keep the peace with her idiot husband. Although she lived in the same house with her kids, for the most part she ignored them throughout their entire lives, and certainly never offered them a hug. What a disgrace!-I was appalled the author had Catherine drink at the wedding, and very heavily too, when just a month or so before she was drinking orange juice!-I was shocked when the author didn't have the baby placed in a car seat. Come on, this book was written in 1985!!! My child was born in 1983 and he was in a car seat! It was the law!!!-And finally, what exactly was Catherine going to college FOR? I was never sure what she studied.Anyway, believe it or not, I loved this book, despite the heartache to so many people. This book was so realistic that, in the end, even though happiness prevailed, you hated the heartaches that had attached itself to so many nice people."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found it interesting how the author used an incredible amount of realism. The story is set in modern-day, about a college student that gets pregnant after a one-night-stand. They marry. It had possibilities, but after getting halfway through with it, no progress was being made. The hero and heroine just can't seem to get past their problems -- specifically, her problems -- and move on with the romance. I especially disliked how he only seems to love her when she has dealt with her problems and changed as a person. If they were really in love, he should have been able to accept her problems and help her deal with them. The entire story just seemed depressing to me. There were too many parts where they were fighting, and even the &quot;happy&quot; parts didn't sound romantic. I think the author has real potential, but this book just doesn't demonstrate it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is a constant arguement! I read the first hundred pages, and skimmed the rest of the book. I got so tired of the argueing between the two characters. My friend loved the book and said she has read it several times, but I was very bored with the bickering."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Separate Beds is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. It is a wonderfully written book about two people and how their lives change when their actions on a blind date result in an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy.Catherine Anderson is a college student who comes from a poor family. Her father is an abusive alcoholic and her mother is a frail creature who doesn't stand up for herself. Catherine's life is a struggle and she isn't shown any love by her family. Clay Forrester, however, is the guy who has it all--money, great looks, a fast car, a family who loves him and everything he wants at his fingertips. These two are set up on a blind date and when Catherine shows up at Clay's house with her father Clay doesn't even remember her. Clay's pressured by his family to do the right thing and give the baby a name. Clay and Catherine agree to a marriage that will keep Clay's name reputable and will give the baby a name. Catherine will get a college education and financial support for the baby. They agree to divorce after the baby is born. Their marriage though must look legitimate and not like the business deal that it is. However, they begin to have feelings for each other but their pride stands in the way. Will the marriage work or will they go their separate ways?This book is just incredible. It is written with such feeling that the reader forgets these are fictional characters and begins to care about what happens to them. I found myself cheering Clay on when he tries to help Catherine understand her feelings. The reader can really see how much Clay cares for Catherine and how much she cares for him, even though she won't admit it.This is a wonderful story. I was sad to finish this story as I wanted it to go on. The characters were all well developed and the story was great. This book is a guaranteed page turner as you just have to keep reading to see if these two can put pride aside and let their love for each other show. A book to put on the keeper shelf and read again. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I would rate this book really 3.5 stars. The novel is appreciably realistic and this author really uses the plot well and expands on it (i.e girl gets pregnant, couple struggle to realise their feelings). This is definitely better crafted for a so-used plot that Mills & Boon novels use rather shallowly. The characters however, could use a little work. Clay comes across as rather shallow, materialistic and immature though his compassionate nature and obvious caring (this develops) for Catherine helps balance this out. It doesn't reflect too well on him that he slept with Catherine just because he had an argument with his then-girlfriend, Jill Magnusson but I guess he was drunk and did make an attempt to stop somewhat counts. Readers can really feel for Catherine and her emotional problems (her barriers) but it can be really frustrating as her attitude drags down the novel at times, particularly when Clay is trying to be understanding. You can understand her dilemma - her inability to trust and love Clay because she fears being hurt and she's never really had that. Also her feelings that she wasn't the one he was supposed to marry and the fact they planned to divorce makes her unable to take a risk with her heart. It is a really sad in the story to see how she goaded and pushed Clay out - for him you can understand that a man only takes so much rejection before he turns to someone else. You can understand that she needed total reassurance from Clay (he wasn't able to give her this and admit his love), before she was ready to commit her love. One thing I didn't like in the novel was how Clay returned to his old girlfriend, Jill Magnusson. Firstly it was distasteful for her to be invited to the wedding and doubly so for him to actually kiss her there. Secondly, after her spiteful hurtful remarks to Catherine which really was the last straw that broke Clay & Catherine apart, it really is awful that he could go back to such a spiteful, shallow woman, knowing Jill's behaviour (her lies to Catherine). It was also wrong of him to confide his marriage troubles to her. Granted, they needed a separation, and it suited Clay to turn to another woman but not Jill. Six months or so to realise what she is OTT. However, on a better note it is their separation that help Clay and Catherine grow up. Clay realises his priorities have changed and finally wakes up to Jill's self-absorption. Having a baby and receiving unconditional love from her daughter, brought Catherine out of her shell to realise that she had to give love in order to receive it. Thus, LaVyrle Spencer really shows her talent for creating realistic and emotionally-wrangling plots for her romance novels. It is a great book and has grown on me."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"HI all you readers! I must confess that i do not read lavyrle books that often. I only read about 5 of them and I sometimes find her books a little cheezy and unreal. But not this very ONE. This book reflects on a pregnant girls life and her path in trying to hold on to the love of her baby and it's father . I usually don't find a good enough story behind romance novels and nothing that makes the story romantic enough. The books usually come out unreal and you cant respond to any lame thing in the book. Seperate beds went way past that obsicle and really caught my interest. This is not just a book to read if you are in for romance. It's also an intruiging story about the ups and downs of being a single mother trying to struggle with your own emotions and everything else that comes along with pregnancy. Not only do you feel so much for the characters, you wanna get to know them cuz spencer really succeeded in making them truly lovable people. 5 stars for a book like this anyday!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Someone recommended \\"Separate Beds\\" to me as a truly great romance novel. She said it was one of her favorites and that she had read it time and again. After reading it, I'm afraid I didn't see what the fuss was all about. I found it to be not so much a romance novel but rather a novel where two people grow up along with their child. There wasn't a lot of romance here.First of all, let me preface my review by saying that I found it difficult to get past Catherine drinking while pregnant and not using a car seat for her infant daughter. My older sister had two children in the early to mid 1980's and I'm pretty sure she knew enough not to drink while pregnant and understood the wisdom of using a car seat. Despite those detractors (or the fact that the young characters didn't speak the way most of their contemporaries would have), they weren't the things I was most bothered by. I wasn't even bothered by the dated feel of the novel, either. In fact, I found some of it amusing and absurd (Clay and Catherine listening to The Lettermen in 1985? Puleeze.).This was a promising tale of a young girl from the wrong side of the tracks who came from an abusive home and married a wealthy, handsome man whose life experiences couldn't have been any more different from her own. The plight of the couple (who had only dated once) and their feelings at the prospect of becoming parents were very relatable and the book kept me quite interested for at least the first half. At that point, Catherine's continued placing of barriers between herself and Clay was understandable but it got old, quickly. Catherine couldn't allow herself to get close to Clay without a commitment so she created all sorts of obstacles to prevent that. For his part, Clay was attracted to Catherine but couldn't feel any strong emotional connection toward her because she never demonstrated any affection whatsoever toward him. I have to say, most of the book was pretty depressing.Also, I just didn't love the two main characters. Clay showed responsibility at first and he was basically a good person, however, some of his actions were reprehensible, imo. First of all, he slept with Catherine while on a blind date after having a fight with his girlfriend, Jill. He invited that girlfriend to his farce of a wedding and kissed her. He made out with her in front of God and the entire country club on New Year's Eve. He went to live with said ex-girlfriend after he left Catherine and after he knew the ex was a complete and utter liar. Finally, this man from a loving, touching family never held his daughter until the end of the story when she was around eight months old. I found that truly bizarre! I understood why Clay left to begin with. Basically, Catherine had frozen him out to the point where they needed to separate and reevaluate their lives. She overcame much, but she was certainly a trying character at times. As an aside, I found it odd that Catherine didn't seem to care much about who her real father was. I know I'd at least be curious.The story ended happily, but I still felt somewhat unsatisfied. For one thing, the sudden, sweet ending just wasn't enough, for Clay and Catherine had been combative for most of the novel. I would have liked a little more, an epilogue or something to convince me they were truly a happy couple at last. This was my main problem with the book. The happily ever after didn't feel totally genuine.Positives: LaVyrle Spencer created a believable story with believable situations and consequences. Her book was rich in detail and made me want to continue reading to see what would happen next. Most impressive was Catherine's emotional journey which showed real growth. Not only did she mature but she learned how to love and be lovable and vulnerable in return. I also really liked Clay's parents for the most part. They admitted they were wrong at first, trying to force Clay's hand. Then again, they were far from perfect, for I surely didn't get why they avoided their granddaughter just because her parents had split up. Still, the connection between them and Catherine was real. You could feel the love and respect there on both sides. In fact, I felt it more strongly than I did the connection between Clay and Catherine!I give \\"Separate Beds\\" 3.5 stars because it was engaging and it did make me think of the story for several days after I finished it. Obviously, I'm not in the camp who adores it, but it's an okay read -- just not an overly romantic one."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read this book over and over again! If you are looking for a book that you cant put down, look no further! The story puts you on a rollercoaster of emotions, from joy to outrage and everything in between! I have now read several of her books and this one still remains my favorite. Catherine and Clay make you feel as though you know them persoanlly and make you feel you have a stake in what is happening. Superbly written so that you will not be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I know it is a favorite of many. I read it a couple decades too late and some circumstances and the reactions to those circumstances are a bit out of date now. This book started out with a good plot and realistic reactions to the unexpectant pregnancy. Due to my age, I could actually relate to the time-frame. Initially, I liked both the hero and the heroine and was looking forward to learning how they fell in love.As the story progressed I became weary of the mind games that Catherine kept playing with Clay. I understand that she was emotionally damaged because of her abusive and alcoholic father and her spineless mother. I think Clay deserved a gold star for sticking with her as long as he did and trying to help her with her problems. She really needed some professional therapy or intervention! Then, toward the end of the book; Catherine suddenly becomes the mature and rational one and Clay becomes the flake. This story had a little too much drama and emotional baggage for me to enjoy."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was on such a good track. The first half of it was heavenly - the perfectness of the angst both Catherine and Clay felt was well done, the hardness of her decision, her fear, her desire not to end up like her mother.After their first Christmas together... ugh. The books spirals downward. I understand these things have a set pattern, and I do love romances. They meet, the fall in love, neither can admit it to the other for fear of rejection, they reject each other, are miserable apart and reunite. I GET IT. The problem with this book? NO ONE is as STUPID as Catherine is when it comes to love. NO ONE would live with a man she's \\"married\\" to and not realize he's falling in love with her.I can't STAND stupid heroines and LaVeryle drags out the gawd-awful part of this book for almost half the size of the novel. Boring."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A modern day fairy tale - Everything doesn't fall nicely into place just because Cinderella meets Prince Charming. The real world intrudes again and again as two flawed human beings have to face heart-breaking obstacles, and their own insecurities and fears, in the course of following their hearts. But there's happily-ever-after in the end - as only LaVyrle Spencer can provide.I first read this book when I was Cathy and Clay's age and I appreciated the uncondescending portrayal of life at that stage - when youre 18-19-20 years old - on the verge of adulthood, but still finding your feet. In this case, the characters are doing it under extraordinary circumstances, but thanks to Spencer's honest portrayal I could easily identify with these two people and I lost myself in their story again and again.Reading it now, years later, I've discovered the story is timeless - despite the now dated clothes and cars and other cultural references (ah, the early 80s!). It still makes me laugh and cry just like it did the first time I read it."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was gripped by the first sentence. although the book is dated, the situation between catherine and clay is modern. the story is so real i have come back to read it at least 5 times. and the ending could not have been more perfect. i was able to finish the book in one weekend and highly reccomend it to anyone who is in to romance."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As my first Lavyrle Spencer book, I found Separate Beds a very worthwhile read despite its predictable storyline.Catherine and Clay are complete opposites; from personality to family background and social status. Finding themselves plunged into a marriage of convenience (or inconvenience due to an unexpected pregnancy), they try to make the best of their differences. Obvious troubles occur as well as some unexpected ones.This is a sweet story that I finished in only 3-days. Spencer's writing style is pretty simple to fly through, giving you enough detail and description to keep you interested without boring you with too much of it. Recommended for those who want a good story but a book they don't have to concentrate on too hard."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"mostly i read fantasy. my mom suggested this book.the first romance i ever read. since then. have bought the book both soft cover and kindle version. have read it five or six times over the years. i like the character development and storyline. always a feel good read."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"LaVyrle Spencer's Separate Beds inspired me to write my first book Truths and Roses. I loved the characters in Separate Beds so much that they felt like people I actually knew. I aspired to do the same for others in my own writing. Ms. Spencer's gift for storytelling and creating lovable, memorable characters is what drew me to her writing and made me love every single book she has written. The day I heard she was no longer writing new books felt like a reason to mourn for me. That's how much I have treasured her stories, and I am so glad they are now available on Kindle for new readers to find and no doubt devour as I have! I envy those who will read this for the first time!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read this book long time ago remembering I liked it so I decided to order for my kindle. But there were many parts in the book where it seems like a page or two were missing. It was hard to follow some parts of the story but because I had read to book before I could follow it. But I felt cheated out of the whole story. I still liked the book but when I went report it there was not an option to explain problem. Luckly I was able to get my money back considering this is an expensive kindle buy. Unless they work out the bugs with the kindle edition stick with the book."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I saw SEPARATE BEDS mentioned in one of the romance threads and thought I would give it a try. Overall it was just an okay read for me. It wasn't horrible, but it's not a keeper for my bookshelf either. I gave it three stars because it was well written and I liked the plot. It was the characters and the last part of the book that kept this from being a four or five star read for me. They both had issues they were struggling with and that's okay. I like a little conflict and emotional turmoil in my reading as long as there's a resolution and happy ending.I hated the fact that Clay took up with his ex-girlfriend even living with her while he and Catherine were separated. Even though Clay and Catherine got back together in the end I just didn't feel it. It seemed like they had been living separate lives and hadn't worked to resolve their issues. They just drifted back together and it seems like to me they could just as easily drift apart again."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The story of Clay and Catherine is my favorite summer read ever! I found an old copy when I was in high school and read it by the pool one summer day. I couldn't put it down!

Even though it's time set is outdated, I still love the book. I also feel this book is a real eye opener for starry-eyed young girls when it comes to pregnancy. I had a friend who was in a home for unwed mothers about the same time I read this book and the parallels between her accounts of the home and Ms. Spencer's are sooo on point. It's a real tear jerker but worth the read. The only thing that would've made this book better would have been a sequel. The reader only gets to see Catherine and Clay as a truly happy couple once in the entire book! Also, a sequel featuring Catherine's brother Steve would make for a good book, plus tie up a few loose ends surrounding Catherine's father. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first book that my mother and I ever shared reading. When I first read it, I was 15 years old and I knew everything, or at least I thought I had! I read this book while camping with my family in Oregon. It took me a day and a half to finish it off, as it was impossible to put down! I am not much of a romantic reader, but this book has something for everyone. I think that men would even enjoy this read. I purchased this version for my mom's 49th b-day. It was such an inexpensive, yet thoughtful gift! She loved it and I look forward to reading it again and again! Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Whew!! What a book! I lost so much sleep and my housework went to hell, but wow was it worth it. I could NOT put this book down. &quot;Separate Beds&quot; was absolutely gripping! Clay was to die for I am telling you...first of all he was gorgeous, but his personality..oh!! He was so playful and adorable and polite, and oh my GOD ..did I mention he was to die for? Next came Catherine. She was not as easy to like as Clay, but her character developed in a believable way...simply put...she and Clay were PERFECT together. This has made my list of top faves. I am telling you..stop whatever you are doing now,buy the book, and for goodness sake...READ IT!!!"},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!A solid story composed of very real, complex and interesting characters, but Clay getting a pass for cheating on wife Catherine with old girlfriend, Jill Magnusson (and moving in with her!), just didn't set well with me. Be a man and get a divorce first. I started out having an enormous amount of respect for Clay for manning up and taking responsibility for his child (despite the absence of DNA as proof back then), but he lost me when he went back to Jill because Catherine didn't know how to love (like Jill did?). I did find it curious that Catherine wasn't at all curious about her real father, who might have wanted to get to know his daughter. Fathers seem to be ignored in most books written by women. Though Catherine was strong, I couldn't help but feel sorry for her, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing. This was a depressing book, the ending bittersweet. I was never fully convinced that Catherine and Clay were in love with each other, but rather they had simply grown together because of their baby. They are the type of couple I can see being relatively happy for a number of years, but ultimately, end up divorcing and finding a greater second love. I thought it would've been more interesting had their baby died and then see if they ended up staying together, for even Jill says something along the lines that it's no so much Catherine she cannot be, but Melissa, his little daughter. I recommend this book only because it is a good read, but falling in love with the characters? Not quite."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old,and since I was supposed to be reading Sweet dreams and Nacy Drew at that age instead of reading grown up books, I had to read the book on the sly, my older sister had borrowed the book from her friend and just before I completed it she had to return it, The story stayed in my mind all this time, I didn't know who the author was but I remembered the title and the story line and all this years I have wanted to find this book so I could finally complete it, I ordered this book a month ago through a local bookstore and went to pick it up on Saturday afternoon. I started reading it at around 23:30 Saturday evening and stayed up or night re-reading the entire book needless to say I only fell asleep after completion which was at 10:00 Sunday morning. I loved this book the emotional upheavels of the two characters was so touching and so real you just had to feel for the both of them, though I thought Miss Spencer should have decreased Clays age to maybe 21 or 22 as he came across as being very immature for a man of 25, I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the book does seem to move a bit too slow, also I don't understand why Clay's family didn't see more of the baby or why Clay didn't hold his baby until the end. Just what the heck was Catherine going to college for? The author never tells us what it was she was studying nor what career path she planned to follow once her degree was completed. However all the above mentioned do not take anything away from the story that is why I'm still giving it five stars, this book was definetly worth the 12 year wait and my sleepless Saturday night, I can't wait to re-read it this weekend ( but of course at a much slower pace since I finally know the ending). Buy this book don't hesitate, it's worth the money and definetly a keeper."},{"Title":"Separate Beds (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was a really good story.
