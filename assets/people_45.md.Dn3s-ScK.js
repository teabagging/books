In the admittedly &quot;extensive and well-researched commentary&quot;?Glancing over the commentary from last week's parsha (Vayigash) I find citations from the following sources among others: Ibn Ezra; Rambam; R. Avraham ben HaRambam; Ramban; R. Hirsch; R. Menachem Mendel of Kotzk; R. Bachya; R. Shlomo Ashtruc; Sforno; the Chafetz Chaim; R. Munk; R. Yosef Dov Solovetchik; R. Yaakov Kamenetzky; R. David Feinstein (not to mention the Zohar and other traditional texts cited by title rather than by author). Even this is not a complete list, and it is just silly to say that the commentary is &quot;not reflective of the variety that is present within the tradition of rabbinic Judaism.&quot;Nor would it even be correct to say that Rashi's interpretation is given precedence over others' (as would be expected if the translation were controlled by his commentaries). At 45:1, for example, the commentary cites three interpretations, one each from Rashi, Rashbam, and Ramban, without attempting to adjudicate between them. At 46:15 the commentary cites Rashi, then Ibn Ezra's contrary reading, then Ramban's disagreement with Ibn Ezra. And so forth.Of course Rashi is cited fairly often, as are other solidly tradition-based writers who have written extensive commentaries on the text (i.e., those who are said to be &quot;acceptable [from] a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) point of view,&quot; to those whom our friend regards as &quot;religious extremists&quot;). Why this should be an occasion for surprise or alarm, let alone an indication that something is amiss with the _translation_ in this edition of the Chumash, is more than I can fathom.Nor is any other evidence offered that Rashi's interpretations have colored or biased the translation itself. And such evidence is very much needed, if only to establish the credibility of the one mounting the claim in question. To put it bluntly, anyone who levels such a charge had better be a highly competent reader of Hebrew himself.I must therefore suspect that the problem here is with traditional translation and commentary in general. It is exceedingly odd to describe straightforward Orthodox Judaism as &quot;fundamentalism&quot; -- a term much more descriptive of the various &quot;liberal&quot; movements which derisively tagged traditional Judaism as &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; in the first place.At any rate, such comments do tell the customer something important: this volume is faithful to Torah-based Jewish tradition in a way that even the most conservative &quot;liberal&quot; Jews will find uncomfortable. In other words, if you want to study Torah, this Chumash is just exactly the edition you need."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"The Stone Edition Chumash includes the Hebrew text of the Pentateuch (the Torah), Onkelos's Aramaic translation and an English translation, commentary, charts, Haftaroth, Megilloth and other relevant synagogue readings.The Hebrew text is clearly pointed and easy to read, beside it is Onkelos's translation, beneath it is Rashi's (Rabbi Shlomo Yitschaki's, 11th c.) commentary (in Hebrew, &quot;Rashi&quot; script). On the opposite page is the English translation and commentary. The translation is accurate, modern, clear and mellifluous. Marginal notes here introduce, summarise and set the context. The English commentary is quite extensive, inspiring and captivating, and carefully selecting from and integrating the classical medieval commentaries of Rashi, the Ramban and Ibn Ezra, among others, and many, many modern, Orthodox sages. The word of God is the concern here, and its illumination is pure and profound.The book is also aesthetically beautiful in every respect.This edition is, in my opinion, the best single volume translation of and commentary on the Torah available."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"First, I would like to say that I received this item sooner than anticipated, which was my first surprise.

This is fast becoming the most popular English-language Chumash for synagogue and home use, and it's easy to see why.With illustrations, cross-references, and haftorahs included in this nicely-bound single volume, it's a thrill to see a work of this quality available...This makes a fine bar/bat mitzvah gift, or even a wedding present, as it's an essential addition to any Jewish home (even one that has another Chumash/Bible already).As well, for non-Jews studying the Torah in the original or seeking an introduction to Jewish interpretive tradition, there are plenty of commentaries, illustrations and footnotes to make your study a meaningful experience."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"This chumash is absolutely magnificent. First, the translation is wonderful; clear and easy to read. There hasn't been a passage yet that I couldn't figure out what it was trying to say.Beyond that, the commentary is wonderful too. For example, it notes for Genesis 3:4 that Adam, when he told Eve of G-d's prohibition on the Tree of Life, added to G-d's prohibition words that G-d did not speak. Adam told Eve that touching the tree would kill her, though G-d never said this. Thus, the commentary says that perhaps the snake pushed Eve against the tree, and when Eve did not die, the snake convinced her that if that one part of the prohibition was false, then the whole prohibition was false.For Genesis 6:1-2,4, it notes two possible interpretations for the sons of G-d taking wives from daughters of men. It says that sons of G-d could mean righteous, G-d fearing men, and daughters of men are less spiritually upright people. Thus, the spiritually high people debased themselves by marrying less spiritual people, thus consigning them to the same fates. It also notes that Eloh-m is used, the rulership aspect of G-d, so perhaps sons of G-d means rulers and kings and daughters of men means ordinary (common) women. Therefore, it means rulers forcefully took commoners as wives, thus showing that before the Flood, the powerful had begun to subjigate and abuse the weak.Many are troubled by Exodus 21:2-6, which says that if a Jewish slave is given a wife while he is a slave, once he is freed, he must either leave his wife or, if he wants to stay with his wife, he must remain a slave forever. To many, this doesn't seem very moral. However, the commentary very effectively sheds light on this passage. It notes that Leviticus 25:39 says that a Jew who sells himself into slavery to pay off his debts is to be regarded as an indentured laborer, not a slave. The only other way to be sold into anything like slavery is steal something and not be able to make restitution. Thus, Exodus 21:2-6 is speaking of a thief, not of a poor impoverished misfortunate laborerer who sold himself to pay off his debts. Second, it notes that the passage speaks of a women OWNED by the master being given as a wife to the slave. If the master OWNS the women, she is not an Israelite/Jew. Therefore, she is a gentile slave, probably a descendent of a prisoner of war. Therefore, Exodus 21:2-6, when it says a slave must either leave his wife or remain a slave forever, is really speaking a thief who was graciously given a wife (if you ask me, he doesn't deserve a wife) who was probably a descendent of a prisoner of war who was graciously enslaved rather than killed. The passage sure seems far more moral, doesn't it?As can be seen, this commentary is terrific for illuminating confusing and troubling passages in the Torah. Even passages that seem straightforward and easy to understand often have a great deal more to be learned from this commentary. Though this commentary may be too \\"pious\\" or \\"fundamentalist\\" for some, most of the commentary deals with straightforward meanings, and as often multiple interpretations are given, there is nothing to stop one from picking choosing what to believe from among the interpretations given. I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"This edition tries to condense as much of the basic wisdom of the Jewish tradition about the Tenakh into a single volume. It does a splendid job at that, with a translation of everything from the Bible one would need for liturgical use (Torah, Haftarot, Megillot) and a good starting commentary on the Torah itself. However, it must be remembered that this book *is* a condensation. As such, the English text is very selective in what commentaries it chooses to include. As such, it presents a good, basic, down the line approach. Do not expect profound mysteris to abound in this volume. Also, for those who are not from a strictly observant, Orthodox background, the tone adopted in the volume can be at times a tad pompous and overbearing.If you understand Hebrew/Aramaic, this is a great book that adds to the vocalised text of the Torah the commentary of Rashi and the Targum of Onkelos. If you don't understand Hebrew, this is a great point to start! One can quite comfortably learn the Hebrew of the Torah from this volume as it is a a side-by-side edition with two parallel languages which is helpful to develop your own language intuition.The book guides the reader to understand just how much more there is to be learnt and that's a great thing. The fact that it presents a basic point of view is also great because too many people fail in their learning by ignoring the basics.A great introduction into the Jewish understanding ot the Torah"},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"this is a great chumash version.artscroll has the best in judaica[siddur.tanach.torah].the addition of onkelos[the full aramaic translation of torah's 5 books] is the best.the version also has the rashi commentary and other commentators from orthodox jewish sources.great book, get it."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"This presentation of the Chumash was very well planned and printed.

If you only want one Chumash in your library then make this the one. However, one must understand that the commentary does not even scratch the service of inner meaning of the text. It is simply a minimum line or put in a positive way, a springboard to further study.One reviewer commented that &quot;This commentary picks and chooses which midrashim are to be authoritative, leaving the rest to the dustbin of history. While this indeed is illuminatin [it illustrates clearly what the author's biases are] it also gives a terribl narrow picture of authentic rabbinic Judaism.&quot;This is totally unfair. No one ever suggested that this was the be all and end all of Chumash commentary. Indeed the idea is quite ludicrous. Nothing is consigned to the dustbin of history. You simply have to go on to more advanced sifre Kodesh. The author had no choice but to narrow his commentary. You cannot fit the waters of the ocean into a plastic bucket.So I suppose it is only fair of me to suggest another Chumash that one can advance to. &quot;The Call of the Torah&quot; by Rabbi Elie Munk is a five-volume set also published by Artscroll. Rav Munk combines both the classic commentaries of Rash&quot;i, Ramba&quot;m, Ramba&quot;n etc, the &quot;peshat&quot; of his teacher Rav Hirsh and also the more hidden Torah of Kabbalah.

While the translations are readable, they sometimes vary greatly from the actual Hebrew text. This is because the editors have chosen one particular Torah commentray (Rashi), and have biased the translation in favor of Rashi's interpreation, even when they were only meant to be allegorical. This bias makes Rashi out to be an authority second only to God! Due to this overwhelming bias, all of the other hudnreds of Bible commentators together barely equal Rashi alone - at least in the eye's of this book's editors.While it certainly is important to present a digest of Rashi's views, it is most inaccurate to bias the entire translation according to him.Fortunately, the extensive and well-researched commentary presents a digest of thoughts from rabbis; Unfortunately this commentary is limited to those views that are acceptable a Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) point of view. Thus, the commentary is not reflective of the variety that is present within the tradition of rabbinic Judaism.The same goes for midrashim, which are rabbinic exegetical glosses on the text of the Torah. This commentary picks and chooses which midrashim are to be authoritative, leaving the rest to the dustbin of history. While this indeed is illuminatin [it illustrates clearly what the author's biases are] it also gives a terribl narrow picture of authentic rabbinic Judaism.In terms of physical presentation, this work is an elegent example of beautiful typsetting, readable fonts, and a beautiful cover.It is earnest, authentic, and pious. But in the end, it is biased towards the religious extremists, and this in the end shortchanges the reader of what should be a wider and more varied education.I would suggest getting the Soncino Chumash, or the five volume JPS Torah commentary set, instead. However, note that this Chumash _can_ be good, if you already know the breadth of the tradition, and so can avoid its pitfalls."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Strap-On Sex: A Complete Resource for Women and Men","review":"This is the first book I've read that I have learned some neat tricks from.

If I were a regular reader of Butch's columns, I'm sure I'd have a lower opinion of this, but if I haven't seen it, it's new to me. Additionally, sex positions are described rather than illustrated--I found this hot, but some may not.One more thing to note is the use of pronouns in the book--Butch doesn't seem to go in for the \\"zhe, hir\\" style of gender negativity, instead varying the couplings she uses as examples for techniques. Since she presents every gender strapping on and acting as receptive, it occasionally took me a couple read-throughs to determine who was doing what to whom with which organ/device.

They claim that humans possess four basic drives to acquire, to bond, to learn, and to defend. The unique approach in their book is the manner in which they apply their theory specifically to the workplace. Historical case studies are used to show that successful organizations are those that give their employees opportunities to fulfill all four of these drives. There are of course a number of competing drive theories from Freud's sexual drive to Steven Reiss's 16-drive theory. The authors, well versed in sociobiology, openly acknowledge that the numbers and exact nature of our drives need further exploration and provide suggestions for research projects. Irregardless of how many more drives one human may or may not posses their theory is enlightening for any reader. While being academic in its approach and presentation it is written with the lay reader in mind so any undergraduate will comfortably assimilate the information provided.

These drives are to (1) Acquire, (2) Bond, (3) Learn, and (4) Defend. The authors search broadly through various disciplines to support their theory, significantly focusing on evolutionary sciences and neuroscience. Their work is a contribution to the literature on organization development vis-&agrave;-vis human biology and neurology, but unfortunately does not go far enough and reveals errors and lack of depth. For one, they postulate a Great Leap forward in human evolution dating back 70,000 years, but fail to account for the fact that although human \`evolution' per se seems obvious, evolutionary science to date does not link man directly to earlier non-human life forms (i.e. the \\"missing link\\").The authors likewise delve into neuroscience in an attempt to prove a unified theory of our drives by linking them to neurological activity in the limbic center of our brains, but stop short of including or even alluding to respected research that explores links between activities such as meditation and brain functioning (e.g. neurotheology, AUB), much of which supports a uniquely human neurology linked to spirituality (while not necessarily claiming to prove or disprove a God).Even their case studies make errors of omission. They overlook key variables in their cases involving the economies of Russia and Ireland, and do not account for global economic influences. Today it seems more commonly acknowledged that the failure of capitalism in Russia had less to do with factors related to the imbalance of these 4 drives than with the monopolizing of the country's natural resources and large business ventures by the old party elite, and the economic successes of Ireland that they site as evidence of a country that balances these 4 drives is somewhat dated as Ireland today has budget deficits and the highest rate of inflation in all of Western Europe.It would seem wise for Lawrence & Nohria to supplement their 4 drives with non-biological human drives such as our commonly acknowledged spiritual quests, for one. If we have an innate drive to transcend this material world and to know God (Western theists), our Ultimate Reality (Eastern spirituality) or our higher power (atheists), and if we at times even \`deny' the other 4 drives in this quest, some even to the point of martyrdom, how can Lawrence & Nohria claim to have captured the essence of human nature? If for instance, the Jews of old gave up family, nation, and even life to remain true to their spiritual drives; and if early Christianity evolved \`in spite of' the persecutions and against the accepted teachings of the day to acquire (\\"it is better to give than receive\\"), bond (in lieu of their own family members who did not accept Christianity), learn (as per their traditional mindsets) and defend (martyrdom, etc.); if early Islam likewise revealed a community of early believes who went against most of these drives to later establish a human system that embraced a vast expanse of land from North Africa to Portugal to Arabia; and today if Baha'is give up money (acquire), family (bond), school (learn: it is illegal for Baha'is to go to university in some nations), and even life (defend) as they are driven by faith in lands where it is fiercely persecuted; and finally if a cross section of humanity including humanists and atheists can sacrifice all for fellow humanity, how again can Lawrence & Nohria with such confidence claim to have the best unified theory of human nature that is reduced to our DNA?"},{"Title":"Driven: How Human Nature Shapes Our Choices","review":"The arguments presented are based on weak theories and opinions.

While some readers may be familiar with a lot of what is presented here, it is agreeable to get a perspective from another academic discipline and a new sense of application. It is especially pleasing because professors Lawrence and Nohria write well and have an appreciation of what an exciting time of biological discovery we are living in, a time when the convergence of knowledge and techniques from various disciplines is giving us the ability to look inside the black box of human nature previously closed.The authors' use of the term \\"drives\\" to designate the source of behaviors is familiar, but the idea that these drives come from modules in the brain, or a network of modules, is what is relatively new. Whether this is just another construct like Freud's ego, id, and superego is an open question. However--and this is important and at the very essence of what is going on in brain science today--unlike Freud's construct, the one presented here is based on something tangible in the brain's structure. As the authors report, recent advances in technology allow us to discern the brain's structure as it works. These observations provide a scientific basis for constructs attempting to explain human behavior. Whether there are four fundamental drives, as messrs. Lawrence and Nohria think, or some other number, or whether an entirely different construct is required, is also an open question. Personally, I find their array persuasive, and I think the idea of \\"drives\\" a valuable one. More important though is their understanding that we are motivated by more than rational self-interest, the so-called \\"invisible hand\\" from Adam Smith and the market place.Here are the drives as defined on page 10:D1 is to acquire objects and experiences that improve our status relative to others.D2 is to bond with others in mutually beneficial, long-term relationships.D3 is to learn about and make sense of ourselves and the world around us.D4 is to defend ourselves, our loved ones, our beliefs, and our resources.In should be noted that these four drives do not in any way contradict the general finding in biology that individuals tend to behave in such a way as to enhance their reproductive success. What is new is that such \\"selfish\\" behaviors include behaviors usually seen as altruistic. Yet I think the authors would enhance their understanding of the idea of \\"altruistic behavior\\" by reading Amotz and Avishag Zahavi's The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997) in which the adaptive function of some altruistic behavior is to directly advertise fitness.It should also be noted, as the authors do on page 63, that \\"What drives behavior is a contest among the emotions, not the rational calculation alone.\\" In other words, rationality leads to the creation of an emotion which competes with the instinctive emotion. This is an important concept. It is not the rational mind overcoming the emotional mind, but the employment of emotion by the rational mind to overcome instinctive imperatives which sometimes lead us in the wrong direction.Through the process of \\"social bonding\\" as presented on page 83, the authors embrace the idea of group selection, an idea disparaged by notions from Dawkins's \\"selfish gene\\" and elsewhere. The idea that there could be the selection of genes that \\"orient behavior toward the good of the group\\" has long been discounted by the establishment in evolutionary biology. (This view is changing.) The seemingly very convincing argument has been that \\"any carrier with a genetic disposition to be nice to others would be, in time, wiped out by the selfish free-riders in the population.\\" (Still on page 83.) My feeling, however (similar to that of the authors), is that for human beings the \\"in time\\" part has never had a chance to kick in. This is mainly because of the constant struggle of tribe against tribe throughout human and pre-human history. The benefit to the tribe from individuals willing to risk life and limb for the good of the tribe is clear. What has not been realized by many is that the benefits to the individual by enhancing the tribe's fitness more than offset the loss incurred from taking risks. True, if the tribe faced no outward danger for a long period of time, the genes of the \\"selfish free-riders\\" would predominate in the population and the altruistic genes would die out. But that hasn't happened. Consequently groups (bands and tribes) that contained many \\"altruistic\\" individuals survived while groups with fewer altruistic individuals died out. Therefore we have the \\"group selection of individuals\\" (which is a way I have seen this phenomenon phrased).I should also like to note that religion, the cultural evolution of, is accounted for in a similar way. Those tribes that had religious beliefs strong enough to facilitate bonding and altruistic behavior survived more often than tribes that did not. This is something that E.O. Wilson pointed out some years ago in his book On Human Nature.I think this is an excellent book for the general reader and a fine melding of the ideas of evolutionary biology into the culture of the work place and other loci in the modern world. The authors do a good job of showing how the ideas of evolutionary psychology go far beyond the retelling of \\"just so\\" stories, ideas that can help us to understand ourselves and the world in which we live."},{"Title":"Driven: How Human Nature Shapes Our Choices","review":"Leave it to two Harvard business professors - Paul R.

In contrast to many models of human behavior (economic = self-maximizing, etc) that aren't credible because they don't explain much of what we human beings are really like, this book presents a more complex model that, in my opinion, rings true. Even better, the authors don't try to claim perfection, instead being happy with being useful. In the best scientific traditions, the conclusions of this book are stated in such a way that it is clear what they know, what they think and what they hope. The authors are also unafraid of criticism (good science), confident that their thoughts are valid but quick to point out areas that need more research and in several cases, describing realistic experiments that could be conducted.

I was actually dreading to read the book, however the authors have done a magnificant job of livening up each academic part with real world case studies. The main theme of this text is how we base our decision making on four psychological drives that every person is born with regardless of religion, race or other factors:1.) The Drive to Acquire (D1) - We all have it, it is normal but some have too much of it. Those who have an overdose of D1 tend to teeter on the edge of self-destruction and those around them.2.) The Drive to Bond (D2) - Everybody likes to feel wanted and belong to some type of organisation (family, cultural, religion, hobby, etc., When a person engages in decicion making, they will usually decided positive for the person who has something in common with them.3.) The Drive to Learn (D3) - Learning is a part of life and when this drive is not satisfied in people they become aggressive and restless. Have you ever seen a highly intelligent well-paid co-worker leave a job although this person never had any problems with peer or superiors? Chances are that this person was in dire need of a cerebal orgasam i.e. The person was somebody who needed to be mentally challenged.4.) The Drive to Defend (D4) - We have learned certain beliefs and take them to be true until proven otherwise. When somebody attacks or tries to show us otherwise we become agitated, angry or beligerent because deep down in our subconscious we have a defense mechanism that does not want to be proven wrong.This is an excellent book for markets, negotiators and employers. What makes us tick inside our crainium. The authors have excellent examples taken from Hewlett-Packard and how they created a bond between employees and the company.

The reason behind this is this books challenging approach, based mainly on inner and outer focus rather than on positive or negative meanings. But that is only a part of what goes on in Ms Fairfield's book. There are brilliant essays on how to choose a deck (don't only expect the usual &quot;choose one that resonates with you&quot; approach here, you may realise quite a few things about your political views depending on which deck you choose), how to design a spread, how to read for groups and numerology, apart from card definitions diferent to the usual ones. I am not saying that these explanations contradict what other books may give on the subject. Rather, thet are complementary (and from my experience, they work specially well for &quot;here and now&quot; questions). In spite of this all, this is an easy book to read, and it will specially suit intermediate tarot students (but can be read by everyone)."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"Fairfield's take on the Tarot is a little different than what most of us are used to. She bases her meanings for the Minor Arcana solely on numerology rather than visual cues; her meanings for the cards are based on what the numbers mean to her. The result is an unusually positive meaning for each card--a little bit politically correct, IMHO. 5 of Pentacles? You're not having financial trouble, you're just going through a period of re-adjustment! *chuckle* While I'm sure these meanings would give a different slant to a tarot reading, I don't use them much because some of them differ vastly from the traditional meanings and from the artwork in my decks. I'm more story- and picture- oriented than number-oriented; I want to look at a card and sense its meaning intuitively, rather than having to look up a number in a book. The card itself, rather than any book, is the biggest clue to its meaning--at least the way I work. But there is room for all opinions, and besides, this book would work well if you were reading a deck with pips, or an ordinary playing card deck. Fairfield's system wasn't my cup of tea, but that doesn't mean it won't be yours. The true treasure of this book is the last several chapters, which focus on doing readings. She provides suggestions about creating your own layouts, using the tarot for dream analysis, using the tarot to clarify yourself in a discussion, etc. She encourages the reader to do things her/his own way. And I can't argue with that."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"I've been reading the tarot for over 15 years and this is one of the best books on the subject that I have found.

Each life event, each emotional interaction, each inner awareness, presents us with an opportunity to understand ourselves and our Universe better. Every new problem or question is a challenge; with each challenge we discover new ways of using the Tarot.\\" - From the bookAuthor Gail Fairfield advocates a choice-centered approach to Tarot, which encourages Tarot readers and querents (\\"readees\\" as she calls them) to use the cards for making better life decisions. In her book Everyday Tarot, Fairfield explains the structure of a Tarot deck, the development of number (such as \\"Two-ness\\"), the four suits, designing a layout (card spread) and more.An excellent book for both Tarot beginners and experienced readers, Everyday Tarot provides an overview of the Major and Minor Arcana. According to Fairfield, every card is neutral in value, i.e. neither good nor bad in and of itself. However, the meaning of the card can be stretched along the entire spectrum of positive or negative. She likens cards to rain: rain is neutral, but too much can cause a disastrous flood and too little can cause a drought. Determining whether a card is to be interpreted positively or negatively depends largely on a querent's personality, question, and spread position.Regarding reversals, Fairfield doesn't feel that the basic card meaning is affected, although the way an individual experiences the concept may change quite a bit. Upright cards indicate that an individual is experiencing the concept in a public, clear, objective or obvious way. Reversals, however, indicate that an individual is experiencing the concept in a more subtle, private, subjective, internal way.For each suit and card, the author provides General/Neutral meanings as well as Positive, Negative, Upright, and reversed.Arguable the most intriguing part of Everyday Tarot is the development of number throughout the Minor Arcana. Fairfield groups all the Minors in sets of three, except the 10's and Kings. These groups describe four different cycles-each having a particular level. She explains that every triad contains THIS, THAT, and THE OTHER. THIS refers to something new that is established, THAT challenges, confronts, changes or expands THIS and THE OTHER resolves and integrates the interaction between THIS and THAT. For example, Aces start the first cycle of three (the conceptual level) and are THIS, while Two-ness solidifies or confirms the direction of the Ace (THAT). Three-ness (THE OTHER) then unifies the aggressive energy of the One/Ace with the stabilizing energy of the Two. (The way she explains these groupings and cycles are easier than it sounds.)The 10's are described as \\"hesitating\\" and aren't included in the triads or cycles. The Kings represent a completion point, and thus are outside of the triads as well.Everyday Tarot also includes information on the reading process, choosing a Tarot deck based on symbols, ways to use the cards, and expanding your reading skills.Personally, I found a lot of new, helpful information in this book. For example, I hadn't considered numerical values all that much when performing Tarot readings, but Fairfield's methods are so sensible and accessible, that I've started employing her system. I am also enjoying exploring reversals as internalized versions of cards as opposed to interpreting them merely as blocks, hindrances, or opposites of upright meanings. Everyday Tarot has also provided me additional insight regarding the suit of Wands. Fairfield considers Wands the suit of \\"Self\\", representing personal growth, awareness, and personal direction. It's the suit asking, \\"Who am I and where am I going?\\"I've highlighted my copy of Everyday Tarot to death, and refer to it often. Overall, it's probably the best Tarot book that I've read thus far. Fairfield writes in the engaging style of a fellow reader as opposed to some high-minded \\"expert\\" pontificating in brittle prose. Her explanations are clear, her organization is tight, and her methods are empowering to both the reader and the querent. At 153 pages, it's not a huge book, but it's packed with immediately useful information and new ways of looking at-and using-the Tarot."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"Gail Fairfield's \\"Choice Centered Tarot\\" is one of my top 5 tarot books. Rather than a lot of superstitious fatalism, Fairfield offers us a worldview that embraces taking personal responsibility for our choices in the present moment in order to CREATE our futures. The tarot is presented as a tool for gaining insights into those choices so we can be more informed and conscious. The section on choosing a deck based on how certain facets of humanity are depicted in the card images is very helpful and thought-provoking. The section on designing your own layouts is deeply empowering! When I first read \\"Choice Centered Tarot\\" in the 1980s, it made a huge impact on my tarot work AND on my personal philosophy of life. It still does. Get it and use it!!!"},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"If you're looking for an intelligent, well thought out and organized guide to using tarot cards, this is the best I've ever found. It is not, strictly speaking, a traditional, Waite-deck, 'fortune-telling' approach. Originally published under the title, 'Choice Centered Tarot', this allows one to use the tarot as a guide to reflection, choice-making and everyday living. It can be used for creative projects and busting out of mental ruts. It is also easy to read, use and understand, and it's fun."},{"Title":"Choice Centered Tarot","review":"I've been reading for over 30 years, and this is *still* my absolute favorite tarot book. I like the different approach she takes to it, addressing symbolism and numerology, rather than just the meanings of the cards. I'm thinking about starting to teach classes and, if people can still get it, this is the book I'll use."},{"Title":"Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft","review":"Question: How might religion and spirituality play a positive role in the work of diplomacy?When a friend in Washington, D.C. recommended I read Religion, The Missing Dimension of Statecraft, I hesitated. I shouldn't have waited. This book is a series of theoretical chapters and case studies, which illuminate the effect of a sacred-secular dichotomy in public life and religious life in the United States. It shows how American diplomats have been unwilling or unable to understand the influence of religion in peace-making the past several decades.Douglas Johnston shows how the role of religion in peacemaking is mostly unnoticed because religious mediators typically avoid attention from the media.Conflict resolution is chronicled in post WWII France and Germany, Nicaragua in the mid-1980s, Nigeria in the Biafran civil war, East Germany's peaceful transition from communism, South Africa's journey to the end of apartheid, and more. These case study chapters show how, in each of these conflicts, there were faithful Christian leaders serving as peacemakers. These mediators paid close attention to the role of religion in the peace negotiations.Finally, after surveying the track record of the US foreign policy establishment's attention to spirituality, a few chapters explore the implications of the case studies. For today's Christian leader, this book is a useful resource to seriously examine the challenges faced in envisioning how we might partner with political leaders to realize the fuller potential of peacemaking.However, this kind of diplomacy must not become publicized. It's best left to the quiet negotiators, the true peace-makers."},{"Title":"Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft","review":"Amazon sometimes eats reviews when editions change. I bought and read this at the same time that I bought and read the same author's book on \\"Faith-Based Diplomacy,\\" and I just want to say, after reading the books and also hearing him speak, he is on to something very very important. I believe that we need an Undersecretary of State for Cultural and Religious Affairs just as we need an Undesecretary of State for Democracy and an Undersecretary of Defense for Peacekeeping. America is completely out of touch with the world, and genuine faith, not the American Fascist faith of the fundamentalist right, is a compelling moral advantage that we have lost sight of.Here are some other books I recommend:Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping RealpolitikGod's Politics: Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It (Plus)The Left Hand of God: Taking Back Our Country from the Religious RightThe Republican War on ScienceTempting Faith: An Inside Story of Political SeductionAmerican Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On America"},{"Title":"Religion, the Missing Dimension of Statecraft","review":"Many examples of Christians working, such as in Eastern Germany just after the wall came down.

I'm studying it now for the Series 65 and find myself cursing every 3rd page or so. There are multiple typos, grammatical errors, and mis-spelled words. Even worse, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense. A subsequent paragraph often contradicts its predecessor, for example. I'm waiting until I finish it to call Dearborn's &quot;help line&quot; with all of my questions. It will probably take an hour to get through all of them. I do not recommend Dearborn's publications and wish that someone would kick them out of this market. Dearborn's editors are welcome to hire me to summarize all of the problems I found with this book."},{"Title":"The Diabetic Athlete","review":"This book is divided to two parts. The first part explains the physiology of exercise and how it relates to diabetics. It includes general chapters and chapters dedicated to type 1 and type 2. The premise of the book is that knowledge is power, so knowing what the body does during an exersice is powering you to better manage your diabetes as it relates to exercise. It also has a chapter on nutritional supplements for diabetic athletes. The second half of the book deals with specific sport activities and gives advice on how to change your nutrition or insulin regimes to better accomodate for these activities plus examples from actual athletes. I found this part to be less usefull. However the book is worth its weight in gold just for the first part and is a must have for any diabetic that considers exercise as part of his medication. The book is very well written, full of concise and clear information."},{"Title":"The Diabetic Athlete","review":"The Diabetic Athlete was exactly what I was looking for.

We are well into the baseball season and looking ahead to hockey. I was very nervous about handling low blood sugars, but he seems to take it all into stride.I highly recommend this book -- it is easy and interesting to read."},{"Title":"The Diabetic Athlete","review":"This was not quite as helpful as I'd hoped. I can understand why, since there is no one answer for the challenges of managing diabetes and exercise. It listed many types of exercise and then what various diabetics might do in certain situaitons, but the end result is that you STILL have to figure it out for yourself. I guess I was looking for more guidance, and more physiological information. Still worth purchasing, and there is a new version in the works by the same author."},{"Title":"The Diabetic Athlete","review":"I am a Type 2 diabetic using an insulin pump.

Twelve years ago, in one horrible night, her father was lynched for a crime he didn't commit, and her gypsy mother, LaVita, fearing for her own life, ran away and abandoned her.Now Chantalene is determined to find out what really happened, and who killed her father. The townspeople aren't exactly thrilled to see her, and things start going dreadfully awry from the first page. Fortunately, she finds an ally, Drew Sander, a New York tax attorney, who is also returning to Tetumka, but for very different reasons. I won't tell you what happens, of course; you'll have too much fun reading this book for yourself.Author Marcia Preston writes an engaging fast-paced thriller that hooks the reader from the very first sentence and doesn't let go until the end. The mystery has many levels--child abuse, traumatic memories, frontier justice, and the characters' search for their own integrity. Not to mention a delightful hint of romance. I can recommend this book for a really enjoyable read. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"I finished the book this morning with the satisfied feeling of having spent my time on worthy reading.

But this was a surprisingly well-written and intriguing book. This is my first book by M.K. Preston and I'll now try another!"},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"This was a wonderful read. The story moved and I was caught up from the first page. The mystery was cleverly devised; even though all the clues were placed, I was surprised by the outcome. The characters were intriquing and felt like real people. Their conversation was natural and engaging; I loved the interraction between Chantalene and Drew. It was tantalizing and fun. Marcia K. Preston's first novel is like experiencing Thanksgiving dinner at Grandma's house. You want to eat your fill, but you don't want to wait too long for another helping either.Once while away from the book, I kept sensing a scene, returning to it in my mind like one does with a song that will not be banished from the brain. Eventually, I realized that it was Tetumka and Chantalene's ranch and Whipporrwill's corral that I was seeing in my mind. That desolate place was with me...and I was longing to be back with the characters and see what might happen next. An excellent first book that leaves the reader begging for a sequel."},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"Chantalene is hip, a protagonist with an attitude. She is tough, funny, sentimental and, bottom-line, isn't going to leave Tetumka Oklahoma until she finds out who murdered her daddy and what happened to her mother. Trouble is, it happened 15 years ago, but that doesn't stop her. She shakes up plenty of trouble in Tetumka when she comes back and starts asking questions. Perhaps She'll Die is a great read--humorous, intriguing, with a little romance, and a surprising ending. Rural Oklahoma comes to life, and Preston's characters have all the bite and edge reminiscent in Flannery O'Connor's short stories...an opinion not tendered lightly. I hated to put Preston's book down, and hated even more when it ended. Hope to see Chantalene again. Hat's off to M.K. Preston."},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"Marcia Prescott's \\"Perhaps She'll Die\\" zips along at just the right pace. Chantalene, the main character, has just the heart, beauty and courage to be featured in a series. This independent young woman puts love of family and righting a wrong ahead of personal safety. The mystery, written in the mold of Mary Higgins Clark and other great storytellers, is a winner. Chantalene's ride into town astride her horse with the wind whipping her cheeks has the atmosphere of frontier justice and modern-day womanhood. Ah, to be young again, riding a horse under the hyacinth-blue skies of Oklahoma. Let's hope Chantalene gallops her readers onto the pages of a new adventure soon."},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"I loved this book and I would recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Perhaps She'll Die: A Chantalene Mystery","review":"In fairness, I was unable to get past page 30 or so, I found it so depressing."},{"Title":"The Lighthouse Handbook on Vision Impairment and Vision Rehabilitation (2-Volume Set + Free CD-ROM with Return of Enclosed Card)","review":"This two-volume set is divided into two areas -- visual disorders and vision rehabilitation.

I love Aurthur Conan Doyle, but this guy is better. Half way through the book I found myself reading slower because I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, Investigator","review":"Martin Hewitt, Investigator is a series of short stories linked by the protagonist, Martin Hewitt, and written down by a good friend, the journalist Brett. The similarities to Doyle's Holmes are striking and most likely intentional. Doyle had killed off Holmes in 1893 and other writers were looking to fill that void.Unlike Holmes, however, Martin Hewitt runs an investigative business, is a very personable gentleman, works well with the police force and easily makes friends. Add to this his ingenious ability for disguise and fluidity in thieves cant and in Mr. Hewitt you have an investigator that is able to blend in anywhere and solve the most intriguing of crimes.In Martin Hewitt, Investigator, Brett gives the details of several of Hewitt's most renowned cases, many of which he was intimately involved with as well. They are tales of impossible to solve crimes that Hewitt was able to crack by piecing together a few clues (a burnt out match, raindrops on a hat, uncapitalized letters in a note) where the police detectives had failed.While the solutions to these various crimes and mysteries do fit together well with the evidence and clues, the reader is not privy to all the information that Hewitt is (as he doesn't share it with Brett). Hewitt then chides Brett (or the police) for not having seen such and such clue and then builds his entire case on that missed bit of information. Morrison uses this ploy to make the solving seem even more spectacular, but this style patronizes the reader and is not a fully satisfying reading experience.----A note on the Kindle edition: There were no errors that I noticed, and the format worked fine on Kindle. Sadly, though, the illustrations aren't available on free editions. There was one story, in particular, that would have benefited by being able to see the floor plan."},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, Investigator","review":"Martin Hewitt is not Sherlock Holmes, but then again, who is? From what I've read, the character of Martin Hewitt was a contemporary to Holmes, and almost seems to me the \\"anti-Holmes\\". However, I did enjoy reading these mysteries very much. I don't think they're any more outdated than the Holmes stories are. But, if you're interested in this book, don't expect it to be like Sherlock Holmes, as Mr. Hewitt is not much like him at all. For example, he's not going to have a client walk into his office and give him his life's history through deduction like Holmes might. The characters don't quite have the personality of the Arthur Conan Doyle characters, and the writing seems simpler, and the mysteries generally simpler. However, I did enjoy reading them very much, and since I think I downloaded this book for free, you can't beat that. I don't think it has an active TOC, but if I remember correctly, very few typos. Anyway, for free you can't complain too much. Mystery lovers, give it a try!"},{"Title":"Martin Hewitt, Investigator","review":"I liked this collection of short stories. Mystery aficionados will most likely find reading these stories a very pleasant diversion. To avoid all of that unnecessary typing, I'll copy from my early review of Chronicles of Martin Hewitt:Arthur Morrison's detective, Marin Hewitt, does seem to have a touch of Sherlock Holmes in him; he is very observant, keeps his solutions to the mystery to himself until he has proved his theory, and solves the mysteries he tackles with a certain flair. On the other hand, Martin Hewitt doesn't have the obsessive idiosyncrasies of Sherlock Holmes; he is not addicted to cocaine, has no obsession with music, and doesn't go into a blue funk when there is no intriguing mystery to challenge his intellect. Quite the contrary, Mr. Hewitt maintains a perfectly respectable business in private investigations, even to the extent of having an office and a clerk. Martin Hewitt seems to be a perfectly normal person with an abnormally keen insight into investigations. Of the two, Holmes would certainly make the far more interesting character study, yet, Hewitt seems somehow to be more real and less of an artifact of the imagination, if it is possible to say such a thing about a fictional character.For free on Kindle, it would be a crime not to nab this collection."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"Moberly's book is one in which every person, both Christian and non-Christian, should read. She purports a view of homosexuality that ties up loose ends which have always been present for homosexuals and heterosexuals. And her tautological argument is one which will only leave you with answers instead of more questions, which so many other theories on homosexuality, both for and against, leave you. If you are willing to read this book with an open mind and without any premeditated repudiations, you will glean much insight and understanding."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This is the book that nearly every 'ex-gay' ministry has incorporated into their worldview. A book that has been the basis for many folk's struggles in 'reparative therapy'.Moberly makes her case based on a review of a number of theories that were commonly held by psycologists in the early 1900's, theories that are generally not held by psycologists today. She has, to my knowledge, only written one other book on gender/sexuality and no longer researches this area. Her recommendations on the route to changing sexual orientation are the most contentious area of the book. These were based on her research of literature rather than mass interviews of those likely to be affected. There is no indication given that the vast majority of those attemting to change orientation (however hard), will fail, as she had not actually see her book's theories tested out in practice when it was first published.The proof is in the fruit.Since her book was published, many ministries with good intentions took her suggestions on board and channeled those of homosexual orientation through the paths outlined. Some ministries (e.g. Courage UK) were honest enough to admit that after years of trying they had not seen any of the orientation change promised, and they dropped the program as it was only creating frustration for those involved. Other psycologists, such as Jeffry Ford, also pointed out the failings in Moberley's theories.I am one of those who spent years closely following the theories espoused by Moberley. In those years my sexuality did not change, neither did it change for any of the hundreds of others I met in such ministries. At most, it resulted in repressed homosexuals, more akin to asexuals.These theories have now been tried and found wanting. The likelihood of change is now widely accepted to be exceedingly small - the reprints of this book should note this fact on the cover so that others are not misled.If this affects you, read wisely and read widely to discover the real truth. This book is not the place to begin."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This slim volume - more of a booklet than a book, really - constitutes little more than a stall upon which Dr. Moberly sets out her opinions.The fact that the opinions are expressed clearly enough should not lead the reader into the mistaken supposition that there is any science behind them. Certainly none is adduced in this small work.It's not clear what Dr Moberly's doctorate is in - she is not, it seems, a Doctor of Medicine, but possibly of Theology.No scientific evidence whatever is presented in this work to suggest that practical application in any way of any of Dr Moberly's ideas has ever at any time resulted in a change in the orientation of any person's sexual desire.The fact that some readers might LIKE some of Dr Moberly's opinions, doesn't make them science."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"The media sugarcoats the tragedy of homosexuality. It argues there's no cure for the dysfunction. This treatise, on the otherhand, vividly describes the cause of homosexuality and thus prescribes the way out. The way is not easy. But the treatise is powerfully optimistic and thus a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This is a great balance to the highly politicized views and opinions that are set forth in popular media. While folks are certainly free to hold the opinion of embracing their same-sex attraction as a genetic part of themselves to be embraced, others are not comfortable with this view for themselves. This book presents a thesis that in many cases same-sex attraction is an attempt to \\"make up for\\" or \\"restore\\" the bond that for whatever reason was not completed with the same-sex parent. It is also a plea to the Christian community to look at homosexually differently - not focusing on the Bible passages that condemn homosexual practices but focusing on the passages that seek to care for the orphans. If one's bond with the same sex parent is still in childhood, condemning that person is silly as is praying for \\"instant healing\\". A path of healing involving prayer over a long period of time along with healthy non-sexual same-sex bonds is suggested."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This book takes the position that homosexuality can be &quot;cured.&quot; It follows radical Christian Right thinking. Moberly's book presents the argument that homosexuals suffer from stunted development ... and the &quot;new Christian ethic&quot; is simply to acknolwedge that. When gays &quot;grow up&quot; they can become heterosexual. She presents no case studies for her theories, no facts -- which leads me to believe she makes up her conclusions. She says that it could take decades for a homosexual to &quot;grow up&quot; into a heterosexual. For balance ... read Mel White's &quot;Stranger At the Gate&quot; or &quot;What the Bible Really Says about Homosexuality.&quot;"},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"The reason why so many right-wing Christians, among others, believe homosexuality is a choice, and thus why it can be &quot;corrected&quot; through religious therapy like this, is because the vast majority of human beings are bisexual to some extent. On this one needs to read the Kinsey Report and other medical reports on sexuality to better comprehend the data. Buyer beware: if you are truly 100% gay, you cannot change your orientation, and this book will only make you more unhappy, not less."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"Moberly espouses studies and treatments that have been totally disavowed by every reputable organization from the American Pychiatric Association on down. She employs the old trick of quoting others out of context in order to support her practices. These &quot;treatments,&quot; to me, are akin to the practice of taking a person who is left-handed and tying that hand down so that the individual may learn to be a &quot;normal&quot; right-handed person."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This book posits the idea that gays are such because they failed to bond with their same sex prior to puberty -- with the load of blame heaped on the same-sex parent. Whether this is the cause of homosexuality is not my concern. This book invalidates homosexuals as if there were something wrong with being gay. Moberley says that later-life bonding with the same sex (platonically) can change one spontaneously into a heterosexual.I find her concepts to be emotionally abusive because she wants to rewrite the personalities of homosexuals, as if they had a mental disorder. Her treatment methods are immoral. If you are a gay who is conflicted, get some professional therapy to help you discover and accept yourself rather than being tortured by religious bigotry like this."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"I am a Christian who has formerly had a homosexual relationship after years of struggling with homosexual desires (as a Christian). The question I wrestled with and every one who has struggled with homosexuality wrestles with is \\"Why do I have these feelings?\\" Elizabeth Moberly's book answers this question. The most healing thing in this book is that she says that the homosexual drive is a legitimate drive and is one that a man or woman does not choose for him or herself, but it is a desire that stems from dysfunction in child-parent relationships. This desire to be properly loved and raised by the same sex parent is absent or lacking; consequently, this legitimate need, if it is not met, becomes sexualized in same sex attractions for some people. I can only speak for myself, but in my case, this is exactly what happened to me. (Again, I was a born-again Christian when I was struggling with homosexuality, and my parents were also evangelical Christians -clergy even). Granted, my general sin nature and exposure to living in a pro-gay culture didn't help either, but it was only when I came to understand the child-parent connection to my homosexual drive and allowed God to meet these legitimate needs for love that I have been freed from these desires. There is freedom. There is healing. Don't believe the lie that there isn't. But it isn't easy. It doesn't happen in one day. It takes time - and failure. It requires great courage and the willingness to trust God to meet your needs. It may be the hardest thing you ever do, for like any sin, if we do not depend on God, we can always fall back into the sin in the same way a former alcoholic can go back to the bottle or someone who has repented of an extra-marital affair can be tempted to engage in another. For those of you who are parents: get this book. I do not condemn my parents; instead, I have learned to forgive them and to understand their own needs and issues. We are all in this together. Finally, I trust that as I pray for a Christian spouse, God will provide. Don't give up on the God who made man and woman to be \\"one\\" Don't give up on what you know to be true. This book will help you on your journey."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This was a book that was out of print for a while so it is nice to hear that now it is available once again. We used this book in my homosexual support group to help us understand more of the roots of what my struggle really was- my cry for the safe emotional connection of the same sex (in my case, my mom) needs that I missed and craved so much especially as I lost my mother in a car accident with a drunk truck driver when I was 5 years old and then later came to have memories of some inappropriate sexual contact stuff that my father had with me- it just tore up my \\"world\\" inside and I went \\"searching\\" for a woman's comfort and love.This book helped me to begin to understand what it was I was really craving and that it was not as much a sexual need as it was an emotional one and that I was meeting what God made as a very legitimate need (the comfort, love, security, and bonding from one's same sex parent) into an illegitimate need (lust and sex with women). Those were very difficult times for me and I am glad and thankful that the Lord gave me HOPE and revelation that proved to be true through books like this. It has been about over 15 years now I began really struggling in my early 20's and I want to ask you to hang in there too. There was hope for me and you know what?- God has hope that can really transform you too- I am so thankful for all that He has done in my life.This book is a good start looking into what your cry for the same gender attraction is really about and you know what?- it isn't really about sexual intercourse and lust and stuff- its about our need for someone who represents my father or my mother who will take care of me in a safe way and love me and comfort me and be there for me and connect with me. With Jesus, there is hope, and you know what?- He DOES make a way and He has never left me to handle it on my own especially as I have cried out to Him for His help- He comes running. Do it and see. Watch what Jesus does. He has a way and when we stay honest with Him (it's taken going through a lot of tears for me though I don't know what He's got for another person, but all that crying when I remembered the things that hurt really helped) and He did provide different people and He continues to provide people and I find that these non-sexual, purer relationships sure have a lot more depth to them than the sexual one that I had or any of the lust-filled flirtatious ones had. I hope this helps someone. I know I sure needed a lot of help, but Jesus is soooooooooo good, my friend. He astounds me. He touches my heart and changes all that anger and all that rage and all that pain and all that coldness that I've had and takes it onto Himself and man, He starts to transform me when I think there's no way out and I don't know of how to get myself out. Jesus replied, \\"What is impossible with man is possible with God.\\" (Luke 18:27) Take care, my fellow traveler and Jesus' very best to you in your journey."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This book is very short, cogent, biblical, and clear. If someone wants to argue against the Bible, then they might not like this book. But for those who want to love homosexuals as themselves and not be prejudiced or mean-spirited, then this is a great book to read. Strikingly, Moberly directs homosexuals NOT to stifle their homosexual urges, and yet not to act them out sexually either. Her thesis is that homosexuality essentially is not a sexual issue, but a relational issue. I agree with her--because I know firsthand that eating disorders are not primarily about food. They're about relationships--just like homosexuality is. While homosexual acts are sinful, just telling someone gay to be celibate is an inadequate and unwise response. Anorexics don't suddently get well when someone proudly tells them to eat more. Likewise, homosexuals don't suddenly \\"turn hetero\\" or develop the ability to be celibate when someone proudly tells them to \\"straighten out.\\" If followers of Christ would heed the wisdom in this book, the Church would probably become a respite for homosexuals and a community in which more people could testify together of the healing grace of God."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"Eliabeth Moberly has revolutionized my understanding of homosexuality. She brings enlightenment to the struggle of the homosexual by suggesting he/she experienced and is still experiencing a deficit of love from the same-sex parent. This is accomplished by offering possibilities of separation, both physical and mental, from the parent. While these separations occur in a child's life both conciously and unconciously, Moberly does not lay blame continuously on the parent. Emphasizing the valid need that the homosexual is experiencing, she seeks to encourage Christians to love and step into non-erotic relationship with the homosexual. It is only through these relationships that valid needs will be met. She warns that fulfillment of legitimate needs takes much time and that one should not expect spontaneous results."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This booklet was stock reading in the late eighties and early nineties. Me and my ex-gay friends lapped it up eagerly as we discovered the reasons for our sinful desires. I began to hate my father for the things he had supposedly done, or not done, to me. I also had a series of extremely harmful close-friendships with male christian friends in an attempt to 'top-up' my masculinity and make me straight. This resulted in a serious break-down which still affects me years later. I first started to 'see the light' when my best friend from university told me that he had had a bad relationship with his father but that hadn't made him gay.This woman needs exposing as a charlatan. She has messed with the heads of many serious christian men and women and seriously screwed us up. As far as I'm aware she only has a doctorate in theology and so her attempts in the psychological world are not informed by any foundations in psychology. Apparently she has gone into cancer research now, presumably expounding the belief that cancer is caused by having a bad relationship with the family pet in childhood and can be healed by buying a dog in adult life!Just take a bit of advice from an old-timer: If you don't want to be gay, just be celibate. Pop-psychology like this will screw your mind up more than you can imagine."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"This book is awesome at explaining the issues behind the symptom of homosexuality. It is small, but chock-a-block full of truths about why people become homosexuals. I couldn't put it down because I kept going &quot;Yeah, that's right! Tell me more!&quot;. Its the first book that I recommend to people who are homosexuals, but who want to change. I'd also recommend it to people who want to help people who want to change as it looks at the underlying issues, not the symptom. Homosexuality is a sin and God hates all sin, but if you're motivated and ask for God's help it is possible to change. I've seen it happen in my own life and its great! Thanks Elizabeth Moberly"},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"Moberly really hits the nail on the head with this book on a Christian view on how those dealing with homosexuality can find healing in Christ. Although the book is written very much like an essay or research article (which it probably was), the truth behind what Moberly is saying is rewarding and incredibly insightful. She offers the view that homosexual leanings are due mostly to a detachment from the same-sex parent earlier in life. This thought, although incredibly eye-opening and true, is presented as the ONLY reason and other views may need to be considered.

I assume she bases her conclusions on her experience with her clients.Even thought the book is challenging, I believe her conclusions are helpful for christians who are trying to better understand homosexuality. As someone who's sister is a homosexual, I had a reason for wanting to understand Dr. Moberly's views. That is why I was committed to reading it twice. As an Orthodox Christian, I am happy that another member of my church, who appears to be able to speak authoritatively on the subject of homosexuality, has published these ideas, and conclusions."},{"Title":"Homosexuality: A New Christian Ethic","review":"Great find.

Yet, they point out, cats are not the \\"independent, solitary\\" beings that many people suggest. A cat's personality is much more developed than that. Most writers have had their own favorite cats and in this anthology are a collection of rich and diverse selections of cat stories and poems from the pens of authors such as Checkov, TS Eliot, Ernest Hemingway, John Updike, The Brothers Grimm, Edgar Allen Poe, and so many others.

As usual with breakthru authors, their efforts get commercially applied and the insightfulness of the original work is closeted, where it can conveniently be academically referred to &quot;what he said was...&quot; (ellipsis filled in by whatever your professor used to characterize the book.) Shannon took an early art form to a rigorous science. This is the book reporting the method of the since-evolved science of data communications, and a good bit more. The fact that I am the first reviewer in this forum speaks eloquently of the paucity of readers and the concomitant large number of data communication experts who have ignored the now larger issues it discloses than the single commercial application of one of its conclusions. Read it. You will agree with me that focusing on the source rather than the sink (terms he coined) is the weakness of communication theory as currently modeled on Shannon's first, obvious conclusion.

In terms of \\"practical implementation\\" of theory, it's fair to say that this seminal work has had a far greater contribution to mankind than Einsteins' paper on general and special relativity (just don't say that to a physicists face).... All to often, famous theorists are relegated to \\"cult-like\\" obscurity. Persons like Shannon, Gallager, Forney, Komolgorov may be legendary within a cult-circle of die-hard communication theorists, but are relegated to unfortunate obscurity by the masses. It's rather unfortunate, with todays advanced communication systems, and techniques of coding (Turbo codes, modified LDPC codes, etc..)which push the boundaries to the ultimate limits as defined by Shannon.... that more people (both engineers, and laymen alike) don't recognize the names of early pioneers who started the revolution, and who's theories are the basis for many of our modern luxuries which allow us to download information at such rapid rates.People often underestimate the deepness of Shannons' work,due to Shannon's writing style. He was one of those rare writers (somewhat like Forney, or Massey) who can actually explain complicated subjects using mere words, without the need for prettying the theory up with fancy math. Comparing the equation filled textbooks of today, versus Shannon's work, one might get the impression that Shannon's work was simplistic. I think it's clear to anyone whos studied his work, that IT WAS NOT SIMPLISTIC. Obviously, there was alot of \\"behind the scenes\\" math which Shannon had to go through to actually codify his many theorems. Just because Shannon did not show extensive derivations for each one of his theorems does not mean that he was not a good mathemetician..It merely means that he did not want to write a 1,000 page paper... he wanted to keep it simple (as was the customary writing style in the early to mid 1900's).In short.. This book should be on YOUR shelf if you dont already own it, and if you are interested in information theory, and the deeper underpinnings of digital communications. I give the book 5 stars, not because it's any kind of elegant literary masterpiece; simply because it is based on the most important paper ever written. ... S.A.

The paper became a book, with a 1949 first edition, which is now a classic, and which has been reprinted a number of times since, ending with the present lovely 1998 edition. It is still the place where readers can learn the essentials, including the two equations of information theory, that are now named after Claude Shannon."},{"Title":"The Mathematical Theory of Communication","review":"This is the seminal work that may be said to include the basic concepts, definitions and theorems of information and communication theory. This book does not need any praise because anybody who had even an introductory education in computer science or electronics of communication will have met the name of Shannon (if you haven't yet, please rush to Google and read his achievements).The beauty of this edition is twofold. It includes two main parts. First part is by Weaver, and you don't need anything more than high school logic and algebra to understand the very clearly explained concepts. The second part by Shannon is 'the real thing' and for the mathematically educated reader, you need a fine grasp of probability theory, calculus, and a little bit of calculus of variations if you want to absorb all of the material.To sum it up, if you want to really understand what entropy means in terms of information theory, then this is THE book for it.

The problem it deals with is a classic one for electronics, telecommunications and computing - noise vs. fidelity of data transmitted. The solution it propounds is simple and yet so revolutionary that it charted the course of these fields since it was published.The basic premise of the book is that 'redundancy' or elimination of noise occurs at infinite time. 'Entropy' or shuffledness allows for some noise and produces more information because it requires reconstruction at the receiving end.The authors support their arguments with simple statistical formulae which explain how entropy and redundancy are inverse of each other.This book has been highly debated by both the people involved in the fields concerned and the people outside the field.Most of the debate surrounds the controversial aspect of Shannon and Weaver's definition of information in engineering terms, which excludes issues like relevance, meaning etc.A great deal of debate also got carried into social sciences and humanities where a new celebration of 'entropy' occured."},{"Title":"The Mathematical Theory of Communication","review":"Typically, a paper which defines a new field of science is not the best introduction to new researchers in the field.

She also weaves in themes from past books in such a way that you know the idea is familiar, like a childhood friend forgotten but suddenly recalled, but you are challenged to see them with a new prospective and find in them new insights. This book, from cover to cover, lifts up the importance of a space that is offered by God (though Ulanov does not seek to define this God but rather leaves that to the reader)in which true creativity and healing can mix and flow into everyday life. This book is powerfully written, with imagery so accessible and common that it moves the soul closer to that which is Divine. This book not only challenges the reader to explore their own understanding of God but to re-frame how they interact with others. I now have 2 copies of this book. One is my personal copy full of notes and reflections stirred up by the nature of the book while the other copy is for sharing.

The story begins when an American civil engineer falls into an underground world. There he discovers a subterranean paradise inhabited by a race called the Vril-ya.These Vril-ya tell the narrator that they are descended from ancestors who escaped the 'upper world' as a result of a deluge which covered the earth. Their evolution has taken a certain course mainly because of the discovery of an energy source, similar to electricity.This energy, from which they also take their name, is called Vril. Lytton's narrative, published in the same year as The Descent of Man, is one of the first truly post-Darwinian novels. It incorporates many of the scientific ideas of the period, and the subsequent fears of degeneration and devolution. The narrator soon discovers that this subterranean paradise is not all that it seems. Lurking in an unlit region of this underground world are a race of primitive savages, who like Wells's Morlocks, represent the flipside of evolution. Without Vril the savages have not progressed, they live in darkness, eat meat and resemble animals. In contrast, the Vril-ya live perfect lives, they are physically beautiful and have developed the abvility to fly with the help of Vril.

As a story it is well developed and is one of Bulwer-Lytton's best works of science fiction. Also from a historical aspect it is an interesting document to see how the Victorian mind saw the world and what was beyond their horizons. This book had an incredible impact upon the reading public upon its release in 1871 and its influence, as well as that of Lytton in general, is felt greatly in later works of early sci-fi. I especially feel the stylistic influence in Upton Sinclair's \\"Millennium\\" and while for a review this is neither here nor there, this is important in understanding the development of the genre.The book opens up with the main character, an American, being invited into a mine exploration by friend. Within just a few pages of the most basic exposition the story begins. For this genre and being that the terranean characters matter little, jumping into the plot like this makes the reading fun. For a 19th century it reads very fast and before long the reader will be well acquainted with the ways of the vril-ya and \\"vril\\" - the power source of the coming race. It really is a fun read.The only problem with this book is that while Lytton goes through an enormity of steps to describe the culture and idiosyncrasies of the vril-ya the book at times reads more like notes of an anthropologist than a literary novel. Of course this may be the intention and since it is such a quick and enjoyable read, we can forgive the author of this. If you are fan of Lord Lytton or a fan of early Sci-Fi this is a definite read. I also would recommend this book to anyone who like 19th century novels and think this should be included in more high school English literature classes because it does not fit the stereotype and would be a welcome break for many students. While we know quite well that this work is purely fantastical it is really enjoyable to see how the mind of the 19th century saw the possibility of worlds going on underground and it is fun to imagine and believe...-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Written in 1871 The Coming Race was the last novel ever written by Lytton, he died two years later.

Worth a read, especially if you are interested in the development of science fiction."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"In this 1871 work, Lytton presents the reader with an early science fiction tale about an American adventurer whom we come to know only as \\"Tish\\". The author wrote the story near the end of his own life in 1873; however, he exposes his protagonist to vignettes of technology and ethical concepts which would not actualize until the 20th Century!At the outset of the story Tish accompanies an associate deep into the bowels of a mine, presumably somewhere in Europe. It is therein that the two enter a subterranean world. The associate is killed almost immediately by a \\"krek,\\" a creature with, \\"...a vast and terrible head with open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes -- the head of the monstrous reptile resembling that of a crocodile or alligator, but infinitely larger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever beheld in my travels.\\"From this point to almost the end of the work Tish is exposed to, and made the dubious guest of, a highly advanced culture in terms of technology: the Vril-ya. They represent the futuristic, powerful faction of the larger underworld race which is referred to as the \\"Ana\\". The non-Vril-ya were regarded as barbarians by the Vril-ya and were kept on the fringes of the technologically superior Vril-ya regions, (a situation which I regard as symbolism of the Jewish People of Europe during this era).The author presents the Vril-ya as having aspired to social and civil preeminence; however, the excellence of their political systems and their philosophies, while devoid of conflagration and dispute, were shrewdly left for the reader to appraise.Vril-ya society, in a nutshell, was static. They had no desire for wealth since each person could have anything s/he wanted by way of \\"Vril\\". Their diet was pseudo-vegetarian, milk being their singular non-vegetarian indulgence. A lazy society by nature, they considered Democracy to be primitive and thus perceived to be found only in barbarous cultures. Their own form of government was classified as \\"benevolent autocracy,\\" except that the benevolence extended neither to the non-Vril-ya subterranean who shared their geography nor to any other. The most significant cultural divergence from surface dwelling humans hinged upon the fact that Vril-ya women were not only larger than males, they were also the assertive and dominant gender in their society.Lytton was quite clever in his approach to analogizing Vril-ya Society to contemporaneous European events and attitudes. The technique is reminiscent of a later work by a fellow Englishman, J.R.R. Tolkien, author of \\"the Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It's also clear that Lytton was brilliantly intuitive in regard to his vision of futuristic technology.The work is quite provocative in this regard: Lytton leaves the fate of mankind as an open issue with his Hitchcockian conclusion. Hence, do the Vril-ya exemplify God's [first] \\"unsuccessful experiment\\" in creating mankind? We He nullify the power of Vril in the event that the Vril-ya and the surface dwellers come into conflict? Or do the Vril-ya represent God's success story... and will humankind thus be purged from the Earth's surface as part of a \\"Master plan\\"? The latter appears to be the author's rendition and interpretation of \\"The Revelation to John\\" (in \\"The Holy Bible\\").This is a superb yarn and seizes upon much of the \\"Hollow Earth\\" to-do of the period. This terrific book is timeless literature, expressed in the sci-fi genre and is just as compelling today as the day it was originally published. My highest recommendation even for non-science fiction enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"The Coming Race is a fine sci-fi novel, of the 1800's variety. For the most part it is quite enjoyable, and Bulwer-Lytton's vision of the Vrilya is quite comprehensive. Still, though, overall the book felt a little too short, and a little too amateurish, when compared against H.G. Wells, or more modernish sci-fi authors. Still, a recommended read by all means!Regarding the Broadview Press edition, I always get one of these books if I'm reading classic fiction because I love all the extras they have, like essays or other short related stories by the same author or script and newspaper excerpts, however I was sorely disappointed to find none of the above in this book, beyond an introduction that didn't tell me much that Wikipedia hadn't already."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Written by Bulwer-Lytton of Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Competition fame, this isn't the greatest novel I've ever read.

Whatever that is. He goes through the usual discussions of how their language works, funerals, foods and all that that you might expect in this sort of work, but thankfully in less detail than usual (the whole novel is only around 100 pages).

Tolerable, but if that really bugs you, get a different edition."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Reviewed by Leslie Granier for Reader Views (5/07)\\"The Coming Race\\" is a book that will best appeal to individuals who enjoy studying different civilizations and learning about how their citizens come to behave and believe the way they do. It incorporates aspects of both science fiction and fantasy. This book follows the accounts of a man who has fallen into an underground world that is so different from the world he knows. The author utilizes a very descriptive style to portray the intuitive thoughts of this narrator as he recalls this experience.The residents of this underground society are known as the Vril-ya. They lead simple and peaceful lives in which there is no war and no crime. In fact, if someone is unhappy in their society, his only recourse is to emigrate to a different tribe. In their world, no individual is considered superior to another individual (including the leaders) in order to ascertain there will be no jealousy among the people. Another major difference is that children are the workers and are entrusted with the toughest jobs such as killing any dangerous creatures that are encountered. In the beginning, the narrator seems impressed with this seemingly perfect civilization. However, he comes to question whether it is a good thing to have such a controlled and stagnant society and worries that this type of advanced civilization may eventually take over the world.This book started off great and I expected it would be action-packed and full of adventure. However, I was somewhat disappointed that it turned out to be mainly a narrative. I would have preferred more dialogue between the characters. The chapter about the development of their language (Chapter XII) was particularly grueling and contributed to the slow pace. I did enjoy the author's use of lesser known vocabulary words. It is good to know that my high school years were well spent.Although this book was first published in 1871, there is much that can be learned from it. \\"The Coming Race\\" makes some important points about what constitutes a productive and successful society. Having no war and no crime sounds great, as does complete equality among individuals. However, once this type of \\"perfection\\" is achieved, life will become extremely dull as there can be no debates or exchanges of ideas to keep things interesting. The world needs conflict and change so there can be progress and growth.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"With my review I will touch on some points that may entice curious readers to spend the few hours it takes to read this fascinating book. As you will see, I found that reading about this book was even more interesting than the novel itself.Bulwer-Lytton's biography and list of accomplishments may surprise someone who knew nothing of him previously. As a musician, I was interested to learn that it was his novel, \\"Rienzi, the last of the Roman tribunes\\" (1835) that inpired one of Richard Wagner's early operas. His novel, \\"Paul Clifford\\" (1830), spawned the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, thanks to its opening sentence, which reads in part, \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\". What is less known but more important is the incredible influence of \\"The Coming Race\\" on subsequent generations.I was drawn to this book indirectly by learning a bit about the origins of Theosophy and the influence of the Theosophical movement on various aspects of Nazism and on David Icke. (The Christian researcher Chris White has shown the strong influence of Theosophy on David Icke.) But whence came Madame Blavatsky's inspiration? Believe it or not, much of her work is plagiarized from a single work by the novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton, \\"The Coming Race\\".It was the very unusual character called Joseph George Caldwell who actually led me to read this book. He has done a great service in assembling passages from four different books in a 47-page document (easily found on the Internet) which includes only a brief introduction by Caldwell himself. Caldwell's essay, \\"On Edward Bulwer-Lytton: Agharta, Shambhala, Vril and the Occult Roots of Nazi Power\\", includes passages from books by Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non, Victoria LePage, Joscelyn Godwin, and the recently deceased Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. The cited books are all available on Amazon. The various passages document the unquestionable influence of \\"The Coming Race\\" on various writers and certain political operators who followed Bulwer-Lytton.\\"The Coming Race\\" is replete with ideas that were current when the book was written, including Darwinism, especially Social Darwinism, and eugenics. Some of the science fiction aspects look several decades into the future with with the devices and contraptions depicted. The underground Vril-ya race is made to seem futuristic, yet timeless, with the archaic form of speech that Bulwer-Lytton assigns them. I would venture that it is probably more interesting to read this book in light of the enormous influence it has had rather than for its literary qualities.The novel closes with a warning from the first person narrator about The Coming Race. Little did Bulwer-Lytton know that the warning should have been about the novel itself."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Interesting text, and I guess where people can draw some of the Nazi images from, but don't read this expecting Hitler's master plan to come jumping off the page at you.

Not so much science fiction as much as it is a look into a utopian society that commands a power we can only imagine. He talks more of culture than technology and science. The plot is non-existent but that's what I was looking for! In reading something old, you will find something new, as reading something new you will find something old."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"Bulwer-Lytton's novella is like fine wine: drink slowly and savor each taste. His prose is both archaic and beautiful, not unlike Shakespere, a comparison I am happy to make. Complex and meandering sentences, sometimes a full paragraph long, add a note of authority and beauty to this fine story.Although its place is an abode within the \\"hollow earth,\\" its story is timeless and deals, in a very personal way, with the eternal debate about whether a mysterious utopia or the vagaries of life here on the surface, with all its problems and uncertainties, is preferable. Lest I reveal our hero's choice I will say no more.A wonderful read, certain to remain within the annuals of cult classics!"},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"I'm something of a Bulwer Lytton fan, so I looked forward to this, one of his rare works in the field of speculative fiction. Oddly, though, here Bulwer tends to disregard even the science of the early 1870s in which it was written. It's the tale of a Gilded Age American mining engineer's encounter with the super-developed subterranean culture of the Vril Ya. Despite its imagined aircraft and robotic automatons, the book is really a fantasy. It's based on the idea of a race of humans with innate supernatural powers who have created a fossilized and somewhat Buddhist-style peaceful society, but who also feel morally obliged to destroy \\"inferior\\" cultures such as ours. I think the author intended a parallel with the European colonialism of his time. There is also an interesting cultural reversal of the roles of men and women, which includes some of Bulwer's liveliest writing. But on the whole, the book is more of a prolonged philosophical anecdote than an entertainment."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"A man named Bulwer Lytton had written a book called The Coming Race in 1871 which describes a race of men psychically far in advance of our own said to live in caves in the center of the Earth, soon to emerge to reign over the rest of us. The Vril Society established itself as a reaction to this book.The Vril Society (or the Luminous Lodge) combined the ideals of the Illuminati with Hindu Mysticism, Theosophy and the Quabbala. It was the first German nationalist group to use the swastika as an emblem linking Eastern and Western occultism. The Vril Society presented an idea of a subterranean matriarchal socialist utopia ruled by superior beings that had mastered the mysterious energy called the Vril Force.The Vril Society formed shortly before the Nazis came to power. They believed they had secret knowledge that would enable them to change their race and become the equals of men hidden in the bowels of the Earth through methods of concentration based in Ignatius Loyala's Spiritual Exercises."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"This book perhaps was inspired by Lytton's s&eacute;ances with Daniel Dunglas Home. A character Zee is mentioned. \\"Z\\" was reportedly a spirit who influenced Lytton to write Zanoni. It is a very short book. It took me about an hour to read. I can see how it might have been interesting 140 years ago, but I think it can only be recommended to hardcore fans of early fantasy/science fiction. Lytton has a sprawling style of writing with paragraphs that sometimes drag on for a whole page. The one thing that I found slightly interesting was that with the concept of the \\"vril bath\\" he appeared to anticipate Wilhelm Reich's orgone box."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"This is a dreadful novel, whose only claim to fame is that it inspired a large bunch of nutters to create the Second World War. It's content though entirely fictional prompted the creation of the Theosiphists, the Vril Society, the Thule Society and ultimately formed the philosophy of the NAZI Party. As entertainmant, its a total loss,a poor version of A Journey To the Center of the Earth. Even Tarzan at tne Earth's Core is a more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The coming race","review":"I bought this book hoping it would explain the inspiration for the Vril Society. Why would anyone be moved by this book to form a society following the idea of Vril?? Not only is it boring, but it is written like a children's book. Everything is explained like this...the grass was green and everywhere there was light...blah blah.... horrible imagery! I'm being biased only b/c I've read so many things about how the Vril Society influenced Nazism...and now I can't imagine why. This book sucks."},{"Title":"Overheard in a Garden","review":"Written in 1900, contains light and sometimes humorous verse and short pieces, with illustrations by author.

After practicing with Level 1A books at school, he was so proud to be able to pick up this book and read it from start to finish. He got a big kick out of the surprise ending and has read it over and over to anyone who will listen--in person and on the phone. The sentence construction is very simple (&quot;The fox sat on a box.&quot;) but it's a sweet, funny story that is enhanced by beautiful watercolor illustrations. Even our 15 month old daughter now loves to sit in his lap to have him read it to her. Although he'll outgrow it soon, his reading confidence has been helped a great deal by having books of his own that he can read. We're adding more of Barbara Gregorich's books to his library for just that reason. It's an easy investment to help him develop a lifelong love of reading."},{"Title":"The Fox on the Box (A School Zone Start to Read Book, Ages 4-7, Level 1)","review":"This is a wonderful first reading book.The book is structured so that there is a page with words and then a page with an illustration only.

Reading a book like this made his first reading experience enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Fox on the Box (A School Zone Start to Read Book, Ages 4-7, Level 1)","review":"I thought this book would be great but I was wrong. It has about six sentences in the whole book. Almost all of them are: The fox ____ on the box. The filler words are jumped, played, sat, ate, etc. The word \\"ate\\" is a sight word so they don't even sound it out. A reader that can read words with ed at the end are too far along to be reading a book with all the other words being the same on every page. A beginning reader will not know the ed ending and if you tell them then they know the whole book since it's almost the same on every page. This book is lame.

A must read for anyone interested in this period and these events."},{"Title":"Scientist and Catholic: Pierre Duhem","review":"Brisk, fascinating biography of an important, though largely forgotten, French Catholic. Pierre Duhem was a scientist who devoted much of the second half of his life to extensive research in the primary medieval sources which document the fruition of modern Western science. On the basis of this research Duhem established the importance of specifically Christian belief in laying the foundation for Western science (contrary to the myth of opposition between Christianity and science). Author Jaki is a good writer who brings the man to life through many fascinating anecdotes. Duhem was a devout Catholic, and Jaki, who is a Catholic priest and scientist, particularly focuses on Duhem's spiritual life. This is an excellent and enjoyable book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Scientist and Catholic: Pierre Duhem","review":"Pierre Duhem was a French Physicist in the late 1800's and early 1900's. A Catholic, he was banished from the French mainstream (to their harm) but well known in his field. Duhem was interested in the history of science and reviewed manuscripts from antiquity. He found where Buridan disagreed with Aristotle on the question of whether the earth had a beginning or not. Seems simple but questions like this have consequences to the way in which people can think about things. Aristotle put science in fetters, not on purpose, but by the magnitude of his achievements. The quoting of Aristotle as an authority sealed arguments, deflected real science, deformed it. Aristotle was correct on so many things including that small mistakes in the beginning lead to large ones later on. Duhem had many observations,mostly unknown to history,but which are now available for perusal-likely with profit. Those with genius often throw out sparks which others pick up and fan into flames. Most anyone who has a mind finds it most tiresome to unlearn things that he picked up as easily as our computers pick up virus but Duhem and Jaki are programs to aid in the unlearning. Those with an orientation towards the Christian view of the world will find that Duhem didn't cheat by using revelation. Like Aquinas, he took what he could find and made it useful. I can't yet tell you about his physics until I go thru his translated, 1991, works, but we should rue the fact that we were denied his expertise all these years in America just as we should shout down the parasites that deny us the last work of Gulag's author(and,for much the same reasons are these censoships imposed)."},{"Title":"Scientist and Catholic: Pierre Duhem","review":"This is a rambling, unfocused biography, full of tantalizing but obscure references to people and publications few will have heard of.

My first-grader loved the pictures, especially the one of the cellar &quot;eating&quot; Babe the pig.

The fear and guilt were HUGE as I began reading (they still are) but Zimmer's and Sacker's work as an M.D. specializing in Eating Disorders has provided much-needed insight into sufferers' motivations and pain. My daughter, age 14, marked all the pages that &quot;spoke&quot; to her...she marked MANY pages. Authors Zimmer and Sacker attempt, and for the most part succeed, in explaining all variations of EDs. Esp poignant for me were the comments from a mother, and her powerlessness to stop her daughter from destroying herself through starvation. I bought several copies to distribute to family members so that they can support my daughter in recovery. Very useful is a section for educators on how they can assist a student who has an ED."},{"Title":"Dying to Be Thin: Understanding and Defeating Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia--A Practical, Lifesaving Guide","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially those who suffer from anorexia or bullemia.

A big thank you and hugs to the authors."},{"Title":"Dying to Be Thin: Understanding and Defeating Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia--A Practical, Lifesaving Guide","review":"With society placing the stress it does on females being physically thin, I think the numbers this book quotes for the totals of US women with serious eating disorders is, if anything, on the low side. I along with virtually every woman I know has at one time or another had what amounts to an eating disorder and in a few cases, had them to a serious extent. With body image being as important as it is, particularly with teenage girls, I'm pessimistic that this book or anything else can do more than try to spur the one suffering from this insidious disease to WANT to do something about her affliction. I read this book because I was curious to see if things have gotten any better in the last decade as far as treatment of eating disorders goes, and also in the level of collective recognition among young women that a disorder is there in their own lives. From what I read here, I'd say the answer to both is no. On the positive side, this book did one of the better examples of addressing this life-threatening situation and if it can be gotten to the right hands, it could truthfully save some lives that might be in danger right at this very moment."},{"Title":"Dying to Be Thin: Understanding and Defeating Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia--A Practical, Lifesaving Guide","review":"This is a great book and very informative.

While the steps are very easy to follow, at the most crucial parts (which would be the complicated parts), the author fails to describe exactly what to do and just assumes that the reader would know how to do it.Also, i found problems and inconsistencies with the directions for the most basic bases like the frog base, where the explanation was severely lacking making it seems almost inaccurate. I had to check other origami books as well as look for directions online for the missing steps... and there was at least 2-3 steps that was not explained in the book, which other books and online sites had. In short, the directions in the book aren't suitable for beginers at all. You definitely MUST have some prior exposure and experience with origami to actually be able to fully follow through with the directions to complete the project.However this book is throughly enjoyable and very informative on cultural notes of the origins of various origami projects.

It is a great book for someone just starting out because it gives one a thorough look at the basics of origami, but it was NOT what I was looking for at all.

A group of procedures is also explained, so that later explanations just refer to these, without explaining everything again.

It is the first published account of a female British ex-slave. Mary Prince, a slave in the West Indies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tells the story of her life in an effort to awaken sympathy for the abolitionist movement in England.Mary particularly emphasizes instances of the arbitrary punishments meted out by her various masters. She repeatedly questions how the British, a civilized nation, could permit its colonists to treat its colonial work force like brute beasts. Mary elicits our attention and respect in the ways she manages to resist the brutality of her masters, both physically and vocally. She often shows herself speaking out against cruelty regardless of social taboos, accepted colonial norms of unquestioning obedience, and the image of the &quot;benevolent&quot; slave owner.Mary's narrative is also remarkable for her characterization as the &quot;self-made heroine.&quot; Mary tells us extensively about her attempts to save enough money to purchase her freedom, and to engage, convert, and marry the man of her choice. As the editor of this edition points out, as Mary begins to learn the value of her labor, she more easily manipulates her owners into realizing their own powerlessness over her. A sort of Wollstonecraftian feminist hero, Mary Prince bases her self-definition on her ability to be financially, as well as physically independent, and to improve herself through education and religion.One limitation of &quot;The History of Mary Prince&quot; is the fact that it was only dictated by Prince. It was transcribed and published by British abolitionists, who may have suggested the emphasis on brutality and deemphasis on specifically sexual violence. It is impossible to know the extent of the editing process, which was out of Prince's hands. Nonetheless, this edition, edited by Moira Ferguson, contains many relevant historical documents which provide a rich context for Prince's narrative."},{"Title":"The History of Mary Prince (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Born in Bermuda in the late 18th century, Mary Prince was a Black woman who survived enslavement in the colonial world of the Caribbean. She orally told her story to a third party, who transcribed it. First published in England in 1831, &quot;The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave&quot; is one of the most important narratives of the slave experience in the Americas.This book describes in detail the reality of the slave experience: the dehumanization of Black people, the moral degradation of their masters, and the ever-present violence. Prince's story is also an important early defense of the humanity of people of African descent. She notes that slave masters &quot;think that black people are like cattle, without natural affection. But my heart tells me it is far otherwise.&quot;Prince tells of her labor in the salt ponds of Turk's Island, her conflict with a hired mulatto woman, her spiritual life in the Moravian Church, and many other topics. Ultimately, she celebrates the desire and hope for freedom: &quot;All slaves want to be free.&quot;&quot;The History of Mary Prince&quot; does not quite attain the level of literary craftsmanship and psychological complexity as do some other classic slave narratives (I am thinking in particular of those of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs). But it is still a powerful, authoritative, and important human testament. Mary Prince declares, &quot;I have been a slave--I have felt what a slave feels, and I know what a slave knows.&quot; We of later centuries need to hear her words."},{"Title":"The History of Mary Prince (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"this is a good read but one must keep in mind the agenda of anti-slavery zealots.the new intro is informative and even admits the main problem with mary prince's narrative.namely, that her account may have been embellished by anti-slavery society activists in england.this is another narrative, like the early narrative of venture smith that was \\"related by\\" the enslaved person.those types of narratives are always suspect of having been embellished. even so, it is an importantpart of the historical record - especially regarding enslaved women in british held islands in the caribbean.i will use in university level african diaspora history courses that i teach. i am interested in how studentswould compare prince's narrative with linda brent's (harriet jacobs) \\"incidents in the life of a slave girl\\"."},{"Title":"The History of Mary Prince (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was a required book for an undergrad class.

It is obvious that he has vast affection and tolerance for the glories and foibles of his fellow men.Each character described in these dramatic events is accorded understanding and respect.Marker is tough-minded enough to see the flaws and weak points of the people he is called upon to deal with, but also generous enough to play to their strengths.There are none of the shrill denunciations of incompetence, greed and opportunism that one comes across so often in diplomatic or political memoirs.He spends no time on indulging in moral indignation about what others should or should not have done, preferring instead to quietly do his duty by all the conflicting parties, and encouraging them to try and do the same.He is refreshingly modest about his own achievements, but not so reticent about others'.Indeed, his world seems to be peopled by \`brilliant', flamboyant', \`solid', \`decent', \`dedicated, \`intelligent', \`hard-working', \`decisive', \`highly skilled' individuals, who between them seem to have managed to iron out most of their differences with just an occasional nudge from the Personal Representative of the Secretary General for East Timor.He shows that patience, pragmatism and prudence make excellent companions to passion and courage. Without ever wavering from his vision, he was able to persuade disparate personalities with diametrically opposing points of view to sit down and talk to each other seriously. No mean accomplishment.Marker gives us a straightforward chronological account of the whole process; an unflinchingly lucid and honest report of a series of delicate negotiations, rendered even more colourful by descriptions of backstage politicking, diplomatic reflexology (applying pressure where needed) and liberal applications of good, old-fashioned charm.Reading his natural, unpretentious prose somehow enhances the tragic effects of the turbulent events unfolding, and heightens our disgust for the total waste and futility of violence."},{"Title":"The ZOO WHERE YOU'RE FED TO GOD: A NOVEL","review":"We need a story about our fucked-up western lives. We need to find a way through them, to begin an initiation into a reality that makes sense to our souls. Michael Ventura's &quot;The Zoo Where You're Fed to God&quot; is about finding a way -- here, today, in America -- toward our souls. Michael Ventura writes prose like images write dreams. Dream Images are not afraid to be dark and neither is this story. It takes us into the dark places we avoid in our culture -- at a high price -- and yet these are the places that we long for -- we dream about -- we cannot live without -- and when we are in them we are closer to life. The story is not about details -- don't get stuck in the surface of the story -- but uses its efficient detail to mark the doorways to the American myths of these times. We see young love on our TVs and in our movies and in our stories and we let it stay young without allowing it -- and ourselves -- to mature and express the soul as love-making does in other cultures (at least in old -- very old -- ones). The images of the act of sex in our culture reflect the shallowness of our culture that cannot get beyond the adolescent ideas about the body. This story gives us an example of a soul-full love and it does it through a strong presentation that leaves behind the stereotypes and shallowness that come with reading a story only on the surface. 'Sexual stereotypes' is only one of our dark myths Michael Ventura explores. He also takes us through 'the family' and 'the nature of the city' and 'relationships.' The nice thing about reading this story is falling into these dark myths and seeing the light as the crazy part and then coming out wonderfully light."},{"Title":"The ZOO WHERE YOU'RE FED TO GOD: A NOVEL","review":"ventura has opened my chest and massaged my heart while also opening my skull and exciting my mind..this ranks as one of the best books ive read in the past decade..on my second journey through it now..may not be for everyone but its not only for middleaged complex men who think,wonder,question,ache and search..i love this book..try it...the viewpoint is original,interesting,helpful,truthful,beautiful"},{"Title":"The ZOO WHERE YOU'RE FED TO GOD: A NOVEL","review":"This man is absolutly brilliant and his brain is an enigma to most all of our modern mindsets.

The book is filled with AA clich&eacute;s and doctrines, higher powers and rescuing deities. As so common in these groups, he sounds as if he just hates clients who exhibit these \\"faults.\\" For instance, a depressed person describing his/her pain is likely to be called a whiner. His doctrines certainly have no place in counseling, medicine, or psychology.However, if you are in a 12-step group you might like this because the abusive attitude and language will feel very warm & familiar to you. Also, for those of you who wish to know the kind of advice you or your loved ones will actually get in 12-step groups, this book will be extremely useful.An artist might also enjoy using it.

The Ten Most Common Character Flaws and What You Can Do about Them","review":"After reading the first two chapters of Tartaglia's book, I thought the information was given in somewhat of a shotgun approach: a little bit of everything was coming at me. It seemed that the information was good, but I didn't think the organization (or perhaps the flow) of the material was helpful. Either Tartaglia changed or I got a better handle on his style. Starting with the third chapter, my interest increased all the way until the final chapter.Tartaglia has submitted ten character flaws for discussion. There's a little something for everyone. The chapter titles are: 1 - Addicted to Being Right, 2 - Raging Indignation, 3 - Fixing Blame and Nurturing Resentments, 4 - The Dread Seekers - Worry and Fear, 5 - Intolerance, 6 - The Poor Me or Martyr Syndrome, 7 - Self-Regard Run Riot, 8 - The Excuse for Everything-Inadequacy, 9 - Hypercritical Fault Finders, 10 - Chronic Dishonesty - The TrapAt the very least, I can assure you that if you read the book honestly, you will learn some things about yourself that you won't like. But Tartaglia gives some good advice on what you can do about these character flaws. He often relates the remedies to Biblical principles, which I appreciated, although I'm not sure that I agree with some of his interpretations. If you are honest with yourself, you'll learn something about yourself and your worldview after reading Flawless."},{"Title":"Flawless! The Ten Most Common Character Flaws and What You Can Do about Them","review":"We all have character flaws, it is an unavoidable fact. We all have idiosyncracies that hinder us at times, and sometimes downright debilitate us! Not only do these flaws make our own lives disappointing, but they make those around us wish that we were not around them! Dr. Tartaglia shows us that these flaws tend to travel in clusters. They spin out of control and perpetuate themselves... &quot;You only need to get one flaw going and the others automatically join. When they are all working in combination you are out of control. When they are out of YOUR control, your life becomes unmanageable.&quot;The &quot;flaws&quot; he examines in this book are very... commonplace. If you honestly ask yourself the 19 questions he places at the beginning of each chapter (why 19? I don't know), you will SURELY find yourself saying &quot;Wow, hey, I do that all the time!&quot; Or, conversely, you will say, &quot;No, I have a lot of problems, but this is not one of them.&quot; Make a list. Take notes. It's terribly interesting what you find out about yourself as you read this book. And it's so educationally beneficial and satisfying to place other people in those places that don't apply to you. &quot;Oh, I know someone that is SO EXACTLY LIKE THAT!&quot; etc. etc. You can photocopy those chapters and send anonymous letters!The chapters conclude with good practical pointers on how to overcome flawed behaviour patterns. The author is witty and has definitely been around the block a few times in his observations about human behaviour.

Very insightful and best gift to have!!!"},{"Title":"Icon: Art of the Wine Label","review":"ICON - the embodiment of spirit, matter, and time. In Einsteinian terms, ICON would be the equation that sums time, space, matter, and ideology.ICON is a tour de force, a signature piece representing the extensive body of work by two of the wine industries brightest stars, Jeffrey Caldeway and Chuck House, package designers.One once told me that the contents of a barrel, brown bag for a label, sans introduction, sipped from a coffee cup in your kitchen, will defy distinction by most and keep both the wine and the consumer most honest.But we of sophistication desire more than honesty, and more is ours in ICON. To the vast universe of wine, the package brings order to chaos, diminishes chance, dispels mystery, stamps a caste, creates distinction, and strokes your ego and those of others. We assume the package as an intimate expression of Self, much in the same way one would don a designer creation. Albeit, a label does nothing to alter the wine.In this treatise of wine package history, we are reminded that necessity is the mother of invention. Order to chaos produced the first labels. Labels of origin, distinction, and personality followed. It wasn't until recent times that ego drove the package, and Ego is the stuff of ICON.This book reveals both Jeff and Chuck as modern day alchemists, intently stirring their witches brew of ego, dream, soil, anxiety, money, sweat, clone, ambition, microclimate, and desire, distilled into an amalgam of glass, cork, paper, and ink which will transform total of Past into the largesse of Future . . . a responsibility from which all but the most tempered would shrink.And whom amongst us do we charge with this lofty responsibility? It must be entrusted to those select few who have the creative talent, skills, will, and ability to lift mere grape juice to the pedestal upon which it currently resides. Package designers must do for others what they are incapable of doing themselves.Jeff Caldeway and Chuck House are gifted Iconoclasts, challenged with creating an artistic expression which will herald not only the product but, moreover, the totality of the person, the sole of the winemaker, the beast that lies within. We find the authors delving into a very intimate and complex process of discovery. Needs. Wants. Values. History. Family. Dreams. Hopes. Fears. Stuff. From all this they must derived a package that projects not only the person and the product, but also an expression that potentially becomes a fulcrum on which success and failure balance.Drawing from ancient beginnings, Jeff Caldeway and Chuck House have successfully bred charm and aristocracy into the great wines and spirits of present day, inscribing pedigree after pedigree that will endure. Page after page brings to mind another example of success that can be directly attributable to the profound influence their package had on the wine selection process.The depth and breadth of their body of work clearly place Jeff and Chuck at the forefront of the wine package business for more than three decades, leaving a legacy most others could only hope to achieve. ICON secures their place amongst the elite who's creativity exceeded all those before them, who's work will not soon be eclipsed.Art, beauty, and finesse abound. ICON elicits something that is deeply satisfying, much like a well-turned ankle or great music. Printing, inks, paper, photography, binding are all first cabin. ICON is a calling card, a testament, and an example of excellence that the authors expect from themselves and deliver to others.We are blessed to have such a fine compendium to grace our lives, the likes not often achieved. It is a gift, a reference, a history, a conversation maker, and a commanding centerpiece for any lover of wine and art. I would recommend you add ICON to your collection and see how long it stays on your coffee table! I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

This perplexing book is beautifully produced and generously proportioned. The publisher has given his all (not without hope, however, of getting it back--note the price). It's most impressive. So why is it also rather disappointing?Frankly, it's because we are led to expect too much. Title and subtitle suggest a richly informed and wide-ranging survey of label art from many sources over many decades. In fact the coverage spans just a few years, a few places (nearly 85 percent of the designs are from California) and two designers (Jeffrey Caldewey and Chuck House, who are pre-eminent in their field). And the subject isn't art but label and package design: in short, sales tools. Even the title is a pretentious flim-flam. 'Icon' means either 'sacred image,' which is hardly justified here, or those vulgar little cartoons that offend the eye on computer screens the world around. Surely they didn't mean &lt;that>?Then revelation comes: Icon is the name of the design firm headed by Caldewey and House. It is hard to escape the conclusion that this is a glorified promotional brochure.Within those rather severe limitations this is a pretty attractive coffee-table production. Each of the more than 100 wines shown has its own page and is shown in full--the whole 'package,' not just the label. Some are delightful, charming, friendly and fun, notably those of Bonny Doon (whose owner is the famously humorous Randall Grahm), Frog's Leap, Gundlach Bundschu, Honig, Whitehall Lane and (too few) others. Elsewhere, elegance is to be found, as is cutting-edge stylishness--and, unfortunately, other labels that seem prim and merely dignified, as if standing on ceremony.Each package portrait faces a page with a blessedly brief paragraph of odd facts, high-flown hooey and grammatical lapses (one wonders about the editing here; the first error, although admittedly minor, occurs in the very first line of the introduction). By hooey I mean insider designer prattle like 'the five-sided label . . . represents the five grape varietals used in the blend.' To me, symbolism fails when the designer has to explain it. Especially because this selfsame label clearly lists not five but &lt;four>. Or 'A separate aureate banner proclaims the wine's reserve pedigree.' 'Aureate'? Oh, you mean gold-colored or gold-tone? 'Banner'? Oh, that's the tacky little strip made to resemble, complete with nail holes, the brass title tags found on ancient picture frames. Frankly, a designer still using such old-hat stuff in 2000 has more reason to blush than to boast.One important point that does come through is that good design isn't simply \\"dreamt up\\" but discovered and developed from facts and artifacts specific to each project. A good example is the elegant Lewelling label, inspired by the 19th Century calling card of the winery's founder. Another is Whitehall Lane's, based gloriously on the melted-crayon artwork of the winery owner's three-year-old daughter.Wine geeks will love this book and so will designers. Ordinary wine-drinkers will enjoy a quick riffle or two but then are likely to leave it on the coffee table and forget about it.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer on wines, spirits and travel."},{"Title":"Icon: Art of the Wine Label","review":"This is a great book for any wine enthusiast.

It opens your eyes to a world behind wine and design. Using our senses is not something we have to limit to taste, smell and sight of the wine. The bottle, the label and the story behind the winemaking process can be just as interesting. After reading Mr. Marsano's review you are under the impression Icon lacks depth and a true reason for its existence. However, he forgot this is a coffee table book and therefore it is aimed to be fun, require short attention span, entertain, decorate and certainly not demand from you a critic eye to spot the fault on terms like \\"banner\\". Icon certainly accomplishes its mission. It is full of interesting details, beautiful photographs, facts and stories completing the magical experience of wine. Sorry Mr. Marsano, your criticism migh be professional, your eyes failed to spot the real meaning of this book.I am almost certain this is the kind of book that should be kept as an icon(again) of our times. The name is perfect. The book has been carefully crafted, holding a luxury quality that certainly will keep it alive throughout time.

It even covers many of the experimental prototypes from R&D, as well as .22 cal rifles and pistols used to train service members and some foreign weapons used by US forces. The best feature, to me, however, is the plethora of photos showing the weapons in actual use in the field. There are also many era photos taken by several of the author's relatives who served in the war.

Nation readers will remember Donner's great books on U.S. political repression, The Age of Surveillance and Protectors of Privilege. On this occasion, however, our conversation turned to Frank's work as an attorney thirty years before, when he had defended dozens of people in McCarthy-era subversion cases. Donner had the animated face of a Jewish Benjamin Franklin. His voice always sounded a half-tone sharp of the prevailing conversational pitch, and he was imbued with a combative, cheerfully anti-authoritarian spirit. But as the nitty-gritty of his work in the fifties emerged from the recesses of memory, Frank's voice lowered to a hoarse mutter, the flesh of his face grew heavy and he lapsed into gloomy rumination: about clients overcome by paranoia; about the burden of learning that a Communist Party committee in Ohio had beaten a member falsely accused of informing; about the F.B.I.'s harassment of Frank's own family and neighbors. These were hardly conventional courtroom war stories.Most of the attorneys who shouldered the unprecedented professional burden imposed by the anti-Communist purge are now dead, Donner among them. Few now remember that they were a diverse lot--labor lawyers and Communist Party members, white-shoe corporate practitioners, distinguished academics--or that for most of them the loyalty cases turned out to be a messy, life-defining business. Even institutional memory is at risk of being lost: Early this year, the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, established to aid these lawyers when the A.C.L.U. succumbed to the era's hysteria, passed out of independent existence, merging with the larger Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City.Two books published over the past two years--a family biography centered on liberal California celebrity lawyer Bartley Crum by his daughter Patricia Bosworth, and the memoir of left-wing paladin Victor Rabinowitz--begin the important excavation of these lawyers' stories. Reviewers have focused on each book's larger story: Bosworth's is a sometimes excruciating chronicle of an imploding upper-class family, Rabinowitz's is a saga of a half-century of activist lawyering. But loyalty cases are the linchpins upon which both men's lives and careers turned.Many people remember Joseph Welch's \\"have you no decency\\" denunciation of Joe McCarthy. But Rabinowitz tells a story that's probably more representative of loyalty-case lawyering. The occasion was one of McCarthy's hearings at the Army Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, around 1953. A distraught woman approached Rabinowitz outside the hearing room. A single mother and, it seems, a party member, Sylvia worked as a clerk for the local board of education but had been formerly employed at the Signal Corps. If compelled to testify, she would lose her public school desk job. Rabinowitz took Sylvia's case on the spot.I waited in the hall to catch McCarthy ashe came up in the elevator, and a fewminutes before ten o'clock he stepped outof an elevator car, saw me ... threw hisarms around me shouting, \\"Hello Vic!What can I do for you?\\" There wereabout fifty people in the hall, and I didnot relish the greeting.Keeping a lid on his repulsion, Rabinowitz asked McCarthy to excuse Sylvia from testifying. \\"I pointed out that it seemed unnecessarily cruel to this young woman to deprive her of employment.\\" Sure, said McCarthy--just check with his chief counsel, Roy Cohn. Cohn, true to form, said no. The genial McCarthy proceeded to shred Sylvia in the hearing; she lost her job the next day.By disposition and training, lawyers are essentially believers in the system. The attorneys at the top of their game in the fifties, even Marxists like Rabinowitz, had earlier found special ratification for that inclination in the New Deal. So cases like Sylvia's represented a rude awakening. And the unique pressures of ended loyalty cases--the fractious fights between C.P.ers and liberals, the constant F.B.I. surveillance, the likelihood that attorneys themselves would be subpoenaed by the same investigating committees as their clients--could leave even high-powered lawyers feeling unmoored. Some, like Rabinowitz, were so outraged by the sustained cynicism of the inquisitors that they became outriders of sixties radicalism. On the other hand, at least a few were left crushed in livelihood and spirit--among them Bartley Crum, one of the most prominent members of the Hollywood Ten's \\"dream team\\" in 1947, who would spend the next decade yanked back and forth between the poles of principled resistance and humiliating capitulation.Both Rabinowitz and Crum arrived at their encounters with the inquisition through the National Lawyers Guild, founded in 193 7 as a progressive, pro-labor alternative to the American Bar Association. Except for the guild, though, their careers could not have been more different. Rabinowitz is, at 87, one of the few survivors of that era still practicing law. Moved by a short story by Albert Maltz (later one of the Hollywood Ten), Rabinowitz had steered himself into labor law, joining the Communist Party in 1942. In a few years, he and Leonard Boudin founded what remains the nation's leading progressive law firm, today known as Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman.Unrepentant Leftist is an unapologetic recollection of movements and clients. Rabinowitz is blunt in his motivation for joining the party (he was \\"more interested in works than faith\\"), equally unambiguous about his differences with party policy in the postwar years and his reasons for leaving in 1960. He recounts his firm's long representation of Cuba, the ups and downs of the guild, his efforts on behalf of the civil rights movement in the South (among his clients, his daughter Joni, tried in Georgia on a trumped-up perjury charge). With great dignity he describes the arduous job of aiding in the representation of his partner Boudin's daughter Kathy, who, after eleven years as a Weather Underground fugitive, was arrested in 1981 for murder in a Brink's robbery in Nyack, New York. Through all of this Rabinowitz comes across as a stand-up guy, as Abbie Hoffman defined it: the Tony Curtis character who, when the Roman centurion comes for Kirk Douglas, rises to declare, \\"I am Spartacus.\\"Rabinowitz was witness to the first chapter of the purge. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Labor Act to regulate union organizing. Taft-Hartley's section 9(h) required officers of unions certified by the National Labor Relations Board to make sworn declarations that they were not members of the Communist Party. A Rabinowitz client, the American Communications Association, was closely aligned with the C.P. and, when its officers could not sign the requisite oath, was duly decertified. Various federal judges upheld the decertification. Rabinowitz tried to convince the union and party leadership to swallow their loss: He feared an adverse Supreme Court ruling would set a broader and more dangerous precedent. The party hierarchy insisted on an appeal, but Rabinowitz turned out to be right. In American Communications Association v. Douds, the Court ruled that protecting \\"the free flow of commerce\\" from crippling strikes favored by C.P. strategists trumped First Amendment rights. It was the first national test of a blanket ban on Communists in trade unions, and it unleashed a flood of anti-subversive legislation aimed at other sectors.At first, the anti-Communist panic was actually good for the firm's business. But soon the professional cost was clear. Many individual clients could not afford to pay, and heavily Communist unions like the United Electrical Workers were going broke defending themselves. The firm's largest and most reliable client, the Health Care and Hospital Workers Union-District 65, abruptly decided it needed lawyers without Rabinowitz-Boudin's red taint. Rabinowitz himself was called to testify before Senator James Eastland's Internal Security Subcommittee, and had to block Eastland's investigators physically from seizing his client files.With exceptional candor, Rabinowitz illuminates, in new and often unflattering ways, the role played by the Communist Party hierarchy--the flight underground of C.P. leaders indicted under the Smith Act, for instance, which he correctly viewed as the sheerest folly. Equally enlightening are his accounts of debates with other party lawyers on how to handle investigators' subpoenas--arguments between \\"First Amendment Communists\\" wanting to defy the committees' right to ask any questions at all, and Fifth Amendment Communists wanting to protect themselves with the established right to non-incrimination. In the short run the so-called First Amendment Communists lost out, especially after citations of the Hollywood Ten for contempt; most witnesses claimed the Fifth. But in the long run, repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment under the glare of klieg lights helped convince the public that dissenters really were conspiratorial criminals. It would take more than a decade before Rabinowitz, Donner and other lawyers could chip away substantially at the inquisition's reach, one contempt citation, one passport denial at a time.Communist Party strategists come in for a lot of knocks in Bart Crum's biography, too, though from a different perspective. Where Rabinowitz complains that the party sometimes insisted on hiring establishment lawyers like Crum at the expense of political practitioners' greater expertise, Crum, working on the Hollywood Ten case for producer Adrian Scott and director Edward Dmytryk, was in precisely the opposite position: locked out of key meetings and decisions.Crum desperately wanted to be a standup guy, but through a combination of personal failings and the ravages of blackmail, he ended up with a chronic case of liberal staggers. Prior to 1947 he'd combined a lucrative career as retainer to the likes of William Randolph Hearst with forays into reform politics. Self-aggrandizing, fiscally profligate and publicity-addicted, he attached himself temporarily to lost causes: the doomed 1940 presidential campaign of reform Republican Wendell Willkie; the pioneering but equally doomed newspaper PM, which he tried, disastrously, to salvage from bankruptcy. Another lost cause was his family. Patricia Bosworth's book filters her father's public career through an intimate life of considerable privilege but greater pain. I'll skip over Bosworth's recounting of the details, except to say that her father's appealing public persona, his idealism and restless energy, are as apparent as his horrifying self-indulgence.By 1947, Crum's attachment to Popular Front causes--ranging from Jewish resettlement in Palestine to the Progressive Citizens Association--had attracted the scrutiny of J. Edgar Hoover. Then came the Hollywood Ten. From the beginning, Crum found himself at odds with orthodox party lawyers on the team. \\"My father felt uncomfortable with the Party's secrecy,\\" Bosworth writes. \\"He would joke and flatter to make a point, tactics the Communists didn't appreciate at all... In the midst of one discussion my father suggested everybody simply tell the truth.\\" His clients Scott and Dmytryk agreed, but were outvoted when party lawyer Ben Margolis and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo argued that to answer questions at all would acknowledge HUAC's right to ask. Worse, Crum learned that party lawyers had held a separate, secret caucus about tactics. Despite Crum's professional prominence, he was ill equipped for the blacklist's political complexity. \\"You have no cunning in your face, Bartley Crum,\\" Bertolt Brecht said to him one day, shortly before the martyrdom-averse Brecht told a boldfaced lie to HUAC about his political affiliations and then packed his bags for East Germany.Still, Crum took on other loyalty cases--California teachers and unionists mostly, meeting them late at night in bars to avoid attracting attention. Rather than directly challenge the inquisition, his strategy was to \\"protect the client from making rash statements ... to sound 'hostile' to Communism.\\" It's not clear whether this \\"establishment\\" strategy paid off for his clients. It certainly did not protect Crum from the F.B.I.: \\"Most certainly a Communist or a hidden Communist,\\" his file says. \\"Always refers to himself as a Catholic or Republican; obviously a double alibi.\\" Nor did it shield his family from being ostracized in their affluent, conservative social set.Crum couldn't quite make up his mind where his commitments lay. Sometime in 1948, he stopped handling loyalty cases because \\"his more conservative clients disapproved.\\" Yet that same year he moved to New York as new publisher of the failing PM, which he renamed the New York Star. Endlessly red-baited and hopelessly undercapitalized, the paper was out of business in a year, and a few weeks later Crum attempted suicide. By the end of 1950, Crum had resigned from the National Lawyers Guild to look \\"less subversive.\\" At the same time his client Dmytryk broke with the Hollywood Ten to testify about his own activities. Most of the Ten blamed Bart.These conflicting pressures reached critical mass in the spring of 1953: In a restaurant with his family, he was suddenly called to the phone. Hoover was on the line, warning Crum his passport would be revoked unless he went to Washington to answer some questions. Crum provided a dirt-eating written statement: \\"I am a practicing Catholic. My religious and political views are not and have never been compatible with Communism or Socialism.\\" That's what he told his family, gradually adopting a defensive bitterness toward the C.P. What Crum didn't say is that he also agreed to provide the F.B.I. with information about the Lawyers Guild and two of his colleagues.In the short run, Crum's strategy worked: His passport was renewed. But the process seemed to collapse his internal system of meaning; he had no Rabinowitz-like compass to restore stability to his life. He'd already come to rely on alcohol and barbiturates. His son Bart Jr. committed suicide. Over the next few years \\"his career fell into a shambles,\\" notes Bosworth. Crum only re-emerged in the public eye in a bizarre episode in 1958, representing one of the founders of the notorious promoter of the entertainment blacklist, Aware, Inc., in a complicated lawsuit against Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters. This brought him into contact with the young Robert F. Kennedy's Senate rackets investigation. Hoping that Kennedy might somehow straighten him out with the F.B.I., Crum began to leak information he'd been told privately by Teamsters lawyers; he finally agreed to testify publicly. In a Capitol Hill hearing room he even charged that Washington power broker Edward Bennett Williams, on the Hoffa team, offered to buy his silence. The charge was probably true, but Crum was so addled by drugs and alcohol that he got key facts wrong and was forced to retract his own statement. And there, essentially, Crum's life ends: Within a year he committed suicide after a dinner party.The interesting thing about these two very different stories is that Crum brought to the inquisition so many seeming advantages over Rabinowitz: money, political connections, press contacts. Yet it was Crum who ended up shattered. It's easy enough to pin their different trajectories on character and temperament. But there's more to it than that. There were liberals with lives more orderly than Crum's who managed to be just as politically unsteady, including the era's A.C.L.U. director, Morris Ernst, who secretly passed information to Hoover. Maybe the difference is that a party attorney like Rabinowitz had little to lose, while a wealthy establishment lawyer could lose everything. Moreover, Crum and Ernst both believed their professional effectiveness depended on remaining respectable, on preserving access to the powerful--a thoroughly ineffectual self-deception and a lesson for today's access-preserving Washington liberals. (The self-deceptions were not all on one side. The standup silence of Rabinowitz and other party loyalists, while admirable in so many ways, was also part of a disastrous culture of secrecy that made anti-Communist attacks as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.)Between them, these two biographies evoke the minute particulars of a defining moment in the history of U.S. civil liberties. It's easy to forget that most of the earliest important First Amendment precedents, in the shadow of World War 1, were more recent to McCarthy-era lawyers than the Hollywood Ten are to us today; the expansive First Amendment rulings of the Warren Court were still years away. And then there was the unprecedented challenge to lawyering itself. Going back to Samuel Adams and the Boston Massacre, the American legal system has generally maintained a clear distinction between advocate and client, but the loyalty cases punished lawyers and clients alike. While not every lawyer met the loyalty-case test with equal honor, virtually all did so at personal cost.The loyalty cases, which once loomed large enough to make national political careers for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, now surface in the national consciousness only occasionally, like a bad dream fleetingly recollected over lunch. But theories of the First Amendment that today seem common sense were first articulated by loyalty-ease lawyers; for instance, Yale Law School Professor Thomas Emerson, who with I.F. Stone founded the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, conceived his magisterial The System of Freedom of Expression as an affirmative response to the witch hunts. If jurors today know enough about the First Amendment to acquit Oprah Winfrey of libeling the Texas beef industry, if opinion polls show a public suspicious of a messianic inquisitor like Kenneth Starr, it's largely because a contemporary language for free speech was created by the exhausted and embattled civil liberties bar of the fifties."},{"Title":"Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir","review":"Any student of human rights and the US history of legal battles in this field would enjoy this memoir.

I bought this book as a guide to help me understand all the different devices and software packages that I needed to focus on.The biggest strength of this book, in my opinion, is the real world networking information and the clear manner in which Liska describes what security risks there are for most network environments and how to make those environments more secure.For example, a lot of network books talk about RIP (Routing Information Protocol - basically a protocol that allows your router to choose the best path to tramsit data) and most of them recommend enabling it in order to have a redundant network. In my experience, none of the books that I've read, except this one, have mentioned that there are fairly big security risks associated with using RIP. This book describes the nature of the security risks as well as the most likely way someone might exploit them, and then offers suggestions on how to either duplicate RIP's functionality in a more secure way or how to make sure RIP is as secure as it can get.Another part of the book that was quite helpful to me was the section on VPN's, something I have no experience with. Liska runs through the different types of VPN's, what the effects are of using VPN's, how to make sure your VPN stays secure, and as he does throughout the book, impresses upon you the importance of good passwords.This is just a small example of two of the many things I learned even on a quick flip through the book. I like this book a great deal because it's crammed full of interesting information that actually applies to my production network that I did not know or even know I had to know. Liska even covers Wireless Networks! As a WISP employee, I can attest to the accuracy of this information, and I would love to see him write more on the subject!In short, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an informative and clearly written book covering the most pertinent information on all parts of the network, from Human Beings to Switches to Firewalls. I look forward to Allan Liska's next book."},{"Title":"The Practice of Network Security: Deployment Strategies for Production Environments","review":"I've read many tomes on the subject of security but they never really get into the details of what really matters, they only touch on the very basic ideas, or they are too detailed about one specific topic and fail to present what is in the real world. Finally Mr. Liska has written the text that brings it all together with an excellent marriage of theory and real world practice.To start, Allan realizes that most network admins are faced with cost-cutting issues and are stuck dealing with management. Allan's dicussions on risk management, cost analysis, and how to &quot;sell&quot; the value of solid network security to the powers that be can be a real eye opener. Make your managers read this stuff. Read it to them yourself.For the more techincal side, there are very solid in depth discussions on the important stuff like routing, switching, general (and spcific) firewall configuration, comparisons of user authentication approaches, VPN techniques from dial-in access to broadband, an excellent chapter dedicated to Wireless protocols and security, and so much more. Nothing is left out.This book is a must have for any serious network or system administrator."},{"Title":"The Practice of Network Security: Deployment Strategies for Production Environments","review":"This book is an excellent reference for anyone involved in the practice of network security.

It is written in terms even a beginner can comprehend, yet its information is invaluable to even the most experienced professional.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest, professional or otherwise, in building robust, secure networks."},{"Title":"The Practice of Network Security: Deployment Strategies for Production Environments","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with \` The Practice of Network Security: Deployment Strategies for Production Environments'. The book is a very good technical overview of the details of network security.While it is technical in nature, it is not so technical as to turn off the average reader. This is a good resource for a manager that needs to understand a security technology, but who does not want to get bogged down in the technical minutia.The book brings together all of the top-level security technologies and products needed to secure a corporate infrastructure.The book covers a lot of ground in its 375 pages and is an excellent starting point for anyone needing a quick and effective introduction to network security."},{"Title":"The Practice of Network Security: Deployment Strategies for Production Environments","review":"This book covers a lot of ground; communication protocols, authentication, authorization, and accounting, network topologies, logical network structures, IDS, IPS, security at the network and host levels, and security policy creation and enforcement. It doesn't get very technical, but does cover alot of theory and security implications.Liska covers all the security basics we should all know: don't transmit passwords in clear text, patch software, shutdown unused network services, use strong passwords and change them often, change default passwords on your routers, switches, and other network hardware, run network daemons in chroot when possible, restrict physical access to servers, centralize your logs, etc.The book is very relevant as of May 2007, although the wireless section may be slightly dated. In the wireless LANs chapter, 802.11i was ratified after the book was printed. It refers to the standard as Temporal Key integrity Protocol (TKIP). It is actually named WPA2. TKIP is only a subset of WPA2, as is CCMP, which wasn't a standard at the time of printing.Some useless advice is given regarding securing wireless connections. Namely, disabling broadcasting of SSID, MAC filtering, and enabling WEP. Today this strategy can be simply circumvented by anyone that knows how to download and run a cracking/sniffing program.Bridging firewalls were mentioned briefly with some advantages. This is a great security strategy as it creates what I like to call a stealth firewall. Liska states the fact that they are difficult to attack or detect because they do not exist at the IP layer. He also mentions that firewalls are no place for Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), alerting an admin of intrusions. This is very good advice as firewalls should only be a part of your Intrusion \\"Prevention\\" System (IPS).In the DMZ chapter, discussions of network designs are accompanied with a liberal amount of diagrams. This is a great help in understanding how network elements are situated and analyzing security holes. I have yet to find an Internet resource that has the number of graphical representations of different secure network designs, including multiple DMZs, that this book contains.Liska does advise security by obscurity. For example, changing BIND's version so as not to disclose the version, for which there could be specific exploits. A second example is changing the name of the Window's administrator account to something, and I quote, \\"non-obvious.\\"The \\"DNS Security\\" section is fairly thorough, mentioning transaction signatures (TSIG) and ACLs. However, split namespace is not mentioned. This is a great security strategy because it protects your \\"private namespace,\\" not allowing it to leak on to the Internet. A separate namespace should be deployed in the DMZ, resolving names of hosts in the that particular DMZ.The last few chapters cover security policy enforcement, such as logging relevant data, strategically monitoring the network, and isolating attacks.This book is a good stepping stone. For instance, it mentions that a good security model is to centralize all login accounts and states that Kerberos can do that. Then, a few pages describe what it is, how it works, and the security issues involved with its implementation. The next step would be to go out and get a dedicated Kerberos book."},{"Title":"Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry","review":"This book is an essential reference for anyone with interest in doing any type of study in the history of Islam from 600-1500. Humphreys hasn't written yet another drab, stale survey book; rather, he compiled something immensely more useful. He has created a veritable inventory of scholarship, not coarsely comprehensive but pleasantly judicious, and accompanied it with a running commentary that places each work on the larger grid of modern scholarship on the subject as well and extrapolation of the various challenges realting thereto. In this way, it facilitates a critical yet broad engagement with the important scholarship hitherto written in the field helping us to refine, reconsider, and reshape the direction of future scholarship. Also, this work serves as an accessible point of entry for historians who specialize in areas other than Islamic history whom I trust will also find in plenty helpful."},{"Title":"Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry","review":"If you ever wish to kick start your understanding of the vast corpus which is called Islamic history, this is the book to do it. Written by a preeminent scholar of Islamic studies this book is a gem. It's basic premise is to weed out the useless from useful texts; it informs you about the relevant texts for the fields within Islamic history which you will need to build up your results (for instance, this book tells you if you want to understand Muslims and Islam you need to study major Hadith books - and among them Bukhari should be the first place to start with). Such specific references alongwith publisher name and publishing year are really helpful. A scholar of the class of Bernard Lewis often cites this work as the first place to start with.I personally found the text very readable and not cumbersome at all, which is generally the case with reference books on historical studies."},{"Title":"Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry","review":"This is not a book for a casual reader looking for more information on Islamic History*. This is a book for those looking to understand the framework of Islamic history. This is a challenge to get through, and the first read through feels discombobulated. However, the value of this book is that it provides the reader with a historiography of all the important works/resources (at least in the early 90s) that exist, which required a knowledge and depth of the subject that is awe inspiring for any inspiring historians (the fact that sources in at least five languages are discussed adds to the immensely impressive scope of this work). On top of that it provides key insights into the restraints that the historic record puts on the study of history and gets the reader thinking like a historian about the problems and gaps that are inherit in the discipline.I personally found that the value of this book came as I continued to increase my knowledge of Islamic history and was able to refer back to this book for resources to continue my education. While I have only just begun to scratch the surface of my interest in Islamic History, this book continues to provide insights and leads that have directed my research in ways that have saved me hundred of hours. This is a must have for anyone interested in studying Islamic History at anything higher than a casual level.* I would personally suggest Dr. James E. Lindsay'sDaily Life in the Medieval Islamic World (The Daily Life Through History Series)for an introductory book on Islamic history."},{"Title":"Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry","review":"This book is a poor choice for people who know little about islamic history.

It's spring and the world of nature is reawakening from winter's slumber as the children prepare to enter the world of magic with their guide, Spot the dog. With Spot's help the kids explore the nearby forest where they discover the Dark and Dreadful Path, eventually stumbling onto the Magician's secret hiding place through a door in a tree. The Magician teaches the children that the secret to magic is believing, and shows them how to inhabit the bodies of animals. Soon the children are coming to the aid of a family of beleaguered badgers who are battling the forces of Evil in the form of a wild dog named Fang. A superbly written fantasy adventure for young readers. Also highly recommended is the first title in this marvelous quartet, The Steps Up The Chimney. The final two eagerly awaited Archway Paperback titles planned are The Tunnel Behind The Waterfall and The Bridge In The Clouds."},{"Title":"The Door In The Tree","review":"In the door in the tree the three constant children go to stay with there uncle and his patner in Golden House. While there the children come across a door in a large tree with a room looking out onto the whole valley. Here the children first meet Meg Lewis a local woman who is trying to protect the badgers. They soon learn more about how the badger's are being hunted for sport by the badger baiters and there vicious dogs and become very interested in what they can do to help them. But when the magician refuses to help with magic they find themselves left with a terrible choice to make. I really enjoyed reading this book but at times it was dragged out a bit too much. I'm looking forward to reading more books in this series so if you're someone that likes reading books about magic you'll really enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Door In The Tree","review":"This is the second book in the \`Magician's House Quartet' and sees the three children of the previous novel (\`The Steps Up The Chimney') return to their uncle Jack's Golden House, where the year before they had meet a time-travelling wizard called Stephen Tyler, befriended a number of wild animals and mastered the magical art of sharing their bodies, and helped deliver their uncle's girlfriend's baby when the wizard's assistant Morden had attempted to sabotage the birth.The children William, Mary and the youngest Alice are delighted to be back during the short spring break, eager to begin living more of the magic, but are slightly disconcerted to find that nothing out of the ordinary occurs. Just as William begins to doubt the reality of the magic of however, Alice once more joins minds with the dog Spot, who leads her to the Door in the Tree...In this story, the badger sett of the valley is under attack from badger-baiters - a fact the children learn from their new friend, the elderly woman Meg Lewis, who lived by herself in Four Fields where she has appointed herself a guardian of the wildlife in the area - in particular the badgers. When the children discover a dead badger upon the path that Spot calls \`The Dark and Dreadful Path', and find several ominous messages signed \`the Fang', they realise that something indeed is amiss within the Golden Valley, and once more it's up to them to restore balance.\`The Door in the Tree' is a step up from its predecessor \`The Steps Up the Chimney' - it takes the children further into the woods and grounds of Golden House to discover further beauties -and harsh truths - of the natural world, a pattern that is continued in the next book \`The Tunnel Behind the Waterfall' where the children trek even further to find the lake known as Goldenwater. In this second book the children also find new acquaintances - not just Meg, but animals such as Falco the kestrel, Bawson the badger, Merula the blackbird, and re-appearances from Cinnabar the fox and Jasper the owl.The story is more focussed and to the point - in the previous book suspense is built up only for nothing to happen, but here there are several exciting and interesting occurrences of the children's adventures - especially those that occur during the night. Although disappointingly the door in the tree actually plays a very little part in the story (you never actually learn where it came from), other happenings slowly begin to build up and create tension till the children are once more separated and relying only on their individual talents to resolve the problem. Corlett's descriptions of the children entering the animal's bodies are especially vivid, and his greatest strength is action-sequences (seen used to best effect in the final volume \`The Bridge in the Clouds'). Also worth re-reading is the lovely description of Four Fields, Meg's home.However, as it was in the first book, the magician and his evil assistant Morden have very little to do in the main plot strand of the book. Morden appears only as a lurking threat at the back of their minds, and the magician himself Stephen Tyler arrives without warning to spout ideas of philosophy, alchemy and human nature that young readers may find confusing and are perhaps better suited to books of a higher age group than these are intended.There is some more information on the history of the house as told from Meg's point of view - its interesting, but a little hard to piece altogether, especially if you can't quite remember little tidbits of history that were first told in the first book. A timeline or family tree would have been appropriate to chronicle the families that lived in the house - the Crawdens, the Tylers, the Mordens, the Lewises and now the Taylors/Greens.Luckily the children improve - in the first book I could barely stand them due to their quarrelling and rudeness, but here there is a slight improvement on their manners, though Alice still needs a lot of work to make her even remotely likeable - the fuss she makes over Phoebe breastfeeding her baby is vulgar as well poorly written. Parents might not enjoy reading such passages out loud (Alice shrieks out - \\"Boobs! Boobs! Will's got a thing about boobs!). Like the plot strand of Jack and Phoebe's living together without being married, it is too crudely and awkwardly written to belong in a children's book. Other authors have tackled such subject matter with far more sensitivity than Corlett does here.All in all, its an enjoyable enough book, a good continuation of the \`Steps Up the Chimney', but nothing overly special, with a few moments that unfortunately drag this series down from what it could have been."},{"Title":"The Great Mistake","review":"Mary Robert Rinehart's The Great Mistake is a good commbination of mystery and romance. Her books are fairly humerous and I recomend them. The Great Mistake is not one of my favorites (I perfer Rinehart's The Circular Staircase) but still a good book worth taking a look at. One of the things I like about Rinehart is her 1st person narrative style. I like to see the story through a character's eyes."},{"Title":"The Great Mistake","review":"This book is 368 pages long, but it seemed like 1000. It felt like the book could easily have been half as long and lost nothing worthwhile. None of the characters - including the insufferable narrator - are believable human beings, and nothing the slightest bit interesting happens in the entire book.The problem is not that this book and its author are from the relatively distant past (first half of the 20th century), because they are roughly contemporary with Agatha Christie, Ngaio Marsh and Dorothy L Sayers, and even Christie's books are entertaining if not literary masterpieces (which Sayers's are).The Great Mistake is just coy and annoying. By the time the murderer was revealed (on page 364) I no longer cared. In fact, I NEVER cared, because I didn't care about anybody in the book. I would have been delighted if ALL the characters had been killed off by page ten and the remaining 358 pages had been blank.If this just happens to be Rinehart's worst book by far, it's a shame, because I will never read another one."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of DC and AC Circuits","review":"Fundamentals of DC and AC Circuits - Hazen has done it again with a winning book targeted exactly right for the Vocational and Technical School markets. This book is the very definition of adjectives such as readable, understandable, practical, applied, and complete. Many students say this is one of the few textbooks they were able to read and actually understand. All parts of the book and available ancillaries were written by Hazen, providing the all-important continuity that students need and expect. This is a definite buy for anyone wanting to learn about electricity, either on their own or in a formal classroom"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of DC and AC Circuits","review":"A very readable book; ideal for learning elementary electronics either in school or on one's own. This is a text for use in the first course of an Electronics Technician program. It is well-written and has very few errors. Hazen succeeds in making things understandable on an intuitive level (where other authors, e.g. Floyd, seem to assume a year of college physics for the background understanding of more abstract concepts). The pub date of 1990 should not put you off, because the fundamentals really have not changed. What has changed in books which have gone through more regular updating are the graphics, which are fancier, and the prices, which are proportionately higher (funny how the same hard to follow explanations are repeated from edition to edition by other authors -- a weakness not improved by pretty graphics). This book also comes in at just under 650 total pages (supplementary material and index are paginated seperately) where a competing book weighs (heavily) in at 1008 total. Which one would you rather carry around for a year? Few 2 year tech programs will use all of the material in the 1kp volume. This book can help open the doors to something more advanced, such as the excellent _The Art of Electronics_ by Horowitz and Hill."},{"Title":"Classic Paul Simon (Paul Simon/Simon & Garfunkel)","review":"I had been looking for a Simon and Garfunkel sheat music book, And this one is great.

Her analysis of the neoconservative agenda to dismantle governmental involvement in social programs is both clear and articulate. The general point that McQuiag makes is that Canadians have been fed a bogus line by neoconservatives when it comes to the financial burden caused by the government's involvement in social programs. Drawing on examples from Europe, she argues that countries that spend considerably more of their GDP on social programs have lower crime and poverty rates, etc. and do not have larger deficits (since they have relatively high tax rates). Where the reverse is the truth, such as in the US and South Africa, what we find is a much more pronounced inequality between the rich and the poor. Canada, McQuaig claimed, was at the crossroads in 1993--either we could go the Europeans route, or adopt the American approach, which of course is what the neoconservatives would prefer. But why? Does it have to do with saving taxpayers money, improving services by allowing private corporations to operate day care centres or provide medical insurance? Nope. It all has to do with power, and the pathetic notion that the wealthy and elite have concerning those who are poor, disabled and unemployed--this is their lot in life, so why should we [the rich] have to pay their way? In essence, McQuaig exposes the true nature of Canadian society--which is very much contrary to the image that is presented to the rest of the world--and this discomforts many people, and downright irritates those who have much to lose from Canadian society becoming more equitable."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Banker's Wife: The Assault on Equality in Canada","review":"A powerful book written in defense of the Canadian welfare state, &quot;The Wealthy Bankerfs Wife&quot; takes a critical look at the American social-welfare system and compares its counterpart in Europe - most notably the Scandinavian countries. In doing so, author Linda McQuaig reveals to readers the direction that Canadafs leaders are taking Canadafs social-welfare system in their quest to &quot;re-define&quot; Canadafs social-welfare programmes.In chapter after chapter, McQuaig shows that under the European model, family values have been maintained, families have been supported, children do not go hungry, children are educated. There is a support system purposely designed so that parents can stay at home to raise their children. In contrast,&quot;The Wealthy Bankerfs Wife&quot; shows that under the American model, purposeful, conscious social policy has been to destroy and attack family values in a country where extremely high rates of child poverty, malnutrition, child abuse and child violence are the rule rather than the exception.&quot;The Europeans manage to maintain extensive social welfare systems and strong economies, while the Americans have convinced themselves that they canft afford anything more than the most minimal social programmes. Canada, which has traditionally been situated somewhere between the two models, has recently been drifting in the American direction. Before we drift any further we should remind ourselves that we do have a choice of directions, and that the direction we choose will ultimately determine what kind of society we live in.&quot; A well-researched, provocative book that provides the opportunity for much-needed debate concerning the future of Canadafs social-welfare system."},{"Title":"The Wealthy Banker's Wife: The Assault on Equality in Canada","review":"Filled with statistics about income inequality, this book is one great manipulation of numbers. McQuiag sees income inequality as an evil in itself and something that must be prevent without giving a coherent explantion as to why this should be so.Once again, a great display of how a total lack of knowledge of how a free market system works can lead to the adoption of an incoherent ideology. Innoculate yourself with basic economic theory before reading this book, lest you get swept up by the ultimately totalitarian ideals of McQuiag.Why does my country keep producing these socialistic demagogues?"},{"Title":"I Want to Know How You Found Me","review":"I received this book in the mail today and, at first opening the book, felt a deep disappointment.The very beginning of the book states, \\"I want to hear the story about how you and Daddy couldn't make a baby...\\" I believe this statement causes adopted children to feel \\"second best\\". Also, infertility is not the case in all adoptive families (mine included).

With a bit more swagger and style, and a (slightly) more down to Earth plot, the publishers found \\"Caper\\" to be more palatable, and had it published, while \\"Vortex\\" remained on the shelf for a few more years.THE PLOT: While investigating the sabotage of a NUMA research vessel, Dirk Pitt narrowly saves a Greek military outpost on a small Mediterranean island (Thasos) from being strafed by a WWI biplane (yes you read that right) which disappears as mysteriously as it arrived. Of course a mysterious beautiful girl gets involved with Pitt, and her uncle, a supremely evil Nazi war criminal, turns out to be behind both the sabotage and the attack, in an attempt to protect his lucrative smuggling outfit.THE PROS: It is not hard to see why the publisher chose this story. It is full of action, romance, daring, treachery, historical mysteries, and evil villains. From a high flying dogfight with antique planes, to a Roman laberynth, to the villain's secret lair, the story keeps moving, weaving a rather intricate little story about Bruno von Till and how his operation came to be, while our heroes try to outwith both the police and the villains and put an end to the smuggler.THE CONS: While the story is quite thrilling, some of the problems common to Cussler's earlier works are there, namely the female characters. Pitt's \\"seduction\\" of the main heroine by slapping her is a bit much, even for a macho-adventure book. The ending is a bit of a letdown too, without giving away too much, it feels more like a whodunit climax with Pitt unmasking the villains and explaining their crimes rather than physically confronting any of them."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"One of the earlier Dirk Pitt books.

Seriously, Mediterranean Caper is one of the most poorly written and contrived books I have ever read. I've seen Johnny Quest cartoon episodes that had much more plot and sophistication.Save your money. Another one-star review here from Paul Treleaven describes in great detail the shortcomings of this book that I agree with wholeheartedly (good observations, Paul). When Dirk starts slapping the lady on the beach around, and she still wants to be intimate with him, well, that strains credulity. The Dirk Pitt character is really a jerk in this book - he hits women, beats up chauffeurs, screams obscenities at his superiors, and generally behaves like a gluteus maximus.Cussler has done much better than this. I highly recommend one of his later novels (The Chase) that ditch the Dirk character (maybe his name should be changed to Dick)."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"While I found this to be an ok story, it is definately dated in the author's/main character's attitude towards women.

He is like the uber manly character of most adolescent fantasies i.e strong male character dragging a women towards his cave by the hair. anyway, that being said, the story isn't bad, but at the same time very corny/cliqued.

With this in mind I thought I'd start at the beginning (which is really Pacific Vortex, as it was written before \`The Mediterranean Caper' - or \`Mayday!' as it's called in Australia - was published).However, while I won't comment on the literary merits of Pacific Vortex (think an utterly dumbed down James Bond - and that's really dumb), it was supremely advanced over the stilted dialog and so-called machismo of the Mediterranean Caper. In fact, I wasn't even able to get past 35 pages of this truly awful example of writing.And why is that, you ask?Let's look at the following text taken from the book. To put you in the scene our \`hero' Dirk Pitt has gone down to the beach one early morning. While there a beautiful young woman stumbles across him. Naturally they talk and she reveals how her beloved husband was killed in a car crash eight and a half years previously:&lt;and let's now read the literary brilliance of Clive Cussler:>\`It's been eight and a half years now,' she replied in a whisper.Pitt felt dazed. Then anger set in. What a waste, he thought. What a rotten waste for a beautiful woman like her to grieve over a dead man for nearly nine years. The more he thought about it the angrier he became. He could see tears welling in her eyes as she lost herself in the remembrance, and the sight sickened him. He reached over and gave her a hard backhand slap across the face.Her eyes jerked wide, and her whole body tensed from the sharp blow. It was as if she was struck by a bullet. \`Why did you strike me?' she gasped.\`Because you needed it, needed it badly,' he snapped. \`That torch you carry around is as worn out as an overcoat. I'm surprised someone hasn't taken you over a knee and spanked it off. So your husband was dashing. So what? He's dead and buried, and mourning over him for all these years won't resurrect him from the grave. Lock away his memory somewhere and forget him. You're a beautiful woman - you don't belong chained to a coffin full of bones. You belong to every man who turns and admires you.' Pitt could see his words were penetrating her weak defences. \`Now you think about it. It's your life. Don't throw it away and play \\"Camille\\" until you're withered and grey.'Her face was distraught in the morning sun, and her breath came in sobs. Pitt let her cry for a long time. When she finally raised her head and turned it towards him, he could see that her cheeks were streaked with tears, mixed with tiny grains of sand, clinging to the wetness. She looked up at him, and he caught the gleam in her eyes. They were soft and scared-looking, like a little girl's. He lifted her in his arms and kissed her. Her lips were warm and moist.\`When was the last time you had a man?' he whispered.\`Not since...' Her voice trailed away.Pitt took her as the long shadows of the rocks crept upward over the beach, shielding their bodies from the sun.&lt;and thank you Clive>'Why did you strike me?'Personally, I can think of several other things I would've said in that situation, such as: 'Help', 'Police' and 'Rape'.I can only hope that in the intervening 3 decades since those words were written that Clive's attitudes to women and what constitutes a \`hero' are a bit less pathetic. Here's a fragile woman who is physically and verbally attacked by our 'hero', whose eyes are then equated with looking \`soft and scared-looking, like a little girl's' (well, whatever gets you going Dirk). Naturally Dirk Pitt then has sex (I won't say she does, she's just - in my mind - been raped) and she's ever so grateful and invites him back to meet her family, etc. etc.When I read that section I honestly thought, no, I must've missed something. There's no way that just happened.At that precise moment I found I could not read on.What sort of hero is this? Is this how a \`man's-man' is meant to behave? Is this, as other reviewers have said of this book, 'fun'?I mean, was this sort of garbage ever seen as okay, even in the early 1970's? I can understand a writer having their hero as a clich&eacute;d \`man' that all other men envy, etc, but what Dirk Pitt does in that scene is not something any \`man' or \`hero' would do.Sorry, Clive, because of that one scene I won't be reading any more of your books. I've already wasted my money on this one and the ridiculously plotted Pacific Vortex. I've already been burnt twice.There's too many good adventure stories out there, with much better writing and plot, and with character's that aren't throwbacks to some outdated era for anyone to be bothered with this infantile slush."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I'm always game to check out a good thriller, and never having read Cussler, thought it was time to sample one of his early books. Originally published in 1973, this is the second in his \\"Dirk Pitt\\" series -- and I have to say, it is truly awful. Probably the best way to characterize it is as a really poor imitation of the James Bond films (not the books): indestructible manly hero, sex on the beach with willing beauty, outrageously silly plot, secret submarine base, and worst of all, the villain who explains everything to the hero instead of killing him.Set in the early '70s, the book starts with some zany promise, as a German WWI biplane attacks an (fictional) American airbase on Thasos, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea, about 75-100 miles east of Thessaloniki. The biplane efficiently destroys a bunch of F-105 Starfire Jets and C-133 transporters, without any response. (Apparently USAF bases of the time had no antiaircraft batteries. And the key to evading USAF radar is to use vintage aircraft -- so beware a North Korean strike force of Sopwith Camels!) Fortunately, Pitt happens to be flying a Catalina flying boat near the base at the same, and with the trusty aim of his rifle-totin' sturdy sidekick, manages to drive the biplane off. Pitt's been called in to investigate a series of strange accidents aboard a nearby scientific research vessel belonging the (also fictitious) National Underwater Marine Agency.Of course, the strafing and the accidents are related, and soon Pitt is knee-deep in a ridiculous plot. Apparently inspired by the 1971 film \\"The French Connection\\", Cussler soon has Pitt chasing after a massive heroin smuggling operation. But wait, there's more! One word: Nazis. I'll refrain from saying any more, other than the key to the smuggling plot that has baffled Interpol for decades is figured out in a few minutes by Pitt sketching on a beach. Unfortunately, it also will have been figured out on about page 20 by most semi-intelligent readers.The writing is just terrible, there's no other way to put it. Clunky descriptions, probably the worst dialogue I've read in several years, and cardboard characters. Plus, there's all kinds of stuff that Pitt does and figures out \\"off-camera\\", which are only revealed at the very end, which makes the reader feel rather cheated. I'll grant a writer one or two clever reveals in a story (the best I can think of is in Frederick Forsyth's \\"The Odessa File\\"), but these feel cheap. Many reviewers have commented on Pitt's rather old-fashioned take on women. However, in Cussler's defense, it was written more than thirty years ago, and it is in keeping with the genre. More importantly, with the regards to the scene where he slaps the beautiful woman and she proceeds to have sex with him, it's revealed at the very end that there is a good plot reason for her submission. It's still a laughably bad scene, but it does make some cockeyed sense within the scheme of the plot.Overall, I like thrillers and I like junky adventure stories, but even within those genre considerations, this is poor poor stuff. Maybe Cussler's gotten better over time, but I'm sure not going to waste any more of my time finding out."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"This was my first Cussler novel, and while I liked the plot, I felt that it was not well-written. In addition to being somewhat offensive to women, the narrator used trite expression after trite expression. Really it was irritating."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"As usual any book written by Clive Cussler is superb thriller and is very good.

Cussler can always make hours go by quickly when reading his books."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"One of the more misogynistic Dirk Pitt novels, and hence feels quite dated.Usually I just roll with his standard take on women in this author's novels, but this one seemed more extremely unbalanced in how he expressed the lead female character, to the point that it was distracting and felt out of tone. I have read many of Mr.Cussler's books, and will continue to, but feel this is just an area that modern female readers need to just ignore - women are viewed as chattel or worse, and this book errs on the side of outright disgust. I need to read more of the novels with the Fargos to appreciate a more balanced and nuanced approach."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"This was Cussler's first Dirk Pitt novel. I would not have bought this if I had not been mislead by Amazon. On your website, you represent this book as published in 2004. It was actually first published in 1973. I read most of the Dirk Pitt early novels and as the character has progressed, he is much more entertaining. In closing, I would have never bought this novel if you had accurately stated it was first published in 1973. If you search my buying history, I am a regular customer. Shame on Amazon for this misleading marketing."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I like all of Cussler's books. He makes the finding of a mystery in history seem like it could have really happened the way he wrote about it."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I have greatly enjoyed the Cussler &#34;Oregon Files&#34; series, this was my first read of a &#34;Dirk Pitt Adventure&#34;. A let down to say the least. The writing is sophomoric at best.Character developement is nonexistent and the story line is plodding and painfully predictable. This book totally lacks the artistic sophistication of the &#34;Oregon Files&#34; writings. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Nothing is better than a good Dirk Pitt adventure and you don't have to read them in order of publishing date. Characters are real, details and technicality is so spot on you feel they could be truth instead of fiction - Cusler draws you into the plot and the lives of the characters with such ease and realism that you don't even realize how much you know them. Love his work."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Another great book by Clive Cussler. A dirk Pitt adventure and a hard to put down reading.

But, this Dirk Pitt adventure (the first published, though Cussler wrote the aforementioned PACIFIC VORTEX first), is a fun ride of a novel and moves along at a fast pace (it's actually one of Cusslers shortest, if not THE shortest). With some very vivid fight scenes and some nice Alistair Maclean-esque plotting (apparently Cussler used the late Scottish writer's work as a template until he found his own style) this Cussler novel really delivers and I made fast work of it reading over a weekend about a year ago.Starting with the attack on a US airfield in the Greek islands by a biplane and involving smuggling, German fighter aces and the trademark underwater sequences for which Cussler is perhaps best known for (through his non-fiction writings as much as for Dirk Pitt) I can guarantee that this novel will no doubt charm even the harshest of Cusslers critics as long as they take it for what it is - some harmless. Mildly diverting fun.On a sidenote, all the reviewers who are commenting on the bad writing should really lighten up, this was after all one of Clive Cussler's earliest works :)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I will keep this review short. I have read all of Cussler's works over the past dozen years or so. I read The Mediterranean Caper perhaps ten years ago. To this day I still believe that it was my favorite of the Dirk Pitt stories. If you are a new fan of Cussler - pull this older book out. It is a classic."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I first started reading Cussler when I found Pacific Vortex at my condo complex's library. I became addicted. Dirk Pitt novels are all top-notch adventure stories with political suspense, romance, and high-speed car chases thrown in. This is the 2nd book in the series, though it was the first one printed, and is an exciting, riveting adventure tale. I don't want to spoil a lot, but the plot is excellent, and as always, as twisty as the roads Pitt drives his sports cars on. It all starts when Dirk Pitt, the main hero, and Al Giordano find an antique WWII Bomber plane attacking a United States Base. With the help of a beautiful secret agent, Pitt is thrown into a wild action-packed tale of danger and villanous criminals. As with many Pitt books, the political entanglements can sometimes slow the action, but I still highly recommend this story, and the rest of the series. Enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"This is the first of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. This was my second book by Cussler having discovered him by reading Dragon first. AS soon as I realized there were books before Dragon I ran to the bookstore and for the first three and The Mediterranean Caper bring first I devoured it. I was hooked (officially!). It was great to find Dirk Pitt as he was first introduced to the world. A swashbuckling character part James Bond part Indiana Jones (long before there was an Indiana Jones). This is a great start toa long and wonderful life of a character. I will concede that some of the actions of Dirk are a bit over the top. He is a true womanizer , but you also have to remember when the book was originally written. That is what \\"manly spies\\" did... yeah i know its no excuse but people this is not great literature, its escapist reading. For those of you that are just now discovering Cussler you are lucky... you don't have to wait 6 months to a year for the next novel you have many to read (also the character does grow and mature...)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Clive Cussler's books always remind me of a James Bond movie. The plots are preposterous, the hero is far too perfect, and the women fall into his bed much too easily. Nevertheless, they're so much fun that they keep you turning the pages until the very end. The hero, Dirk Pitt, is an Air Force Major on assignment to the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA) as a kind of trouble shooter. In this case, Pitt is sent to Thasos (a small island off the coast of Greece) to investigate sabotage attempts being made against a NUMA scientific expedition. He immediately finds himself in the middle of an air raid on a U.S. Air Force base - a raid made by a World War I era biplane. Pitt ultimately winds up bringing down a Nazi war criminal who has eluded justice long enough to become perhaps the world's most clever and dangerous smuggler. In the process he becomes romantically involved with a beautiful Narcotics agent posing as the smuggler's niece while narrowly escaping death several times. In short, if you like James Bond you'll love Dirk Pitt."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Look, this is a very early work - and the edges are really rough. The writing is pretty stilted. The plot plays games with the reader. The attitude towards women is really wretched. It isn't a terribly good book by any measure. Read this book if you are already a Cussler fan and you want to explore his early works. Don't read this as your first exposure to Cussler. You might well not give him a second chance - and some of his other books are really quite good. My personal favorites are _Raise the Titanic_ and _Night Probe_. Those are also pretty early efforts, but even a couple of books past _The Mediterranean Caper_ he had settled down into a pretty darned effective writer who could tell a good tale without totally annoying the average reader. If you already gave this book a try and hated it - try one of the above two before you give up on Cussler entirely."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"A great book from start to finnish......

Also check out any books from AJ Quinnell (Man on Fire, Siege of Silence.....Check them all out !!!!)"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"In this outer, Dirk Pitt, NUMA's deep-diving hero, tangles with an elaborate smuggling ring that treats the Aegean waters like their own bath tub. In one of their bolder moves, the smugglers strike at nearby USAF base using nothing more than a WWI fighter. Millions of dollars worth of air force aircraft shatter and burn when struck by the primitive fighter's machine gun. Nearby, an NUMA research ship is also targeted by the smugglers. In striking back, Pitt will face a WWII U-boat skipper and a hot Grecian beauty. It's a thin Pitt adventure - closer to the Kurt Austin NUMA books, but still above them. It's closer to \\"Pacific Vortex\\" than one of the larger (and globe-spanning) novels like \\"Cyclops\\" or \\"Raise the Titanic\\". A lot of it is over-the-top (even with their planes on the ground, wouldn't a USAF base have other forms of protection? And are 20 ton airplanes a tad bit more damage resistant?) On the plus side, it's still a dependable Pitt actioner and Cussler (still keeping himself out of the story) gets some good use of the hot Aegean settings."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"I am a Clive Cussler Fan and normally love his Dirk Pitt books but this one I did not like because the Dirk character was very different than I am used to.

This is not the first Dirk Pitt story, but it was the first published. Dirk Pitt is a Major transferred from the Air Force to the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA). On paper he is the Surface Security Officer. In reality, when an oceanic research project has trouble, Pitt flies in, figures out the problem, fixes it and gets the project back on track.In Mediterranean Caper, the First Attempt research vessel is in the Aegean Sea looking for a missing link fish. Some unusual accidents take place; Dirk Pitt swoops in for the rescue to run into an apparent ghost plane. While sorting out the problems with the research project and an explanation for the ghost plane, Pitt runs into a drug smuggling scheme, undercover agents, and a traitor. I am no expert when it comes to the Air Force or anything military for that matter, so I have no idea about plausibility. For me it was an exciting story filled with twists and turns.The point of view did bounce around a bit, but I did not have trouble following it. Cussler does a good job introducing characters, so I had no trouble keeping track of everybody. I will warn you that Dirk Pitt is very James Bond-esque. In fact the whole story has that feel to it, but since I'm a fan of James Bond, it works. All in all, a fun, entertaining read and I will be looking for another Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt adventure to read."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"My first Clive Cussler.

At the end of the story you get all the details courtesy of a long monologue (its almost tiresome). Up to that point this is really a good story. It starts out with a bang, and keeps on going. Actually if Cussler had played out the details he reveals in the monologue in a different way, he could have added another 50 pages and made this story really well formed. Given this was written in 1973 I suppose we can forgive Pitt for his smoking cigarettes. I found that the story still translated well to 2009, its not like I was saying \\"back in the old days they did it like that...\\".

She comes to her senses, and within minutes they're making love on the beach.

I don't like them well enough to spend my own money. However, if I had read this one first, I would never have read another. I am old enough to well remember that being more sexist and insulting was OK with MANY men and some women, but this is just stupid and insulting: \\"he was not a man who catered to feminine wiles...loved the feel of their soft bodies...disliked subterfuge and games...little ploys it took to seduce the average woman...preferred straightforward and honest women, but there were far too few to be found.\\" Then on page 27 he meets a beautiful (of course) young woman in a modest bikini and within 3 sentences he is attempting to seduce her. Within 5-10 minutes (probably) he slaps her face (because she is mourning her late husband) and has sex with her. Of course he's doing that for her own good to help her get over her husband and get on with life! Even in 1973 if a man had slapped my face for mourning my deceased husband I would have kicked him in the genitals and walked away. What a jerk Cussler must have been to write that! There are other very disparaging comments about women in general but too many to go into details.Dirk Pitt is an egotistical, arrogant, moody, unlovable, unbelievable character. He is beat up, bleeding, exhausted to the max with no sleep and yet he goes on and on like Energizer Bunny. I finished this to see how bad it got. The story was good enough but too much garbage. Someone in that condition would know he shouldn't be diving.The other thing I dislike in books is the continual references to smoking that nothing to do with the story. In 248 pages there were 49 references to smoking. Only 1 related to the story itself. There would probably been more but with the action and impossible environments Cussler couldn't squeeze them in. Hard to smoke when you'r underwater or dressed for it.

This is the first Pitt Adventure I've read. I thoroughly enjoyed the simpler throw-back to a less complicated time. Unlike the one-legged, blond-haired, blue-eyed and complicated Latino- Juan Cabrillo, who relies on the stealthy high tech gadgetry on his state-of-the art vessel, Dirk Pitt is more like one of Captain America's army pals. So I found the Mediterranean Caper to be crisper, and cleaner- if somewhat slower. But it still maintained my interest from the first page until the very end. Some of the vivid- if somewhat stereotypical, characters in this book remind me of roles portrayed in the \\"The Love of Four Colonels,\\" a play by Peter Ustinov.

They thought it was extinct. Someone is sabotaging things. Dirk Pitt is assigned to help them. Some bad guys are nearby doing bad things.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I enjoyed the Lee Child books about Jack Reacher, and I thought this author might be similar. Although I've compared Jack to a comic book hero, I find Dirk is much more of a comic book hero than Jack. Dirk is a hero adventurer whose life is often in danger, but he always survives and outwits the bad guys. I've now read two Dirk Pitt books. I'm done. He just doesn't do it for me. I'm not sure why. Jack Reacher fascinates and entertains me but Dirk doesn't. The Dirk stories feel like action-adventure movies, not the kind of depth that I normally get from books.

The storyline and plot are inventive and believable, but Dirk Pitt actions and dialog are contrary to most other Clive Cussler novels. Case in point is his treatment of the Baron's daughter, which is crude and out of character.I checked the publication date and discovered it was 2004, several years ago. All though the book I felt as if the novel was written by someone other than Clive Cussler. Maybe it is that the main character has matured over the years."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"As a Clive Cussler fan and having Dirk Pitt as a hero this book was really good at showing some of Cussler's earlier writings and what Dirk Pitt was like back when he was younger."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"See my earlier comments.

I concur. I think I would have dismissed Cussler forthright. Sure, all of his stuff is contrived, but with a professionalism that is so much more irresistible.

Their only complaint against this book, is a scene where pitt basically tells a lady to move on with her life. Nothing wrong with that, should he have slapped her, no. But he was right in telling her that to waste all those grieving was destroying her, but of course none of that really matters. Since we know that she was really an agent, and trying to play Pitt. Since she didn't know if he was an assassin or not. Sent by her \\"Uncle\\", a former Nazi Ace who killed the real Bruno Von Till. Took his place, and now ran drugs, Interpol sent in an agent to pretend to be his niece. Pitt and Giordino must try to stop him. Pitt battling a viscious dog in the underground catacombs of Von Till's castle is scary enough. But Pitt does win in the end, and actually adds to his car collection. As the second book in the series, it's still abit rough. But it's not terrible by any means, you can actually see where Cussler started to settle on what makes Dirk Pitt. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"This is the first in the Dirk Pitt series for Clive Cussler and it was interesting to see the early formation of the character.

Dirk Pitt, the main character and lead for several other Cussler books, is a fun protagonist and certainly an engaging character. Mainly because of Pitt's likability, I am looking forward to checking out more of Cussler's works.Now, after all that, why only 3 stars? Well, quite simply, it just wasn't a great book, but on the other hand, it met my expectations. The Mediteranean Caper is a fun adventure story, but with a plot maybe a little too fantastic. The book starts off with a bang, but even that bang seems a little forced and unbelievable. And as the story progresses, the elements of realism get left in the dust. Not to mention, he spends so much time building up one character, and then super-casually reveals this huge twist that turns out to mean nothing to the story.I am absolutely not one who doesn't like to suspend belief when reading books or watching movies. James Bond is my favorite fictional character ever, so I am obviously a huge fan of stories that are \\"unbelievable.\\" But when I read Ian Fleming's books, I can appreciate that he is an expert writer. Never did I get that sense with Cussler, and hence it is a three-star book. It served as a great introduction to Cussler's books, but it isn't the same as Fleming, or the adventure novels of Alistair McLean."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Released only once in 1995, this book contains the first two published Dirk Pitt adventures. A limited number of this omnibus were printed then, making it very sought after today. Collectors will love this publication, as well as anyone who's wondered how it all started with Pitt and NUMA. \\"Iceberg\\" is my favorite of the two because the bad guys are eventually apprehended during a daring battle in The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at Disneyland. Cussler gave readers an entertaining backstage look at the Magic Kingdom-something the Walt Disney Company did not appreciate much. A number of copies of this book are available here on Amazon and elsewhere on the Internet. It's worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"A novel filled with adventure, excitement, and deeds of daring do, taking place sometime during the 20th century, in and around the Mediterranean. The story is described in the third person following dashing hero Dirk Pitt and loyal friend, Al Giordino as well as following the diabolical villains. It is a story filled with danger and action combined with amazing descriptions. Recommended age 14 and up for innuendoes and descriptions of violent events.This novel is not a simple read, but it is not cut and dry either. Cussler is and amazing author who has a gift for expressing description and emotion. Even though the story is told in third person, as a reader you get a real feel for the characters and become amerced in the story. The story is mostly centered on the charming Dirk Pitt, an unusual hero who always manages to land on his 1feet. Pitt is not a common hero, his features are attractive, but not quite movie star quality so he relies on his wit and people skills to help him \`get in the door' so to speak. From the first three pages I was lost in this book. Cussler does an amazing job setting up descriptions to make the reader feel like they are in those places and know those people. The quote \\"his large brown hands moved efficiently, pulling back on the control column and the plane aimed its flat snout at the sun\\", is a taste at some of the imagery and description used. I spent a majority of this book wanting to be there, wanting to be in the action. Cussler is truly a gifted writer who embraces his spirit of adventure."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Cussler just doesn't know how to disappoint his readers. If he has as much fun writing his books as I do reading them he must be in a perpetual good mood. This early novel of Pitt's adventures takes place (guess where?) in Europe on an island and it isn't long before Pitt, the human magnet for trouble stumbles upon quite an interesting situation. From getting strafed by an old bi-plane to finding an underground cavern complete with a submarine to getting lost in a maze and attacked by vicious dogs Cussler has given us a meaty tale to swallow, but one we are glad to digest because he makes us enjoy the ride. As usual good prevails and evil is punished, Pitt-style, and all in all this early outing for Dirk is as fun as almost anything in the Cussler library of adventure. Pick it up, climb aboard and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"This is my second Dirk Pitt book. This was a quick read with lots of action. As another person mentioned, you just don't go around slapping strangers and then make love to them in a matter of minutes. The ending was quick too. Pitt explains how he solved the mystery and the reader has to wonder when did he have the time to do all that?I have a question about the teaser so if you haven't read the book yet, turn away. :)How did Pitt capture the Teaser? He mentions oh by the way look behind this certain rock down below and you will find a surprise. It seems there is nothing that Pitt can't do.

This is the book that got me hooked on Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino. From the opening scene of Dirk engaging in battle with a WW1 aircraft to the final battle in an underground cavern it kept me enthralled enough to re read the book (at last count) ten times. I found the villans in this book about the best of all Cussler books. As is always the case the geography, scientific and mechanical information to be spot on. I found out that Al is missing a finger on his right hand and that Dirk was a gentler man in previous years. Mayday captured my imagination.

I originally purchased this audio cassette because I'm a fan of thereader, Bruce Greenwood. I have enjoyed Mr. Greenwood's work since &quot;St. Elsewhere.&quot; Whenhis most recent television series, &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; ended, I looked forward to the opportunity toexperience another one of his projects. I had no knowledge of Clive Cussler's work. Since I'musually not attracted to the detective genre, I didn't expect to receive much enjoyment from tnestory. Happily, I was wrong . Mr. Cussler's main character, Dirk Pitt, is a larger than lifesuperhero with romance and intrigue to spare. This isn't a criticism; if the popularity of a certainsecret agent is any indication, we like our heroes invincible. Mr. Cussler sets the stage with avery visual style of writing that forms word pictures for the reader. This coupled with the variedhost of characters, provides an expansive canvas for Bruce Greenwood's boundless talent forvoice and dialect. Mr. Greenwood can move from a British accent to a German accent and on toa woman's voice without a hitch. One is soon swept away by his magic and treated to a virtualtheater for the ears! (Being the avid Star Trek fan that I am, I can only hope that Simon &amp;Schuster will consider Mr. Greenwood for their Star Trek audio series.) The combined talents ofClive Cussler and Bruce Greenwood provide a powerful elixir for fun. I'm looking forward tofuture visits with Dirk Pitt.Rating 8Bonnie R.

I quit reading it when Dirk gets angry and gives a lady a hard backhand face slap for grieving too long for a husband that was killed. This isnt the Dirk I know or care to read about"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"My problem is that I'm a completist. This means that when I consider something worth getting into, I do it from the start, and I acquire everything related to it. In the case of fiction, I begin by reading an author's work chronologically. When I decided to get into Cussler, judging from generally good reviews and my fondness for thrillers, I started with his first book \\"Pacific Vortex!\\" and have just finished this one, \\"The Mediterranean Caper\\". I have come to realize rather quickly that Cussler could not have built his reputation with these early works, because they are quite dreadful. I'm hoping things get a lot better as I read through his subsequent efforts.This book is as bad as the one- and two-star reviews have made it out to be. But I read it with the same curiosity that one would watch a cheesy 'B' movie, and basically to witness the evolution of a great writer across the years. Onward then, to \\"Iceberg\\" and hopefully the writing improves steadily!"},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Very entertaining! My husband and I have been reading (and re-reading) Clive Cussler's novels for over 15 years. All his books contain lots of action and history. Yet, he is still able to connect all the loose ends. The hero Dirk Pitt is a man of honor and principles. He's a quick thinker with an adventurer's spirit."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"Dirk Pitt is a man's man. He is the ultimate machismo. He was the Hollywood action hero before there was such a thing. Pitt is the man described in the theme song for the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;. The type of hero that he is has been outdated, whether wrongly or not, in our more politically correct times. It's wrong to rescue a damsel in distress now. It's wrong to be ruthless when it comes to the feelings of others. Ours is an age when we tell the truth on one hand and gently coo &quot;I'm sorry for telling the truth&quot; with the other. Pitt is a throwback to old style pulp fiction heroes and I don't see anything wrong with that.The Mediterranean Caper is the first published novel starring Dirk Pitt. It opens with an attack on Brady Air Force Base, which is located on the Greek island of Thasos. Without warning a German bi-plane identical to those used in World War I strafes the airfield, causing much damage to the facility and its aircraft. By coencidence, Dirk Pitt and his best friend, Al Giordino are flying to the base and are able to win an air battle against the attacker. The wounded bi-plane manages to fly away and disappears into thin air and so begins the mystery.Dirk Pitt is the Special Projects Director for the US National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). What that really means is that he is a troubleshooter. When things are going wrong he is sent in to solve the problem. In this book he has been called in to investigate the sabotaging of a NUMA research ship called The First Attempt. The ship's mission is to locate and capture a fish that is considered a living fossil. Someone does not want this to happen and is sabotaging the ship's equipment. Dirk just happens to fly in as the seemingly unrelated plane attack on the base is going on.Shortly afterward, as he is lying on the beach, relaxing after all the excitement, he meets a beautiful woman named Teri. This sets up one of the more comical scenes that almost made me put down this book. As the woman warms up to Dirk she begins to reveal a little of her past. She has been in mourning for her dead husband for the better part of a decade. She starts to break down and cry. Dirk becomes so enraged by this that he slaps her across the face. I mean, he's only known for her about five minutes and he's slapping her across the face for showing weakness. Of course, instead of her running away, they make passionate love right there on the beach.It turns out that the girl's uncle is a German war veteran who basically runs the island through his business influence. Dirk is invited to dinner and the adventure really begins when he tries to ascertain whether the uncle is tied to the attack on the Air Force base. Dirk is promptly thrown into a labyrinth below his villa in pitch black dark with a ravenous dog tracking him through its depths. Will he survive to find out what the Mediterranean Caper is all about? Well, of course, there's 13 other Dirk Pitt novels. It's the getting there that's the point.Parts of the novel made me roll my eyes. Especially the slapping making love scene. Pitt tells her that her sadness is as worn out as an overcoat. There's really some cheesy metaphors and similes through the whole book. I really started to enjoy it as I realized that basically I was reading a comic book in novel form. I mean, the characters and the book were written for fun and adventure, not to spark epiphanies. The action scenes are really good and draw you in. The character depth is about that of a Dirty Harry movie, that is, practically nonexistent. At times Pitt seems very intelligent, at others very stupid. All in all, this was a fun book and I would recommend it. Hopefully, the second novel will be better."},{"Title":"The Mediterranean Caper (Dirk Pitt Adventure Ser.)","review":"My names Silje, from the age of nine I have read Mr. Cussler\`s books.

Those are my only two Cussler books I've read, but I'm hoping to give a few more a whirl to see how it matures. There is promise here, it's just clearly a very early start to a writing career.

The author has idolized Lincoln and criminalized all southerners and Steven Douglas in a way that is unbelievable. The author's constant referrals to the behavior of Lincoln as to be heroic and perfect at all times is difficult for a normal person to believe. She continually presumes to know Lincoln's thoughts from the earliest age about what he wanted to be when he was a man and how he felt about slavery though his actions did not correspond with these great feelings of outrage toward it. According to the author, though he abhorred slavery and wanted to see it end immediately he did not pursue this in the early years of his governmental service because the rest of the country was not ready for it and it would go against his greater motivation of keeping the great nation of America united. Another example of how ridiculously exaggerated are her accounts of his life is when she describes a speech so eloquent and moving that the press who were present dropped their pencils to listen, forgetting to write it down. And even Lincoln himself was hard pressed to recall his own speech so we have no record of this speech only that it was the most powerful one many ever heard. How utterly nonsensical. If I am a member of the press it would be my greatest ambition to record an awe inspiring speech; not sit there dumbfounded. If you want to read of Lincoln idolized this is the book for you. If you want the truth and an honest representation of all the events, I recommend you move on!"},{"Title":"Fisherman's Guide","review":"This book ranges from surreally esoteric, to painfully personal. It covers systems theory, personal journey, the Enneagram, business theory, and upward self-transcendance. The author had a H*LL of a ride, and tries to capture it and put it into words for our benefit. It may be a \\"noble failure\\" ( in the eyes of some, not mine!) but it's along the lines of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (both structurally and philosophically).I'd strongly suggest to anyone to buy a copy -- it's cheap, come on! -- and give it a try. It's really quite an acheivement"},{"Title":"Fisherman's Guide","review":"The amount of information this book encapsulates is astounding! The core of the work is about a spiritual experience of the author's that leads to a direct understanding of a transcendent pattern that permeates all of existence. This is then systematically applied to many diverse fields of knowledge to give you an idea of how it works and how you might apply it yourself.While it is written partly like a personal story, a fishing trip of sorts, it is interspersed with historical/societal commentaries and concise descriptions of quite a few of the predominately held scientific models underlying our understanding of reality. While some might find it a bit daunting, I found the manner in which it was written quite nice, poetic even. It is easy enough to understand if you take your time with it. The author's website (Google search: \\"Cosmic Mind Reach\\") also has a lot of material that might help you to grasp the meaning of what is trying to be delivered."},{"Title":"Fisherman's Guide","review":"The book is a well written literary dialogue that recounts an extraordinary insight into the cosmic order. The scope of the book is immense; in Part 2, a fantasy dialogue between the Sherlock Holmes of science and his trusting public Watson reviews the whole of science for the general reader. The parts about fishing in the Canadian wilderness provide continuity. They are liberally sprinkled throughout the book and are very illuminating in how they relate to the cosmic order. The way the cosmic order is illustrated is not easy to follow completely but one can nevertheless glimpse a new approach to understanding the natural order and the empirical evidence of science, as well as the revelation described. The book is quite a feat that will make the reader sit back and think. The author's novel The Hall of Two Truths is also available at Amazon. You can find his website on a Google search."},{"Title":"Fisherman's Guide","review":"This is a fascinating book, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.

It is here the favored triplets enact their star performance to a caroling chorus of chlorphyll. Triplets beckoned from the moisture of the soil are joined in wedlock with triplets coaxed in from the breeze. The parson comes from ninty million miles away.

After the pain of losing her brother and her two parents, in two separate tragedies, it seems that Ms. Ford could have discussed that some more. Also after what transpired between Ray Coleman and Amber twelve years before, it also seems unrealistic to think that they could have a successful relationship without some serious discussion and counseling.It is also not plausible that Amber Spencer has never been with anyone else for twelve years.Ray Coleman is an exciting character and for people who are interested in current events, Ms. Ford gives the reader some tidbits of information on what is happening in the Middle East.The secondary story line kept the book going on and ultimately makes the book worth reading.Kudos to Ms. Ford for her hot romance scenes.Borrow your friends copy of All the Love and buy some of Bette Ford's other books."},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"Betty Fords books After Dark and Forever After were fabulous and rate very highly on my best/favorite list I immediately bought copies of these two books for my best friend -I could not believe that All the Love was written by the same author -very weak plot line."},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"I was really skeptical when I set out to read this book because of the reviews that it received.

I beg to differ, it is just what I expect. I am a true fan of her writing and will continue to support her always! It was this book that highlighted the career of photojournalism which I felt was an interesting career. Ray Coleman, photojournalist comes home after an accident. Amber Spencer, director of a nursey school has a long history with Ray. This is like the story with unresolved love issues between Ray and Amber. So here, we have a book that deals with Ray and Amber's relationship both past and present, then we have the secondary story of a dangerous man on the loose who causes some serious problems. But the author, who manages to provide these two stories in a way, that makes it in my opinion a very good story to read. Now, I have said Ms. Ford is an author who can deliver those hot loving scenes, and of course she does it again in this book. So to my fellow readers, give this one a try, read it, its an easy read, not boring and very good.

Maybe this book was wrote before tracking devices(or All Star)and cell phone tower triangulations. Frustrating!"},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"Okay, so this book did not have all the qualifications for a Five in my book, but it did have Four Star quality. &quot;All the Love&quot; had a good storyline and the characters had great chemistry together but the book was lacking something. Bit I must said what Ford lacks in this book she makes up for it with the love scenes. Better luck next time!! Much love Ford!"},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"Although this was not typically as good as Ms. Ford has given us in the past, it's still worth adding to your collection of African American romances. The story was typical and easy to follow with enough suspense to keep you reading but the plot was somewhat of a rehash of other stories that have been written. Ms. Ford deserves the right to give us a typical story every now and again, but I do hope she gives us another story like &quot;After Dark&quot; real soon."},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"I liked this book, it as easy to read and entertaining to the end.. .The double plot always adds suspense to a book as well, very well written. If you liked this book, or want to read one that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!"},{"Title":"All the Love (Arabesque)","review":"This book was kind of lengthy, but I truly enjoyed it. Bette Ford can really write.

At last my search for great Southern humor is ended as long as Ed Williams keeps putting out this kind of quality writing. He is good ... very good! Guess I'm gonna change from Grizzard's Sprayberry BBQ to Ed's Nu Way hot dogs .... that ain't all bad 'cause Lewis did before he left us. Don't miss a real treat. Try Sex, Dead Dogs, &amp; Me for an antidote for the dreadfully dull political babble which we are about to experience for the next few months."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This book was as a gift from the most beautiful lady in Alabama and I want to thank her. This book was a great pressure reliever. I have not laughed so hard in a long time--actually brought tears to my eyes--it was GREAT!! Each Chapter is it's own little short story. My favorites were Stink Perfume, The Vapors, The Brotherhood, and Porno Movies. The way Ed tells each story puts you right there it is so easy to visualize the situation you are laughing right along with him. I actually felt like I was right there participating in the particle jokes. As a matter of fact the experiences Ed writes about are similar situation I've experienced. I found myself recalling some of my own similar experiences that added to my laughter. You don't have to be from Georgia to appreciate this book. Although Ed writes about things that happened to Ed in a small Georgia town but no matter where you live you can relate because of similar experiences. This is a very entertaining book to read. You too will find yourself laughing resulting in tears forming in your eyes too. Again thanks for the gift I love it!!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This book will make you piss your pants, you'll laugh that hard.

Defietly a must read! -Ryan"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Ed has a unique memory of youth... and so much of it coinsides with my own memories, at least the way I choose to remember.

Those who were lucky enough not to be targets for their hijinks can consider themselves very fortunate!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"I received my copy of Ed's Book on Christmas Eve by courier from Amazon.com and read it from cover to cover. I guess the best thing I can say about it, is that it is one of the few (if not only) funny books I've ever read that doesn't condemn, talk ugly about, criticize, and/or generally make fun of or portray attorneys as &quot;sharks.&quot; I re-read the book to make sure there were no negative comments about lawyers and that in and of itself makes the book priceless to me. One of the other things that Ed and I agree on is our choice of Georgia Tech being the best school in the world. My two favorite teams are Georgia Tech and whoever is playing Georgia. His chapter on Vasectomy (and especially about the doctor who performed it) is hilarious. It should be required reading for ALL men. I disagree with his assessment of cruise passengers - since I am an expert in that area with 19 prior cruises and on every one I took my husband. While I do not watch porno movies, I also must disagree with certain sexual positions he says are impossible because I have proof that they are not and could probably tell of others, he has never even imagined. You learn these things after being married to the same man for almost 30 years! I would recommend his book to anyone who needs a good laugh! I found myself laughing outloud on many occasions and I intend to buy more copies for friends. I also hereby affirmatively state that Ed did not pay me in any way to write all of these good things about his book!!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"I loved this book - laughed at points until I had tears in my eyes! The bad thing is, I have to hide it whenever one of the church workers comes into my office (due to the title). It is a great book, and the choir leader and holy water chapters have provoked considerable discussion around my dinner table. Ed Williams has the intestional fortitude to write about things that have gone on in small churches for years. He is a treasure, and I hope this book is the first of many to come from him."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Ed Williams has put down on paper for the consumption of the general public the shared experience of young men of our generation. The fact that he is reporting the events as they happened in a very small southern American town is really just an added wrinkle because the stories he tells are not that different from the stories any forty something north american guy would tell. He however has done it. My wife has not read this book and probably wouldn't enjoy it much and it would probably prompt her to shake her head and inquire..&quot;Are guys really like this??&quot; The answer is Yes. Ed has the guts to tell the tales that let everyone know that we: think about sex constantly, love to watch others humiliate themselves, will go to great lengths to get cheap laughs, think farting is always funny and rate professional sports just above world peace and total enlightment. Many of the vignettes had me laughing out loud. Ed's ingenuous writing style is crisp, conversational and compelling. Again let me say this piece of work will be enjoyed most by men born between 1955 and 1965, however given the right script treatment it could be a very funny and appealing film. sort of &quot;PORKY's&quot; meets &quot;DAZED AND CONFUSED&quot; meets &quot;FRIED GREEN TOMATOES.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend at the university. I had a hard time finding it in the bookstores, so I ordered it here. I have never laughed as hard in my life (my roommate threatened to make me leave our room, then she read it and laughed more than I did). Ed, should you ever come to Oxford, let me know. Maybe we could do something that might inspire a chapter in one of your future books, you southern devil, you!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"After having read the reviews and and tuning into GPR's interview with the author I couldn't wait to get my copy of &quot;Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me&quot;. I even sent a gift copy to my son. Unfortunately, the book wasn't worth the wait. I waited patiently for the belly laughing humor I was sure this book contained and all I received for my patience was a few chuckles.Not only was they hype much better than the book but I found the editing (if there was any) to be very poor. As a reader I find it very frustrating to try and guess which word the author intended to use in a given sentence. This book was worse than a small town weekly newspaper for errors. In addition, I found the author's over use of asides and paragraph numbering to be even more frustrating.Mr. Williams shows potential as a southern humorist but this book obviously went to print way too soon. I wish I had saved my money."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"I detect vast experience in the fine art of story fabricating might be a talent the author uses freely.

Balboa (online) is a good ole boy read reminiscent of Lewis Grizzard's down home stories. Add his book to your list of &quot;must haves!&quot; You'll laugh at the chapter about his vasectomy. (Not usually a hilarious incident, is it?) You'll savor his love for his family and come away impressed by the values he holds dear. Plus, you'll learn all about the Brotherhood - and why the members of B.T.O. were destined to become full-fledged members. Some of you may recall that Juliette, Georgia is the setting for Fanny Flagg's Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. Ed Williams puts that town on the map again. Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me - The Juliette Journals has lots of the same Southern charm, with his own special mixture of warmth and humor added as well."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"The stories touch a part of me in the way that brings back memories of yesterdays. It succeeds in making experiences of common life an art form. They made me laugh and cry - because, I could relate to similar experiences, long forgotten.While entertaining with an individual style of story-telling, the author tugs the heartstrings of the reader - nudging a bit of nostalgia of family, friends and of experiences of one's own. He opens a doorway that allows us to realize that each experience in life can become a cherished memory.This humorous look at the experiences of a small-town southern boy makes y'all wonder what serious thoughts lie below the surface of the written word."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This is the funniest book i've had the pleasure to read since Pat McManus's &quot;The Grasshopper Trap&quot;"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Lot of laughs.

You might want to read the book by yourself, since you will be laughing very hard and someone nearby might look at you strangely because you're laughing so hard. Great southern humor."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Ed said it himself, this is no Sunday School book. But it is arare glimpse into the life of a young man growing up in small town, GA. and his thoughts, escapades, and encounters as he relates one hilarious adventure after another. Not for the prudish-of-mind, Ed's honest storytelling gives a rare glimpse into the thought processes of the adolescent/teen/college male and his primary preoccupation -- sex. As a female reader, I must say this was enlightening! Brace yourself, folks, for this personal, no-holds-barred account"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Want to laugh 'til your sides hurt? Buy SEX, DEAD DOGS, AND ME. Who would've thought that stink perfume, vasectomies, or catching a choir leader with his pants down could be so funny?The author, Ed Williams, may claim to be just a simple country boy from Juliette (of FRIED GREEN TOMATOES fame), but it takes a talented writer/storyteller with a naturally flowing gift of humor to turn what most of us would see as mundane or even disturbing and twist it into a series of humorous, can't-wait-to-tell-your-friends-about-THAT-one stories. It'll make you want to join the Brotherhood, impersonate Elvis, and think about your best and worst kisses.Williams is also a brave soul. He is one of the few writers out there with courage enough to tell it like it REALLY is, even if it means revealing a somewhat warty side of himself.SEX, DEAD DOGS, AND ME is refreshing in its honesty, filled with country wisdom, brave in its revelations, and, a-ah...forget the high brow, it's ! just a fun read. Trust me.Oh, yeah. And do you know a guy who doesn't like to read? This book could turn him around and remind him of how much fun it can be. (Good gift idea, huh?!)Williams thinks BTO ROCKS, well, that may be, but I think ED ROCKS. Can't wait for the sequel."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"I have read many Southern humorist books, and this one fits right in there with the best. These episodes of Ed Williams' life reminds me of the times I spend listening to guys and gals, young and old, telling their life experiences. If you enjoy sitting down after a great meal with friends, and reminiscing about the good-old-days, the funny-old-days, even if those good, funny old days were last week, then this book is for you. It is definitely a page turner."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Although this book has been out awhile, I was just recently made aware of it through the author's newspaper columns. It is hysterically funny, I laughed so hard at points that I had to put the book down. The best thing is, he has a new one coming out soon. Prepare yourselves to read something from Georgia's next great humorist."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This book proves that fiction is never as funny as true life stories. Small towns can really be exciting. Fried Green Tomatoes has nothing on the true stories of the real residents of Juliette Georgia!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"If you like to laugh, then you need to read \\"Sex, Dead Dogs and Me\\". The author writes with such charm and unique sense of humor you can't help but laugh till it hurts and tears roll down your face. The old saying \\"laughter is good medicine\\", well if that is true, then Ed Williams should be referred to as Dr. Ed Williams, as he tells you stories of his life that will touch you in a way that can only be good for you as well as educational from his perspective of course! And along the way you get to know him so well that you could swear that you had known him forever. You'll see Ed as a sweet mischievous boy, loyal friend, co-worker, caring husband and loving parent.I highly recommend you read any book by Ed Williams, you will feel better!"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"Ed Williams has a God given talent with the written word. I'm reading his books out of order. I first read his most recent \\"ChristmaSin\\", then this one, his first, and will finish up with, his second book, \\"Rough As A Cob\\". This collection of short stories had me laughing out loud at each one. I laughed so hard I had tears streaming down my face while reading \\"Catching the Choir Leader With His Pants Down\\". No one can tell a tale as Ed can. I felt like I was there at each one of his antics, cheering him on. He writes with a combination of his very own unique personal style, his intelligence, his Southern charm, and his inimitable wit. His writing makes me feel as if he is speaking to me while we are sitting across the table from one another enjoying adult beverages.While funny and entertaining, his writing also lends itself to a more serious and gentle side. That is the love he has for his family. He writes of them in such a way that is very obvious to the reader the love he has for them and justifiably so. Each member sounds like a person I would be proud to know, be friends with, and be related to.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humour who likes to read. You won't be disappointed in the least. If I enjoy a book, I re-read it again. I know that I will be re-reading all of Ed's books many, many times in the years to come."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"I laughed until my sides hurt. Sex, Dead Dogs, And Me is thick with outstanding humor. It has it all. Ed writes about extremely funny stories from his youth such as good and bad kisses, workman's compensation for jock itch, the vapors, and the adultery business. If you love to laugh, you'll want this book for your collection. You get a truly all encompassing, across the board variety of wit.My favorite is Ed's classic tale of stink perfume. It reminds me of my own prank-filled youth. I have read a lot of humorous books, and this ranks among the very best. Ed's writing style brings the stories to life. It was easy to visualize the characters and get attached to them. Fresh, entertaining and comical, I highly recommend it.I will have to make one correction however. A Canadian girl's lips kiss better. Perhaps one day Ed will get to test that theory.Linda Oness"},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This is a wonderfully fun, heartwarming and irreverent look at life &quot;down under.&quot; Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Sex, Dead Dogs, and Me : The Paperback!","review":"This has got to be the funniest book I have ever read. I can't believe anyone could read this book without laughing their head off! I made the mistake of taking this book with me to the doctor's office to read while I waited. Now, after reading the first two chapters at home, I should have known it would be impossible for me to read the stories and just snicker quietly. Totally absorbed in the stories and laughing like crazy, I looked up to find everyone in the waiting room staring at me as I though I had lost my mind. Ed's book is a wonderful reminder of those carefree &quot;good old days&quot; when we truly enjoyed life. He tells his stories in a way that makes you feel as though you are actually there taking part in, and enjoying those crazy stunts and escapades as much as he did!

It's a great starting point in what to teach for each subject. I have found it to be essential in our homeschool and use it as a base for teaching and a resource to expound upon. My children love it."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I kind of liked \\"what your preschooler needs to know\\" because it seemed fun and upbeat and had lots of neat stories for kids. I don't like the kindergarten version at all. It's not fun. It's not upbeat. It's drudgery. I bought it as a homeschooler to see what public schoolers were learning...but I wish I hadn't."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"If a school doesn't address the information in the books or provide a simple way for a child to learn it, it isnt' doing it's job. Period.I dont' believe that this curriculum provides anything that a school can't provide with other, better educational methods. The example of why this by-rote schedule is necessary is ludicrous. They offer a classroom of children beginning to learn about world exploration and Magellan. The children are asked to trace a route on a globe from Europe to North America, but some can't because they &quot;didn't do that last year in Mrs. Jones' class&quot;, others in &quot;Mr. Peach's class did that last year&quot; and the children who just moved in from another school &quot;did Magellan last year&quot;. I would be surprised if any child with basic map literacy couldnt' find a route on a globe, and for the children who did that last year, they should be able to offer different, possibly more complex views on the subject.Any child exposed to a library or even a small home book collection should be able to have the &quot;cultural literacy&quot; base this curriculum would like to provide. The cultural background presented in this book is weak, without any discussion of where these fairy tales and nursery rhymes came from. No child needs to learn &quot;Jack Horner&quot;, etc. in school. If it is taught, it should be at a level where the child will learn the origins of these things, and maybe learn to act them out.The history portion was severely limited. Most children will pick up the very basic elements of what was offered just by looking at and asking about the presidents on our money.Math is very weak. Again, talking with your child and reading a few basic books would teach everything offered here.I explored several &quot;focus&quot; schools in my district for my daughter. After looking into Core Knowledge, we named it &quot;American Myths and Legends&quot; and rejected it for our child as too rigid, without an ability to meet the needs of specific children. In some districts, a core knowledge school may work as a selection factor, if it is one of the only choices available. Parents who care about their children's education may send their children to the available magnet school, so the school may well be populated with families who care about education. It doesnt' work that way in practice in all districts though.One thing to keep in mind is that this curriculum was established by concensus. Therefore, anything viewed as &quot;radical&quot; or outside of the mainstream would not have passed the review committees. I think they probably lost a lot of value due to the process.If you are starting a new school in your district or looking to homeschool a child to make sure she loves learning, look into William Glasser's &quot;Quality School&quot;. We create community and love of learning and manage to score at 100% on statewide tests. We love our school."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I have 6 children, and we are homeschoolers, so I am always looking for good resource materials.This series is good in a lot of ways.It stresses the old classics, more from a cultural literacy standpoint than anything else. You want your children to understand references to literature. You want your children to know what others are talking about when they refer to a mythological figure.These books not only provide the parent with a few basic stories, but they also put it in the mind of the parent that these things are important for the child to come into contact with.The social studies are nice and simple, with little maps and nice little pictures. For my children, I develop checksheets to go along with them -- they read a section in the book, then they draw a picture relating to it, or look at a globe and point out the place under discussion, or create an animal from that part of the world in clay -- something involving DOINGness, instead of just READING. They really love this and it makes the material stick in their minds that way.I make a checklist out of the math section, to verify that the kids are up to speed.Overall, I think these are valuable books, and well worth having. I would warn parents to watch for the vocabulary used in the literature -- kids will get confused if many of the words are not defined for them - the literacy level is pretty high per each grade level."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I think this is a fine book. I bought it expecting a list of things that my child should know prior to entering Kindergarten. Instead what I got was a book that I could use to teach my child. Excellent!I think it would be better with a comprehensive list of expectations and/or goals that every child should reach by the time they are through with Kindergarten. That is the teacher in my coming out.I found that the social studies section was amazing. I didn't realize that kindergarten children could comprehend so much.Word of Warning: This is ONLY the very basics that a child should be able to learn. This is NOT the be all end all of a kindergarten curriculum to use for homeschooling. However, it can be used as a place to jump start your learning. You will need to add more literature and poetry and math activities. However, it's a well rounded, full of information, useful book."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"The Book \\"What Your Kindergartener Need To Know is a great book to use to get your child started in learning. Even if you didn't get your hands on it before Kindergarten it is a good review and will help you to see if you child has suffered any \\"gaps\\" in their knowledge to date.Since different states and school systems have different opinions as to what a child should know at what age, this book may not necessarily cover what your child has or is about to learn in your local school. From my analysis, the book covers more information from a cultural awareness perspective. This means that is basically is filled with things your child should have been exposed to by this point. They may not KNOW these things or be able to recite everything from this book, but they should have some awareness or have had some exposure to it at this point.When my children and I received this book, our first Core Knowledge book by Hirsh, we went through the books table of contents page with a pencil and marked off everything they knew. My children are in the 3rd and 1st grade, and the 1st grader \\"KNEW\\" much more of the items, which to me means she remembered more items since she had been exposed to them more recently. Although the word KINDERGARTEN was written boldly across the front, they took great joy in my reading the fables and testing them on the geography and math question at bedtime.I purchase these books in anticipation of beginning homeschooling, but we could not wait to get started on this series. I recommend this and the other books in this set to anyone considering homeschooling or even school-schooling. It is great fun to interact with your children and amazing to find out what they actually know.Contents include, but are not limited to:Teaching your child to read and writeIntroduction to literatureNursery rhymes, poems, and Aesop's FablesChildren's Stories like Three Billy Goats GruffSimple history and geography, especially AmericanVisual arts and musicMath and math readinessScience including plants, weather, animals, and the human body, all at a \\"Kindergarteners Level\\""},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I was really glad to share this book with my child. It gave me a million rainy day ideas. Great for the preschooler! I loved the way it incorporated classic tales, nursery rhymes, mathematic basics, geography and scientific information in a way that is both simple and exciting. The activities are really enriching and interesting to the child. Every parent should own a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"When I bought this book, I expected to see more of a checklist of what my child needed to know for Kindergarten and what my child would learn in Kindergarten. As a former Kindergarten teacher, I have an idea of what is needed, but I wanted it in writing. What I got was different, but not bad.This book is devided into sections: reading, writing, art, etc.There are whole stories, poems, songs, and lessons for a kindergartener. While I don't expect that it will be enough for teaching a whole year of Kindergarten at home, I think it will be a great start. The emphasis is placed on reading (rightly so I think). I would like to see more in the math section though. I find that the art section is lacking, while the Social Studies section has much more than I would expect a Kindergartener to know. I hope I'm pleasantly suprised in that area.For information purpose it is not in a themematic form. It does cover many of the things that you would expect to see in a classical education (artists, authors, paintings etc). But it is lacking if you want a fully classical education.While there a few resources, there are not near as many as I would like to see. I'd also like to see a comprehensive, overall list of what a child is expected to know before and after Kindergarten.While it seems that I have discussed many of the points I see that need improvement, I think this book is great. It is probably the most comprehensive one book you can find for helping your child in Kindergarten. This would be a great start for homeschooling parents who don't want to spend a lot of money. It is a great book for parents who want to help their child learn prior to and during kindergarten but aren't really sure what to do.I would buy this book. Just be aware of the limitations and be prepared to suppliment those areas."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"The book is full of a lot of information. I'm using &quot;What Your Kindergartener Needs to Know&quot; as the base book for homeschooling my daughter. Not only are there many recommendations but, there are complete stories and songs in the book to allow you to teach without having to purchase other books. There is more information in the book than I thought my daughter could comprehend. But, I offer some of the information to her and she understands and wants more. If you want to know what your child should be learning or want an excellent book for a base for homeschooling, I highly recommend &quot;What Your Kindergartener Needs to Know&quot;."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I am a firm believer in the Core Knowledge Sequence. I love the way this book tells what they should be learning and provides information that you can teach directly from the book. It also arranges concepts in a specific order to facilitate learning.As a part-time homeschooling mom, I find it amazing how much my son's private school education is lacking. If it were not for my supplementing his education with the Core Knowledge Sequence, he would not be learning much beyond reading and math. This book is great at helping you fill in the gaps in your child's education. I feel that it goes way beyond the basics that most children are receiving in public and private schools. It has opened my eyes to how much you really can introduce to a kindergartener. This book will help you give your child a strong foundation for future learning. I plan to full-time homeschool my son for first grade using the Core Knowledge Sequence. BTW, they have a great website...."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"...... This is the type of educational guide I had been looking for!...... As a busy mom &amp; entrepreneur, I don't desire to homeschool my kids presently, but want to be an active leader and main influence in their education. This series gives me well-rounded view of topics, learning skills and levels for me to present and work on with my children, in additional to their public school and private preschool education...... My preschooler, age 4, has particularly benefitted from, for example, reading additional stories about some of our presidents when he made &quot;Washington&quot; and &quot;Lincoln&quot; related art at preschool. We've also used many of the math sorting/classifying/counting/identifying shapes skills as a normal, integrated part of his day as he plays.. Overall, I view this series as a springboard for us as a family to concentrate on topics, skills, stories, etc., as the kids need them or are interested in them. We've already pulled out my grandmother's 1960 encyclopedias to look up more about a topic; searched the internet about another topic; got engrossed as a family in one of the science experiments; and checked out a library book about one of the stories they have included in an abridged form...... I would love to also see a related workbook for this series."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This book is great if you homeschool or want to help your child during the summer. If you want to use it for homeschool, Hirsch has made a teacher handbook. The Teacher Handbooks provide background about language arts, history and geography, visual arts, music, mathematics, and science. Each handbook has been written to look like the Core Knowledge Sequence. For each section in the Sequence, there is a matching section in the handbooks."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"Like a recent reviewer who gave this book only two stars, I was shocked when I opened it and found that the first 100 pages or so consist almost entirely of poems, stories, and sayings. Because my 5-year-old loves the stories and songs (even the ones she is already familiar with), I'm giving this book four stars instead of three.The intent of the book is primarily to provide basic material that the parent must apply. The editors state in the introduction that this is neither a textbook nor a workbook. Unfortunately, that explanation isn't given in any of the promotional material one sees.The longest story (Snow White) is 7 pages and most are under 5 pages. Each has at least one picture, but some are only drawn in black and white. Most of the poems have drawings, too. Because some of the sayings are no longer in use, I get the impression that the designers of this curriculum are aiming to preserve mainstream 1950s culture. However, the literature section does include Japanese, African, and Amerindian tales.Like another reviewer, I was pleasantly surprised to see my daughter fascinated by the geography section, which has maps of continents with their animals drawn in. I thought the art section was challenging, because it mentions warm and cool colors, and offers guidelines for teaching a child how to analyze and compare paintings. The math section is also good, covering a wide range of topics from very easy to difficult.The presentation of the settling of the New World is the main theme of the history section. This is a complex topic that was handled broadly (including several pages about Amerindian culture and slavery) but not deeply. It seems too ambitious to focus on the country's origins at age 5, but I admit that I'm not sure what would be better.There's a good description of the Mayflower's journey from the viewpoint of a child, but one doesn't get a clear sense of why people made the long voyage. The British king is described as nothing more than a boss. The discussion of our flag is also dumbed down, with extraneous emotionalism like \\"glorious sight\\" but no explanation of its symbolism (\\"What do the stars mean, Daddy?\\").There are a few other flaws in this book. The photo of the earth on page 117 has north at the left and south at the right. This is understandable given the outer space perspective, but the layout artist mistakenly used a mirror image that puts Madagascar west of Africa! The brief discussion of the spice trade mistakenly includes Japan and omits Indonesia. And the story of George Washington cutting down a cherry tree is, well, a lie. Perpetuating such a legend seems pointless, particularly because fantasy reinforces the modern tendency to see history as mere opinion.For kids like mine who are growing up where they have minimal contact with fellow Americans, cultural literacy is a great orientation. The book has lots of poems and songs that they have not become acquainted with from watching videos or Nick Jr. I heartily recommend this book to anyone in a similar situation; it is certainly worthwhile."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I love this series of books and recommend them to all parents. I use them to review concepts with my own children to ensure that they have the basic understand of concepts needed for their grade level. I often review with them over the summer. In addition, it has many things that are overlooked during the school day as a teacher only has so much time. I particularly appreciate the fine arts, cultural literacy, and geography sections of these books. This book is not a complete curriculum but rather an overview of the minimum amount of knowledge your child should have at each grade level."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"My daughter is home schooled, and this was a great help to me for figuring out roughly where she should be at this age.

I'm using this along with a few other sources to teach him. It covers several subjects and has exercises to do with him. If you are homeschooling or just want to cover some things at home to suppliment kindergarten, it's a really nice little resource and it also includes other resources to go along with each subject that you can order separate. My son really likes the stories in it and I've read many of those over and over. It includes many familiar nursery rhymes and stories, such as The 3 little pigs, Snow White, Cinderella, etc. It also has a geography and history section, music and art. It also has reading and writing instruction, but we had already covered this with various workbooks. It's a nice one to have for educating your child and I will continue to pick these up to go along with his other grades as he grows."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"Dr. Hirsch has grabbed the essence of knowledge and put it in a \\"Walmart bag of practical use for us.

Thanks so much will order again from you!"},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I read to my child every night. I have done this since he was days old. We have a boatload of books. He is almost 4 and I noticed he pays more attention when I read books with stories. I am sick of \\"Are you my mother?\\" and anything to do with Horton.I was attracted to this book because it was filled with interesting, well known stories. I thought the lack of color pictures would be a problem, but it turned out to be irrelevant. He loves listening to the stories. He even tries to repeat them back to me.Unlike other's, I like that these are the classic versions of the stories. These original versions don't always have the moral point infused into modern versions. They also can talk about death. However, this gives me the opportunity to have intelligent conversations with my child regarding tough topics.Let me give you an example with the 3 little pigs. In the classic version, the brick pig only uses bricks because that is what he finds, which is the same with stick and straw pig. The moral of him working harder to get a better house is not in this version. In this version, stick and straw pig get eaten by the wolf. The wolf gets boiled in a pot of water.So after we read the story as-is, we had a discussion about it. My 3yo really enjoyed the interaction.At this point, we are doing 1 story, 1 fable or poem, and 1 math, science or spelling thing out of the book each day. I have been very happy with the results."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This is a great book for teaching all the things you remember learning as a child that is often left out of the current curriculum in today's schools.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I really apreciated a text that had all the different subject ares for my little four year old son in one book.

We were in Germany this summer and had a chance to visit Bremen where we were introduce to the local foke tale \\" The Bremen street musicians\\" I purchased the book in german and my friend transulated it for us.

I will definately purchase the nxt level."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"My children are 3 years and 20 months. This book has provided numerous, fun, learning opportunities for them. My redheaded 3 year old had a fun time when we discussed the section about Thomas Jefferson. She was thrilled to learn that he loved books (just as she does) and that he also had red hair just like her. The format of this book is great. It is divided into subjects that make it very easy for a parent to use with their children. Even though my children are young, they are still gleaning knowledge from this book when I use it in conjunction with \\"What Your Preschooler Needs To Know\\". I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"Once I got past the fact that they spell 'kindergartner' differently than I would (and yes, I even checked dictionary.com to verify their way was correct, lol!), I set about examining the book itself.The series focuses on defining the least common denominator of what children absolutely must learn before moving on to a higher grade, and I'm very grateful for some level of guidance. I'm a (newbie) homeschooler, and I could not for the life of me find any kind of reference to tell me what skills are the most important to learn at the kindergarten level. With this book, I finally did.This book not only tells me the essentials of what should be covered, but also ways to teach them and gives references to other books that I can use to do it. As so many before me have said, the curriculum included is not all your children are expected to learn in kindergarten. However, it provides a solid place to start.The introduction is excellent and helps the reader understand that when our children are being educated, there needs to be a common ground--things that all children need to learn before moving on to the next grade level. Having moved at the end of 2nd grade, I know all too well what it's like to be bored out of your skull in class as your teacher covers things you already learned eons ago. And if a kid from my new school had moved to my old school, imagine the stress of suddenly being expected to know things you've never been exposed to!One comment of this book really got me. The parent who felt she'd scarred her child for life by reading Casey Jones to him really made me shake my head. A responsible parent will read a story he or she is planning on with a child in advance, to make sure that you want to and are ready to discuss anything that the story might bring up. Don't blame the book; blame yourself for not doing your homework. It took me less than 2 minutes to read the Casey Jones story, which I did based on that review. It was the story of a brave man who sacrificed his life to save the lives of many, much like another story I expose my children to all the time."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I bought this on a whim not really know what to expect, and I was BLOWN away by how comprehensive and complete this book is!

I am in LOVE!"},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"As an anxious parent of a 4yo getting ready to go to kindergarten, I found this book to be extremely valuable. First, it put all my fears to rest and let me know that I was already on the right path in preparing him. It approaches subjects like Science, History and Geography that I hadn't considered, and finally it contains quite a bit of short stories that can be used for bedtime reading which my son loves. This is a solid book for anyone wanting to help their little one with prep for school."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This is an excellent book that describes what the Core Knowledge curriculum covers in kindergarten. This curriculum is only supposed to supplement up to 50% of a school's whole curriculum but it is the part that most schools are missing these days. My daughter attends a school that teaches the material covered in this book and she's learning the continents, all about Christopher Columbus, simple fractions and she's collecting data and graphing it in math class. These are the things that the Core Knowledge Curriculum adds to a Kindergartener's knowledge bank. There are some Core Knowledge schools throughout the US but we need more."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This book would have received five stars from me but for the lack of bright pictures. There's no denying that pictures really help engage young kids so for the kindergartener to second grader titles at least, the publishers could have considered using larger images and more colors. But all that aside, this series is a great comfort because it helps seal whatever \\"gaps\\" I feel may be in our homeschooling curriculum. I like the way they include not only stories and fables but also ideas on teaching math and necessary info on science, history etc. I also use the series to back up lessons. For instance, I read my son the King Midas story and compared it with another version of King Midas in another book to explain how different authors tackle stories differently. It also gives me ideas for lesson plans and it helps wrap up our day when I either read it to my son or he reads it independently as a bedtime storybook. Altogether a great multi-tasking series."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This is a well-written, easy to read synopsis of our educational system in the U.S. The thrust of this series is to try and build consistency for all student throughout the U.S. and as such, this book outlines what a kindergarten curriculum should include. It is not meant to be exhaustive in itself, but a reference and starting point for both schools and homeschoolers. There are sections from all subjects, the illustrations are interesting to our kids (4 and 5) and they have enjoyed reading and learning directly from this book. If you're interested in education and want something to get started, this is a great tool."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I highly recommend this book. It has most everything a child would need to know to move on to first grade.However, something is necessary to make this complete. It needs a companion workbook, or at least a better question and answer review or synopsis at the end of each section. Having one or the other would greatly enhance a child's education.One tip I did discover the hard way -- definitely buy the paperback and NOT the Kindle version. We did start with the Kindle, but having the hard copy makes a world of difference for highlighting, taking notes, and reviewing chapters. Plus a 'Good' to 'Like New' one is cheaper than the eversion."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I purchase this book over 9 years ago when my son was in Kindergarten. Being a new mother, this book was a great resource of information. Now that I have a 5 year old daughter in Kindergarten, I purchased it again and am glad I did! I had forgotten all the subjects a child should be introduced to at this age. It is a wonderful supplement to my daughter's education and she loves the fables that are not covered at her school. I like the suggestions given (especially in History and Art)and being able to make sure that all the subjects that are not covered at school, I can teach her myself. Wonderful purchase!!Encourage every parent to invest in this book series."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I use this book for my kids as a preschool guide and it's a fabulous place to start. This book is great for ages three to five and perhaps a bit beyond. If you have a vast library at home the first section will be a lot of review. The book is specific enough to spark young mind's interest in a subject but general enough to leave room for self/parent-guided research. The English and math portions are more of what I'd think of as early pre-school level but the history, geography and social sciences areas seem to be spot on for PK and K. I loan it out to friends all the time and highly recommend it for homeschoolers and group schoolers alike."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"My 4 and 5 year olds love this book.

Bennett, Jr., Chester E. Finn, Jr., John T. E. Cribb is a book that summarizes the phases of a child's life from birth to eight grade. It is an excellent resource and works well hand-in-hand with the Core Knowledge Series. Bennett does quote E.D. Hirsch Jr in his book on several occassions.I home schooled my four children and now teach for a Classical/Christian School. I encourage all of my parents to own a personal copy of Bennett's book.

I was appalled when I read my 4 year old, the story of Casey Jones (p.105). The story was boring, and ended with Casey be killed in a horrific train crash. It goes on to explain how he was found, with his hands still on the throttle and brake. I guess I should have read it to myself first, but my son was so excited when he saw the picture of the train. YOu can only imagine the look of horror on our faces, by the end of this story. The rest of the book is FILLED with talk of violence and killing. In the story of Snow White, the queen says,&quot;Put her to death, and bring me her heart to prove that you have done it. In The Three Billy Goats Gruff, it talks of violently beating up the troll, and pushing him over the bridge to his death. In the 3 Little Pigs, the wolf DIES in boiling water. I could site many more examples. If the authors really think these stories MUST be included in this book, why don't they find more humane versions. So, thank you Mr. Hirsch, and Mr. Holdren, for forcing me to talk to my son about violent and gruesome things. These are definitely not things Kindergartners Need to Know!!!"},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"The book was listed as \\"like new\\" condition, and it was only in \\"good\\" condition.

But nothing that i couldn't find in another book about history etc.I mostly did not like all the \\"classic\\" stories and poems. I grew up with many of these stories and KNOW my parents and grandparents told them in a much less violent way. I will be returning this book for sure.If you don't want to tell your child stories about death, violence and hitting then don't waste your time on this book. I know they will learn this at some point....but let them be children for the short time they are innocent.Good luck!"},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This book has a lot of basic information that Kindergartener's sometimes learn in public school. Having been a public school student and knowing kids in public school now, I think this would be very beneficial to any parent of a 5 or 6 year old. Most public schools, and many private schools, do not cover all this information.It is also a useful starting point for homeschooling. You can probably make a years curriculum expanding on the information found here. We use it for our children as a supplement to our regular school work. They really enjoy it because the lessons are very short and interesting.At $10, if you use this in conjunction with your library and the Internet, you'll have a rather inexpensive homeschool curriculum."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I feel very helped by all the stories and activities in the book. Fables, Fairytales, Sayings and their meanings, Math, Science, Geography and more are being discussed in a language for the adult to teach their child in a way that only a parent can \\"translate\\" for their own child. It helps defending oneself from \\"dumbed down\\" school curricula. My only suggestion: the book would be perfect if there were activities to help comprehension of the mostly text fairytales. For instance a little craft project that involves acting out a part in a story to emphasize the moral/meaning/concept of a story."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"I homeschool my 5 year old and all over the internet you read about how great these books are. Well, I just finished reading through this and I thought it would give me some good ideas about what my child should know by the end of our Kindergarten year, but instead it mostly gave me activities to do with my child and short stories to read. It all felt like a big helping of page fillers. The title should be \\"Activities to do with your Kindergartener\\" as that is mostly what this is.If you WANT to use this as a curriculm it is still very weak and you'd be done with it in a few weeks tops with your child. It's not even good as a guideline and even states in the short introduction of math that \\"The activities listed here are supllemental ways for parents to reinforce their children's learning at home. They are not suffecient for teaching math in school.\\"But it gets worse because half of the activities are just short stories (lots of well known ones from Snow White to Goldilocks and the Three Bears). There's also pages of nursery rhymes/songs. It felt like a literature workbook without problems to solve in a large part of the book. I don't need to read stories from this book to my child when we can just read those same stories in better versions from real books we own or from the library. This would help people who never read to their kids, but I doubt those people are the ones reading this book. I agree with the reviewer who wrote \\"What Kindergartener needs to know Jack Horner?\\"Then it gets worse (yes, again) because it gives segments to read to your child to teach them about geography or history. Instead of reading the short, bland descriptions this book gives you, you'd be far better off to get a book from the library about the topic or do a hands-on activity.The introduction and the first few pages about teaching reading are the only parts worth reading, then it goes into \\"activities to do with your child\\" mode. I wanted a book that would outline basics that should be taught in various subjects among different learning levels/styles of Kindergarteners, that I could use as a guideline. This isn't it."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This book is a must have!

The insights and revelations his book yielded paid huge dividends for me. I have read the stories to my kindergarteners, used the math activities, and have profited from the advice on what constitutes a strong school. The beginning of the book should be read and reread by all educators and parents, for it provides some sobering reasons for why our nation's school system is in trouble. It also gives commonsense information on what we can do to make our schools stronger. E. D. Hirsch is the pioneer of the Core Curriculum, which I believe can save education in America.

It seems to have been written more for folks with kids in public school to fill in any gaps; I'm using it from a homeschooler's perspective. It has served its purpose. I don't plan to use the remaining Core Knowledge Series books because I want to pursue a classical education for my kids, but I would recommend this book to those who are as timid as I was starting out with homeschooling and who haven't yet settled on a specific curriculum or direction."},{"Title":"What Your Kindergartner Needs to Know: Preparing Your Child for a Lifetime of Learning (Core Knowledge)","review":"This is the stuff we want our children to know!

I too was upset about the &quot;roughness&quot; in the stories. What I did was read it first and changed it to the way I felt was appropriate. Otherwise, I would find the same story but written without the violence in detail.I plan on buying the rest of the &quot;grades&quot; because I have benefitted from the detailed curriculum guidelines.

However, she was so excited that we have already begun reading the book. I love that you and your child can sit together and read through this book. It does have a few sections here and there that are just for the parent, but the majority of the book is for both of you. The poems and stories at the beginning of the book were all familiar to her already, but she enjoyed hearing them again. This week we climbed a tall ladder and took a rocket ship to the moon to learn about the earth, continents and oceans. Now we are learning about each continent individually.

Despite the title, the book concentrates completely on the American ships. But, it is a VERY enjoyable book nonetheless. As one might expect, the book covers all the major events of the period, including the destruction of the Maine, the Battle of Santiago, the cruise of the Great White Fleet, the fleet actions in World Wars One and Two, Korea, Vietnam, and Desert Storm. The book is also full of personal stories and anecdotes from officers and sailors aboard these great ships, detailing such incidents as coaling aboard the old pre-dreadnoughts, a female stowaway aboard the USS Arizona, and the old prank of sending a lighted piece of paper floating down the trench on the ship's head. The book provides an excellent assortment of pictures. I especially enjoyed the up-close shots of the Spanish-American War-era ships, as well as the shots of the cage masts and bridge areas aboard the Florida and Wyoming class ships. Of course, a lot of the book is devoted to coverage of the Iowa class, both due to their long service and the fact that the author served aboard the USS New Jersey. I got this book as a Christmas present, and have already read through it twice. Plus, I find myself constantly pulling the book off the shelf, just to open it up and let my eyes rest on all the great pictures of these majestic ships. If you are a battleship enthusiast, or just generally a naval buff, I guarantee you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Battleships","review":"I originally got this expecting information on all battleships, not just the U.S. examples. However, despite the fact that comparisons cannot be drawn with their rivals overseas in this book does not undermine its effectiveness altogether. It has quite a lot of photos, in varying times in the boats' careers, from construction to their disposal. This is a book very helpful for modelers, and for battleship enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Battleships","review":"Filled with breathtaking photographs in color and black-and-white, Battleships is both a history and a tribute to naval craft designed specifically for the art of war. Chapters span centuries of history up through the modern day; a wealth of information fills every chapter.

The authors all were well known and trustworthy and their treatment of old subjects (such as basic research principles) and not so old (setting up a genealogy web site) was generally quite well done. But this one is somewhat different. The subject of \\"genetic genealogy\\" is still very much unknown territory to almost all genealogists, even the professionals. It's not even a \\"social science,\\" so one has to acquire a certain amount of new background knowledge even before delving into it. This author is also less likely to be known to most genealogists outside his own specialty: He's a medical doctor, a Section Chief at the National Institutes of Health -- although he has also been president of the Prince George's County Genealogical Society and chairs the NGS committee on Family Health and Heredity, so he certainly can't be called a beginner. Personally, I've been \\"doing genealogy\\" for more than three decades, but my background is in history, library science, and archival management, with no training and very little experience in the life sciences. Over the past few years, I've read dozens of articles in all sorts of journals on the subject of applying recent breakthroughs in DNA mapping to family lineages, but even though I've been intrigued by the possibilities, the result has generally been to confuse myself even further. I'm pleased to say that Shawker has supplied an antidote to my ignorance.The first section lays out the reasons you need to know about your family's health history, because \\"ignorance is not bliss.\\" This is especially true among Acadian families, as in other geographically or culturally isolated populations (Ashkenazic Jews, Amish, Afrikaners, Pacific Islanders) which suffer from a predisposition to assorted diseases and conditions. He follows this with a primer on the nature and process of genetics that is very well written and easy to understand (even for me), with a full explanation of dominant and recessive traits. He includes plenty of case studies, too, from King George III and the Romanovs to Gilda Radner. Then comes a section on compiling a health history, drawing up a medical pedigree, interpreting the results, and being aware of the warning signs for various important and common genetic diseases.The part of the book I read most closely is that which explains in great detail, with many examples and illustrations, how the Y-chromosome is passed on, unchanged, from father to son to grandson, and so on, through the male line, and how the mitochondrial DNA is likewise passed without change from mother to daughter to granddaughter. The famous Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemmings case provides a good example of how all this works, and how one can use deduction to track lineages that are a mix of males and females. Numerous charts and diagrams also increase one's understanding. Shawker also lays out a strategy for developing a family association DNA project to determine the relationships between groups with identical surnames, and he repeatedly makes the point that no testing program can prove anything: It can only serve as another research tool in conjunction with more traditional genealogical methods.Finally, the author addresses the ethical and legal issues inherent in genetic testing, whether for family research or to identify an inherited tendency to contract a disease, and includes a lengthy guide to other resources on the Internet - especially important in a fast-developing area like this. There's an excellent bibliography, too. Shawker is that rare scientist who can write coherently for the layman and I can recommend this excellent work to any individual or library with an interest in genealogical methodology."},{"Title":"Unlocking Your Genetic History: A Step-by-Step Guide to Discovering Your Family's Medical and Genetic Heritage (National Genealogical Society Guides)","review":"Discovering our genetic heritage is a fascinating subject; if we go back far enough we are all related.

Therefore, before I read this book, the extent of my knowledge was the famous quote: \\"Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.\\" His life was one of enormous achievement, and like so many of the American intellectuals of the twentieth century, he was an immigrant who always felt a degree of discomfort in American society. This uneasiness finally led him to resign his position at Harvard and travel the world, writing and adventuring.Written primarily for young adults, Carter gives a complete, albeit brief synopsis of the accomplishments of this incredible man. Primarily a philosopher, Santayana wrote in many other areas, including poetry and fiction. He was also a very modest man, never appearing to take himself too seriously. It is also noted, although largely in passing, that Santayana was a homosexual. That fact seems to have had no direct affect on his public life, hence there was no reason for Carter to spend a great deal of time on it.Santayana did not possess a great deal of faith in democracy, and he spent the years of the Second World War in Italy. While he clearly supported Benito Mussolini, there is no evidence that his support was all that active. His position seems to have been one who simply wants a society to be ordered, there is no evidence that he ever spoke favorably of Nazism, and he was severely critical of the principles of Nazism in his writings.One of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century, Santayana deserves to be studied more closely. I am currently searching for a more in-depth biography, and I can thank the author of this book for my development of that interest."},{"Title":"Satan, satanism, and witchcraft, (Zondervan books)","review":"Anton Szandor La Vey is the \\"pastor\\" of the First Satanic Church in San Francisco, and devil worship is being practiced actively throughout the western world. Does a real, personal devil actually exist? If so, where did he come from, what is he like, and how does he operate?The late Bishop James A. Pike, grieving over the suicide death of his son Jim, observed strange occurrences in his Cambridge apartment which led him to think that his son was seeking to communicate with him. He attended a number of seances in which Jim allegedly spoke to him. Can the spirits of the dead send signals to the living? Are mediums able to establish contact with the souls of those who have gone to the \\"other side\\"? What really happens in a seance?Mrs. Jeane Dixon is considered a prophetess by many people, and top leaders in government and industry consult her for information about the future. Does she really receive messages from God through tarot cards, the crystal ball, or astrological readings? What about astrology? Is it reliable? Is it a harmless pastime? Or is it a practice Christians must avoid?Sybil Leek calls herself a witch, and believes she is able to contact and utilize powers from the invisible realm. She has gained an international reputation, and says that over eight million people in the world are witches. What about witchcraft? Is it merely a game some people play? Is it beneficial to humanity? Or is it evil and dangerous?Universities are offering courses in occultism, and teams of scientists are investigating reports of mysterious magical phenomena all over the globe. They are baffled by some of the amazing incidents they encounter, and admit that present scientific knowledge cannot account for them. What should be the Christian's attitude toward magic?In this book a sincere effort is made to give Biblical answers to questions like these.The first three chapters are a study of the explicit teaching of the Bible about Satan, evil spirits, and their battle strategy. The remaining portion consists of a report and analysis of current occultism in the light of the Scriptures.It has been impossible for me to investigates the large amount of available information on this subject, so I assigned full responsibility of the last three chapters to Herbert Vander Lugt, Research Editor of the Radio Bible Class.The Word of God may not provide a specific explanation for every problem one may encounter as he studies Satan, Satanism, and witchcraft, but it sheds much light on these subjects and offers practical guidelines by which God's children can avoid the dangers inherent in occultism.This volume therefore is sent out with the prayer that it may instruct and help many people in these days of unrest, confusion and fear.Richard W.

We get Kessel, the Maw installation, Kip, adm Daala who reappears then disappears, Qui Xu, the first hint of the aftermath of Dark Empire, and more Wedge (now a critical character). I had some problem with the story like: The spirit of a dead jedi having such tremedous power, the whole idea of the Suncrusher and the studip diversion of the blob race storyline.

He meets Kip Durron and they help each other escape, but into a Maw of a forming Black Hole. Luke is trying to find Jedi for his academy, but a Dark Force spirit is threatening the students.For those of you who plan to read the New Jedi Order books, you'll find that Kevin J Anderson has made important contributions to SW including this trilogy and the young jedi books (the YJ books are surprisingly good)."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"This book tells the story/history of Father Damien of Molokai, a most remarkable man whose indefatigable work in a notorious Hawaiian leper colony gave him the international status of the Mother Theresa of his time. It is well-written, lively, and most readable; but it is also terribly romanticized, Damien IS saintly. Perhaps he was. Readers should take minor note that the main text was published originally in 1937 (according to an older edition of this book that I own)."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"I have read this book five times and I fully expect to do so once again. It is the true story of a Priest from Belgium who, in the late 1800\`s, cheerfully accepted, even demanded an assignment which would cause people of lesser intestinal fortitude to run away: Molokai, a leper colony in Hawaii. His description of the sorry state of the people is enough to make one ill. Yet, through his own unconditional love for his fellow man, took it upon himself, to feed them, cleanse their disgusting wounds, bury the dead with his own hands, cousel them, hear their confessions and prepare them to meet their maker after death. It is a moving tale of a man who totally abandoned himself in favour of his God and his bretheren. This healthy, athletic man knew that by associating with these human outcasts, he would likely fall victim to this dreaded disease and, in fact he did. It would be extremely difficult to imagine any person giving more of himself for the benefit of others. By anyone\`s definition, Damien DeVeuster, \`Damien The Leper\` was a true saint. His story should be required reading for all because it would be sinful to allow the lessons to fade into obscurity. Bless his lily-white soul."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"I read this book about five years ago and am now reading it a second time. It is more stunning and compelling than I remember. John Farrow brilliantly takes us into the heart, mind and soul of a man who gave all of himself to Christ. It is an adventure on every level, a delight for the senses, as Damien fights his way through the jungles, waterfalls and diseases of the tropics to bring God to the islanders. When he is sent to Molokai, Damien faces evil head-on in every possible way, and he meets it, each time, with other-worldly selflessness and a determination that is completely unstoppable. Few people realize that he was left on the shores of Molokai with nothing but an extra shirt to wear. He had no food, no water, no shelter (he lived under a tree), no helper; and he was faced with the task of caring for 800 lepers who had no doctors, no food supply, no medical supplies, no water supply, no clothing, and who often died from exposure, not leperosy. Mothers resorted to prostitution to win food for their children; many of the lepers spent their time drunk on a sickening liquor they concocted. Damien transformed these people and the island into a place of self-respect and decency. Truly, everyone should read this book if only to see what one person can do with thier life. Of course, Damien dies after several years with \\"his lepers,\\" but his legacy continues to shine. The Catholic Church will beatify him as a saint in October 2009. Don't miss reading this book -- it will change you."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. As to its literary quality it is perfection. I read it at least once every year. It is resplendent with richness of imagery in painting the most vivid pictures of Blessed Damien's life and the Hawaiian backdrop in which he lived with his beloved lepers. Fr Damien was completely in tune with God His Creator and so willing to lay down his life for those most scorned and abandoned by the world.

Damien was truly Christ-like. This book captures that and is sheer joy to read."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"It is often difficult to write a critical reveiw of a biography of a man that you deeply admire. However, I must be honest in my assessment of this book. It is informative and paints an excellent picture of Father Damian. The misfortune is that John Farrow needed an editor to edit his work before it was published.Farrow spends far too much time describing the scenary of Hawaii, which takes away from the story of Father Damian. In a book that was over 220 pages, it seemed that less than 80% was directly related to Father Damian. The author also wastes time exploring alleged \\"unclean acts\\" by Father Damian. To quote page 220, \\"... if the story were a thousand times true, can't you see you are a million times lower for daring to repeat it.\\" This reflect my feeling on this discussion. If even the author does not believe it, why include it in the book?I only became aware of the story of Father Damian by chance within the last year and have taken great interest in it. Farrow's biography puts in perspective a life which had chosen to be martyred for the suffering lepers. Not only did he choose to be with the lepers, but he built their secluded island to a more respectable state and lobbied politicians to better the way of life for them.As the author worked in Hollywood, it amazes me that such a story could not inspire a movie. This is certainly a touching and important tale for a wider audience to know, without a focus on the scenary."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"A friend gave me a copy of this 25 years ago. I thought the title intriguing, and started it not knowing what to expect. What unfolded was a riveting and delicious and fascinating tale of a man driven to serve mankind selflessly in the name of his God; and that desire took him to the farthest shores of the earth and to the most remote and unloved spot. But the remoteness of the location and the unique attributes of his new companions did not dim Damien's enthusiasm for a second, nor quell the enormous light that shined within him. This is an almost unheard-of, yet true, story of a fascinating man in a fascinating time and location and environment. The book is written with such love and beauty that it sweeps the reader up in the story and allows him/her to experience it along with Damien. Some of it is so hauntingly spiritual that it gives one goosebumps. It's that good. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Damien the Leper","review":"Very well written.

Candace Serviss"},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"The first chapter of Mackie's Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong is the locus classicus for error theories in contemporary meta-ethics. There he argues that ordinary moral discourse and thought involve an assumption that there are what he calls \\"objective values,\\" and that this assumption is false. Consequently, ordinary moral thought and language are infected by an error that precludes any ordinary moral claims and thoughts from being true.Mackie first argues for a cognitivist interpretation of moral language. In other words, he argues that ordinary moral claims purport to describe facts about the world. In particular, ordinary moral language and thought purport to describe facts about objective moral values. What are objective moral values? They have two defining characteristics: (i) mind-independent existence (think of how chairs, trees, people, and electrons exist), and (ii) \\"intrinsic and categorical prescriptivity\\": that is, they are such that the mere apprehension of them will motivate a person to act in a certain way. The former characteristic is the source of their objectivity; the latter is the source of their normativity.But, he claims, we have good reason to think that no such things exist. Mackie's fundamental worry about these putative objective values is that these things are especially \\"queer,\\" that they are unlike any other things we have good reason to think exist. As I understand Mackie, underlying his worries about the queerness of these putative entities is his perception of a tension in their nature. He appears to believe that the objectivity of these putative entities is in tension with their intrinsic and categorical action-guidingness. That is, it is unclear to Mackie how something that exists as a mind-independent part of reality could have the sort of influence on human behavior that these objective values are supposed to have. It is unclear how something could be both objective and normative. The things that scientists study and that we encounter in the everyday world simply don't have this sort of categorical action-guidingness built into them. So, given the naturalistic conception of the world that Mackie favors, we have good a posteriori reasons to doubt the existence of objective moral values.But, if Mackie is correct about the nature of ordinary moral thought and language, this commits us to regarding ordinary moral thought and language as involving a very fundamental sort of error, an error of presupposing that objective moral values exist. Mackie then completes his error theory by providing an explanation of our tendency to make this error, to mistakenly suppose that ordinary moral thought and language involve our successfully coming to know about the sorts of things he claims don't exist.Mackie's book doesn't end here, however. Indeed, this is only the first chapter, and Mackie goes on to cover a wide range of territory in normative ethics and meta-ethics, along with a few issues in metaphysics (the existence of God and freedom of the will) that have some bearing on moral issues. In fact, despite his worries about the objectivity of morality, Mackie goes on to defend a substitute for morality, one that looks quite a bit like a broadly consequentialist moral theory, and he even weighs in on several controversial moral issues that are still with us. In short, in a little over two hundred pages of exceptionally clear prose, Mackie covers just about everything of interest in moral philosophy.This book is, of course, essential reading for anyone interested in meta-ethics. Understanding some of the material and its importance may require some background knowledge, but enough of the book is more generally accessible that it also constitutes a good wide-ranging introduction to issues in both meta-ethics and normative ethics for a person with some background in philosophy (and perhaps for the general reader). Furthermore, the book, while not a work of history, is sufficiently informed about the history of the issues it discusses to provide the reader with an entry into study of the history of the subject.If you're especially interested in Mackie's meta-ethical views, you should attempt to track down a copy of Morality and Objectivity (Ted Honderich, ed.), as it includes interesting and important reactions to Mackie's views by some major names (John McDowell, Simon Blackburn, R. M. Hare, Bernard Williams, et al.) in moral philosophy."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"It might be read as an introduction to Ethics, but it isn't one. It is rather one of the most important works in 20th century ethics.Mackie's book was revolutionary since being the first one to combine anti-realism (no objectively prescriptive values in the world) with cognitivism (the meaning of ethical statements can be true or false). Most of the previous anti-realists were anti-realists mostly implicitly, only because of being non-cognitivsts. Mackie has a different view which in my opinion is much more closer to the truth. The book also contains his error theory (people have a disposition to see their value judgments as objective). While the reviewer cdtreyer as the mainstream tradition have concentrated on Mackie's error theory I think it is much less important than the denial of the objective values and the justification of the role of morality in quasi-contractual terms.Mackie's views on positive morality are justified by quasi-contractual (he discusses Plato's Protagoras, Hobbes and Hume) means and would combine very well with evolutionary perspectives. The discussion on the content of normative views is just a brief sketch, but this isn't really what this book is about anyway. Anyone who claims that the contents of the first part of the book undermine the contents of the second should read chapter 5 again and again and again. That there are no objective values in the world does not mean that there can't be right or wrong - it simply must be (or rather already has largely been) invented and constructed.If you are interested in ethics you simply need to read this small, but important book which, while not being an introduction is still quite simple and very elegantly written. Besides the main content you will also get to read a great discussion on the meaning of the good (in debate with the classical Geach-Hare discussion found in Philippa Foot's \\"Theories of Ethics\\"), discussion on the is-ought problem and its flawed Searlean solution (also found in Foots collection), a chapter on univerzalisability of moral judgments (contra Hare) and on the frontiers of ethics: voluntary actions, determinism, law, politics, religion."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"Mackie wants to convince us that objective values are not &quot;part of the fabric of the universe.&quot; In other words, there are no moral claims that are objectively true, and no moral rules that are objectively binding on us. He gives three arguments in support of this claim. He argues that the best explanation for the diversity of ethical beliefs is that there is no matter of fact that some of us are getting right, while others are getting it wrong. He argues that the very existence of objective values is &quot;queer&quot; (by which he means &quot;weird&quot;), because they would have to have some strange sort of &quot;intrinsic prescriptivity.&quot; And he argues that knowledge of objective values, if there were any, would require some strange, inexplicable form of moral intuition.I personally am unconvinced by Mackie's arguments. For example, why should our ethical disagreements lead us to believe that there are no ethical facts? People disagree about lots of things that are objective if anything is (e.g., whether UFO's are space aliens). However, this is clearly one of the paradigmatic statements and defenses of &quot;moral anti-realism.&quot;For an alternative perspective to Mackie's, one might read Thomas Nagel's _The View from Nowhere_ (especially the chapters on ethics and value), or Alasdair MacIntyre's _After Virtue_."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"Not only was this book enlightening on the topic of ethics, but (unlike many philosophy studies) it was interesting and easy to understand! Mackie's writing style is straight forward and his thoughts and descriptions are ingenious. No wonder this is not the first printing of this book! I was particularly impressed with his definition of the attributive adjective 'good' and the manner in which he distinguished the common term 'good' from the moral term 'good'. Also excellent is his discussion of 'ought' concerning Hume's Law. The only reason I give this book a rating of four stars (as opposed to five) is that, in philosophy, there is always a better theory yet to be published. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"This is a well written, entertaining book. I did not find the arguments in the early part of the book on error theory and the \\"queerness\\" of object values convincing, but I do believe that different people have different values, which opens the door for a subjective moral philosophy. At this point, the book does an excellent job in developing and building the ideas behind just such a philosophy. This is the closest to \\"Humean\\" moral thought written in the 20th century that I have found (which I consider to be high praise)."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"This book is regarded as the classic statement of moral error theory - the idea that there are no objective moral values. For this reason, anyone seriously interested in moral philosophy must grapple with this book. But the important part of the discussion, the attempted refutation of moral realism, only occupies a single chapter of the book. As such, it's not entirely satisfying. Mackie marshals two arguments in favor of his position, the arguments from relativity and from queerness. While I won't go into detail on either, the first seems flatly wrong and the second does not work against the Aristotelian position Mackie considers. And notably, Mackie does not claim it does either.Much of the rest of the book is devoted to expounding his subjective theory of moral rightness. I found it somewhat interesting (he decries factory farming way back in 1977!), but philosophically, I was unsure of its value. I'm not sure how we actually argue for moral principles, if we grant Mackie's metaethics. An argument that is, in principle, not rationally resolvable seems not like one a philosopher qua philosopher should take part."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"J. L. Mackie, Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong, Penguin 1977.Some thinkers hold that moral principles can be deduced from reason and introspection, while others hold that moral principles can be deduced from a careful examination of the varieties of human behavior observed across space and through time. The first might be called \\"objectivists\\" because moral principles, like mathematical principles, for these thinkers, are \\"out there\\" to be discovered. The second, by contrast, might be called \\"behaviorists\\" because they consider moral truths to be discovered in about the same way as we discover linguistic regularities: by observing how and when groups taken certain moral principles to be true, and by analyzing the commonalities and differences in the conception of morality in different societies. They may also be termed \\"evolutionary\\" because they invariably explain the commonalities and differences in moral principles in terms of the gene-culture coevolutionary process that lies at the basis of our development as a species.There is no doubt in my mind but that the objectivists in the above sense are profoundly misled and misleading, and the behaviorists approach the study of morality correctly. In my view it is obvious that ethics should be studied scientifically, and those who propose to justify moral principles through Introspection or Reason are on the wrong track. Because most moral philosophers resoundingly reject my behaviorist/evolutionary position (the recently deceased Philippa Foote and the American David Chan being significant exceptions), I have been looking around for a philosophical critique of ethical objectivism. J. L. Mackie's well known book came to mind.It is clear from the subtitle of this book that Mackie is not a behaviorist/evolutionary moralist. Indeed, the behavioral/evolutionary moralists are generally deeply critical of the notion that all moralities are possible and we can simply \\"invent\\" and socially instantiate the one that we prefer, as propounded by what John Tooby and Lida Cosmides have termed the \\"Standard Social Sciences Model.\\" However, I thought he might have developed a cogent critique of objectivism even if his alternative is not acceptable. I was wrong. Mackie's arguments are, to my mind, extremely weak and not at all persuasive.Mackie begins by defining ethics as \\"objective\\" if values are \\"part of the fabric of the world.\\" But, both objectivists and behavioral/evolutionary moralists, in the sense defined above, believe that values are part of the fabric of the world, differing only on how we are to discover moral rules and their relation to empirical social practices. My objectivists care no more about what people say about ethics than a physicist cares about what people say about gravity. The physicist's skill and training trump anything folk-physics has to say about the subject. Behavioral/evolutionary ethicists, by contrast, value objectivist philosophical reasoning only when it gives insight into regularities concerning human moral principles and behavior.Mackie's critique of objectivism, which he considers to be a critique of a moral skepticism sort, is based on two arguments. The first is the \\"relativist\\" argument that because people can vehemently and permanently disagree about the content of morality, and because there is not objective process of adjudicating disagreements of this sort, it is unlikely that morality is \\"part of the fabric\\" of the world. This argument, to my mind, has no weight at all. Language, for instance, is surely an objective part of human experience, but there are many highly distinct languages and linguistic structures.The second of Mackie's critiques of objectivism is \\"the argument from queerness.\\" He says that if morals are objective, then our way of knowing morals is different from that of knowing any other aspect of the fabric of the world (p. 38). But this is false. There are a hundred books on morality from the standpoint of traditional science, including arguments about the development of moral principle in species through Darwinian evolution.So, my search for a philosophical critique of objectivist ethical theory goes on. Perhaps I should read the critiques of Foote and Chan to uncover the philosophical bases of objectivist ethics. Well, that should give me something to do on days that the Boston Celtics aren't playing."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"Roger Scruton says that J.L. Mackie's \\"Ethics\\" is \\"phenomenally overrated.\\" Scruton, as usual, may have overstated his point, but I didn't like the book either.Students and potential buyers should know that \\"Ethics\\" is NOT an introduction to ethics. Rather, it plunges the reader into the middle of often-pedantic analytic debates circa 1970, before thinkers such as Rawls, Singer and Finnis had resurrected ethical philosophy as a meaningful guide to action. Mackie rejected the idea of \\"objective\\" morality, whether theistic or utilitarian. For him, ethics was little more than applied psychology with a dash of conceptual analysis. It did not bind persons or tell us how to live well. All it did was solve \\"prisoners' dilemmas\\" and suggest ways to curb extreme kinds of selfishness that could destabilize society.The first part of \\"Ethics\\" is still worthwhile (if only as a demolition job) for readers interested in meta-ethics. However, the book's fundamental shallowness is exposed as soon as it takes up concrete \\"first order\\" moral problems. Here, Mackie skates from issue to issue, considering none in detail. A total of three paragraphs is devoted to abortion. His proposal to kill \\"defective\\" newborns is advanced and defended in literally two sentences. The reader reels from the brevity, superficiality and arrogance of the discussions.Bottomline: The student looking for an introduction to ethics would be shortchanged by Mackie's failure to consider schools such as Kantianism, virtue theory, or Thomist natural law. However, more advanced readers might appreciate his discussion of particular meta-ethical issues. Personally, I thought the book was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (Pelican)","review":"The startling thing is that this book even needs to be written.There are no objective moral facts -- if you think otherwise,then name one.

Any valid argument mustbe based on some other objective moral fact, which I in turndeny. I may well agree with this or that moral statement,but that's simply a matter of subjective views. Some moralstatements might be agreed to by every subjective human beingon the planet -- that does not make them objective. This isquite different from such objective facts as that the sun rosethis morning -- this is not a question that is open todeliberation, or opinion.

It's a book for believers, specifically, Christians, which is fine if that's what you want. The author, Henrietta C. Mears, is clear on her own beliefs and what she and the reader should believe. She's a little more fond of !!!!! than I care for, and there's a kind of a see?-I told-you-so kind of tone to it. Have you ever seen those bumper stickers that say something like, God Said It/I believe it/That's It! ?That's how this book reads. Now, having said that, here's the general direction of the book.Mears analyzes every book of the Bible. Every single chapter of her book starts out with the word Understanding, then names that book, from Genesis to Revelation. She reels off details and assessments of each book, with the underlying assumption that the reader agrees with what the Rev. Billy Graham says in the foreword to this book: \\"The Word of God is the only real authority we have.\\"So, for example, in her chapter on Genesis, she writes: Satan appears to have special enmity for the book of Genesis. No wonder the Adversary has bent his attacks upon it. It exposes him as the enemy of God and the deceiver of the human race; it foretells his destruction; it depicts his doom.\\" A few pages later, we get this sentence Remember, Jesus Christ is the center of the Bible.She also gives us such tidbits of information as this: there are 31,102 verses in the Bible, using 775,693 words*; Psalm 119 is the longest chapter; Psalm 117 the shortest. Ezra 7:21 contains all the letters of the alphabet except J (I don't know how well this fact stands up in translated versions and a conspiracy theorist could have a field day with the source J!); the longest book in the Old Testament is Psalms, the longest in the New Testament is Luke.This book is probably best used in an adult Christian education class or something similar. I don't see it helping much on an ecumenical or evangelical level. Perhaps it works as a self-education tool, for someone who's arrived at Christian belief and wants a wider understanding of the sense of the full Bible.*In English, I assume."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"The cover was almost ripped off.

I found it very thorough (though this is not to be confused with a Biblical history text) with enough information to keep perspectives of timelines and order of events in our history. Specifically, she explained very well the times of the prophets and possible relationships to one another. Mrs. Mears is clearly a dispensationalist regarding eschatology (study of the end times). Meaning, she believes that prophecy is interpreted in a specific way with which I disagree. I do not think this detracts from her Biblical knowledge or that she has a saving faith in any way; I just want potential readers to know this in advance that her book espouses a specific view of prophecy and the end times. I find the book very good and helpful overall."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"I never found a book that was clearly descriptive to understanding the bible. Ms. Mears uses many examples in life that weaves the threads that formlate an exquisite pattern of bible times. There is more to just knowing things exist, but another to know how they relate.

You might prefer to transfer it to your pc first and then just drag&drop; it to your kindle.Even after browsing through it I couldn't figure out if this is actually KJV-based. It doesn't say so specifically but there is a NIV-version of this title. In the section about Romans (kindle-can't tell you the page yet!) it says for example \\"...'Reckon' (KJV) on this....\\", \\"'Yield' (KJV)....\\", \\"...it is used thirty-eight times in the twenty-five verses of this chapter (in the KJV)...\\".I have owned a paper copy of this book for many years and would not give it away because of owning a kindle now.

I bought a membership in aircourier.org and it was the worst travel investment I ever made. The customer service is terrible, which actually counts tons when you're trying to arrange a flight. (You might have better luck going through another consolidator, but aircourier.org is really terrible.)The other thing I found after diligently checking the flight lists is that you can often do better these days just by finding cheap web-fare flights yourself on sites like qixo.com, expedia.com, etc.. I was really disappointed by what I thought would be higher discounts. It's often no more than a few dollars (!!) difference for a lot more hassle."},{"Title":"Air Courier Bargains, Seventh Edition: How to Travel World-Wide for Next to Nothing Seventh Edition","review":"Hailed by reviewers all over the US (according to the book itself), this book definetely does not deliver.

Paula Frosch wrote, \\"the art seems less witty than clever, less creative than contrived, and the artist as brittle as the images. Along with the essay by Armstrong, the work contains a fictional biography, a patchwork of myth and jargon, an exhibition history, and a lengthy bibliography. As an example of self-promotion, this probably belongs on the shelves along with many other catalogs of a similar genre. However, it is by no means an essential purchase in times of budgetary cuts.\\" Pretty harsh that part about an exercise in self-promotion. I can only imagine what she would say today of Alexis Smith!In part this is because of Smith's deep-seated California-ness, and her job in the library at New York's Metropolitan Museum predisposed Ms. Frosch into thinking of Smith as a, well, a poseur. The tradition of funk-collage-assemblage to which she belongs has its origins, perhaps, in the European inspired surrealism of Joseph Cornell's \\"Utopia Parkway,\\" and yet here in the West it has really taken shape, and many of the most inspired artists of Smith's generation have mixed conceptualism with humor with collage to create some interesting work. This large scale book, the gift of a generous friend to me at Christmastime, (hi Alvin!) is a perfect way to celebrate the career of an artist about whom you don't seem to hear quite as much about as back in the day when the Whitney was doing this huge retrospective of her work and she was planning her Snake Path up the steep majestic hill at the University of California in San Diego, that leads to the steps of the Central Library there.Like many artists, she has seized upon some common tropes and made them her own through skillful manipulation, rather like the poet Amy Gerstler with whom she has collaborated and who provides the biography of Smith at the back of this volume. In the case of Alexis Smith, we see playing cards all the time, playing cards and snakes, and also stars. When I think of her work I think of an old time Western, with gamblers playing poker in the front room of the saloon, and out on the range, a snake creeps towards the bound Gregory Peck spreadeagled in the sun. At night a blanket of stars covers the campground of the cowboys and ranchhands. One thing the book doesn't explain is how the actress Alexis Smith felt about this younger upstart who \\"appropriated\\" her name, and sometimes her image. (She was actually born Patti Smith, but I guess that wouldn't do either!) The statuesque Titian haired Warner Brothers star was still alive, if just barely, when this book went into production, and we see one of the works labelled as being \\"from the collection of the actress Alexis Smith,\\" so my guess is she didn't mind the implied flattery of having someone change their name to match your own, but I always think that's a little weird and would have liked more explanation."},{"Title":"Art and the industrial revolution","review":"Just a single word : every historian of the XIXth century should get it or at least read it. This is one of the first books exploring the link between social upheavals and the technological revolutions of the Romantic era. It also helps us understand our own conditions as hypermodern civilians. Klingender put the finger on what's wrong with progress and what's good with liberalism thought (the one concerning the access of knowledge and goods to everyone). It also explores the fears of british people at a time of quick and drastic changes.I'd rate it 9.5 out of 10. I also think that this book deserves a continuation and must be improved, not because it is not accurate or pertinent, but because this topic deserves a vast study... this could make a series of volumes the size of telephone directories! A very interesting subject!"},{"Title":"The Power of the Written Tradition (Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry)","review":"In a sense, this is Jack Goody's &quot;Summa&quot;, even though it contains fewer than 200 pages. The book contains a series of essays in which he deals with objections to his earlier writings, makes a few objections of his own to other writers, and generally illuminates the nature of oral transmission, the interaction of literate and non and illiterate societies, the power writing gives to those who have it, and its influence on conventions such as time, narrative and poetry.This book is of particular interest to me in relation to the Bible, because for years in the seminary I always heard that the laws of Moses, the stories of Genesis or the sayings of Jesus were transmitted verbatim because of the allegedly superior memory skills of oral cultures. Mr. Goody takes dead aim on these naive notions, and the theories of Lord and Parry, by looking at actual oral transmission in actual oral societies. It turns out that word-for-word recall of ritual recitations is non-existent, and rhyme and meter are likewise in short supply. In the observed societies, mythic recitation is collectively composed by intiates at the time of performance, and varies considerably from time to time and place to place.Other issues considered in the book are the creation of narrative time through writing, the influence of writing on the slave revolt in Bahia in 1835, a critique of Derrida's playful, but not very accurate notion of language, and consideration of writing as a technology. This book was very hard to put down. It's a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Power of the Written Tradition (Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry)","review":"The author is pretty sharp when he talks about how oral traditions helped develop some Indo-European languages. But he was lost when he discusses oriental languages, especially Chinese. In China, evidences of writing before 4,000 years BCE (i.e., nearly 1,000 years earlier than any signs of writing appeared in Egypt or Mesopotamia.) have been found, while he claimed the earliest evidences dated around 1,500 BCE. And he almost made himself fantastic when he sympathetically cited a claim that the Indo-Europeans, in a twisted way, helped inspire China's writing system. Indeed, nobody is sure whether or not Indo-Europeans existed when writing first appeared in China, or even in Egypt or Mesopotamia.One more thing that reveals his ignorance is the claim that Chinese (only) uses some 8,000 characters, and that somehow proves that Chinese is the most conservative language. Though what he meant is not entirely clear, there is an obvious misunderstanding here. He must have thought that those \\"characters\\" are equivalent with \\"words\\" in English. Isn't that true?Well, while some of them are, they are much more than that. Those 8,000 charaters, when they come into use, form at least 5*8,000 = 40,000 words, sometimes in single characters, more often in pairs, and occsionally in triplets and quadruples. It is such words which are more \\"equivalent\\" to Indo-European words. For example, Fang, one character, is similar to House; Tian, to Heaven; Shi-jie, two charaters, to World; Qi-che, to Automobile; so on and so forth.A modestly educated Chinese knows (either reads or writes) about 13,000 characters and thus 65,000 words, making him more than an equivalent of William Shakespere, who used a little more than 35,000 words, in all his plays and sonnets and other poems.The author should know that he is not a pastor of any Indo-European gods. When a scholar addresses a broad audience, he should know that making insane claims doesn't help to advance his cause, because many in the audience might know something he doesn't.An old Confucius saying might sober him up: One shouldn't brag about things he doesn't know well enough."},{"Title":"DK Essential World Atlas","review":"This atlas is the size of a regular book so it's not heavy and inconvenient to use. It doesn't go into as much detail as a big atlas, (which means you're not going to find Bugtussle, Oklahoma in this atlas) but it is still an amazing resource. Besides having beautiful color maps, it has several other great features. It has world flags, political maps, physical maps, time zones, geology maps, climate maps, ocean current maps, biome maps, population maps, language maps, religion maps, ecomony maps, global conflict maps, basic info about each country, a gazetteer, a glossary, and more! A great gift for a student or anyone who loves to browse atlases."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"This is one of the finest books of Sci-Fi that I have ever read, and I have read a lot. She writes as if she were seeing the action unfold before her very eyes, and she makes you believe you are seeing it at the same time. I've been waiting for someone to reprint her books. I own all of her books and they are falling apart from having been read so much. My children have read her books, and loved them. I can't wait till the rest come out in print again."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I first read a part of this collection of stories of \\"The People\\" when I was 13 or 14 nearly 35 years ago, and it left such an impression. For years I tried to track it down but didn't know the author. Last month I found out the author's name and googled! I didn't hesitate to buy it when I finally found it on Amazon and they were very quick to get it to me! It was a great price and I didn't mind the postage to Australia as I had waited so long for this book! Well... it was just as good as I remembered and it will be a well loved book for many years to come. I know the story is a bit dated by todays standards, but it paints a wonderful picture about how human nature can be, in caring for and helping people that are different and not judging, and the feeling of having a family that will always stand by you even if it is not by blood."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Zenna Henderson's stories of \\"The People\\" are always enjoyable. Her positive view of the human/alien interaction gives me hope. To paraphrase Carl Sagan, if we here on Earth are the only sentient beings, the universe has too much wasted space."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"This compilation of Science Fiction icon Zenna Henderson's works is fabulous. Topics of love, belonging, connection and family are played amidst the drama of risk, adventure, loss, discovery, empathy and freedom.

Her characters and plots are believable, accurate, and add a positive mysterious air to our earthbound everyday lives."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Ingathering is a compilation of wonderful short and longer stories, published by Henderson over a number of years. Some sweet and hopeful, some heartwrenching, they all tell stories in the best storytelling tradition, of a People who had to flee their Home, and end up scattered and separated, on Earth. Worth reading over again when life seems discouraging"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I have been a SciFi fan most of my life but had never come across these stories until now. I remember the made for TV movie in the 70's with Kim Darby and William Shatner. These stories tell you much more. A wonderful collection for anyone who enjoys science fiction! Would make a good gift."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Zenna Henderson was a great author, as good as any of the \\"Grand Old Men\\" of Science Fiction. She deserves to be as well-known as Heinlein or Asimov. Only her gender, & the prejudices of her era prevented this.Her stories of The People are warm & provide the reader with a kind of emotional & spiritual comfort that is very rewarding.This belongs on the shelf of every single fan of Science Fiction. No exceptions.Please be kind & vote for this review!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Working in education, I often wondered if the &quot;little monsters&quot; were aliens, so I can see the funny side behind some of these stories.I am not a fantasy fan in general, I prefer hard Si-Fi or Alternative history and I like my science/historical research accurate, but I enjoyed these stories despite this.The characters are all quite good as is the dialogue, the world that the People live in is fleshed out in a 3-D fashion.There is a genuine Alienness to &quot;the people&quot; as a race that emerges through the stories, demonstrating their relations ship to us is only skin deep in some interesting repects. They are also fallible, their space craft accident record is abysmal.These stories are all very optimistic.Generally I like my aliens &quot;fried&quot;, but I'd make exception for &quot;the people&quot;, they're simply too nice to shoot. I rarely find myself rooting for the ETs in a book, but I did in this one."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"It's not often that you can write a review before you've seen the book. This is an exception however. I read these individual stories years ago in library books, however then entered an interregnum where they were unobtainable. I am looking forward to rediscovering old friends and making new ones! Zenna is an author of the Golden Years who somehow got lost - totally unjustly."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Henderson is less well-known than many of the Golden Age masters of sci fi, but her work stands alongside the best of them. Her 'People' stories are the gentlest of her work (If you can find any of her other short stories, anthologized in the out-of-print 'Holding Wonder' and 'The Anything Box,' you'll see her weirder side), but they have superior power to make you see the universe in a new way. Like several other reviewers, I found them during a grim teenage time, and they helped more than I can say.The 'Booklist' reviewer accuses them of being too 'mawkish' but in fact, the sweetness and enlightenment of 'The People' is well-tempered by very 'human' flaws. Their racial memories include horrendous persecution, and prompt them to try and quelch their childrens' telepathic and other gifts in a way that seems repressive and cruel to an outsider...until she learns the reason. The stories show a people evolving, making mistakes and learning from them, even as they help various physically and emotionally crippled humans toward a new vision. It's WONDERFUL to have these stories back in print! Now all we need is for the publisher to gather Henderson's other (non-People) stories, and get them back out there, too!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"That is what I wrote to Zenna several years ago, and I was saddened to receive a letter from her sister, saying that Zenna had been &quot;called back to the Presence&quot; a few years earlier. She had the ability to weave magic into her stories, and to make the reader feel and know what was happening. From Perdita and Low, to Lucine, to Valancy and the rest, Zenna made her characters come alive, and gave the feeling that these were not imaginary people, but real ones. These were not made-up events, but she was describing life somewhere in this world that was as it *should* be. Another reviewer said that there would be less suicide if more teens would read these stories, and I agree wholeheartedly. I know they changed my outlook on life. A special thanks to the compilers of &quot;Ingathering&quot; for their work!And please, AMAZON, keep this one in stock forever!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Be warned that in reading Zenna Henderson's fantasy stories about \\"The People\\", they are so naturalistic and convincing that you may find yourself believing you have the gifts: that you can levitate, send telepathic messages, heal with psychic force. When you realize that it's just a dream inspired by the stories, you may wander around in a half-daze, wishing your life were like those stories: that you really did have the gifts, that you endured hardships in the same stoic way, and that you would find safe haven and welcoming arms somewhere in the American Southwest. I know because for weeks after reading one of her collections, I kept thinking that I could levitate -- and I was already an adult!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"When a friend at work loaned this book to me, I asked her what kind it was. She thought for a moment and told me, it was a little bit of everything. At that point, I was reading fantasy and science fiction, so I eagerly started reading it. And it changed the way I look at things. Zenna Henderson touches a lot of core issues that affect the society in general. It also defines with clarity what an outside ring side view of our culture and the way we behave towards things we do not understand. It has pathos and surprisingly, there were some stories that kept me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails - which I never do consiously - praying for things to turn out ok for the people. A lovely work, one of its kind."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I am thrilled that the People stories are back in print. I read them years ago. I own all four of the books, including the hardcover edition of Pilgrimage. I love to share these wonderful stories with others. Now they can buy their own copies. For anyone who hasn't read the stories yet I have one caution. This hardcover edition has an introductory story preceding the first titled story &quot;Ararat.&quot; &quot;Ararat&quot; is the true first story of the People and originally was published in a science fiction magazine first. I read it in the magazine and almost 40 years later I can still remember the shocking thrill that went through me as I read a certain line that told me that something strange and wonderful was about to unfold. Of course I won't reveal the line and spoil it for others, but all Zenna Henderson readers will know to what I refer. New readers READ ARARAT FIRST!!A long time science fiction reader"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"There are only a handful of authors that have moved me to laughter, tears, and wonderment in the same book. Perhaps the fact that Henderson herself was a school teacher, has added so much to her stories. I recently retired but I saw so very many of her 'characters' move through my classes year after year. She has a way of reminding us that there is always hope but she never tries to 'gloss'over the fact that death is still very real and painful.She plays emotions as if they were a harp and all who read her are the better for listening to her music."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I started reading science fiction when I was a Boy Scout, and discovered Zenna Henderson's stories of the People just before I graduated from high school, nearly 30 years ago. Reading the Golden Age sf authors (such as Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein) led me to my engineering career, but the warmth and depth in ZH's stories have stayed with me the longest. Of all the stories I have read, only J.R.R. Tolkien's short story &quot;Smith of Wootton Major&quot; seems to be in the same league with these. If I could take the works of only one sf author with me to a desert island, I would choose Zenna Henderson's &lt;&lt;Ingathering&gt;&gt;."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I try real hard to dislike Zenna Henderson's stories about The People. I'm drawn to the gritter, more hard-wired brand of science fiction, and these stories about the oh-so-wonderful People are just so darned sweet. Plus there's Henderson's writing...these stories read like she crocheted them while sitting in a rocking chair in front of a warm fire.But somehow, I just CAN'T dislike them. Henderson's stories of advanced aliens trying to survive among the knuckle-draggers of 19th and 20th century Earth, their struggle to remain true to their high ideals without betraying themselves, are immediately engrossing. And Henderson's plotting can grab you from the first sentence and pull you right along, never letting go. Her portrayal of the rural west is digital-clear.I highly recommend Henderson's People...five stars. Her afterword to the book, an explantion of how The People came to be written, is a hoot, and worth the price of admission. I also recommend reading the time-line at the end of the book...it will save you some confusion in placing the stories in time and place."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I have loved the stories of the People since I was a child. Now over 40, I can still laugh, cry and dream about them. Through the years, I have told so many others about the People, and all have loved them as I have. I know that I will read and reread these stories, and share them with others, until the day that I, too, am called back into the Presence. The stories of the People are life-changing and profound. I cannot recommend them highly enough."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I will never forget the first time I read these stories. My father introduced me to the People. I have read the stories over and over and still mourn that Zenna Henderson didn't write more.

Every young person should read them and every older person should re-read them!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Long ago, my first introduction to Science Fiction was Zenna Henderson's series about the People. Living through times in America's history when people were being persecuted because they were visibly different (the civil rights period) or because they thought and acted differently (the age of the flower children and activism against social inequities), I found reading about a people who were different and persecuted but retained their inate goodness, kindness, and sense of self worth to be not only uplifing but a call to battle. I determined to go out and embrace the uniqueness of all the people on this planet. In my travels around the world, I tried to personify the teachings of Ms. Henderson and learned that I CAN lift myself and others (spirtually, if not physically), platt sunshine to warm the minds and souls of those around me (at least emotionally), read the thoughts and emotions of others (using my intuition and empathy), and be a healer (by just listening to and caring about those I met). The gift I received from reading Ms. Henderson's books was far greater than the enjoyment of meeting her people -- her gift enabled me to become one of The People."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I must say that I read the book by accident. I was browsing through the store and the cover attracted me. Review-wise.. It was an excellent book of dream. Basically it was only another form of romance genre aimed specifically for women.

Maybe saved my life, as I tended towards both reckless and depressed. As a scientist, engineer, retired naval flight officer, father and husband forty years later, her stories still have impact and insight, reminding me of what's important- and wonderful.

Earth is in the \\"complication stage\\" as The People would say and can not yet be trusted with talents that could do as much harm as good.

If you take nothing else away from reading Zenna's stories -- know that you can be as good as The People. It's in us to be kind and helpful and reach out when there is Need. Sometimes we forget.

My memories of these stories were so strong I wanted to read about \\"The People\\" again. I was afraid they wouldn't hold up to my memories of the stories. Thankfully, they did hold up. Even today, the stories are worth reading.The People are aliens from another world who crash in the Southwest United States. They are similar enough to humans to blend in, yet different. The stories frequently feature relationships between teachers and students, or adoptive parents and children.There is something very pure about these stories, yet good and evil aren't portrayed as black and white. When we are horrified about a fire that was set, we understand how differences can motivate hate, and how hate is rationalized and normalized. It isn't an faceless evil that set the fire, but real people with real motivations. Fear of difference, of the unknown. The \\"evil\\" in the books is used to teach tolerance, not to scare or petrify the audience.This collection of tales has a wide appeal, whether the reader is young or older."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Perfect for science fantasy buffs; as well as teachersor anyone who works with young people. These are sensitivecompassionate stories about 'different' folks; how they aretreated by the majority; how they react, and how they usually;finally get along.My only problem is that these are the 'Complete People Stories...'I want more!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Great book, good price, shipped quickly and arrived in very good condition. This book can get a little sappy at times, and will turn you off if you don't like talk about God. But, it has real heart and sweetness as well as some very interesting ideas. A nice change from a lot of the jaded stuff of today."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I just finished reading \\"Ingathering\\" for the first time, having read most of the stories many years ago in other collections.Most of her stories do portray the \\"People\\" in a very positive light, with a strong faith in God, even if under different names than used on Earth. However, there are several stories, especially \\"The Return\\", which show that the People were individually just as capable of selflessness and short sightedness as anyone else.Some stories outshine others, but on average the writing is excellent, with plenty of detail in both setting and characterization to make you feel like you are really \\"in\\" the stories as you read them. I find the stories to be a relaxing, pleasant read with characters that I can really enjoy getting a chance to \\"know\\" a bit better.Since this is a collection of related stories, rather than a novel, I found it most enjoyable to read a story, then comeback in a day or so and read the next. My biggest regret is that the author passed away (in 1983 after a struggle with cancer) and so can not write more of these wonderful stories!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I ordered this book for my granddaughter. I already have the book for myself and was very glad to get it.

My daughter loved them also and she is the one who suggested getting the book for my granddaughter."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Zenna Henderson is a fine author, reading her stories just makes me feel good, can't say enough about her.A really good choice for a young reader, but still satisfying for me.This Collection was a good start on her body of work, and I hope to see more from the publisher soon.Good price and timely delivery."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Anyone who loves Sci-fi and fantasy, or who just loves a good heartwarming, interesting read will love this collection of stories. Zenna Henderson is a masterful writer who portrays a group of very human-like aliens who are marooned on earth after the destruction of their world. They are good people, far more civilized than us, and perhaps a bit naieve. The problem is, they have some abilities that we don't, and that makes them targets for fear. This collection includes all Henderson's People stories from all her various anthologies and even some stories never seen before. All of them are guarenteed to make you smile, make you think, and even to make you cry. Absolutely marvelous!"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"One of the BEST ever. Is it science fiction? Is it fantasy?? It does not matter...it is wonderful. I hope that her writings are Never lost in the back cupboards of libraries."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Zenna Henderson's sci-fi classic short stories concerning the aliens she dubs \\"The People\\" are collected in this volume. They follow a general story line that is interesting, if it does seem something of a variation on the \\"Superman\\" and his origins theme. That being said, it's a powerful, emotional work that I enjoyed as a moody teenager and enjoyed yet again as a middle-aged man. It gives a sense of connection to those who feel they're alone in the world; at least, it did so to me when I was a boy, and many of those feelings came rushing back when I read Zenna Henderson's stories once more. A thoroughly enjoyable read, though not highly technical in its sci-fi elements."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I was introduced to these stories of The People by my mother and they have haunted me ever since with their sensitive beautiful ideas....but what's haunted me the most is I couldn't get hold of these books anywhere in the UK.

Each time it's been removed.This is the only book I've ever *returned* to Amazon. I've been a Zenna Henderson fan since I was 14. She introduced each of her \\"People\\" stories with a quote from the Bible that added nuance, meaning and great depth to each story. The New England Science Fiction folks decided to strip all that from their publication. Without so much as a word that they had, or that any of it ever existed. (They have not answered repeated letters from me asking why, or how they justified such a thing, either.)This is a Bowdlerized version of some of the greatest, most imaginative stories in SF. Avoid it like the plague. Don't let compilers who publish after an author is dead totally change the author's work to fit some agenda not the author's. If you look at Zenna Henderson's books here on Amazon, you can readily see that every other print version of her \\"People\\" books have the original introductory quotes. So this one is such an aberration I find it mind boggling.(I can't help wondering how long *this* review will last before somebody reports it. For the record, I'm calling this 4 (I've tried more than that, but we'll call this 4).)"},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"For those who want a scifi tale with blasters and aliens who look green, then go elsewhere. The People look like us but are definitely different. And similar. Mawkish? Not at all. We are shown at our best and at our worst here. I wish I could explain the beauty of Zenna Henderson's prose, the images of time and place she creates. There is one paragraph of Valancy (my favorite character) doing something that I can *see* flash before my eyes, the imagery of the tales are that strong. I don't ever want these tales to go out of print again, it would be a great loss."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I am glad to find in &quot;Ingathering&quot; a collection of 'The People Stories'. As a young man I read them and felt that they were a charge to go into the world and teach, accepting people for what they were and for what they COULD be. My only regret in reading the book is to know that there will be no more stories to warm my heart and inspire my connection to the community in which I find myself. If Zenna Henderson has no remaining blood family, she has a larger family in those whom she inspired and encouraged. &quot;The People&quot; are an example of what can be the best in all of us."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"When I was in high school my best friend, Susan, told me I HAD to read Zenna Henderson. I read both People books and \\"The Anything Box\\" and fell in love with her writing.When NESFA Press brought out \\"Ingathering: The Complete Book of the People\\" a few years back I bought a hardcover copy and reread all of \\"Pilgrimage\\", \\"The People: No Different Flesh\\" and of course went on to read the one story from \\"Holding Wonder\\" and the ones that had never been collected before. I loved her writing every bit as much as an adult as I had as a teen.Zenna Henderson was never prolific. This collection plus \\"The Anything Box\\" and \\"Holding Wonder\\" represent pretty much her entire output. She was an amazing author with stories that could pull you in and touch your heart. The alienation and isolation the people live with reminds us of times in our own life where we felt alone or different. Henderson takes these emotional elements and wraps them in science fiction that includes space travel and takes us to an alien world, The Home, that is both futuristic and lost in the past all at once. She takes us back in our own history and yet makes us think of our own future.This is truly an amazing collection."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Dunno where the Booklist reviewer got his information, But I was hooked LONG before the TV movie. Even after 35 years, the umpteenth reading of these stories can make me laugh, cry, resolve to be better myself. All these stories of a people shipwrecked among strangers are a real pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"It's hard to imagine describing a fantasy novel as sweet, but these novels by Zenna Henderson manage to earn the term in the nicest possible way. I've had Pilgrimage for at least 25 years, and it's one that I re-read when I want something calm and reassuring and centering -- an emotional cup of hot cocoa.The story -- originally written in 1961, but it ages well -- is easily summarized: A generation or so back, a spaceship of aliens crash-landed on Earth and many were separated from the others. The aliens look like us, but have unique (magical-seeming) abilities, including telepathy and levitation. The book is a collection of connected short stories told by the second generation of survivors about how they cope with being \\"different,\\" and their need to find other people who understand them. Several include love stories, both romantic love and family-connection love.But that sounds rather ho-hum. What makes this SF/F novel so special is that it's infused with compassion. There's no real Bad Guys -- just misunderstandings, and yearning, and other such internally-fed demons. Most of the well-drawn characters are unrelentingly GOOD, but not in a \\"oh give me a break\\" way -- they simply are full of innate joy. Just about everyone wants to help other people, and are frustrated when they cannot. If you're especially religious in a Judeo-Christian way (I'm not), you'll also add \\"heartwarming\\" to the labels, because there's a never-annoying undercurrent of god-is-love; my born-again friends would feel comfortable handing this book to their ten-year-old kids. (It's certainly suitable for young adults no matter what your personal spiritual beliefs.)The stories are well written, too, with love scenes that make me sigh; one of the (temporarily frustrated) characters watches a married couple greet: \\"Their hands brushed as her feet reached the ground. There it was again. That wordless flame of joy, that completeness as they met, after a long ten minutes' separation.\\" (One reason I like that description is that it reflects my own happy experience after nearly 30 years of marriage. A wordless flame of joy, indeed.)If you've been feeling emotionally battered recently and could use a couple of hours of fine storytelling in which people are NICE to each other -- I heartily recommend that you search out a copy of Pilgrimage and its sequel, No Different Flesh. They're combined in this omnibus book but both are available used for pennies; there's no excuse not to get a copy."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Ran across the works of the late Zenna Henderson by accident. An incredible author of fiction that wrote years ago, Zenna should be known as the Mother of Sci-Fi. \\"Ingathering\\" is the complete compilation of the stories of \\"The People\\"- A compelling story of a group of \\"different\\" folks. Her writing draws an image of a place you will wish you could be. Her writing HAD to draw on her actual experiences as a teacher in remote areas of the American SW.Out of print, but never out of style.

I disagree with some of the critics/reviewers--many of the stories in the other two books were &quot;People&quot; stories as well, they are just told differently.I am also glad that there were some new stories that are in this book (that weren't in Pilgrimage and The People). I think this book should be required reading in schools instead of Harry Potter and other such drivel."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"The People stories are something I read when I need a lift. They can make me teary-eyed, but that's more for wishing the People really were out there somewhere than anything. The basic theme is overcoming differences, and the underlying sameness that unites us all. If you want to teach your children, from about age 8 on up through their twenties, about loyalty, caring, sacrifice, honesty, and the superficiality of &quot;differences,&quot; these are the stories that will help you do it. Or read them for yourself, and remember that there really is a Web of Life, and that you are a part of it."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I was thrilled to see other people had read and remembered......These books guided my life and made me seek out the good in others.. I hope to someday encounter them."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I actually bought two copies--one was sent to a friend who had written a similarly Christian, not non-sf book.The take on the old Jerry Rubin counterculture title is prompted by the sheer charm of this book, which seems toi have eluded even the most positive of professional reviewers who must be either ignorant or dismissive of what is frankly Christian Science Fiction. But unlike other believer-jarring specimens (such as Michael Moorcock's \\"Behold the Man\\" or, even worse, \\"For I Am a Jealous People\\" by Lester del Rey\\"), this is a loving, sympathetic series of what-of tales based on the premise: What if earth were visited by alien humans (you can tell the unsympathetic critics by the word \\"humanoid\\") who are more spiritually advanced than we are? Many group the stories under the \\"psi powers\\" heading,(as if they were materialistically McCaffrey-like), which is so much nonsense. (As a general reporter, I've written articles about church events from which editors have pointedly removed most religious references.) The extraterrestrial abilities are clearly connected with spirituality, something you don't have to be a Bible-be.ter (which I certainly am NOT) to comprehend. In fact, Henderson, by evidence of this and some non-People stories (e. g., \\"The Closest School\\"), is strongly anti-fundamentalist (but not vindictively so, another aspect of her Christianity)It is unfortunate that these stories don't seem to be better-known; that is the only reason they might not be considered \\"beloved\\" on the scale of Asimov's Susan Calvin stories or McCaffrey's Menolly. That said, this is a Must-Have, if only for the author's ability to write plain English about seemingly technical matters without technobabble or even technical detail in a way that is matched only by Ray Brabury--and Henderson is clearly NOT such a Luddite. Her writing is not notably \\"feminine,\\" but it is straightforward, if sometimes experimental (jarringly so in the hippy-era \\"Katie-Mary's Trip\\"). She is not given to C.L. Moore-like tours-de-force. It is fitting and proper that she was a mainstay of \\"The Magazine;of Fantasy and Science Fiction;\\" I believe John W. Campbell (who did buy from McCaffrey) would have hated her. Henderson can be matter-of-factly goofy (\\"The Indelible Kind\\") and has the ability to suggest maddeningly unwritten stories (\\"Shadow in the Moon,\\" which is greatly reminiscent of Robert A. Heinlein's \\"Requiem,\\" in which we learn that one of the People was a crewmember on the Enola Gay. (A fellow fan was greatly surprised when I pointed this out to her.)I find that having visited the Grand Canyon-Meteor Crater region of Arizona is a plus for nearly all Henderson stories, but it is not essential. I do find it hard to imagine that someone who is, or has forgotten childhood contact with teachers, will be missing something, as many of her stories are from a teacher's point-of-view (I can't imagine being un-teacher-minded and reading the non-People story \\"You Know What, Teacher?\\"). Young people almost NEED to read Henderson, especially the stories that are aimed directly at them (again, a non-People story, \\"Crowning Glory\\") Which is to ask, \\"Why haven't the rest of Henderson's stories been collected into a single volume?\\"ETA: I was astonished to discover, after putting out my own book (set in a classroom of first-graders) how much of Henderson I had retained after 35 years (especially \\"The Indelible Kind\\" and \\"The Closest School\\")."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"This author was one of my very favorites when I was a teenager.

Her books have been out of print for an incredibly long time, and I have nursed my old paperbacks way past their life expectancy. When I found this single volume, more recently released, with all of the stories of The People saga, I was delighted. The stories are timeless and have to do with a group of aliens who settle on Earth for their own survival. They are magical, upbeat, and pleasant. Not technical, just nice to read.

My science teacher had SF&F periodicals and books which he made available to his students (Stranger in a Strange Land was one). I read several of the stories in magazines. I remember seeking a book edition, but this was before any of them were published in that format. And it was harder to find SF in those benighted days. But I never forgot (though I did forget the author's name, if I ever knew it). But many years later I was delighted to find the two paperback anthologies. Now those venerable volumes are becoming a bit decrepit so I am purchasing this omnibus. THANK YOU to everyone who made this possible. BTW, while I knew the locales were fictional, I often pored over maps trying to decide which places had inspired them. When I later became a convinced Friend I also wondered how much Quakers influenced the People. A lot of parallels. Finally, about the TV movie that some reviewers address, I agree it's a terrible, confused, fragmented and flawed adaptation. However, the one thing I enjoyed about it was the artwork which represented the schoolchildren's repressed inherited memories of the arrival on Earth and the persecution the refugees suffered. I found it moving and beautiful. I have often wondered who the artist was who was responsible for it. Even after watching the first broadcast I wished that they could be reproduced for sale to the public. It'd be nice if someone would make a new much better adaptation."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Discovering Zenna Henderson's books in the 1960's was one of the most enlightening experiences I've ever had.

The People she has created touch 'everyman', and we end up looking for and appreciating the gifts we have, and looking for gifts in others. Her characters come across so realistically and multidimensional, you come away with the feeling that Ms. Henderson knows something wonderful that we don't... and we genuinely hope she does. And the hope and wonder haunts you for long after you close the book."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"Knowing a little of her bio, it seems obvious that one of the compelling reasons for her success as an author is the wellspring of her own personal tragedy that makes her stories so golden genuine and not mere sicky sweet fantasy or moralizing as too often happens to the point where if folk were honest they wouldn't call most of today's stuff the pretended \\"science\\" fiction it clearly is not and can not be, trashing most of genuine science out of often grossly arrogant, irreligious bias ironically being judgmental about and finger-pointing at \\"others\\" that are claimed to be judgmental, today's usual hypocrisy especially popular among proud, so-called \\"liberals,\\" (as meaningless a term as the \\"conservative\\" or imaginary \\"left/right\\" bifurcation employed by thoughtless and ignorant bigotry) but would call it the straight fiction or fantasy it really is, such hypocrisy being usually refreshingly absent with Henderson (not that anyone is ever fully free of it) in her very appealing personal approach.PSAs usual, my PS is longer than what it follows! For those hoping to find Shatner's \\"People\\" movie representative of Henderson's stories, realize that it's a sad jumble and hash of more than one of her stories that it seems really requires a previous knowledge of them successfully to sort things out. That's not to say it's impossible to enjoy the flick on its own terms, but it will likely disappoint a true Henderson fan as not especially faithful to the story, commonplace when tv gets a story and only rarely fails to spoil if not ruin it. Shatner's character is supposed to be a genial OLD \\"Doc\\" in the original stories, but of course Hollywood always must think \\"sex appeal\\" in their trashy little minds and so of course regrettably brings in sexy Captain Kirk to ruin Henderson's beautiful story that thankfully survives said \\"Kirk\\" attack. How much greater Henderson's wise understanding of fiction was than anything Roddenberry ever imagined! for hers is like the great C.S. Lewis's understanding of \\"science fiction\\" from another age, seen in Lewis's \\"Perelandra\\" triology (1. Out of the Silent Planet, 2. Perelandra, 3. That Hideous StrengthPerelandra (Cosmic Trilogy)), requiring a depth of learning and understanding like Lewis's that is almost impossible in and unknown to the current nave and shallow Star Trek/Star Wars/Stargate universe."},{"Title":"Ingathering: The Complete People Stories of Zenna Henderson","review":"I purchased this book from Amazon.com.

I was 2 years old when the first one was published and until she died in 1960 my mother never failed to read the next story out loud so I would learn more about the beloved People. Many of them she read to me many times. They evoked wonderful dreams and thoughts to such a young girl. I was in my mid-teens before I found out they weren't true - I was devastated then and almost 50 years after meeting the People I'm still devastated to think that it isn't possible that somewhere they are still hiding waiting for society to be ready for them and their love.

Well, my dear and beloved Zenna, it was your own fault. You somehow tapped into the deep subconscious longings (memories, even?) of millions of people, and they believed. In fact, while \\"The People\\" stories are categorized as science fiction, they're much more. The People are who we would love to be, our innermost aspirations to goodness, cooperation, power well used and a deeply ethical center. By now, most people who would be interested know that The People are refugees from a planetary disaster who evacuated their world and headed off in all directions. Some few landed on Earth and, hiding their differences, tried to fit in here. And oh, what differences! Where we harnessed the power of machines, they grew their mental powers, enabling them to fly (\\"lift\\"), see into other to help them heal emotionally (\\"sorters\\") and physically (\\"sensitives\\"). and much more. These enchanting abilities exist in the setting of very decent people you're sure to love, and believe.My high-school age introduction to the series was \\"Pottage,\\" a story of reclamation and small heroisms that become as big as sunrise. It was an apt introduction, and to this day, nearly 50 years later, I can't read it... or even talk about it... dry-eyed. Somehow Zenna Henderson taps into language in an unusual way, accessing emotions and forgotten innocence. Her characters are earthy yet somehow angelic, flawed in their way, but devoted to growth. While Ms. Henderson spent some time as a religious person, and the stories are filled with Biblical references and allusions, the only thing we know of The People's belief system is something they call \\"the Presence,\\" and that life does not end with physical death. There is no preaching here, nothing to separate. And if some consider the stories \\"mawkish,\\" I sorrow for their loss. This is not mere sentimentality. The power of the prose itself would be enough; the vein of goodness that runs through it raises it to the level of literary treasure.I could go on, but what a disservice I would do to the divine prose of Zenna Henderson, who tells her story best in her own way. Once you've begun to read INGATHERING you may find yourself hungering to read the rest of these stories, and believing more about your own capabilities and depth in this life. I cannot recommend this book highly enough except to say that, if I were to be stranded on the proverbial desert island (as Earth became to the early People) and could have only one book for the rest of my life, it would be this one, without hesitation.

I used sections from them in my college papers, an entire story, \\"Turn the Page\\", as the basis for completing one of my education classes. A few years after I first read her, I wrote a letter to Ms. Henderson and mailed it off, the only time I had ever written to an author.

Takes us through history - into the life of Francis Beaufort, a man obsessed with recording his observations of the world around him in exquisite detail, to others who influenced him and who he influenced (including passing mention of Charles Darwin). This is not just about the wind but about natural science and its history, how we observe and express ourselves, and the joy of learning and discovery. I'd recommend it for all ages."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"Up there with Endurance, Cod, Ice, and Longitude as far as non fiction goes. One of the smoothest reads in a long time, I have kept thinking about this book and kept thinking about this book. I am so glad I read it, as it explained one of the great pieces of human science in a wonderfully entertaining yet in-depth manner. Hats off to Mr. Huler. He has done a superb job at crafting a compelling story about a tiny gem from the past."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"In Mr Huler's introduction he relates his experience as a copy editor. The high goal of the editor, he says, is to bring a piece of writting to its clear essence. To remove the unneeded, the clutter. He states this is in large part what he finds beautiful in the Beaufort Scale. Then Mr. Huler proceeds to create a book that I found to be very cluttered, distracted and tedious. The story is in there and it is interesting. But it is buried. A book half the size would have been ample and easier to read. I finally gave up on it."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"Defining The Wind by Scott Huler is a special book that combines two of my loves in life - earth science and language. Huler, a writer who is NOT a science writer by trade, fell in love with the Beaufort [Wind] Scale in 1983 while a copy editor scanning a copy of the dictionary. He was so impressed with the 110 words of the scale and their simple but poetic qualities, he embarked on an extended intellectual journey to discover the scale's author. Defining The Wind is Huler's wonderful retelling of that journey. Along the way, Huler learns to draw, learns to help sail a tall ship, and rummages through many a dusty archive. Without spoiling anything, I can tell you that Huler discovers that Francis Beaufort did not write the version of the scale that Huler fell in love with. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in meteorology, surveying, the ocean, sailing tall ships, history, or the use of language in science. Random thought: I wonder if this would be a good book to give to a teenage writer or artist who doesn't see the benefit of taking science and math classes in high school?"},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"This is a thoroughly engaging true-life detective story. The author, Scott Huler, was struck by the poetic beauty of the Beaufort Scale, a way to determine the force and velocity of the wind by how it moves objects, i.e. \\"small trees in leaf begin to sway - MPH 19-24 - Name, fresh breeze - Beaufort # 5. He set out to discover the art of Sir Francis Beaufort. Through his search he shines a light on the what the essence of poetry is and the fact that nothing is born of itself."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. It is a vivid introduction into the life of times of Admiral Beaufort, and the history of defining the wind. This book was well worth the money and the time to read it. It awakens in the reader the spirit of discovery and exploration that imbued Beauforts age. Mr. Huler gets a bit sentimental about his subject which detracts a bit from the story (hence 4 not 5 starts). Bottom line: you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"For an author who repeatedly touches on his admiration of the beauty of the writing Admiral Beaufort brought to the wind scale, the writing style of \\"Defining the Wind\\" falls short for me. It seems the author couldn't quite decide if the book was an academic text or a popular history volume and the inconsistency grated on me. Especially the use of pop culture references feels gratuitous (e.g. use of \\"white Ford Bronco\\" for a simile for a slow moving sailing ship) and makes a book that could be readable for years seem dated almost out of the wrapper. The book also seems very repetitive. The same source text is referenced often in chapters that seemingly are about a new topic. I think the book was worth reading, I just found the author and the writing style came to the forefront much too often as I read instead of the content and Admiral Beaufort himself."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"This book has a little something for everybody - for historians, it has a little science; for scientists a little history, for the rest of us an amusing story of the fun of losing oneself in research. I enjoyed learning some history not just of Beaufort, but of the time in which he lived, particularly of the state of science at that time. Plus, even as a land lubber I found the sailing info interesting.Huler seemed a bit breathless about his personal discovery of how important it is to keenly observe one's world. This, coupled with his occasional inaccurate use of terms like \\"fission,\\" betrays that the author is an arts guy not a sciences guy. (Although unlike our president, I would bet that Huler does know the difference between \\"nukuler\\" energy and \\"nuclear\\" energy.) The inaccuracies would be less grating if Huler realized that carefully observing one's world is quite a natural activity for the science-oriented segment of his reading audience, and probably for a big chunk of the rest of his readers.Short of the proselytizing about this observing stuff, I found the book informative, and it threw some perspective on the evolution of thought during the 18th and 19th centuries. Overall, an enjoyable read if you just let the overdone parts breeze by."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"The first seven reviews cover both the pleasures and problems with this book. For me, the major disappointment was in the almost cavalier way that the author dispenses with the actual writer of the 110 words of descriptions that inspired his research into Beaufort and everyone/everything associated with that amazing character. After over 200 pages of so much detail and background, all we are told about the 'North Shields observer' takes up less than 4 pages. I for one would have loved to have seen more examples of this person's writing style! It is a mystery to me why neither the author nor his agents would have thought a more complete description of the community, buildings and people involved would have been a natural 'fit' with the rest of the story.The author salvaged (for me at least) a fourth star with his closing chapter on the 'Beaufort moment'; the act of true interaction and awareness of the world around us instead of relying on pure data alone. His observation that technology alone will never take the place of personal observation and involvement is something to remember and cherish, and ALMOST makes me forgive his skating over the true writer of the scale's poetic text.An enjoyable read, a wonderful book to dip into and savor, worth discovering for all the 'degrees of separation' that connect Beaufort with other prominent names from that time in history."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"One of those bizarre little books we often find in our local (independent)bookstore. While it does give the background and construction of the Beaufort Wind Scale, it's more about the men who believe that \\"nature, rightly questioned, never lies.\\" Men like Darwin,Defoe, Capt Cook and all the explorers of the 18th century. What started the author on his quest was not so much the scale as the description of the wind at different speeds. He's teaching us that you can learn more by observing than by measuring. Sometime, look in the dictionary at the wind scale descriptions. You're more likely to remember \\"wind extends light flag\\" than Beaufort #3 at 4-7 miles per hour. This book is great for writers and artists who really need to learn to not only look but to see."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"The Beaufort Scale encourages us to pay attention. This book is a history of the Beaufort Scale, a descriptive list of categories by which to define wind. Surprisingly poetic and elegantly precise, the Beaufort Scale is used by sailors, meteorologists, kiters, and anyone just fascinated with wind. With descriptions of smoke, leaves, branches, trees, umbrellas and inland waters, the 1906 Beaufort Scale classifies wind strength from 0-12. The author's wry wit flavors the text which chronicles in depth the mysterious genius Admiral Francis Beaufort, the history of wind measurement, the development of the Beaufort Scale, and its unexpected influence on poetry, music, and art. The Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale and the Fujita-Pearson tornado scale we hear of on the evening news are, in their elegant descriptive simplicity, descendants of the Beaufort Scale."},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"I read Mr. Huler's short piece on the wonders of the Beaufort Scale in a NYT op-ed a few years ago, and it was so good, I ran right out for the book. It was even better than I'd hoped -- a delightful, delightful adventure of the mind, and side-aching hilarious at times. I wasn't disappointed by the short section on the \\"real\\" inventor of the scale, because although Mr. Huler's research and the adventures it entailed are fascinating, that wasn't the point of the book at all to me. He gets so much into this little book; I learned everything from the life of a copywriter to the mystery of how science changed in the 19th Century (and no one really knows why). Best of all was spending a little time in the company of someone who can look at a wind velocity scale and see a haiku. Thank you, Mr. Huler, for teaching me how to read!"},{"Title":"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","review":"As a child, I owned a book about storms. I don't recall much of the specifics, but I do remember a table categorizing the different wind forces. Though I didn't really think much of it at the time, this was the Beaufort Scale, which creates 13 categories for wind, from 0 - Calm to 12 - Hurricane. Each force is defined by not only a wind speed but also a description; for example, Calm is described as \\"calm; smoke rises vertically.\\" For Scott Huler, the Beaufort Scale is the best piece of descriptive writing ever, a blend of science and poetry; his adoration of the Scale resulted in Defining the Wind.Defining the Wind is an ode to and a history of the Beaufort Scale. Of course, one of the principal parts of this history would be Beaufort himself, and Huler's biography of this British admiral is one component of the book. Francis Beaufort did a lot of wonderful hydrographic and cartographic work for the British navy in the first part of the nineteenth century. His role in developing the Beaufort Scale, however, was only partial.Huler gives us the history of the Scale. Beaufort was not the first to develop such a scale, but he did implement the zero-to-twelve system and came up with descriptions that focused more on the sea than the land. The actual wording of the modern Beaufort Scale - which can be found in most full-sized dictionaries - was created a half-century after Beaufort's death. Even the attachment of his name to the Scale was done after he died, so it isn't like he really tried to steal the idea for his own glory; he merely improved on existing scales for the benefit of the Navy (and science).The big lesson in the book is the importance of description in scales. Most people like to break things down into an organized fashion. We love lists - the top ten songs or the top 100 movies - and we enjoy scales. Even the Amazon reviewing system employs a scale - from one to five stars - and we often use the scale to make judgments about what to buy (or see or eat). But the Amazon scale is truly subjective: what three stars means varies from person to person.What the Beaufort scale does is not only provide a quantitative value for a certain type of wind (for example, a gentle breeze is 8-12 miles per hour), but also a qualitative one (\\"leaves and small twigs in constant motion; wind extends a light flag\\"). The difference between a gentle and light breeze is not only no longer subjective, it can also be seen by those who don't have an anemometer. It's as if a four-star Amazon review was defined as \\"a book of 500+ pages with at least seven characters and twenty chapters\\"; that might be a silly definition in the case of a book review, but at least people would know exactly what they were getting (of course, in that case, no \\"average\\" rating would be required).Although Defining the Wind does ramble a bit in places, overall Huler has done an excellent job in making a subject interesting that most people don't even really think about. If you like reading about weather-related topics (or have a scientific or historical bent), this can be a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Philosophy And Myth In Karl Marx","review":"I have no idea what book John C, Landon is critiquing below, but it is not Philosophy & Myth in Karl Marx. This work by Tucker is astounding. After having read so many works pro and con on Marx and Marxism, this work opens up the vistas of Marx's thought free of either biter hatred, dismissal and diatribes as well as the revisionism and neo-Marxism of fervent true believers out to protect what they have been told Marx says, having never read him fully.Tucker takes you on a history of the underlying philosophy that influenced Marx from German Ideal Philosophy and Romanticism to of course Hegelianism, but this is no dry read. It is vibrant, exciting and a true page turner. I was sad when the book ended. Whether you are pro or con as far as Marx is concerned, you will come out of reading this book with at least an admiration for the intellectual that he was and a deeper and greater appreciation of the elements that have gone into making the modern and postmodern mind.If you are a Marxist or lean that way this book will give you a great indepth understanding of Marx that you won't get from any other work and if you are on the right, this book will give you an understanding of so much of progressive thinking that seems incoherent to you. Along the way you will both be surprised as Tucker, in fully reviewing older Marxism, the ideas that Marx actually wrote, also brings out the areas of his thought where he actually agrees with classical liberal/libertarian ideas. This makes neo-Marxists pensive and turn reactionary as they can't have anyone, especially true believers reading that Marx and classical liberals had a lot of things in common. The meta-narrative today is that classical liberalism was fascist, so you cant have it linked to the founder of scientific socialism.This book is a tour de force not to be missed, no matter what the dry reactionary neo-Marxists think and comment here."},{"Title":"Philosophy And Myth In Karl Marx","review":"It is an excellent book; it seeks to explain the roots of Marxism, defined as the actual &quot;thought&quot; of Karl Marx rather than &quot;Marxism&quot; in the hands of Lenin and others. Tucker's conclusions are, to say the least, doubtful (do however decide this for yourself), but that doesn't blemish the impressive scope and quality of his scholarship."},{"Title":"Philosophy And Myth In Karl Marx","review":"One of the strange secrets of Marx is that you can often learn more about him from his critics than from his defenders. Then ironically Marx's critiques, if not his theories which get in the way, often spring to life again. This Transaction reprint is like walking past an old canon on a battlefield and induces one to reopen old battles in one's mind to the point of rubbing salt in old wounds. One thinks of the Prussian official inviting Schelling back to the Universities to 'uproot the dragon seed of Hegelianism'. This approach to Marx critique wishes to uproot the whole of German philosophy starting with Kant (armed with Karen Horney's view on psychoanalysis, it seems) and that's both its weakness and curious eccentric interest. It's instructive to watch someone who has the nerve, almost naivete, to try. Hegel has a few dangerous themes in his work, and this strain entered Marx. Without agreeing, one can consider an 'expose' of a side of Hegel that is factored out of all treatments by his fans. But Kant, Hegel and Marx can't be lumped together in such a cavalier fashion. It seems at points like the book's real villain is Hegel. That approach, way before Fukuyama and his 'end of history' pastiche, would be rejected out of hand now that Hegel is back in the propaganda business, and it has to be admitted the author is perhaps off the mark on every other page. But every _other_ page is curiously apt.The way in which Hegel influenced Marx and Marxists is a philosophical tragedy in itself as teleological thinking and potential violence come into conjuncition. To pin that on Marx and use Hegel for justifying capitalism as 'cunning of reason' is a bit stinkpotish. Great confusion resulted from the attempts to graft Hegel onto a social-economic critique and a century of leftists have never figured it out. I doubt if this book does either, but if you want to survive at home plate you have to figure all the curve balls from different pitchers. If you are just looking for talking points against Marx here, you would do well to be wary of this book. The age of Freud on Kant has passed and these old fashioned potshots look absurd now. But it is a work every Marxist ought to read. And this book is and remains interesting, no matter that Hegel is now back in the mystification business and Marx said to be discredited."},{"Title":"A Theory of Art","review":"Karol Berger is one of the leading musicologists of his generation, and among the most thoughtful.

The young woman at the checkout counter was mesmerized by the image as well. The illustrations inside equal or surpass the one on the cover.The images are detailed but not fussy. They are highly evocative of German Romanticism -- very moody, dreamy, somewhat melancholy, with an emphasis on the grandeur of Nature. If you enjoy the illustrations of Maurice Sendak, Edward Gorey, Arthur Rackham, et al., you will like this book.Like Barrett's artwork, Poole's text tells the classic tale soberly, including the queen's botched attempts to strangle Snow White with silken laces and prick her with a poison comb. There is also more mention of Snow White's mother and father than in many retellings. This version is certainly more in line with magical/mystical/matriarchal imagery than Disney's.Some of the images -- e.g., drops of blood -- and the story itself may be too intense for very young readers. For me, this book is a contemporary gem and is worth seeking out."},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"SO many things to love about this book, this version of Snow White. It's not sanitized, the binding on the inside is a two page spread of a glossy ebony tree, against spellbinding white snow and one stain of red blood - every single image is exquisite, I could describe them all poetically.As usual the young queen bears a girl and dies, the king remarries a \\"superlatively beautiful queen\\", who \\"also had a proud heart and a greedy, jealous temper\\".So the story goes on as usual, but is somehow injected with new Excitement! new Pathos.Although snow white is supremely silly, and the prince falls in love far too easily, the Dwarves are excellently drawn & written.Instead of being humorous shovel-totting twats they're just stolid kindly woodsmen who grow fond of poor young SW.The story is retold very nicely and fresh, but it is the paintings that make this book priceless.Every single page is a peek into an enchanted world, moody romantic & mysterious.kotori ojadis@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"I read the story as a youngster and I never ever forgot this haunting retelling of the classic fairy tale.

In a straightfoward and impartial manner, Yin-Shun clearly writes of the strengths and weaknesses of varying approaches to the Buddhadharma, the beneficial effects of practice and harmful effects of common misconceptions and misguided practice.It seems that every corner of Buddhism is touched upon, to provide solid direction for the interested person or the advanced practicioner.His writings are so clear and deep, that I held my head in awe of the understanding and compassion of the Dharma.

Master Yinshun was concerned with finding the common ground between the various practices and sects that emerged (Pure Land, Chan, Tiantai, etc.) and showing how these different teachings, whose proponents were sometimes at odds with each other, can be harmonized. In this, Yinshun not only re-asserted the fundamentals of Buddhist tradition, but brought new insights into how the philosophical systems- madhyamaka, yogacara, tathagatagarbha- can be integrated.

The author begins with the foundations of Buddhism, common to all Buddhist sects (Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Five Moral Precepts, etc) and gradually works his way into Mahayana Buddhism in particular, then ultimately reaches the teachings of the Bodhisattva Path. The book has a very clear flow throughout.The detail and depth of research is unprecedented as well, as he covers practically every topic in Buddhism from meditation, chanting, devotion, tantra, Bodhisattvas, Buddhas and so on. This is a book worth referring to over and over again just because so much can be found in this one book. Some Buddhist texts haven't been widely translated into English either, so there's a lot of hidden gems not normally found in Western books.Also, Ven. Yin-Shun, being a respected Chan Buddhist himself, speaks from experience. The book does not contain anecdotes, but he does speak on current trends in Buddhism, and also explains carefully the various types of meditation, and how to go about practicing them (again, relying on extensive Buddhist texts).This is a challenging book to read just because of its size and depth, and Ven. Yin-Shun is actually writing for a Chinese, not Western audience, but if you're familiar with Buddhism and want more depth and understanding, this definitely should be your next purchase.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Way to Buddhahood: Instructions from a Modern Chinese Master","review":"The author offers a completelly new way of meditation. And I should say it's a very intresting way what works for me!"},{"Title":"The Way to Buddhahood: Instructions from a Modern Chinese Master","review":"I have to say that when I picked up this book, I expected nothing short of being blown away, going by what others had said. When I first began reading it, I found the book nauseating, much to my surprise (a funny thing about expectations, huh?). He begins the book by affirming the humanity and rationality behind Buddhism, and then, in the following pages, takes the tone of an overbearing parent instead of that of a thoughtful and rational Buddhist priest. I soon realized that the rhetoric is a product of his Chinese culture, and that the resistance that prevailed in me during these first few pages more a result of our clashing cultural conditioning, rather than any dispute of substance.After I saw through this rhetoric and opened up to his teachings, I was amazed at how much he managed to condense so much in so few pages - clearly the fruits of long and careful contemplation. However, the Chinese grandpa rhetoric often obscures his brilliant intellect, sometimes explaining and justifying practices by merely stating that we should do it because it's the best and that any other way is heretical and the product of a deluded mind. At other moments, particularly in his careful explanation of dependent co-arising, he manages to explain such a subtle teaching with utter clarity.In his overview, though, he oddly omits all of Vajryana Buddhism while simultaneously claiming that this book embodies the culmination and integration of all Buddhist schools teachings and thought, and this characterizes much of the book, a careful selection of texts and ideologies to fit his tidy system. It would not be so precarious an omission if he did not, while omitting certain texts that blatantly contradict one another, also claim that we should in no way entertain heretical, non-Buddhist schools of thought because they will ultimately lead to further delusion and suffering.His explanations of karma and the six realms also fail to pass the scrutiny of a rational, empirical mind, explaining that hungry ghosts and the hells could exist beneath the earth's crust, while giving no thorough explanation of karma except for that tired Buddhist analogy of a flame and candle.One point that he emphasizes, and which I truly appreciated, was that teachings depend on the abilities and tendencies of the student and the culture in which he lives, challenging any sort of orthodox leanings that think \\"Zen,\\" \\"Vajryana,\\" or \\"Therevada\\" is the true way. Although I don't think this was entirely his intent (he still seemed pretty stuck on the Greater Way as being the only road towards liberation and Buddhahood), it opened me up to realize that people are very different from me, and what inspires and works for them might be totally different from what inspires and works for me, even though we ultimately pursue the same path. Anything that gets people unstuck from this profound and blinding attachment certainly gets my endorsement.I would also like to respond to some of the other viewers comments. First, the meditation instruction he gives are quite spare. I can only recall a scant few pages in which he goes over actual practices, and that the little information he did provide was hardly enough for me to then jump on my cushion and start meditating. On the other hand, his explanation of the fruits of meditation practice, in between his exhortations, I found extremely insightful and helpful.Also, to the reviewer who thought that this somehow compared to the vast ocean of Buddhist scripture and commentary, I must say that this book hardly scratches the surface in terms of their profundity and subtlety. This book does not compare to the Diamond Sutra or Lotus Sutra and the rich commentary surrounding each.One of the main problems that I had with this text was the attitude it took towards this world, hearkening back to ancient Pali texts in its rejection of the material world and its single-minded focus on the dharmakaya as being somehow separate from the nirmanakaya, or the samsaric world. Just something to be wary of, as this seems to contradict the defining characteristic of Mahanaya Buddhism, that samsara is nirvana, and, in line with that, a greater sensitivity to and appreciation of this body and all its afflictions. Yin-shun believes that the defining quality is the emphasis on extinction and nirvana among the Therevadan tradition, while the Mahayana rejects nirvana in this lifetime for the continued benefit of all beings. He strangely omits how many Therevadan traditions include Bodhissatva vows and focus on helping others achieve liberation before themselves.Despite its shortcomings, I would still readily suggest this book to any long-time student of any of the Mahayana schools who has not yet taken the time to study the different sects of Buddhism and is stuck on their way being the only way, or to beginners and novices of the Mahayana school, as this book manages to provide in clear prose, although somewhat didactic and paternal at times, the full range of Mahayana practice and thought, as well as the foundational ideas which underpin it."},{"Title":"Story","review":"This is not a review of the book that I purchased because I still have not received it.

The book is especially useful for playwrights and scriptwriters seeking to craft universally compelling tales."},{"Title":"Mustangs and Unicorns: History of the 359th FG","review":"Author Jack Smith and Pictorial Histories Publishing Company produced this excellent, well-illustrated history of the 359th FG in 1997. One of the 8th AF's lesser-known groups, the 359th FG was also one of the last Mighty Eighth groups to enter combat. First flying combat in mid-December 1943, they destroyed 351 e/a in the air and on the ground. They also were prolific train busters. Their efforts earned the Group a DUC. The wartime history of the 359th and that of its postwar successors are comprehensively covered in this well-done volume.Initially equipped with P-47 Thunderbolts, the 359th later re-equipped with P-51 Mustangs. They soon earned a reputation for close escort, their original commander, COL. A. P. Tacon, demanding that Group pilots stay with the bombers rather than chase off after Luftwaffe aircraft. The 359th was the first to use Mustangs in dive-bombing, were the first to down an Me 163 and also were involved in a 'friendly fire' mission wherein Group pilots downed nine Russian Yak fighters! Group aces included John Murphy, George Doersch and Ray Wetmore. Postwar reincarnations of the Group flew P-51s, F-86s, F-84s, F-4s and C-130s.Smith does a workmanlike job of relating the Group's birth and combat history, relating events using a day-by-day format. Though he doesn't use first-person reminiscences or combat reports, he nicely summarizes the air battles and strafing missions flown by the Group and the subsequent postwar activities.A big plus for the book are the hundreds of well-reproduced b&w; and color photographs, many of them previously unseen, that run throughout the book. Fighter buffs will undoubtedly enjoy all the shots of pilots, aircraft, air combat scenes, crashes, etc.Unless something better comes along, MUSTANGS & UNICORNS, A HISTORY OF THE 359TH FG will stand as the definitive history of this little-known but deadly 8th AF fighter group.

The Agency is substantial stuff -- and it was a full on inspiration for my own book, The Mailroom, which came later, and covered the Wm Morris Agency in part. Classic stuff, this book."},{"Title":"The Agency: William Morris and the Hidden History of Show Business","review":"After seeing this book referenced in a couple Hollywood biographies, I expected to have a book filled with interesting insider stories of the movie and TV business. Instead this lengthy historical project is filled with page after page of unfamiliar names of agents and the stars are only peripheral to the story.The main problem is that the author tries to cover too much territory--explaining almost 100 years of the William Morris agency. The beginning years of vaudeville could have been covered in a few paragraphs instead of 50 pages. The minute details of insignificant agents should have been left out and instead the focus could have been on the Hollywood stars served by the agents.There are a few interesting tidbits, but rarely is any detail given to any subject. The early years of television include some often unheard facts about how stars were drawn to the tube. But major events in the business get a paragraph or two. Most of it is based on second-hand research from others books, which results in a number of mistakes by omission or \\"facts\\" taken out of context.At almost 500 pages, it's a long, tedious bore that will only be of interest to entertainment historians. It's not for those looking for an entertaining read filled with insights into how Hollywood works."},{"Title":"Here Come the Brides","review":"Fantastically funny book!

I also didn't want to pay $2,000 for a sleep study that would tell me I needed more pills and better sleep hygiene! Having suffered from insomnia for eight years, I was ready for a real solution.Two things caught my eye about this book. One, a large percentage of the reviewers were medical professionals who used the method in their practices. Two, the book suggested an approach that would actually relax the body and calm the mind, not drug it or try to control everything around it and hope it behaves. This was what I was looking for!After trying the methods, I can confirm that they work spectacularly; however, I do have a word of caution on the methods.

The author calls this exercise \\"the healer\\" and, from what I understand, it is one of his own patented \\"mini-moves\\". In this book you'll find several mini-moves to practice and learn (with a partner, of course, as it is difficult to learn the mini-moves by yourself) based upon what type of sleeper you are. Are you a \\"nervous sleeper\\"? Perhaps you are a \\"tense sleeper\\"? Maybe you're \\"just plain sleepless\\".

(Instead, see \\"The Cartoon Guide to Statistics\\", or Feller's \\"Intro to Probability\\".) The writing is willfully obscure and florid (though, admittedly, entertaining): gymkhana, panjandrum, kubiagenesis?My main objection is the lack of insight: the author does (mostly) correct computations and statements but seldom shows much depth of understanding and rarely conveys any to the reader.Rather than answering questions or giving examples that convey the meaning of the theory, how it lets you understand questions, Epstein does many unillustrative examples.This book won't teach you to understand games and gambling, which it could do and should do.At best, it provides a basis from which you can (after too much work) begin to understand games. This is not because the subject is that hard (at least not what Epstein covers) -- it's because the material is undigested and Epstein is a poor expositor.If you want to get something out of this book, be prepared to do the work that Epstein hasn't, and to look at more modern and insightful references.Here's an example: how many times do you need to shuffle a deck before it's essentially random? Very natural question, of big interest in gambling. Epstein gives a very slick argument, one of the gems of the book (measure entropy of a shuffle) that you need at least 5 shuffles - but beyond that just writes some equations for 2 shuffles of a 4-card deck and says that a computer would help, and instead tabulates that 18 perfect shuffles of a 58-card deck return it to the original state. (See the Wikipedia article on \\"Shuffling\\" for a much better discussion, with links to references.)The rest of the book is like this: some question begging for study, perhaps an insight, and then irrelevant and pedantic computations and tables.There are gems in here (it's a grab-bag), and the writing is often amusing, but it's a frustrating read: it could be so much better."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"This book covers the mathematics behind gambling, in an extraordinarily well-written yet technical manner. The author covers all sorts of games such as blackjack and bridge, and provides mathematical derivations of all sorts of probabilities. There is also a most interesting discussion of the pari-mutuel system used in wagering on horses. A good assortment of challenging problems for the reader are also presented.The only warning I would give is that the book is probably not suitable for someone who has at least taken 1 university course in calculus and algebra. While Epstein doesn't use any advanced math, there are certainly a lot of formulas and a certain familiarity with math is essential.This being said, the book is a classic in its field. If you're interested in the mathematical study of gambling you will not be disappointed. This is one book that you can read many times and always find something new and interesting to try."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"I would mostly echo the positive reviewers of this book. This book is indeed a classic in the field of probability theory and applied statistics. It is also a great book for people who want a serious, math-intensive treatment of gambling.I am writing this review mostly to deal with the criticism that this book has received from some of the other reviewers. I would agree with those critics that this book is not for the faint of heart. This book does require a certain comfort level with mathematics.However, I don't think it's all that fair to bash this book for those alleged faults. Mr. Epstein's book does not pretend to be anything other than a serious treatment (and a serious treatment would require a great deal of mathematical analysis) of gambling. In fact, the serious analysis of gambling is what gave rise to the mathematical disciplines of probability and statistics. Mr. Epstein is (was) an engineer and the book makes that very clear. FAIR criticism would be based on citing problems with the book based on what the book was INTENDED to be. UNfair criticism of this book is based on what the mathematically challenged reader HOPED it would be.BTW, I do agree with the math-challenged critics that there are some good books out there dealing with a more math-oriented approach to gambling that were written with the intention of appealing to people who wanted to make use of such information and wanted a lighter touch on the math. Among them are the *Theory of Poker* by Skalansky and the other books mentioned on this page."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"To the reader who was frustrated by the title of Chapter one, 'Kubeiagenesis', and could not find a definition.-genesis, is first defined as a suffix, meaning 'origin'.Kubeia comes from The New Testament Greek Lexicon.Kubeia (koo-bi'-ah). Definition 1. dice playing 2. metaphor for the deception of men, because dice players sometimes cheated and defrauded their fellow players.Translated to english in Ephesians as both 'sleight' (KJV) and 'trickery' (NAS).Clearly, Kubeiagenesis is meant to be the origin of sleight, trickery, and deception.That it is the first word of the text may be to inform the reader that what follows may be nonintuitive -- but is well defined, documented, and referenced. You may find yourself reading several of the referenced texts before completing the book if you are going to absorb it all.This book is the Bible on the subject. The author brilliantly interweaves relevant stories, and shows connections to disciplines outside mathematics and gaming. If you simply want answers and don't care how they were calculated, try some of the other texts offered. If you want to understand the subject -- buy this book."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"Don't read this book if you're a poker player who knows how to divide your outs by number of unseen cards but never took any serious math courses. This is a serious mathematical treatment of gambling.If you want a more rigorous treatment of the general statistical theory involved in gambling (in general, not just for poker) then this is a book you MUST read. Are you a full or part-time mathematician? Are you someone who took some math courses and is interested in learning about how to mathematically describe different games that involve gambling? Are you wanting to write a computer program to simulate statistical games based on solid mathematics and understand your program? This book is something you don't want to overlook if you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of those questions. If you answered with a resounding &quot;no&quot; to all of them and are just interested in a particular game and aren't mathematically inclined then you want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic is a superbly written book comtaining much knowledge about gambling and assessing the odds for specific games. Epstein begins with an overview of statistics and gambling, followed by chapters on specific items, like dic and coins, and specific games, like blackjack, bridge, and even chess. One caveat: you need more than a rudimentary knowledge of statistics to fully appreciate this book. Also, the book was written in the 1970's before poker (in general) and hold 'em (in specific) became popular. If you are buying The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic to analyze poker, I would recommend looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"From the number of stars above, you know I really liked this book. It is difficult to review such a book because you have to think about the intended audience. I think the intended audience is me; someone who is mathematically literate, who is looking over probability and statistical thinking applied to games of chance, or who might be otherwise modestly interested in such. The intended audience is probably not a professional probabilist. The intended audience is definitely not your average gambler. As such, the specialist and the average person may not be well served by this book. But, for the scientist, engineer or recreational mathematician who might be reviewing material on combinatorics, probability and statistics, or interested in applying it to different \\"games\\" (like markets), this book is a work of beauty. The author is witty, informative and he picks lively subject: I was never bored. A most entertaining way to review probability in general, and the mathematics of gambling. There are other books on the mathematics of gambling games which treat the subject differently, or in greater detail, but for a medium-light read on the subject: one that includes actual mathematics, without drowning in detail and formalism, it's hard to beat Epstein's book."},{"Title":"The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic, Revised Edition","review":"If you have exceptional mathematic and linguistic skills you will find this book a delight. For the remaining 99.99% of us, it will just be an unintelligible frustration.The author is most proficient at making the simple, complex; and the complex, unfathomable.The whole point of this type of book is to inform. If it can not be understood it cannot inform.It is no suprise to me that the author has only written this one book. If he concentrated more or making sure his obvious knowledge was disseminated, and less upon circumlocutionary linguistic eloquence, I'm sure he would sell more books.

Williamson's style is akin to Thomas Hardy, especially in the lengthy nature descriptions throughout the work. At times, Williamson allows an almost obsessive [autobiographical??] bitterness to overwhelm the plot development in the second half of the work and overtake the portrayal of Philip Maddison. Still, the work has great merit and should be read as a whole, though it weighs in at 7,000-8,000 pages. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"A fox under my cloak","review":"This series of books (15 in all that make up A Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight) is a wonderful journey of discovery, history and vivid storytelling. Williamson's novel is brilliant. Each volume stands on its own, but is best read from the beginning to truly experience the cycle of Phillip Maddison's (and one's own in some way) life. Volume 15, The Gale of the World, makes one want to start again from the beginning. An epic tale.

I was able to guess both the Executioner and how the two stories involving Glitsky and Hardy were going to converge half way through the book. The next 200 odd pages were then difficult to get through.Lescroart still retains his captivating style and warm characters but this book is living off the success of his last couple with constant references to events from the First Law. If I hadn't read The First Law before this one I would have struggled to understand what all the references to the previous year was about.I would only recommend this book to his die hard fans."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"THE SECOND CHAIR is an excellent addition to the series of legal thrillers by John Lescroart featuring San Francisco lawyer Dismas Hardy and his good friend Abe Glitsky, recently promoted to Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau. While the novel is adequate as a standalone story, I don't believe that I would have rated it as highly without the detailed background knowledge of Abe's and Diz's experiences that formed the basis of Lescroart's previous book, THE FIRST LAW ( 2/9/2003 review), which I strongly suggest be read prior to this book. (Since the events in THE FIRST LAW in some ways represented a crucial divide in the lives of all participants, perhaps the numbers incorporated into these titles indicate the author's intention to make it easy for new readers to understand the order of the subsequent books in the series. If so, his fans will be glad to see that he has left himself unlimited possibilities for additional sequels whereas the author Sue Grafton is already more than halfway through the alphabet.)In contrast with the two most recent novels somewhat deviating from the typical format of this series, this book much more closely resembles the earlier stories. FIRST LAW had been about the failure of the justice system and the emotional and physical damage that the episode described caused to everyone in Abe's and Diz's circles of friends and families. Prior to that THE OATH (9/11/2002 review) had basically been a story that cast Diz in the role of a detective with very little courtroom action and with Abe having only a very minor role. This story combines what initially seem to be unrelated murder investigations by Abe and Diz with legal maneuvering, courtroom drama, and more than the usual quota of psychological stress and character development. While supposedly recovered from the psychological trauma which he recently endured and now managing partner of a successful law firm, in reality the deep scars which Hardy received are far from healed. He has essentially switched from being a litigator defending the innocent to the highly lucrative legal business of negotiating deals for the guilty. And Glitsky has become enmeshed in the political pressures brought on by a recent wave of violence.The parents of Andrew Bartlett, a seventeen-year-old who Hardy's young associate Amy Wu has previously represented for a minor offense, contact her when he is arrested for the double murder of his girlfriend Laura Wright and his well loved high school drama teacher Michael Mooney. Amy ( who is introduced in a manner which suggests that she will be a new addition to the continuing cast of this series) believes the evidence against Andrew to be overwhelming and thus arranges a deal with the DA to accept a plea bargain in return for Andrew being sentenced as a juvenile offender rather than being tried as an adult. When the deal falls apart and Amy incurs the wrath of both the DA and the judge assigned to the case, Hardy concludes that it is necessary for him to sit as THE SECOND CHAIR with Wu (psychologically numb from the recent death of her father) and help in the preparation of Andrew's case for trial. As further apparently random murders occur and increasingly terrorize the city, a tenuous link finally appears between Glitsky's investigations and Andrew's case. The complex plot is ingenious and the conclusion satisfying. And fans of the series will be glad to see the inclusion of a strong legal element as an integral part of this story.I downgraded my rating from a full five stars for three reasons. First, the book certainly does not deserve five stars on a standalone basis, yet to make the background understandable to new readers it dwells on the events in the previous book in excruciating detail for readers already familiar with that background. Second, I thought that although Amy's self-destructive behavior and preoccupation with her own problems was a totally integral element of the plot, it was carried to such an extreme level that it made her behavior even more frustrating than was necessary. Third, in a few cases the perspective of the narrative made certain elements of the case clear to the reader well before it was obvious to the participants, which somewhat lessened the suspense.On a final note, this book also includes a strong negative perspective regarding the current childrearing practices and self-centeredness of many professional and upwardly mobile parents. In addition to the lack of communication between Andrew and his parents, we are introduced to two wonderful minor actors in this drama. First is Jeri (Honey) Croft, an actress in the play which starred Andrew and Laura, and whose wisdom and sensitivity contrast fiercely with her punk look and outward demeanor of disdain, Second is Catherine Bass, who is an attorney suffering from CDD (the well known but often misdiagnosed affliction Chocolate Deficit Disorder) but more importantly for this story is Mr. Mooney's former wife who specializes in areas which make her very knowledgeable regarding the troubled lives of psychologically estranged teenagers. So, if you enjoy literary series which employ plots with a lot of interwoven threads and that take the time to leisurely provide the necessary details for continuing character development, THE SECOND CHAIR is a very worthwhile addition to the Diz and Abe show.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I have read all the Dismas / Abe books, and it seems like I can usually figure out &quot;who done it&quot; before the characters. I guess this is because the author plays fair with the clues in the books, but it tends to lessen the enjoyment compared to other authors.The &quot;plot hole&quot; of the bystander did not bother me too much, but given the skill of the perp it does make you wonder how this could have happened.I would warn first-time Lescroart readers to get the books in order, there is a LOT of back-story in this book that would spoil the previous novel for you if you read them out of order. Again, I didn't mind this as much as some - as I read a LOT and for enjoyment, not to remember every detail of the novel. So having a refresher of what happened before was OK for me.The highlight of the book for me was Dismas' new car! He now drives a Honda S2000 convertible - since I have one too this added to the read.Another solid entry in the series, but if you pay attention you will figure it out."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Attorney Diz Hardy's inexperienced partner, Amy Wu, tackles her first murder case, even though she believes her client, high school student Andrew Barlett, to be guilty as charged. Someone has shot Andrew's girlfriend, Amy, and the drama teacher, Mr. Mooney, during play rehearsals at his home. The police believe they have Andrew dead to rights, especially because he's been toting a gun to school and is known to be jealous of their relationship. He's also been caught out in some pretty blatant lies. When Wu's strategy, to plead guilty to keep Andrew within the juvenile tier of justice, backfires badly, Diz steps in as second chair. While Andrew is in custody, someone else begins shooting victims with legal connections all around the city.As a courtroom drama, this novel is slow-moving, falling somewhat flat, and he personalities of Hardy and Glitsky are rather blunted this time around. On the other hand, Lescroart does a great job at presenting a thought-provoking array of ethical issues as they pertain to the responsibilities of the defense attorney. Amy commits some serious errors, which cause Diz to second guess some of the professional choices he has made in the emotional wake of the murder of one of his closest friends (see The First Law. Amy is definitely in need of a refresher course, as she skirts dangerously around the edges of ethical boundaries. There are also some interesting glimpses into the workings of the juvenile courts, and the factors that are considered in determining whether a teen defendant should or should not be tried as an adult.Wonder if Lescroart is doing an Evanovich with his titles, inserting \\"first\\", \\"second\\", etc into the series."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"This is my first Lescroart novel, and I found it entertaining and compelling. Lescroart weaves an intricate web of murder, guilt, revenge and human weakness.

We also have a killer called \\"The Executioner\\" who is killing random victims with no apparent connection.The author maintains a tight pace, although slow initially, and affords us empathy with the book's many characters.It has led me to seek out others in the Hardy series."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Fairly good. Suspense is maintained, though perhaps drawn out too long. And the characterizations of the main players are well done, plus there's some sharp, witty dialogue.But the ending seems to be written for Hollywood, garishly melodramatic. And I'm not one who usually can predict endings (my wife can), but in this one I could see where the plot (the pattern and motives for the killings) was heading from about the midpoint of the novel--tho I didn't know the identity of the killer, which seemed to come out of the blue.I'll probably try another Lescroart."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Something about The Second Chair by John Lescroart just did it for me. I have been reading the Dismas Hardy/Abe Gilsky series since very early and have experienced a lot along with this clever and entertaining pair. I have been there for judges accused of murder, wrongfully accused individuals fighting for their lives in the legal arena, political scandals, police misconduct, murder, mayhem and a huge gun battle that left not only my head spinning, but the collective heads of our protagonists and their friends and family about to explode. Now all seems well on the legal landscape of Lescroart's San Francisco. Hardy is now the managing partner of a profitable law firm, Abe is in a real position of power in the police force, the DA and police chief are both friends of our hero's and most importantly, no one is shooting at them. Yet, what may seem fine on the surface is decidedly not fine underneath. Hardy is now a &quot;fixer&quot; wielding influence for clients he never would have touched before and in-between his fixing sessions slipping a few nips from the ole' wet bar. Abe is frustrated by the seemingly futile nature of politics and dealing with the press, and becoming more and more concerned about the burning pain in his gut. To add to Hardy's troubles, one of his associates, Amy Wu, sick with grief over the death of her father, is taking on her first real murder case, and not doing that good of a job with it.Oh, and somebody is going around killing people too, for apparently no reason.Lescroart does something with The Second Chair that just really amazed me. Here Lescroart the writer and Dismas Hardy the Lawyer become one and find a way to solve their mutual problems. Lescroart's problem is a series with growing tension with each edition, bordering on getting out of control. Hardy's problem is a lost faith in the Law. So Lescroart steps back and goes to the root of his story telling, by letting Hardy go back to his roots, a murder trial. Gone are the corruption and conspiracies, the ever escalating cycle of violence. Lescroart takes us back to a human tale, a tale of flawed individuals working in a flawed system, yet good intentioned and honest. Here the lawyers aren't battling a corrupt DA or biased cops, but their own prejudices and problems. This is simply good story telling at it's core without cheap stunts or gimmicks. While this may not be a perfect book, it is the perfect tone for this edition that just might save a series."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Having recently read The First Law, I decided it was time to go back for more. With the Second Chair, Lescroart spins a intriguing tale - one that is clearly better than The First Law. Perhaps my familiarity with some of the characters this time around helped. Throughout the story, Dis Hardy and Abe Glisky continue to search for their way in life in the wake of the action in the First Law, adding an extra dimension for those who have read the previous book. That said, my sense is that, while the exposure to the previous work was beneficial, the plot here was simply more compelling.

He has several story lines in each book and then weaves them all together to surprise me at the end.

He claims at the last minute that he is innocent. Despite very strong circumstantial evidence to the contrary, his attorney must suddenly work on a \\"soddit\\" defense (some other dude did it).I am nearing the end of the Dismas Hardy canon and I have been finding it difficult or impossible to be sure if this is the first one I had read. Yet I think it might be.I remember that rush of pleasure that a reader feels upon realizing this is going to be a good book--and perhaps it was also because I had discovered a new writer, or one new to me.At the start, I was not all that pleased with protagonist Amy Wu. She was reputedly extremely clever but kept making sloppy errors. She supposedly was suffering from low self esteem which had flared up recently because her father had died and she felt she had never pleased him. Why this happened is left a little vague, even when it is enlarged upon somewhat as the book goes along. It could account for several of her mistakes, but the extent of her indifference seems a little out of character with the nature of a true workaholic.True, there is the factor of her booze binging and the nightly prowl through bars looking to be picked up...There is a lot to be said about knowing the characters, which makes the reader more comfortable with personal foibles while several red herrings are tossed into the mix. Perhaps a professional really familiar with police procedure could find holes in the plot, but to me it just moved along briskly because that was my expectation.I do, however, think if I were the Hardys I would be unable to countenance the nightly search for a parking spot within walking distance of home. We used to live on a popular street with inadequate parking and one of us had to end up parking on that street (usually me) and my car was occasionally broken into or vandalized (my daughter claimed it was from frustration as they didn't like my dowdy driving gloves, my moth-eaten maps, or my ancient taste in music cassettes). But I was very happy when we built a home with ample underground parking. I suppose this is why when the Hardys did have the opportunity to provide parking and did not I was shaking my head. Yes, off track, but when deeply immersed in a story, these thoughts are distractions that affect the reading, if briefly.Some readers claim they figured out early who the killer was. I myself read for pleasure so do not perform what professors call a \\"close reading.\\" But even when I began to suspect, I still enjoyed how the writer tied up the various threads.My one criticism is a relatively mild one but should be easy to correct. Some of Lescroart's Spanish is a little shaky here and it seemed he once confused Spanish with French.However, if I ever needed a lawyer and could call Dismas Hardy, I would--in any language.

Amy herself is engaging is self-destructive behavior following her father's death, and is endangering both her client, and the firm's reputation, so Hardy steps in as second chair.DEVEOPMENTS---may contain spoilersWell into those plot lines (the murder charge and Amy's self-destructive trajectory) the action abruptly changes, and five (5) new unrelated plot lines are introduced in rapid-fire order. Various additional plot lines are introduced at subsequent points. Most of these eventually converge with the main plot line.There are also various other story lines--mostly the personal stories of various characters. These are introduced/supported by a detailed summary of the preceding novel in the series (\\"The First Law\\")--which could be interpreted as introducing a dozen plot lines, with the implication that some or all will continue in this novel. However, as far as I can tell these story lines are completely irrelevant to the current story. These details undoubtably enhance the experience for fans of the series, but not so for new readers.CAVEATSI counted about 93 NAMED characters in the novel, most with at least some character development. Of course, many are minor, such as court bailiffs. However, this is allegedly a mystery--so the reader is forced to assume that any named character may later emerge as a significant character (i.e., \\"the butler did it\\"). So many named characters is patently absurd, unnecessary, and abusive to the reader. I doubt that anyone new to the series (like myself) could manage a few pages without being totally lost. Indeed, one-third or so into the novel, I had to stop, and go back to the beginning, and start again from page 1, writing down the name and description (e.g., \\"attorney\\", \\"friend of the accused\\") of every character as he/she was introduced. I had to consult the list frequently when characters returned.If I was a bit more cynical, I'd describe Lescroart's style as the \\"Agatha Christie\\" school of mystery-writing --confuse the heck out of the readers, then pull a rabbit out of the hat. In fact in this case, THE BUTLER DID DO IT--or more precisely, a very minor character in a subservient role, whom we know NOTHING about except his profession and last name.Lescroart seems to have become oddly enamored of the term \\"sepia\\", referring to several interiors of rooms as being in \\"sepia tones\\". Sepia is an ugly yellowish-brown stain, which could accurately be described as shxx-brown, and really is a form of excrement (squid ink). Sepia is used to tint black and white photographs to make them look old. I have never seen a \\"sepia toned\\" room, and hope never to.VERDICT\\"The Second Chair\\" is filled with interesting characters, and is a good read"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"The Second Chair, by John Lescroart, is the 10th entry [site is incorrect] in the excellent series featuring defense attorney Dismas Hardy and his longtime friend San Francisco Police Department Homicide Investigation Specialist Abe Glitsky. Second Chair is a term that refers to the attorney that assists the lead attorney in a trial. In this book, Hardy, the new boss at his law firm, sits second chair for Amy Wu who is defending a 17-year-old accused of murdering his girlfriend and a high school drama teacher. Wu makes several pivotal mistakes in her handling of the case which may prove costly for her client. Hardy comes in to try and pick up the pieces. Politics, a mystery, and a legal thriller all rolled into one... Lescroart again proves a master in the field.This is great reading, and well worth a four star rating. Enjoy.For those new to this outstanding series, the order of books is as follows:Dead IrishThe VigHard EvidenceThe 13th JurorThe Mercy RuleNothing but the truthThe HearingThe OathThe First LawThe Second ChairThe MotiveBetrayal& A Plague of Secrets [scheduled for release in July 2009]I personally recommend reading them in order for the best experience. The characters evolve and are fully realized."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Another lawyer/cop book which was enjoyable. I liked The Vig better but this is still a good story about a teen accused of a double murder and what it takes to prove that he did (or didn't) commit the crimes. I wanted to read some of this author's older books because he has a new one coming out in February that I want to read. I figured some background knowledge might help me with the new book."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"This book begins and ends as a perfectly competent, trial-centered mystery thriller. The plot is like a finely made cuckoo clock. Once wound up, it clanks and whirrs, doors open up at just the right time and things pop into sight exactly when they should. In a book that is a part of a better than average series, it is well and good that they should do so.However, the heart of the book is not given to the series protagonists, Dismas (named after the \\"good thief\\" on the cross beside Jesus) Hardy and Abe Glitsky, but to a young lawyer named Amy Wu. Ms. Wu is very bright and very competent, so bright and so competent that she makes thoroughly boneheaded errors, one after another, in entirely convincing ways. The middle of the book is given to Ms. Wu's slow realization that she has made a mess of things and her attempts to crawl out of the pit she has dug for herself. This is not the stuff of a well-constructed mystery. This is, rather, something that looks very like--dare I say it?--literature.A couple of hundred pages of this 454 page book are more like a novel than a mystery story. Overall, this has a slightly negative effect on the mystery story, hence the four stars. But it also gives me hope that Lescroart has something good, something really good in him that someday he might put down on paper."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"This books starts with a murder. The suspect: a teenage boy who does his best too look and act guilty. Because he's a juvenile, he can be saved from LWOP (Life without Parole), if he pleads guilty to a double murder.Everyone thinks this is a great idea. The perp will be out at the age of 25. There is no long trial and the DA gets convictions on two murders. Everyone except the suspect who at the last minute refuses the deal, because he insists that while he might be a creepy kid, he didn't kill two people.Now, things get going! That's the beauty of this book. You never quite know what's coming next."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"This latest John Lescroart novel starts slowly and I was worried at first, but he knows what he's doing, for the pacing overall is excellent in this tale of disillusionment with the justice system. The book picks up speed as you go along and gives testament to the way this author crafts his work.The thing that stuck me most about this book was the wonderful character developement and dialogue. The only other author that comes close to this is Grisham and &quot;The Firm&quot; and a handfull of other books come to mind--&quot;The Last Juror&quot; being the latest one.I did find a few minor flaws with this book, but feel that it's not important to point them out--if you find them, then so be it, but I don't want to be the one to take anything away from this well-written novel.Also recommended: The Last Juror, Bark of the Dogwood, Pompeii"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"THE SECOND CHAIR is by far Lescroart's best work. While I loved FIRST LAW, THE OATH, and THE HEARING, this one is my all-time favorite. Well-drawn characters, a plot with just the right amount of twists and turns, and an excellent writing style make this one of the most enjoyable reads you'll come across for this genre. Yes, it does take a bit of time to build, but just wait--you won't be disappointed. And why shouldn't Lescroart take his time? He is, after all, miles above your average mystery/thriller writer. You can't go wrong with this one.Also recommended: THE FIRM by Grisham, McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and SPLIT SECOND"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Dismas Hardy is the new managing partner of his reorganized law firm after his former partner was gunned down. A new associate to the firm, Amy Wu, is grieving over the recent loss of her father. She brings the firm a high-profile case in which Andrew Barlett, the seventeen-year-old son of a prominent family is charged with the murder of his pregnant girlfriend and drama coach. Wu tries to keep Andrew in juvenile court where his maximum sentence is eight years as opposed to adult court where it would be life without parole. At first Wu is convinced that Andrew is quilty and pushes him to accept the plea bargain offered by the D.A. in which is admits to his guilt in order to stay in the juvenile system. The problem is he adamantly protests his innocence despite all the evidence against him. With the firm's reputation is on the line, Dismas agrees to sit second chair at the trial.John Lescroart writes one of the best legal thriller series if not the best. His characters are fully realized, emotionally complex people that grow with each book. If you have never read this series, it is not a bad idea to start from the beginning. It would be worth it because most of the books in the series are excellent.Lescroart is able to draw on the reader's emotions regarding his characters. I strongly disliked the Wu character in the beginning of the story. She had this boy's life in her hands and she was just trying to ramrod him through the system because she thought he was guilty. She was busy feeling sorry for herself: drinking, picking up men, overall irresponsible behavior. She was just not a very sympathetic character. In the course of the story, you really get to see her evolution. By the end you can understand why she was acting the way she did and even sympathize with her.Abe Glitsky, another mainstay from the series is also present in a parallel storyline. There is not quite as much interaction between Dismas and Abe this time out, but the storylines do tie together in the end.John Lescroart fans will enjoy this entry in the series and new readers will become fans."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"In San Francisco, Laura Wright and her drama teacher Mr. Mooney are killed in his apartment. Laura's lover, Andrew Bartlett, the father of her unborn child is arrested two months after the double homicide and charged with special circumstances murder. Amy Wu, an associate in the law firm in which Dismas Hardy is the managing partner, takes the case even though she believes her client is guilty.With his parents' permission, Amy plea bargains for her seventeen year old client so that he will plead guilty if he's charged as a minor. She explains to Andrew that he will be remanded to a juvenile youth facility for eight years and then would be a free man. Andrew agrees to Amy's suggestion since the evidence against him is so overwhelming, but at the last minute he declares his innocence. Dismas takes a more active role in the case, seeking evidence, interviewing witnesses and acting as THE SECOND CHAIR in Andrew's upcoming hearing.No doubt about it, Dismas Hardy is the twenty-first century's Perry Mason only more personable since the audience sees his interactions with his employees, friends, wife and children. THE SECOND CHAIR is a great legal thriller with a cast of characters easy to like. The intrinsic workings of the California judicial system especially when it comes to the rights of a juvenile is fascinating to observe. John Lescroart's latest work, THE FIRST CHAIR is definitely heading to the New York Times bestseller list.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Correct me if I am wrong, but a mystery is suppose to be a \\"mystery\\". It is suppose to be hard to figure out for the reader, not impossible, but hard. This was not hard to figure out. Even the good reviews admit, there was not much mystery in this book. If you like MYSTERY, do not touch this book!!He is a good writer, and most of the characters were developed well. (Except for Wu, who was a shallow stereotype.)Halfway thru the book, i am thinking \\"Are these characters stupid?\\" A blind man could see the connections. It was an insult.Wu is suppose to have an IQ of 150, so she is trusted with her FIRST murder trial with no help? That would NEVER happen!!! NEVER EVER!And she makes stupid comments to Hardy, asking him why would the judge not let their client go free? it is the right thing to do. Hardy, then lectures her on how the system works. LOL. It was laughable.Andrew's story? \\"i made it all up!\\" Give me a break!! And the cowel that he wore, just happened to be the same. LOL. And the eye witnessess could not tell the difference between a black guy and a white guy!?!Did anybody notice. That all the victims just happened to be the one who answered the door, even when others were at home.The ending had ONE small surprise. But most of Part 3, was a waste of time. Brandt just happened to guess who the executioner was??? What a stretch!His ability to write good prose and give details, and create a degree of confusion by overloading the story with too many characters is what helps him. But you have to suspend any rational thinking to think this was a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I wasn't certain, in the beginning, that I liked this book as it started off very slowly and I didn't particularly care for Amy. But once Hardy was introduced, as well as Abe Glitsky, the pace picked up and the story became much more interesting. There was a fair amount of back story, which helped me being a new reader, but might have been annoying had I read the previous books. I'd not read Lescroart before, but would certainly read him again."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Those of us who have reveled in the discovery of this author and his Dismas Hardy/Abe Glitsky novels have been with these two old friends for a long time and through some hair raising and heart breaking times. Hardy, who once was a San Francisco cop is now the managing partner of his San Francisco law firm. Glitsky who was a homicide detective for the SFPD is now a Deputy Chief. Yet, for all their lofty current positions, they are dragged into a compelling drama by the events that are going on around them.Amy Wu is an associate in Hardy's firm. She is dealing the the four month old death of her father by looking for love in all the wrong places when she receives a call from a wealthy couple who's son she has represented in a minor juvenile matter to inform her that &quot;Andrew is in trouble again.&quot; That, it turns out, is an understatement.It seems that Andrew was rehearsing for the school play with the teacher who was directing the play and with his girlfriend. The play is &quot;Who is Afraid of Virginia Woolf.&quot; Andrew and his girlfriend have the leads. While taking a break from rehearsing, Andrew takes a break to go for a walk to work on his lines. When he returns he finds them both shot to death.Two months later the police have decided to charge him with murder. His parents (actually Mom and Step-Dad) are horrified. &quot;He said he didn't do it,&quot; says Mom. &quot;I know he didn't do it.&quot; ...&quot;Andrew is not that type of person.&quot;After reviewing the police evidence Amy Wu is not so sure. It turns out that in the past Andrew expressed jealosy of Mr. Mooney, the teacher and his relationship with his girlfriend. He even wrote a short story entitled &quot;Perfect Killer&quot; in which he details how a young man who is jealous of his girlfriend and a teacher plots to murder them and how he does it in such a way as to avoid guilt. He shares the story with his best friend at school. He even starts to bring his step father's gun to school with him in a knapsack. Then there is the yelling and arguing that those living over Mr. Mooney's apartment hear along with crashing and banging down below. When they look out of the window to see what is happening, the husband sees a person he later idetifies as Andrew fleeing the apartment. He then goes down and discovers the vitims. Doesn't look so good for Andrew.Especially after the police find a spent 9mm shell in his car. Especially after he admits to throwing the gun he had been carrying around off the Golden Gate Bridge.In fact, it looks so bad to Amy that she tries to get him to plead guilty to the offense as a juvenile. He will be in jail for only eight years under California law if convicted as a juvenile. She convinces the parents that this is the best way to go and she convinces herself. The one little detail that she fails to cover is convincing her client. Her next error is to tell the Assistant DA that he will plead before she has gotten that nailed down. It all becomes unraveled in juvenile court as the client maintains his innocense and Ms. Wu quickly finds herself in the cross hairs of an angry judge and a furious district attorney. The matter is quickly calendared for a hearing on whether he should be tried as a juvenile or an adult and the outcome looks forgone. Her client, instead of facing eight years will likely be facing life.Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Glitsky is having his own problems with his new job and is embroiled with a high profile decision not to take a known murderer off a bus, but to wait until the passengers disembark and arrest him then. Quick and easy. Except the target smells the police and takes the passengers hostage, killing several before his demands for a helicopter and transportaion are met. He is killed by a sniper on the way to the copter, but the media is merciless in pursuing the matter.As a part of his job, Glitsky becomes aware of a murder where a woman without an enemy in the world is gunned down as she answers her front door. The husband is the only possible suspect, but that is going nowhere. Glitsky decides to talk to him and is also convinced that the husband is innocent. The only thing out of the ordinary that the woman ever did in her life was be a part of a jury many years ago who had convicted a person for murder.Shortly thereafter, the District Attorney is found murdered in the parking lot outside of his office.Dismas Hardy feels that he is responsible for the mess that Amy Wu has created by failing to mentor her properly and decides to sit &quot;second chair&quot; in the deternmination hearing that has been ordered to go forward in five days.To tell more about the story line would be to spoil the fun of reading a master story teller at the top of his game. Suffice it to say that the stories converge and the ending is all that a reader of this type of novel could ask for. I look forward to Lescroat's novels and if you have not discovered him yet, it is high time you did."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Voice performer David Colacci gives a vital, arresting reading of John Lescroart's legal thriller &quot;The Second Chair.&quot; As with previous works by this author there are dramatic courtroom scenes, and easy to relate to characters. His setting is the City by the Bay.Once again lawyer Dismas Hardy and his detective buddy, Abe Glitsky, are paired. Now Glitsky is the Deputy Chief of the Investigations Bureau and Hardy is managing partner in what seems to be a soon-to-be-successful law firm.Amy Wu, a promising young attorney in his firm, brings him a challenging and headline grabbing case. The son of an upper level San Francisco family, Andrew Bartlett, has been arrested in the double murder of his girlfriend and teacher. He's 17 and the District Attorney is determined to try him as an adult. Wu is equally determined to take the case to juvenile court. However, she needs some help to do this and so she turns to Hardy, asking him to sit second chair.Evidence against young Bartlett seems sound. But there is chaos to come when a string of murders chills San Francisco. Citizens are shot in what are apparently random killings. Thus both Hardy and Glitsky are pitted in challenges that may change their lives - one must try to save a client, the other must stop a psychotic killer.Lescroart just keeps getting better and better.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I have enjoyed all the series, and thought this one was one of the best. The story is well developed, and the courtroom scenes very readable. However...1) Most any reader figures out the connection between the murders long before the experts do. They weren't as smart as we are, right?2) The coincidence of who the shooter turns out to be is a little much, don't you think?3) And a minor note. Mr. Lescroart must not know Southern Baptists. He has the aged, very conservative Southern Baptist minister wearing A COLLAR (!!!), and living in a rectory!

Both moving down separate avenues which eventually meet.John Lescroart is a mainstay in the courtroom thriller arena and once more delivers an interesting, provocative read. Although it was disconcerting the manner in which Amy Wu assumed her client's guilt and pushed hard for him to cut a deal with the DA, I'm sure this is something fairly common in our legal system. Recommended for those readers who love a good thriller."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I wondered if this was non-fiction when I grabbed it and read it late last year. It took me 2 weeks to read it! UNDOWNPUTABLE! This is his best book by far. A rare accord to say the least. I really got engrossed in it. well done and what a cast of characters! His writing is what readers find in every book he writes."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"John Lescroart is one of those writers who is able to grab the reader's imagination with his first sentence: &quot;Only four minutes remained in sixteen-year-old Laura Wright's life as she came out of the bathroom of the small apartment on Beaumont Street in San Francisco.&quot; From this high-pitched beginning, his new book, THE SECOND CHAIR, wends its way through a zigzag plot that is littered with dead bodies, blind alleys, red herrings, courtroom drama and a denouement sure to keep pulses racing.Andrew North is the privileged son of rich self-centered parents: Linda, his biological mother, and Hal, his stepfather. Andrew, a popular high school student, and his girlfriend were the leads in the school play and had made a habit of rehearsing in the evenings at the home of their teacher, Mr. Mooney. One fatal night, when Andrew goes for a walk to rehearse his lines, Mooney and the ing&eacute;nue are murdered.Each time the police question Andrew, they assure the family that he is not a suspect. Thus, he talks to them without the benefit of counsel. He and his parents know he's innocent, but approximately two months into the investigation, he is arrested. Nobody is more surprised by this event than Andrew.When the Norths finally contact Amy Wu, an attorney they had used years before when Andrew had gotten into a small scrape, Andrew was being held at the Youth Guidance Center (YGC) charged with double murder. He was booked into juvenile hall because, although he was seventeen, for the purposes of this arrest he was still technically not considered an adult ... yet. When Amy gets to the house and begins asking the elementary questions a lawyer called into a double murder case always asks, she is appalled by the naivet&eacute; the parents had displayed in the pre-arrest of their son. These successful, rich and presumably savvy parents &quot;knew&quot; Andrew was innocent and believed that he was lucky to have been out of the house when the murders occurred. Their belief in their son's innocence could cost him his life. Up until he was taken away in handcuffs, the family felt that none of them had to worry.After listening to all of the reasons and rationalizations the parents had devised in their attempt to &quot;protect&quot; Andrew and convince themselves that their son was innocent, Wu, who is flabbergasted by what she is hearing, asks why the police decided to arrest him two months later after talking to him several times. Linda explains that in the early stages of the investigation, the police asked if they owned any guns. Hal responded in the affirmative, but was unable to locate it. The police later found a casing in Andrew's car --- the gun had disappeared, but it was the same caliber as the murder weapon.Amy Wu is an associate of Dismis Hardy, Lescroart's &quot;regular attorney.&quot; THE SECOND CHAIR comes on the heels of his last blockbuster, THE FIRST LAW, in which David Freeman, Hardy's mentor, is murdered and the people who truly loved him &quot;took care to see that 'justice' was carried out.&quot; All of them are still reeling from what they did and are trying as best they can to cope with his death. Each in his/her own way is haunted by the part they played in making sure his killer paid with his life. Amy is not doing too well in the emotional stability arena, either. Her father died a few months ago and she is drinking too much, indulging in one night stands and has cut herself off from any help or support friends might offer.Nevertheless, she takes the case. Based on her belief that all or most of her clients are guilty, her approach to a case is to plead down and get as little time as possible for the perp. In Andrew's case she takes the same route and rationalizes a defense of sorts in her mind. She will do what she does best: fight for the best deal she can get, and then hope she can sell it to the Norths and then to Andrew. Her plan is to have him plead guilty to the murders, even if he is innocent, as he claims. If he agrees, he will get eight years of incarceration as a youth offender. If he goes to trial, it will be as an adult and he could go to prison for life. The cliffhanging tension while Andrew, his family, Wu and Hardy try to decide his fate is both heartwrenchingly realistic and perfectly pitched.THE SECOND CHAIR is a compelling novel. It is timely and not so far fetched that readers won't identify with the painful situation facing the characters. John Lescroart brings to the courtroom thriller a mix of anecdotes that explain the law, an ensemble of characters who are fully limned and struggle with the human problems that beset all of us. The ability to shape and reshape them lends verisimilitude, which allows them to mature. This is Lescroart's fourteenth book and it is clearly one of his best. He is such an accomplished storyteller that a reader can pick up any of his books in or out of sequence and miss none of the nuances between his characters or get lost in a panoply of references to earlier novels.This author crafts his tales with due diligence, and that is what makes his work stand tall among the plethora of lawyer-writers whose books line shelves everywhere. This one is a keeper!--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Once again, Lescroart proves he is the master of this genre. While lesser authors cling to rehashed story lines and stale continuing characters Lescroart pushes the envelope.In this story, after falling into a deep malaise following the events of the FIRST LAW, Dismas Hardy resurrects himself by sitting &quot;second chair&quot; to his young protege Amy Wu, who is dealing with some demons of her own. Miss Wu has gotten herself hopelessly entangled in a case where everyone: her client, his parents, the judge have turned on her. Hardy decides that rather than fire her he will sit second chair. This is an interesting plot device similar to that which Lescroart has used in the last several books, that of moving the legal story along in a setting other than the actual trial courtroom. Here all of the legal action takes place in the hearing to decide if the defendant should be tried as a juvenile or adult.There are several secondary stories running throughout this book, most of them dealing with the hubris the other major characters who were involved with the FIRST LAW are carrying and their ultimate reconcilliation with that trama.Lescroart continues to grow and strengthen his characters as they go about the business of life, keeping them vibrant and interesting.This is the 12th Dismas Hardy book and it is as fresh and vibrant as the first!"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"John Lescroart's \\"The Second Chair\\" is one of his best legal thrillers in years. It features a fascinating character, Amy Wu, who is a thirty-year-old associate in Dismas Hardy's San Francisco law firm. Wu has been on a downward spiral since her father died four months earlier. She is drinking heavily, picking up strange men in bars, and doing shoddy legal work. Dismas Hardy, a recurring character in Lescroart's novels, knows that Amy is in trouble, but he has problems of his own. Since a series of tragic events changed his life, he has been reluctant to get emotionally involved in his work.However, Dismas has to intervene when Amy's client, Andrew Bartlett, a seventeen-year-old rich kid, is arrested on a charge of double homicide. Amy tries to manipulate the system to guarantee Andrew a light sentence, but her plan backfires, leaving Amy and her boss with egg on their faces. To save his firm's reputation and extricate Amy out of the legal trouble that she has created for herself and her client, Dismas decides to take \\"second chair\\" in the Andrew Bartlett case.Dismas's close friend, Abe Glitsky, is also suffering from burnout and stress. Glitsky has been promoted to Deputy Chief of Investigations, and he the hates the bureaucracy and politicking that go with his job. He also despises the vultures in the media who are always second-guessing his every move. Abe yearns to do what he does best--solve homicides. He has his chance when a series of mysterious murders rock the city, and he is once again called upon to use his investigative skills to find the murderer dubbed the \\"Executioner.\\"\\"The Second Chair\\" is complex, fast-paced, and suspenseful. The dialogue is sharp and realistic and the plot is complex without being convoluted. As always, Lescroart has done his homework, and the engrossing legal details add immeasurably to the book's appeal. Lescroart also effectively explores the shortcomings of our criminal justice system and how politics and the media too often pervert the truth.However, what I like best about this novel is its heart. Lescroart takes the time to get inside the minds and personalities of all the major characters, and this gives the reader an emotional investment in the outcome of the story. All in all, \\"The Second Chair\\" is a winner, and if you love legal thrillers as much as I do, you will put it at the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I just happened to pick this book up and read it without the preceding works in this series as a foundation. It might be that after reading all of his earlier books Lescroart's 'Second Chair' might be comfortable territory for the initiated. But as a stand alone book, this is pretty tired fare. The plot is far fetched and does not gel into the remotest idea of cohesion. The story bumps along from one character to the next like a bad auto accident. The characters are cardboard cut outs that are painful to imagine. And lastly the ending is a disaster of major \\"saw that coming\\" proportions.The writing style itself is not too shabby, though Lescroart could have whittled down the story by a hundred pages and lost nothing.Plainly, this is just a sub par Grisham."},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"Like many serial productions, picking up this volume and being transported back into the lives of Glitzky and Dismas (not to mention Diz' amazing black skillet) was like slipping on a favorite pair of houseslippers, comfortable -- familiar -- engrossing.

Now there are only two questions to be answered: When do we get the next Lescroart epic ...... and how do you pronounce Lescroart, anyway?"},{"Title":"The Second Chair","review":"I thought this book would be a very long legal trial, but it wasn't, and I enjoyed it very, very much.

In the resolution to the book the killings were for revenge yet an innocent person was killed in the process. That wasn't in tune with the character of the guilty party who wanted revenge against those who had done him wrong yet was an intergral part of the plot of which Hardy was brought into the case for. Why would the murderer put himself in a position to require him to kill a witness when such elaborate steps were taken to remain anonymous otherwise?And did Hardy agree to take the second chair to appease his conscience after being guilty of compounding a felony? Fictional lawyers have always skirted the lines of legality but Hardy seems to have jumped over the line with both feet mirroring what the legal system in the United States has become.And is Hardy liable for his stolen ski equipment and his broken window when the legal profession is responsible for the escalating crime rate. Punishment for a crime was supposed to be so severe as to deter future violators from copying that wrongful act yet has become the cost of doing business.One can only hope that Hardy will become the lawyer that every layman hopes exists in the real world, that of one working for Mrs. &quot;Blind&quot;, that blindfolded lady holding the scales of justice."},{"Title":"Tempest in the Stone","review":"The theme of the book is perhaps summed up by one of the central characters who says at one point, \\"Seems like everyone in this town simply exists, but no one is LIVING.\\" And so it is in small-time Stonecutter, known as \\"the stone\\" for short, and everybody knows each othre and each day seems to be a repeat of the previous day. Timothy Nathan Stelly, Sr. captures the quintessential essence of life in small town America, and although the book is about a tightly-knit group of young African-Americans, it could be about anyone because of the quality and caliber of the writing and the mental images summoned up in this 236-page intriguing piece of writing. During the early writing of this piece, the writer -- who is my younger brother - writes that, \\"this book is dedicated to who ever ran away from the past.\\" Who among us, has never tried to look the other way or play down a dastardly deed or a relationship gone wrong?The characters in this important novel could be anyone, from rich kids from suburban America to minority youth living along the tracks of smalltown USA. And in this case, the latter is an apt depiction. Falecia, Sly, Aurora and Ike are prototypes (caricatures?) of much what is both right and wrong in ethnic enclaves all over America, and yet from these lives that intertwin we can extract applicable analysis, answers and boo coo inspiration that, in turn, will enable us to transcend our own misgivings while striving, as do the central characters, for a better and more productive way of life.A must read!

Hal von Luebbert"},{"Title":"Tempest in the Stone","review":"\\"Tempest In The Stone\\" is a coming of age tale set in a small, fictional town (Stonecutter, or \\"the Stome\\") in California. It describes the life of four young adults--Ike, Bones, Stevie, and Ike's girlfriend Aurora--whose goal is to find a town that offers more opportunities and less boredom.Ike is the problem-solver of the group and a bit dictatorial, while Aurora (and the other female characters) are portrayed as weak-minded. As the four set out on a cross-country trek for Omaha, Nebraka, they must overcome the jealous-hearted thug, Mac--their ex-con/ex-friend. Also standing in their way is Pinch--Bone's drug dealer/pimp brother. Both men become embroiled in deadly situations that serves as an indicator for the others to get out of \\"The Stone,\\" with haste.The trip is also fraught with trouble, including two racists they encounter in Utah, a sadistic cowboy who commits a graphic act of violence against one of the group's members and a troublesome co-worker they meet named Cookie.Through it all the four remain as a tightly-knit grouop, proving that there is strength in unity. Meanwhile, back in the Stone Pinch and Mac meet an all-too-familiar demise: The two are the victims of lynchings--one physical, one legal. In a powerful piece of writing, the author takes us through Mac's psychological meltdown and Pinch's abject fear of being beaten to death.While the book moves slowly, the characters are well-developed and overall, this is a pretty good effort."},{"Title":"Media Promotion & Marketing for Broadcasting, Cable & the Internet, Fifth Edition","review":"This book is a typical college textbook. A lot of definitions... a lot of fairly rudimentary information.It's a good book for people who want to learn basic information about media marketing, but it goes into little to no depth about most aspects of the field.I also don't get the sense that the authors -- college professors-- have much of a sense of the industry as it is today. Other than a mention of sniping and on-air bugs (which debuted several years ago), the book seems a little out of touch.Therefore, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone currently working in media marketing, because you'll learn very little new knowledge.But, as it's not presented as an intermediate or advanced book, it's a good resource for beginners."},{"Title":"Media Promotion & Marketing for Broadcasting, Cable & the Internet, Fifth Edition","review":"I agree with the above reviewer.

This book gives interesting insight on the parallel between \\"earth\\" man's first temptation and Perelandra man's first temptation. Interestingly, the fight against evil by the Perelandra soul seemed to be much stronger than the resistance offered by our own human brethren. This led me to wonder if Lewis was really writing about a general fight between good and evil or if he was actually pointing out how spiritually weak humans are, and our incredible need of a Messiah. The premise is fascinating in line with all of Lewis' writing. However, unlike \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", I found the pace of this book to be just a bit slow. I realize Lewis was purposefully trying to generate more philosophical thought, which was quite enriching, I just liked the pacing of \\"....Silent Planet\\" a bit more.

He does make some compelling arguments."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This book, most basically, is about an educated Christian arguing against Satan with the fate of Paradise in the balance. Everything else, including all the fantastical ambience, is mediocre at best. As with the Narnia books, all of those elements merely comprise a sustained metaphor in Lewis's ongoing evangelization (or conversation, if you want) with his readers. Stretching the same metaphor over nearly 200 pages can get pretty tedious if you're not interested in the topic. So do NOT buy this book if you aren't interested in Christian theology. If you're primarily interested in this because it is called \\"science fiction,\\" I warn you that nothing in \\"Perelandra\\" rivals the images and ideas of Bradbury, Heinlein, etc. If, on the other hand, you like thinking about Christianity in a half-imaginative, half-philosophical way then you'll love it--much more in fact than it's merely passable predecessor, \\"Out of the Silent Planet,\\" and totally dismal sequel, \\"That Hideous Strength.\\"The depiction of Satan is utterly terrifying. I cannot ever avoid comparing Lewis with Tolkien and nearly always to Tolkien's favor. In fact, there is only one exception: while Tolkien's portrayal of the effects of evil (think Gollum, the Nazgul, Saruman) is certainly effective, his depiction of evil itself (Melkor Morgoth and later Sauron) never leaves the reader feeling particularly threatened. Lewis's Satan by contrast is devastatingly real and as such uncompromisingly terrible. At times, you'll want to recoil from the pages. Even more than \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" \\"Perelandra\\" leaves the reader with a sense of urgency in regard to the demonic."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra is a fine Christian allegory of the Garden of Eden, in particular Eve.

The description of the scenery on Perelandra paint visible portraits of the intelligible ideas Lewis is expounding in the prose passages or the dialogue. You have to dig to see these.For instance:1. Compare Ransom's first blush impressions of Venus (ocean, island, sky) with the lectures about femininity regarding the Eldila in the last chapters.2. Compare the Un-Man's description of reality (\\"the thin rind\\" and the \\"meat\\") with the Perelandrian sea and underworld Ransom visits after riding the fish for several days.3.

Where Out Of The Silent Planet was a breezy sci-fi allegory of humankind's failings, and That Hideous Strength is simply the penultimate Lewis tale, this middle chapter is overlong and overly dense. Ransom is taken to Perelandra by an eldil, where his mission is to thwart the devil's temptation of that planet's Eve. Once more, Lewis's description of a foreign environment is rich and brilliantly imagined. Once the devil arrives (in the body of Weston) things kick into low gear. While philosophically intriguing, the arguments of Satan and Ransom and the questions of Eve quickly begin to appear circular and meandering. The climactic chase and physical confrontaion with the devil is both much too long and rather illogical. The denouement is classic Lewis, setting up Ransom's position for the final chapter of the trilogy with magical and moving brilliance, though it is too little to redeem the rest of the novel. Perelandra is a slow and tedious read, worth it only for the wonderful payoff in the third book, That Hideous Strength"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I've read Lewis's trilogy a number of times--first when I was thirteen years old. I wasn't aware of the religious connotations at that age and enjoyed the book tremendously. I can guess that some Christians like Lewis because of his message, which is a bit forced, but I like him for the strength of his imagination, particularly evident in the first two parts of the trilogy. All that other stuff is a waste of space as far as I'm concerned, but he's a great writer and gets away with it."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I suppose it was expected, but I had hoped anyway that the second book could somehow be as profound as the first. But no. Just an unsuprising Christian allegory written as naturalistic fantasy. (I cannot call it \\"science fiction\\" because there was very little science in it.)True, Lewis asks a question here that perhaps most theologists wouldn't ask: was there another way out of the Garden of Eden?But then he relapses into the Trinity and ties the story up much too neatly.In short, too human, too Christian, nothing new here."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Have you ever wondered where exactly humans came from? In &quot;Perelandra,&quot; you get a very descriptive, if not completely accurate, tale of how life began. The only catch is, this is the account of how life began on Venus, not Earth. Perelandra is the second Earth, so to speak. It is Venus. (From Lewis' point of view) Though it is covered almost completely with water, Venus contains many floating islands that are capable of sustaining life. As it happens, this is where most of the story takes place. Dr. Elwin Ransom is stuck on one of these islands and he is looking for the &quot;Eve&quot; of this second Earth. Unfortunately, there is a demon-possessed man that is also on one of these islands, who is also looking for &quot;Eve.&quot; The main conflict is between the efforts of these two people to influence the outcome of this newly born planet. When taken at face value, this book is decent at best; but can you ever take any book at just face value? The complex symbolism that Lewis maintains throughout this trilogy is quite confusing, but I'm sure it's very gratifying if and when you figure it all out. Without the other two books (&quot;Out of Silent Planet&quot;, and &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;), I'm not sure that this book would make any sense at all, but it is very heart-warming, none-the-less."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"With every page i read the page fell off.

That is in part because he manages to deal with Big Questions in (especially for Lewis) a low-key way; he presents difficult problems and gives reasoned answers, all in the context of a suspenseful tale--suspenseful even with little true action, the tension being almost entirely moral.Best of all, Lewis's usual penchant for Very Very Obvious wrapups is here modulated to, in effect, a song of praise, so that it does not bemean the tale itself, nor leave the reader feeling she has been treated like a half-wit, the taste Lewis all too often leaves in the mouth.This is an unusual novel, an interesting one, a complex and deep one, and a rewarding one. (It contains a scene that is perhaps the best and most horrifying portrayal in all literature of true Evil seen face to face.)"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I very rarely write reviews but this deserved one.

It had a good story and message, just hard reading."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra is the second volume of C.S. Lewis's SPACE TRILOGY and I liked it even better than Out of the Silent Planet, its predecessor. Cambridge professor Dr. Elwin Ransom is back on Earth and has told his friend Lewis about the adventures he had on the planet Mars and the supernatural beings he met there. When Ransom explains that there's an epic battle between good and evil, that the planet Venus is about to play an important part, and that he's been called to Venus to do some unknown task, Lewis begins to worry about his friend. Yet he decides to help him get to Venus anyway, so Ransom goes and eventually returns to tell his tale, which Lewis has transcribed for us.Venus is gorgeous -- a lush conglomerate of archipelagos where the land floats on top of the water, so that walking on it is like walking on a waterbed. The sky is full of stunning colors that Ransom has never seen before; exotic trees delight the eye and yield delicious fruit. Other than the strange but friendly animals, Ransom seems to be alone in this world -- until he sees a beautiful naked woman waving from a neighboring island. When he finally meets her, he discovers that evil lurks in this seemingly perfect world.If you were able to ignore the Christian allegory in Out of the Silent Planet, you won't be able to do so in Perelandra -- it's a parallel version of humanity's awakening in the Garden of Eden and Eve's temptation to sin. Evil is trying to gain a foothold and Ransom suddenly realizes what it would mean to bring \\"the knowledge of good and evil\\" into a sinless paradise. Ransom discovers that the Biblical admonition to resist temptation may be a spiritual truth on Earth, but at this time on Venus it's a real physical battle and he has been sent to fight it, both with words and fists.C.S. Lewis, a lover of words and mythology, writes beautifully about the alien paradise of Venus and the possibility that what is myth in one world might be truth in another. He also has much to say about good and evil, sin and obedience, madness and sanity, loneliness and companionship, science and the supernatural, predestination and free will, the nature of God and man, and humanity's purpose in the universe. Some readers will accuse Lewis of preachiness, I'm sure, and that's something that usually annoys me, but though Ransom's introspections go on a little too long, I found it impossible to resist the beauty, logic, and concision of his philosophizing.I listened to Geoffrey Howard narrate Blackstone Audio's version of Perelandra which is just under 8 hours long. Mr. Howard narrates rather than performs the story, which I think is suitable. I'll certainly be listening to him read the concluding volume: That Hideous Strength.Originally posted at FanLit."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is possibly the best allegory I have ever read; Lewis' recreation, and redirection, of the Fall of Man is ingenious. In conjunction with the first book, Out of the Silent Planet, Lewis invents and portrays three radically different ways the Divine Powers order intelligent life on the three planets, Mars, Earth, and Venus. By doing so, he initiates the most brilliant discussion on Freedom of Will I have ever encountered. Though the arguments in the text are mainly philosophical, a background in philosophy is not needed- Lewis' style is straightforward and entertaining, and the plot is exciting and fantastic. I would recommend this book to any Christian as well as anyone who is interested in myth and its implications. Lewis, like Dante and Milton, connects stories from the Bible with other ancient stories, especially Greek, and these play a role in his allegory. Whether religious or not, the questions evoked by this novel are fascinating. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This was the first in the so called 'Space Trilogy' that I read. I got it from a library where they were selling a lot of their older books. I was at first quite lost (I was about thirteen then), and put the book away after the first chapter and forgot about it for a long time. Then I picked it up again, and was completely drawn into the story. This is definately not science fiction. Ransom, the main character, arrives in a coffin sort of thing sent by Oyarsa (an archangel sort of being). The descriptions of Peralandra (the planet Venus) are breathtaking and lovely. The way he describes a certain kind of fruit which Ransom discovers, and the effects it had on him, are beautiful. But the best part of the whole book is when Ransom is debating with the body of Weston, a scientist who came to Peralandra a short time after Ransom arrived. Weston somehow called the/a devil into him, and so Ransom ultimately ends up debating with a devil. It is really good how he shows that the devil can often use the truth against us, when it is used out of context or twisted. I highly reccomend this, although to a non-Christian it may make little sense and end up boring them. I have now read it three times, and still enjoy it every time."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C.S. Lewis was one of the most brilliant authors that I have ever heard of. The way that he was able to capture the idea of temptation fear, and endurance is beautiful and truly amazing! This book takes readers to a new planet with new problems. I enjoyed reading the struggle that Random had and how he overcame each step with true dignity. This story is a must read for anyone who enjoys an exciting space thriller."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra, the second book in C.S. Lewis's trilogy, chronicles the adventures of Dr. Ransom on the planet of Perelandra, otherwise known as Venus. Taking his knowledge and understanding from his adventures in Malacandra (in Out of the Silent Planet) of the spiritual levels of life, human and otherwise, he departs for an assignment on another alien planet. Although he has no details on what he is to do upon reaching the planet, he goes with complete conviction that it is the right course of action and that the Oyarsa, or supreme spirit being of Malacandra, has Ransom's best interests at heart. On Perelandra, Lewis recreates the Biblical story of temptation in the Garden of Eden with Ransom acting as advocate for \\"Eve,\\" the female figure that inhabits that world. Ransom himself goes through many trials before the story's end.The storytelling in this novel is, of course, superb. The world that Lewis creates is fascinating and thought-provoking. He deftly weaves Biblical story and theology into Ransom's adventures and applies them to the universe and its inhabitants at large. He manages to stretch the readers' minds and wrap them around ideas that are much greater than ourselves. Our God is truly God of the universe. Lewis emphasizes that we do play an important role in God's creation but we could also play just a part within a larger scope of God's creations. The Bible is about humanity and its history with God. Who is to say what other creatures God has created to have relationships with Himself?Of course, Lewis has written this story as fiction. Interestingly, he ends the first book with his character writing it as a fictional account about Ransom's space adventure. This is apparently due to Ransom's insistence that readers would not believe the story as true and would reject it. According to Ransom, if the story were written as a fictional account, those readers who would accept the account as true would see past the fictional facade and see the truth about the story. It can make your head spin if you let it. So in this series, Lewis has written a fictional story. Or do we readers \\"in the know\\" know better?Although I really liked this story and am glad to have read it, I have to admit that some passages were a bit hard to get through. Speeches by the physicist character and certain speeches by the \\"eldila\\", or spirit beings, can get a bit heady. However, I am still committed to reading the final book in the series, That Hideous Strength, and will post a review on that when read. I do recommend this book to those who are up for a fantastical journey and are willing to work through a few philosophical passages."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"It's an unfortunate fact that most fantasy novels are set in the modern-day United States. Of course the characters in a typical fantasy novel may carry swords rather than guns and they may ride horses rather than cars, but those are externalities. Where these novels fail is in crafting the characters' minds. They think, speak, act, react, plan, and plot in ways that are entirely based on the modern-day world of the authors. And that is what's unfortunate, because fantasy should allow expansive and imaginative worlds on all levels, not just among minor details.\\"Perelandra\\" does that. It is, in the literal sense, the second novel of the Space Trilogy, and it sends Dr. Ransom to the planet Perelandra, also known as Venus. The Planet itself is hauntingly beautiful. Lewis' attention to the details of color, sound, smell, and feeling bring this world alive as few others have ever been. His bestiary of alien animals and arboretum of plants has no comparison that I know of, except perhaps in the works of Jack Vance. His language flows melodiously throughout the entire book.That, however, is only the minor achievement. The major achievement is the story, the retelling of the events in Eden, set in an alien landscape. Obviously this could have gone quite badly, could easily have become heavy-handed or dull. Instead Lewis manages it with seeming ease, and even makes the dramatic finale fit well with the flow of the entire book. The only misstep is at the very end, with an attempt to meld together mythology and science fiction that doesn't quite fit. Overall, though, \\"Perelandra\\" is a masterpiece that I can recommend without the slightest hesitation."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"Perelandra\\", the second novel in the, if you believe the blurbs, celebrated \\"Space Trilogy\\", stands as Lewis's on contribution to the form of the modern epic and also his tribute to John Milton, the author of \\"Paradise Lost\\". There are a plethora of epic references, and I agree that science fiction is the inheritor of the epic tradition. Much of what Lewis accomplishes through \\"Perelandra\\" is from the epic tradition. There are several elements in \\"Perelandra\\" that not only salutes \\"Paradise Lost\\" but also throws the whole epic tradition in a favourable light. Here are some of the numerous ways in which \\"Perelandra\\" harkens back to the epic tradition.Like most epics, the story begins in a crucial point in the story, with Lewis himself attempting to make it to Ransom's house under severe attack. There are generally catalogs in epics, and this is played as dark humour in Perelandra, as Ransom accounts what each individual has to fight with (essentially two middle aged bodies). There are then descriptions of what these are. Then, to rally himself up, Ransom makes a speech to himself for encouragement. Weston becomes the Unman, a very common tradition of giving a name to a character based on the description of that character. One of the best developed portion of Perelandra's similarities with the epic is the very vivid description of the Underworld which is given in the last section of Perelandra. In it, we get the quite hellish descriptions of the subterranean world of Perelandra, which we had no idea existed. Lewis also gives us his reoccurring theme of privacy and the fact that we do not know everything, with the two thrones and the sea people who appear and then disappear very mysteriously.(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". I have published newly written reviews of \\"The Space Trilogy\\" composed long after I wrote the three original reviews of Lewis's science fiction.)"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This second book of the Space Trilogy is even better than Out of the Silent Planet, the first book. As in the first book, this book contains types of biblical themes. The main theme here runs along the line of the account in Genesis about the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Of course, though C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy books are based upon Bible story lines, remember that they are science fiction and not necessarily doctrinally sound."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Interesting concepts, but Lewis is sometimes so far over my head I I strain to hold onto where he's going!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I LOVE the author but not a fan of this book.I suggest it to those who enjoy,creepy,crawly,sending shivers down your spine,and make your skin crawl!!!!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I have read it a few times, perhaps my favorite book of all time.

It can be read by adults and older kids (teens). C.S. Lewis is a master!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra, published in 1943 is the second work of a trilogy by the father of Christian Science Fiction, C. S. Lewis. The first story in the trilogy, Out of the Silent Planet, was published in 1938, and the set concludes with That Hideous Strength, released in 1945.Lewis is the author of many novels including, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and the other Narnia stories as well as non-fiction works including Mere Christianity, The Abolition of Man and A Grief Observed. Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings. Both were professors at Oxford University and members of an informal literary group called The Inklings.The science part of the story is largely dated. In this book Lewis largely avoids the issue of space flight having the protagonist, Elwin Ransom, unconscious during the trip to Venus. In the novel Venus is ocean paradise not the dry hellish world we now know it to be. The writing style is also somewhat dated, being told in narrative and containing much more introspection, exposition, and character discussion than is done in modern literature. In all of his fiction works Lewis uses allegory to teach Christianity.In the story Elwin Ransom, the protagonist, is sent by Oyarsa, the angel who governs Mars, to Perelandra, the planet we know as Venus. While the first book, Out of the Silent Planet, was an adventure story with allegory, Perelandra is more of a philosophical discussion within an adventure. The story is an examination of the fall of man and, in part, Lewis' answer to the John Milton's Paradise Lost and parallels to Dante's journey in The Divine Comedy.I rate this book four-star only in the context of Lewis' overall excellent writing. This story is less of an adventure, a slower pace and much more allegory.Recommendation: Christians interested in science fiction should read all three works of this trilogy both for edification and entertainment. They remain, overall, five-star stories.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I do have a complaint about this book, which were it not incredible later, would lower my rating. Perelandra starts off slow. It is fairly slow through the book, but there isn't enough material to justify the slowness at the beginning of the book, but the later chapters... wow.Ok, that being said, I want to sing the praises of this book. Dr. Ransom goes to Perelandra (Venus) for his second adventure, having gone to Mars in the first book. On Venus, Ransom finds that the world is young. Venus is in a state that is essentially the same as the garden of Eden. Lewis has some fun with the setting, and with the seemingly arbitrary command.But the real point of the story is that evil tries to enter the paradise of Perelandra, and Ransom is there. This book almost reads as if it were Lewis' answer to the question, \\"what would you have done, if you were in the garden, to keep Eve from sinning?\\" The entire account of that conflict, the philosophy as well as the physical aspects of it, is my favorite part of any book I have ever read. Read this book. I want to emphasizes it to guys all the more. Ransom, in all his imperfections, shows himself a man throughout the pages of this book. His courage comes from a self-doubting heart, but he does what he must do. This book was excellent."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"The first thing you should know about Perelandra is that it a very different book than Out of the Silent Planet. It's basically a story of a man's struggle with Satan that just happens to be set on another planet.I really, really loved this book; it's my favorite of the series. The best part of this book, to me, is the incredible depiction of \\"Satan\\", CSL is at the height of his talent here, even moreso at times, I daresay, than the Screwtape Letters, in his depiction of evil. There are powerful images in this story that (I am sure) will never leave me."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra is quite the most hauntingly beautiful book this reviewer has ever read. From the moment Ransom, the principal character, enters Venus, we are treated to descriptive passages that have the ability to place in your mind an unforgettably beautiful world. Lewis' sweeping prose creates a remarkable vision of an Eden that knows no pain, and the book as a whole leaves the reader with a deep sense of joy and an appreciation of the loveliness of human life. Lewis is quite deliberately retelling the Christian story of temptation, and the theology espoused in the arguments between Ransom and the devil's advocate, Weston, watched with some confusion by Venus' &quot;Eve&quot;, show a deep and profound grasp of the methods of evil, and the twisting, roundabout attempts to persuade her to disobey God. Within this story, Lewis disputes and gives an answer to the still prevalent assumptions of much of science fiction - that man must survive at all costs and extend his seed to the ends of the universe. The physical fight with Weston, told around more stunning descriptions of the natural beauty of Venus, suggest that evil is not all-powerful, and Ransom himself recognises the smallness of his actions against the great dance of life, which is the theme of the fast, moving conclusion to the work. Of the three novels that make up this sequence, Perelandra is by far the most thought-provoking, lucid, beautiful and complete. Lewis himself felt that this stand-alone novel was one of his best, and this reviewer encourages anyone who wishes to sample his adult fiction to get this book."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is, without doubt, the best novel I've ever read. It even beats The Lord of the Rings trilogy. C. S. Lewis's power of description, psychological insight, and emotional intensity reach a height here that is unparalleled. But beyond such engaging writing, Perelandra gives us poetry in prose, reality in story, theology in fantasy, truth in myth. It is an evocative tale, so compelling that for a faint second I could have believed it was true, and that Lewis was describing real events, not fictitious ones! And that is because it is so deeply grounded in the reality of The Great Dance, the drama of creation and redemption which is being enacted upon the stage of humanity. The final pages of this book sent my spirits soaring. I can scarcely describe its impact upon me. Take it and read."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"That wacky C.S. Lewis, thinking he can stick Christian ideals andbeliefs into a science-fictional setting. What gall. You know whatthe funny part is? It actually works, which is something of anaccomplishment in itself. Y'see, this story continues from the lastbook (Out of the Silent Planet) where Dr Ransom is sent to&quot;Perelandra&quot; (Venus) where he finds a fantastic unspoiledparadise populated by strange and quite friendly animals . . . and asingle green woman who seems rather innocent of the world (psst. . . think &quot;Eve&quot;). No sooner do they get to chatting thensomeone shows up who might just be the agent of the Devil, trying totempt &quot;Eve&quot; into disobeying &quot;God&quot; (not called Godbut you get the idea) and Ransom has to figure out how to put a stopto someone who is not only smarter, older and has lots more experienceat this, but managed to do it right once before. Arguments ensue.People who have read Lewis have complained to me that he tends to&quot;preach&quot; a bit too much, and I can see from this novel wherepeople get that idea from. But really it isn't that much of aproblem, for every couple pages of theological argument (cloaked in SFterms, really) he slathers the page full of absolutely beautifuldescriptions of the planet, you can get lost sorting through all ofthem. He really thought this place out and while it's nowhere nearthe &quot;real&quot; Venus, my first rule of writing is chuck scienceif it gets in the way of a good story. And in the end you have a goodstory, it's good versus evil in the classic sense, yes, it's from a&quot;Christian&quot; perspective but it mostly boils down to&quot;Devil=bad&quot;. There's plenty of other stuff to recommend aswell, the fight between Ransom and the Devil's advocate (couldn'tresist . . . sorry) is one of the most brutal fights I've ever seen ina old style SF novel and Lewis manages to contrast the sheer brutalityof the fight with the beauty and splendor of the planet around them.By the end it gets a bit on the metaphysical end of things, but all inall an entertaining romp. Be prepared if you read the first book andwere expecting more of the same, this is a different tone entirely,more philosophical and searching and definitely more than just ascience fictional retelling of the Garden of Eden story."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is the second volume of Lewis's space trilogy (begun in Out Of The Silent Planet and ending with That Hideous Strength) and an excellent one it is. People talk about the books being readable independently, but you'll get more out of them if you read them in their proper order. Lewis has a particular knack for imagining and describing how things would look to a person who had never seen them before, what in effect a \\"pure experience\\" would be like the moment when the sensation is trying to become perception, and a knack as well for reaching between soul and spirit to describe the inner subtle workings of human nature at a level most of us are normally unaware of until someone like Lewis describes them to us. The result makes for enjoyable reading, particularly in the context of a trip to another planet. Here Dr. Ransom is sent off by heavenly powers to Venus where another earthman, possessed of some diabolic force, is intent on bringing about the downfall of that race. Ransom is there to stop it. The story of the Original Sin is retold with imaginative variety, and the book has a particularly and undeniably Christian bent which may well affect the reaction of non-Christian readers. Lewis does a lot of philosophizing in this text, but not as much as in the final volume, That Hideous Strength, which is for that reason and others the weakest of the three. But here he is still at the height of his powers and in control of them."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Shall we call Perelandra an ecological fantasy? A psycho-drama? A novelized philosophical symposium? An illustrated Bible story? Whatever it is, the undoubted &quot;star&quot; of the novel is the planet Perelandra. There, Lewis creates not one world, but several distinct ecosystems: his unforgetable floating islands, (in Surprised by Joy and his autobiographical allegory Pilgrim's Regress Lewis describes how islands have been his symbol for paradise since childhood), the Fixed Lands, an undersea world of mermaids, an environment of caves, and finally the wonderfully complex world of the hero's shifting consciousness. The inner dialogue before and during the climactic scenes falls nothing short of genius.I agree with the reviewer below that the beauty Lewis imagines brings it out and makes us notice the beauty around us. As one of Lewis' favorite writers, G. K. Chesterton, put it, &quot;Nursery tales only echo an almost pre-natal leap of interest and amazement. These tales make the rivers run with wine only to make us remember, for one wild moment, that they run with water.&quot; As I walk through the bamboo groves of Japan, or remember skin-diving in Hawaii or camping in the Cascades, the effect that the bubble trees and night smells of Perelandra have on me similarly brings out the wonder of the earthly creation.As in all of Lewis' works, scene and plot are also the vehicle for the expression of philosophical ideas. Lewis plays with speculation about the nature of primitive man, ideas about gender like the Chinese Yin Yang theory, and a scathing critique of monism. (If, like Jim Jones or the Bagwan Rajneesh, his villain were a real person -- if that is the right term for them -- I suspect he too might be quite popular.)I note with amusement the complaint below that Perelandra is overtly Christian. Imagine that. The famous Christian apologist allowing metaphysics to muddy up his sci-fi novel. I wonder if people make the same complaints about Milton or Camus? Not that I am comparing Lewis to them -- &quot;the same wave never comes twice&quot; and Lewis can stand on his own in any crowd. Lewis may get a bit carried away at the end with his &quot;cosmic dance&quot; stuff; one of the book's few faults. But if you are not interested in ultimate issues of right and wrong, God and human choice, why pick up a novel by C. S. Lewis?author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I was riveted to the first episode of Space Trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet), so it was with great anticipation that I proceeded into Perelandra. The hardcover version has excellent binding and is of good quality.In this tale Elwin Ransom is summoned to Venus, which is in a pre-fallen Edenic state. The Devil follows, possessing the body of Ransom's deceased foe Weston in order to tempt the Venereal Eve. It becomes clear to Elwin that he must act to thwart Original Sin on Venus.The author is a well-known Christian, and this tale builds on basic themes of Christianity.I found the book to be more philosophical in nature, compared to Out of the Silent Planet, but still a very good tale.There are so few traditional science fiction details that the book doesn't read like a work of that genre (no space battles, no details on hyperdrive or warp technology). Instead it is an adventure, that unfolds to show the main character (and the reader, who easily slips into the protagonist's shoes) hidden secrets of the universe.Very thought provoking, and a must read for any Christian."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C. S. Lewis wrote in the Introduction to his &quot;Screwtape Letters&quot; that one reason why he had not written a similar book about angels was that &quot;every sentence would have to smell of heaven.&quot; In Perelandra, he has achieved that effect. The imagery and the sheer reason combine to make the most powerful and compelling picture of good vs. evil since the Book of Revelation. In Dr. Elwin Ransom we have a strong, good, yet thoroughly human hero; in Dr. Weston a chilling portrait of the real nature of evil. This is a book that should be read over and over again. It has something new to offer me every time I go back to it. C. S. Lewis wrote in his autobiography that his imagination was &quot;baptised&quot; by George MacDonald's Phantastes. For those seeking a similar imaginative experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Perelandra. For the whole experience I recommend the other two books of the trilogy, but Perelandra also stands on its own."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is my favorite book by C.S. Lewis. I was never really into reading until after graduating college. I picked up a copy of the Chronicles of Narnia and fell completely in love with those books. At the time I thought they were the greatest in world, and I still love them. I was actually sad when I finished The Last Battle because it was such a great story; I never wanted it to end. Then I started reading the space trilogy. I loved Out of the Silent Planet; it was great as well. But when I got to Perelandra I was floored. It was the same feeling I got when reading Narnia for the first time, only on a different scale. It's kind of like the Narnia books, but aimed more for adults. The worlds, characters, and the story are all incredible. You won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"In Perelandra, Dr. Ransom continues his interplanetary travels, this time to Venus (Perelandra). Unlike his previous adventure, this one has him sent intentionally, on a mission. The sights and sensations that greet Ransom on Perelandra are described with the beautiful imagery characteristic of Lewis's writings. Floating across the Venetian seas on mobile islands, Ransom encounters one of the two human residents of this shrouded planet. Soon after his arrival, however, a sinister force arrives on Perelandra in the form of Weston, the scientist from the previous book. The encounters and conversations following between Weston, Ransom, and the Queen are a fascinating image of what the temptation in the Garden of Eden may have been like. Also, the discourses given in this portion of the book are deeply thought-provoking. For these reasons and for the excellent suspense, I highly recommend Perelandra."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Though not as well known as Lewis's Narnia novels, he also wrote a series of three novels, featuring Elwin Ransom as the main protagonist, in the late 1930s and early to mid 1940s. Lewis wrote the novels due to his famous conversation with his close friend J. R. R. Tolkien, who both said there wasn't enough of their type of fiction in the world, so they would have to write their own. Lewis wrote the Space Trilogy, and Tolkien wrote part of an abandoned, unfinished novel called THE LOST ROAD. Ransom, a philologist, is actually modeled after Tolkien.There's a story in one of Tolkien's letters (published in LETTERS OF J.R.R. TOLKIEN) where his daughter, Priscilla, was reading the trilogy during one of the holidays in the 1940s, and, according to Tolkien, quite sensibly came to the conclusion that PERELANDRA was the best of the trilogy.The second book in the trilogy is PERELANDRA. In many ways, it is the richest of the trilogy in terms of spiritual depth. While OSP is more straight science fiction, and THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH social commentary, PERELANDRA is closely modeled on the Adam & Eve story in Genesis. This novel is something of a homage to one of Lewis's favorite, John Milton. It's a beautiful book, and raises the question of what exactly would happen if Adam and Eve had not fallen. And this time, instead of being kidnapped Maleldil sends Ransom there.The main plot of the novel has Ransom, who was kidnapped last novel, actually being sent to Venus. Lewis does away with the problem of spaceships this time around, having angels just take his protagonist there. He finds himself in a world of vast oceans, with floating islands that are actually behave like film or foam on the ocean, undulating and taking the shape of each wave. He soon meets the Green Lady, who is unfallen. Her husband is on another of the floating islands (they had become separated when they were on different islands which drifted away from one another).Eventually, Weston arrives, the villain from the previous novel, and we find that Ransom must prevent him from corrupting the Green Lady, to prevent another Fall into Sin. Weston is an agent of Satan, and so wants to bring sin into Venus as well.The majority of the novel focuses on Ransom and his efforts to protect the Green Lady from the Un-man, which Weston actually becomes after shortly arriving on Venus. Weston actually becomes demonically possessed, and ultimately must be stopped at all cost. Ransom is stripped, both physically and symbolically, having to rely on Maleldil (Jesus) to help him.SPOILER:Eventually, Ransom and the Un-man swim to an underground chamber, with the Un-Man biting Ransom's heel. This wound that will never fully heal, an allusion to Arthur and the Grail myth as well as the scripture in Genesis saying man will crush the serpent's head, and the serpent will bruise mankind's heel. In the end, Ransom puts the Un-Man to death, and so prevents Venus from having a second fall. The Green Lady and her husband are united.END SPOILERThe descriptions of the floating islands and Ransom's experience on Perelandra in the first section of the book before he meets The Green Lady, along with the ending section of THE LAST BATTLE from Narnia where they are in heaven, to me is the most beautiful passages that ever came from Lewis's pen.One fault that this novel does have it the ending seems to be rather preachy, but otherwise this is a first class novel, and for many readers this will be one of Lewis's most spiritually rewarding novels. Only in THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS does he deal so accurately and directly and with such psychologically insight on the problems of temptation and accountability.While this novel is technically termed \\"science fiction\\", this is much more a spiritual track of our times than straight science fiction. The book is closely modeled upon Milton's PARADISE LOST.For myself, the best way to read this book is reading it in conjunction with two other books, an unofficial trilogy, if you will. Because PERELANDRA is so closely related to PARADISE LOST, you should read that as well. Also read Lewis's literary criticism A PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, in which he expertly discusses Milton's work. Lewis is a brilliant literary critic, and PREFACE is one of the best critical works on the PARADISE LOST ever produced.My own unofficial trilogy:1. Paradise Lost. (John Miltion)2. A Preface to Paradise Lost (C. S. Lewis)3. PerelandraOverall, many readers will find PERELANDRA Lewis's most spiritually satisfying of the three novels. The characterization is strongest in this novel, as Lewis is only dealing primarily with three characters, and we really get to know all of them quite intimately. The novel is also focused mainly on evil in an unfallen world and what one must do to save that world. Until Lewis wrote TILL WE HAVE FACES in the late 1950s, the novel which he felt was his true masterpiece, he long felt this book was his best, and placed it second best after FACES. This was Lewis's favorite in the Space Trilogy and for good reason. It's probably the best (though my personal favorite is THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH)."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I thought this book was a good example of CS Lewis's thought and world view, but as a story I just didn't enjoy it as much as \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". This one was much more overtly \\"religious\\" - I don't think it's a spoiler to say we are dealing quite explicitly with \\"The Fall\\". That's potentially a very interesting topic for a story like this. However at times I felt like I was reading the book of Job - long series of intellectual conversations back and forth. And we have our primordial Lady, who is naive to concepts like sin and death, and thus some of the conversations become very circuitous and convoluted in just trying to explain these things. It's just not light reading, and some parts like this drag a bit. Similarly toward the end, we have what I would characterize as Lewis's attempt to produce the world's wordiest litany (the series of \\"Blessed be he!\\" speeches). Put me straight to sleep two nights in a row.One of Lewis's themes here is the crossover between \\"myth\\" and \\"history\\". It's a theme Lewis uses elsewhere as well. Here he really forces the issue. This story is self-consciously \\"mythic\\" but set at a real time in history, and kind of forces the issue that Genesis is also \\"history\\" in the same sense. I think some of this is Lewis self-consciously reacting to the trends in Biblical scholarship starting in the 19th century, which would crassly equate \\"myth\\" with \\"fiction\\" and \\"fable\\". But here Lewis swings quite a bit farther in the other direction than I expected.Another of Lewis's bugbears is modern astronomy or cosmology which would have a universe so vast and with no center, that humanity becomes insignificant by that vastness, leading to despair. I don't know, maybe this was a popular reaction more specific to Lewis's own age. But it was clearly on his mind when he wrote this, particularly the world's wordiest litany that I referred to above.Again Lewis uses the character of Weston to personify other trends he doesn't like. When Weston first shows up, he's expounding a rather absurd sort of Pantheism or what we might now call \\"New Age\\" philosophy. I don't want to say too much about what happens with Weston, so as not to spoil the story, but it's clear what Lewis is saying that the \\"New Age\\" opens oneself to.The story is at its best when Lewis lets his imagination go, and provides vivid and sensual descriptions of this new world - the sights, the sounds, the floating islands upon the stormy seas, the beasts on the land, sea, sky and underground, the tastes and sensations of the fruits. The story just really slows down for some of these extended \\"meditations\\" in the form of long conversations."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C.S. Lewis richly deserves a place with the top ten authors of the Twentieth Century. He has proven himself to be a virtuoso with the English language and a master story teller encompassing many literary forms from narrative to prose to fantasy. He wrote effectively to adults as well as children.I came late to the space trilogy, having read his other works for several years. A friend pulled the collection from his bookshelf and I was surprised that I hadn't heard of them. I have now read them ten or more times and still find each one fascinating, especially Perelandra.Lewis' stunning description of this paradise fills the mind with colors and textures, sights and sounds. One feels washed and cleansed by the beauty and purity of a world we can only hope for.The running dialogue between the three main characters is a masterpiece of Christian Philosophy and a must-read for the serious Bible student.I will continue to enjoy all of Lewis' writings for the remainder of my journey, especially Perelandra, and I look forward to meeting him when I arrive at my destination.J.D Hancock"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"The impulse to create a fantasy world as a staging area for this-world ideas is one that is perhaps common enough to us all, but there are a select few with the genius to bring their 'worlds' alive to a common 'us.' C. S. Lewis accomplishes this with consummate, and entertaining ease.While I am mindful that Mr Lewis has a decidely proselytic bent, it must be said that his stories deal with much more than the ongoing battle for the human soul (psyche). Mr Lewis's ability to evoke an otherworldly feeling is excellent transport away from our reality, and into the concept of what life means in a cosmic sense--perhpas this above all other forms of entertainment allows for a great evening read--trading our commute for floating islands in a desolate sea of movement and vibrancy.Once you get over the schmalz, which is similar to letting your eyes go out of focus to see the genius of Manet, you will find the book to be an excellent escapist treatise with enjoyable efforts at finding meanings in linguistics and behaviour, as well as a great adventure."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Drawn into paradise, the reader is alive, excited, fearful.

I've read the book several times; the most enjoyable was while on summer vacation in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Reading about the green seas and golden skies, the variegated floating islands, the bubble trees, etc., while surrounded by the wondrous beauty of our own world, was a profoundly enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I love this book! Perelandra is a book about a man named Dr. Ransom who was kidnapped by two humans to take to sacrifice to the planet Malacandra. Now he is called to the planet of Perelandra to protect it from a man named Weston who is possesed by the devil. Weston is trying to get the first women on the planet to disobey god and sleep on the fixed land. Just like when the serpent told Eve to eat the fruit in the garden of eden.If the women goes on the fixed land Perelandra falls into corruption just as earth."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is a really wonderful book, in which Ransom flies to Venus to intervene on behalf of a multi-colored Adam and Eve. It is very fun the way that Lewis uncovers details in the story, as Ransom proceeds with astonishment is his strangely deliberate and chaste way. An odd and very English character.But the writing is absolutely wonderful, and some of the scenes quite unforgettable - there is one where he barely escapes a battle for his life, but winds up unknowingly in a pitch-black cave, waiting in frustration for the sun to rise. He then has to feel his way out, encountering a large insect-like creature he observes by the light of a lava flow. I simply loved that image, which makes this a genuine masterpiece of scifi in my opinion. As ever, it is full of surprizes.Warmly recommended for true scifi fans."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"In this installment of the Space Trilogy, we see the central character, Ransom, sent to the planet Perelandra by the eldila. Whereas &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; relates the story of Ransom's self-discovery, &quot;Perelandra&quot; is the story of Ransom discovering his purpose for being sent to Perelandra. Perelandra is a young planet, and Ransom finds himself in the middle of an innocent world with only two humans. It is a wonderful tale of how this version of the Garden of Eden unfolds. There is a good balance of action and adventure with reason and beauty.The only knock I have against the story is in how it is organized. The beginning is in chapter 1 while the end is in chapter 2. The remainder of the book gives the detailed account of what happened in chapter 2. I found this somewhat odd, and it takes some of the tension/suspense out of the story because you already know how it ends."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Consistent with reviews on almost any site, I rate this book as excellent because it is both profound and entertaining. Forget that you found it in the science fiction section, and just enjoy a great story that inspires you to make choices in light of the spiritual foundations of our world."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is an awesome book. Anyone who enjoys science fiction will love it because it uses so much of the imagination. C.S. Lewis is in my opinion one of the best writers who ever lived."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I've been a fan of C. S. Lewis all my life, but I only recently discovered his Space Trilogy.

(or iBooks :)"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is the best book of C.S. Leiws' Space Trilogy, slightly better than the first book \\"Out of the Silent Planet.\\" A bit deeper and richer than the first book, with metaphors that make you think."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Now here is the C.S. Lewis I remember and love! \\"Out of the SIlent Planet,\\" the first book in the space trilogy, wasn't nearly as good as it was cracked up to be. But this one was fantastic. It had all of the elements that make up some of Lewis' best fictional work: allegory with a moral purpose and fantasy with a large dose of wonder. In this book, Lewis takes the tale of the downfall of man from the book of Genesis and wonders what would've happened if there had been someone there to challenge the devil before he had fully tempted Eve. Lewis also sheds much of the analytical prose that weighed down the first book and has wonderful elements that could be read straight from a self-improvement book, but still fits snugly into the story. Chapter 11 is absolutely amazing in that respect. Still, this book does make it's allegory a little too obvious as it goes along. In fact, halfway through, Lewis seems to give up on the allegory angle somewhat and actually talks about God and has his main character praying to God. All things considered, this is an amazing story, a vast improvement over the last one, and makes me excited to read the final one."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"There are so many great things about this book, as with all Lewis's books. I think everyone should read them all, and this one is great especially if you liked Out of the Silent Planet."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Received the book in a timely manner. It is a light weight paperback - does the job. I already had the 3rd book of the series, so wanted the first two."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I refer to the Pan Book published in 1963 under the title 'Voyage to Venus'. The visual experience so richly experienced by readers of 'Out of the Silent Planet' is even exceeded here. Although it is less varied, it is more magical and evocative. The story itself contains much philosophy and religion much of which I am uncomfortable with, unsure of, or confused by. I am left with too many questions, and there are too many alternate paths for the story which are not excluded by its own inner logic. We all know the first few bars of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. It is unthinkable that it could have been an ascending phrase rather than a descending one. The inner logic of the symphony demands it to be the way Beethoven wrote it. With 'Perelandra' this is not so for me. The story could have gone in different directions and at the end I am unconvinced by the direction C S Lewis did take it. But, having said that, it is a wonderful vision that has remained strongly with me since I first read the book while I was at High School and was great to renew (and the rediscovery of 'Out of the Silent Planet' at High School when I had read it even earlier in my life was similar) ."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Unlike the first volume of the trilogy that begins with &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; and concludes in &quot;That Hideous Strength,&quot; this book is a slow mover. The climactic battle, once it comes, has plenty of blood and terror; but getting there takes some patience. Its depiction of evil's chilling, banal brutality also takes a strong stomach.With that said, though, Lewis describes the innocent world we know as Venus with detail and poetry. I fear his view of women and their proper role belongs to my grandfather's generation; but that I have to forgive, because - after all - they fought in the same war.Worth reading in order to get from Book One to Book Three."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"When Lewis writes, the idea actually makes sense.The book retells the Eden story, but one that went the right way. I was surprised at a few things in this book, including the eventual relationship between god and man on Lewis' other planet. I was also surprised at how completely Lewis focussed the story on the Eve figure and her dealings with the 'snake'. The Adam figure really never appeared until the last few pages, once she had been through the hard part.It's hard to remember that this story was written almost 60 years ago, during World War II. Back then, the protagonist's physical conquest of evil probably had a very noble meaning. Today, it looks quite different when our hero whips himself into a religious frenzy, then batters another man to death, spending a day or more inflicting increasing levels of injury before bashing his face in with a rock. It is chilling to see the hero justify this by declaring the other human to be an 'Un-man', so not worth human consideration. It is even more chilling that he experiences less feeling at brutally murdering his one-time compatriot than at the taste of an unusual fruit, judging by the amount of text spent on each. I just can not read today's headlines and see the act as wholly virtuous.On a more positive note, Lewis' apparent idea of sin does strike a chord with me. Given that evil is a different thing, one of the gravest sins in Lewis' world might be in the modern phrase, &quot;It's not my job,&quot; or worse yet, &quot;I don't get paid enough to do that.&quot; Many necessities are no one's job, but necessary nonetheless. No, there is no pay for many moral and requisite tasks - if anything, the doing may cost the doer dearly. Need and duty are the issues. Lewis barely wastes breath on the idea of fairness.The book, of course, is a classic. Like so many, it must be read in the spirit in which it was written; modern values only corrupt its original intent. I like the book for itself, but I also appreciate the contrast it shows between Lewis' time and our own."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"The used book was in great shape as advertised. There were no torn pages, writing (highlighting) on pages, etc."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C.S. Lewis' Perelandra is not really science fiction but more of a fairy tale for grown-ups. There is no exploration of future science or technology (though, the third book in the trilogy, That Hideous Strength, does explore more traditional themes of science fiction). The setting of Perelandra is an imagined Venus but could just as easily have been a Narnia-like realm. What is key for the wider story is an alien world from which humans are separated by a seemingly impassable abyss.One of the main questions posed by Lewis here is what if Adam and Eve were, in some way, given a second chance? More importantly: What if Adam and Eve were not just met with an agent of evil but also an agent of good, an agent who then desperately sought to persuade the first man and woman not to forsake the word of God. Lewis also poses the question, What if humans were not the only sentient creatures in the universe? This is certainly not a new theme in science fiction, but Lewis provides a fresh perspective by addressing it from a Christian perspective. Lewis questions whether humans might not be just one branch of many within the designs of God.As other reviewers have noted, there is little action in the novel, but the moral tension, the intense theological debates, will grip any reflective reader, whether one is Christian or not. Indeed, some of the earthly suppositions and theories forwarded by that chilling mouthpiece of Satan, the Un-man, are themselves very compelling. Lewis' narration of Ransom's subsequent subterranean journeys are likewise suspenseful and offer a haunting glimpse into a vast and alien world.Perelandra is the best book in Lewis' \\"Space Trilogy\\" and can be read on its own, though Out of the Silent Planet and That Hideous Strength are still very much worthwhile."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"You can read the other reviews for a plot summary. Let me add that I've read this great novel many times and do not see it as an allegory. From Lewis's other works and letters, I think it's clear that he meant this to be a \\"what if?\\" series. What if space travel is possible--what will we find out there? His answer is that earth (the Silent Planet) is separated from the rest of the universe by sin. What if someone from earth goes to Venus, a planet that knows no sin? What if Satan (the bent angel) tries to achieve what he achieved on earth--the seduction of the planet's residents? How would this all play out?If Lewis had wanted to write an allegory, he could've done that: see \\"The Pilgrim's Regress\\". Instead he wrote an engaging, exciting story of good vs. evil--happening all over again."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Awe inspiring, beautiful, clear, logical and emotional. Magnificent praise of God! Words are inadequate to describe its effect on me when I first read it and when I read it again -- and I've lost track of how many times I've reread it. Read it! I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"When I say 'all,' I am merely referring to the antecedent and latter of the three books that compose Lewis' famed 'Space Trilogy.' I had never considered myself to be a fan of science fiction; however, as I am a fan of Lewis, it was nearly obligatory that I read his famous 'Space Trilogy.' I found myself approaching the first book, 'Out of the Silent Planet,' with a marginal amount of reluctance. But, as I ventured further and further into the core of the book, my heart instantly grew fond of the ever-mesmerising style which has made Lewis a master of the pen. Although very impressed and delighted with 'Planet,' what awaited me within the pages of 'Perelandra' was nothing short of literary bliss. Writing himself into the story as a friend of Dr. Elwin Ransom, Lewis captivates his audience after mere pages as he travels to Ransom's own home. What commences after he arrives is perhaps Lewis' most beautiful work in print. As Dr. Ransom travels to a second distant planet, Perelandra, we (the audience) are assaulted with pellucid imagary and chilling realities that are not easily shaken after the last page is turned. 'Perelandra' is a world of fantasy; a world of fantasy which personafies the struggle of good and evil and offers a lucid and tangible potrayal of the Fall of Man. A MUST read for any science-fiction or Lewis connoisseur. A thrilling book and a truly delightful read!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra is a magnificently documented and narrated story of the beginnings of the new world. The descriptions of the surroundings around the entire planet made me feel as if I were really walking on the islands myself. The book expresses the unbelievable beauty and peace God gave to man, and the horror brought to earth by Satan when he tempted Eve. Now Ransom has been placed with the task of stopping it from happening again to the young inhabitants of Perelandra.The book flys by very fast (I read the last 120 pages in 4 hours). Lewis' talent to mix biblical events into a fictional tale shine through once again. Recommend this to all your friends!Check my other reveiws for great Christian CDs, Books, movies, etc."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"CS Lewis illustrates through glittering and luminous imagery a tale enwrapped with soul and heartache. He again shatters my preconcieved notions of science fiction as a genre. This tale is worth the time, it's not an escape, it's a reexamination of reality. Lewis dons prescience of the pitfalls of new age as well as teaching us about temptation and the wiles of the enemy. Beautiful, beautiful. There are some parts that you may have to be patient as you absorb the atmosphere of this landscape, but I seriously read this book while walking to my car and I just couldn't stop. Very Very good."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This book is truly amazing. Not only is it thoughtful and deep in its Christian allegorical sense. It is also something you can sit down with and get totally absorbed in; it must be the incredible description, or maybe the author's amazing talent--but whatever it is will allow you to forget everyone and everything around you for a while and feel like you're experiencing it, not just reading it. Mr. Lewis was definitely a genious. Out of the Silent Planet was wonderful, and That Hideous Strength was pretty good too, but no book in the world is comparable to Perelandra. Nobody can explain it well enough. You'd have to read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C. S. Lewis' Perelandra is sometimes described as a work of science fiction, but those who read it expecting to find a typical science fiction novel (if there is such a thing as a \\"typical\\" sf novel), are likely to be disappointedly surprised. While the protagonist, Ransom, is indeed transported to the planet Perelandra, otherwise known as Venus, the book is much more one of Christian philosophy than it is of science fiction. In fact, the entire story is an allegorical retelling of the Garden of Eden myth.The retelling does have a rather intriguing twist in that Ransom is sent to Perelandra to do battle with the evil tempter in an attempt to save this planet's \\"Eve\\" from succumbing to his seductions and thereby leading \\"Adam\\" to another biblical fall from grace. This is a decently imaginative approach and affords Lewis copious opportunities to regale the reader with wonderful descriptions of the Perelandrian Garden of Eden.Inasmuch as the characters and assumptions are derived from Lewis' early 20th century Christian philosophy, the book contains several concepts that may be jarring to a more egalitarian 21st century reader. For example, the Venusian \\"Adam\\" is referred to as the King, not as a deity but as the literal ruler of the planet, which assuredly exalts him above \\"Eve,\\" who is merely his Lady. In numerous passages, both \\"Adam\\" and \\"Eve\\"are described as superior to all the other animals on the planet, which must bow to their human supremacy. Humans of Tellus, otherwise known as Earth, are, of course, all sinners as the result of their own failed Garden of Eden experiment. The Evil One manifests himself in the body of Weston, a physicist whose empiricism rejects notions of religious beliefs. There are more examples, but the simple point is that Christian biblical stories, beliefs and assumptions underlie all of the characters, actions and assumptions in Lewis' novel.As usual, Lewis' use of language is superb, and his descriptive writing is worth studying for the edification of other would-be authors. I did find two parts of the book somewhat annoying, however. The first is the dialogue between Ransom and the Un-man, representative of evil, as the Un-man discusses Spirituality and \\"truth\\" from his perspective. Try as I might, I could not follow the Un-man's argument and, indeed, Ransom himself says that he is not sure of the Un-man's meaning. Perhaps Lewis has intentionally obfuscated the sense of the argument to indicate that arguments from such a source are fallacious and clouded. The other part comes near the end, while the Eldila, which appear to be angelic entities, expound on the encompassing nature of God. Their lengthy hyperbolic descriptions and analogies become quite tedious after a while.Would I recommend the book to a potential reader? That depends entirely on the reader's motivation. If it is to observe Lewis' generally fine writing skill and technique, then certainly I would recommend spending some time with Perelandra. If one is interested in exploring an imaginative twist to an old story and seeing what the supposed outcome of an \\"unfallen\\" Adam and Eve might have been, then surely the book is worthwhile. I would not recommend it for someone who is ignorant of Christian mythology, for many references and allusions would be missed without a background knowledge of the biblical story of Man's fall from Grace. Certainly, I would not suggest it to anyone seeking a \\"real\\" science fiction novel, unless, of course, the reader were equally interested in a philosophical look at the nature of good and evil, innocence and sin, and beauty and ugliness, for this theme is paramount throughout Perelandra. So far as the title I chose for these comments, if it intrigues you, then by all means read the book and think on the symbolic nature of the container that transports Ransom from Tellus to Perelandra and back again!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This book is disappointing after \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", not because Lewis's skill has become worse in any way, but because this time he is preaching to the choir. The subject is \\"Original Sin\\", the notion that humans are inherently sinful because some ancestors disobeyed a basically meaningless command. Now the story is being re-enacted on another planet, Perelandra, and the hero Ransom is trying to keep the new species from making the same mistake. If you believe in Original Sin, you will probably find the story very dramatic. If you believe in some other religious tradition (as I do) or no religious tradition, you will probably find the storyline boring and overwrought. This was not the case in Out of the Silent Planet, where the reader was presented with an inherently interesting situation and the doctrine was saved until the end.Likewise, the background is less imaginative than in Out of the Silent Planet. Malacandra was wonderfully alien, with the three unusual intelligent species and the wierd but plausible landscape. Perelandra is a stereotypical tropical paradise, with a few extra features like friendly dragons and floating islands. The species is not new but a copy of homo sapiens (doctrinal explanations again).For once I found myself wishing that a sequel had stuck closer to the original masterpiece."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I will never forget the first time that I read Perelandra. Having recently finished Out of the Silent Planet, my hopes were high for the second book in C. S. Lewis's space trilogy. However, I was completely suprised by and unprepared for the experience that was to come in this amazing work.Perelandra is one of those books that is truly great on so many different levels. Lewis's representation of innocence is incredibly deep and very believable. His portrayal of evil, both mentally and physically, is terrifying. The philosophical and theological subjects discussed in the book are many and varied. And Lewis's vision of paradise is one of the most stirring and memorable moments that I have ever had in reading a piece of literature.Perelandra is like a great symphony, it has the power to raise the soul to new heights. The descriptive and imaginative story, the profoundness in the dialogue with the Green Lady, the diabolical methods and doings of the Un-man, the words screamed to the heavens at the beginning of the final struggle, the unveiling of gender by the Eldils, the glory and wonder of the King and Queen, the mystery of the Great Dance; one could go on and on.Like all great writings, Perelandra rewards multiple readings. And like a truly great author, C. S. Lewis has conjured up thoughts and images that I will remember for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"While I agree with the review that this book may not be true Science Fiction, but should be considered Fantasy, I still enjoyed this book. The idea of visiting a world before the introduction of sin into it fascinates me. The book is a great followup to \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", where we learn of the rebellion of Thulcandra, or Earth. Here we have the attempt of Satan to destroy the Edenic planet of Perelandra, and ruin another planet of God's creation. The debates between Weston, Ransom, and the Queen of Perelandra are thought provoking. A few passages even gave me the creeps - seeing the destructiveness of evil compared to the beauty of perfection. This book will not disappoint - unless you are looking for it to be a Hard Sci-Fi novel."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"'Perelandra' departs from traditional science-fiction, as viewed uncomfortably in 'Out of the Silent Planet' and moves more into the realms of fantasy.

The topics are extremely deep so it is sometimes hard to follow, but well worth the effort.This is were he deals with some of the real &quot;why&quot; questions asked through the ages, like &quot;Why was eating a piece of fruit such a big deal?&quot; &quot;Why did God even put the tree there in the first place?&quot; &quot;Why create the universe, and how does it all fit together?&quot; etc."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C.S. Lewis's Space Trilogy is easily one of the best series I've ever read, and while each volume is so strong that it's difficult to choose the best, Perelandra, the second book, builds well on the foundation laid by Out of the Silent Planet and, in the end, outshines the final book, That Hideous Strength.The story begins as Lewis, writing himself into his own story, arrives in the English countryside to visit his old friend Dr. Ransom, with whom he has been corresponding about Ransom's strange journey to Mars, chronicled in the first book of the series. When Lewis arrives, Ransom reveals that the eldils--angelic creatures bound to different planets--of Mars have continuously visited him since his return to Earth, and that he is to leave on another journey that very night. Boxed up in an otherworldly, coffin-like capsule, Ransom is whisked away and doesn't return for over a year. When he does, he narrates his story through Lewis.Perelandra is the actual name of what we call the planet Venus, and when Ransom crashes through the dense, cloudy atmosphere he finds himself in a world of nothing but ocean, where floating islands of matted plants drift along, providing a place for rest and sleep. There, he meets the Queen of Venus, a green-skinned, naked woman apparently innocent of all knowledge except that told directly to her by Maleldil, or God. She knows the animals and their names, that her husband, the King, is somewhere on the same planet, and that Maleldil has forbidden them both to spend the night on solid land.Ransom decides that he has been brought to a new Eden, but for what purpose? His question is answered when a familiar-looking spaceship lands on Perelandra and Dr. Weston, the Nietzschean nemesis of Out of the Silent Planet, rows ashore. Weston soon plays host to a devilish tempter and Ransom's duty becomes clear--he must prevent this Eden's fall.Perelandra is a tour de force for C.S. Lewis. All of his skills are on display and sharply focused--the beautifully-drawn world, the deep resonance of his message and theme, and even the wry, good-natured humor that underlies so much of his work. And the work is far deeper than most scientific or theological fiction--parallels to his own works, such as The Screwtape Letters, and works like Paradise Lost and The Divine Comedy abound. Those to Paradise Lost are perhaps the most pointed, as Lewis dethrones Milton's concept of a high, stately Satan and replaces it with the far more likely childish, vindictive devil that inhabits Weston.The Space Trilogy is very loosely constructed, which means that any one of the books can be read as either part of the series or as stand-alone entertainment. It may not be necessary to read Out of the Silent Planet prior to this novel, but I'd recommend it and, if you choose not to, you'll want to once you've finished Perelandra. You won't be disappointed.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This book is one of the finest books that I have read in a long time.

You may just glimpse a tiny, invaluable essence of the struggle with principalities and powers at extreme elevations....because Perelandra isn't really a novel, and most especially not science fiction.

Narnia's allagory is barely puddle deep by comparison. This is intended for folks who want to think long and hard while they're reading.What WOULD have happened if Eve hadn't eaten the apple at Creation? Perelandra attempts to answer that question and in the process, teaches us a lot about our own psyche when dealing with the enemy.GREAT description. In this relatively short book, Lewis packs in all kinds of descriptive detail. Much more so than the Narnia series. You can really feel the environment (and the emotional state of Ransom as he progresses through the story).EMOTION. At least, that's what it produced in me. I cried over and over again as Lewis masterfully showed how the weakness of humanity is always a prayer away from the Majestic Strength of Jesus Christ.With no shame i confess that i WEPT like a child when i put it down.\\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" is great, and \\"That hideous strength\\" is wonderfully done...but Perelandra is the gem in this series."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra, published in 1943 is the second work of a trilogy by the father of Christian Science Fiction, C. S. Lewis. The first story in the trilogy, Out of the Silent Planet, was published in 1938, and the set concludes with That Hideous Strength, released in 1945.Lewis is the author of many novels including, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and the other Narnia stories as well as non-fiction works including Mere Christianity, The Abolition of Man and A Grief Observed. Lewis was a close friend of J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of The Lord of the Rings. Both were professors at Oxford University and members of an informal literary group called The Inklings.The science part of the story is largely dated. In this book Lewis largely avoids the issue of space flight having the protagonist, Elwin Ransom, unconscious during the trip to Venus. In the novel Venus is ocean paradise not the dry hellish world we now know it to be. The writing style is also somewhat dated, being told in narrative and containing much more introspection, exposition, and character discussion than is done in modern literature. In all of his fiction works Lewis uses allegory to teach Christianity.In the story Elwin Ransom, the protagonist, is sent by Oyarsa, the angel who governs Mars, to Perelandra, the planet we know as Venus. While the first book, Out of the Silent Planet, was an adventure story with allegory, Perelandra is more of a philosophical discussion within an adventure. The story is an examination of the fall of man and, in part, Lewis' answer to the John Milton's Paradise Lost and parallels to Dante's journey in The Divine Comedy.I rate this book four-star only in the context of Lewis' overall excellent writing. This story is less of an adventure, a slower pace and much more allegory.Recommendation: Christians interested in science fiction should read all three works of this trilogy both for edification and entertainment. They remain, overall, five-star stories.Kyle Pratt"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is a fascinating book and story that must be read all the way through book three in the series to be truly understood. One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is an excelent book, and can be equally enjoyed alone or as part of the trilogy.

I hardly had a clue until I read this book! I found the descriptions of the planet to be surprising and very imaginative. It was not what I expected. The illustration by Kinuko Craft of whales, dragons, and palm trees on the cover of the edition I purchased is very good and hints at the story without giving too much information away. The story is a powerful morality tale. The author managed to tell the story with very few characters which I thought was interesting and a bit surprising. Most of the book is great but there are some grim parts that dragged on a bit longer than I would have liked. Evil is a persistence that makes wary the tempted. Do not worry, it is not all gloom. There are many light hearted moments in the book too! Overall I like this book and recommend it for fans of the previous book. This is the second book of a trilogy. It takes place between \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and \\"That Hideous Strength\\" (please see my reviews of those two books for more details). The books of the trilogy tie together, but they were also written to be read independently of each other. A note to sensitive readers: There is more descriptive violence and malevolence in this story than the last one, but there are also many parts of the story that are wonderful and fun!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra may contain the best setting of any fantasy/sci-fi book I've read. Lewis describes the world incredibly beautifully, and does it justice in his description of it. He pulls out all the stops on this one, using the perfect words and evocative imagery to place you right in the book.The story follows Ransom as he travels to the planet of Perelandra to prevent some disaster from happening. Ransom finds that the planet is like a paradise, and in reality, it is. Perelandra is a planet that is still in it's Eden state. Ransom runs into a emerald colored woman, an the majority of the novel is his interactions with her.There's maybe one drawback to the novel. Prepare to reread the last chapter or two a lot. Lewis throws a lot of material at you there that is kind of difficult to grasp."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This book continues the adventures of Ransom from Out of the Silent Planet.

However, I was not prepared for the extent to which this allegorization took place, and found the book too horribly oppressing and proselytizing to continue reading it past the climax scene. This is not a spiritual book disguised as science fiction. This is a diatribe disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"After a certainly interesting visit to Malacandra (Mars), which sounds only slightly old fashioned, we have here another planetary visit by the indefatigble Dr. Ransom. The space craft is a coffin and after his resurrection on Venus he meets Eve and..... Now stop, this cant be right. \\"Eve?\\" Oh yes, Venus is a primordial planet, paradise in the essence. There is no mankind there and therefore they have not fallen, yet. So the world is still benevolent to its dwellers and any evil existing there is introduced by the travellers from Thulcandra (earth).I must say I waded through the book feeling increasingly uncomfortable. All that christian and fundamentalist imagery gave me toothache, in the toes. The tone of the book is somewhat edyfying and pietistic and, well.... schmaltzy, saccharine, cloyingly sweet, exalted, sentimental, get the drift?I did not enjoy the book, nor did I enjoy the next instalment, the \\"Hideous strength\\""},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"- we'd still be in Paradise. Old professor Lewis, you see, would have talked simpleton Eve (clearly, Lewis believed all women to be children in need of male guidance) out of falling for the Serpent's rhetoric. Failing that, he would have saved the day by smashing the Serpent with a rock.This novel is the worst bit of drivel in a ghastly trio of what are generally classified as science fiction novels.In this thinly disguised scrap of plodding evangelism, Lewis demonstrates his remarkable lack of rhetorical skills. When Lewis's reconfigured Serpent(whose brand of evil is more reminiscent of infantile brattiness than of the de Sade or Dahmer or Hitler varieties) appears--between bouts of ripping open innocent little Venusian animals for grins--to be on the verge of convincing the new Eve to \\"eat\\" of the new \\"Tree of Knowledge,\\" the protagonist finds himself incapable of pulling any knowledge of rhotoric from his supposedly brilliant philological mind. Instead he decides to just circumvent all the talking and pummel the Devil to death.My, what an impressive morality Dr. Lewis evinces."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C.S. Lewis was able to write so many genres: children's books, cerebral treatises, and fantasy allegory. Perelandra was touted as a science fiction drama, but the action I associate with drama was pretty nil. While missing a more modern drama with cliff-hanging excitement, it was a feast for the intellect. Always an allegorical proselyte, Lewis demands us to focus while we dream of his other-worldly fight of good v. evil. If you love his fantastical worlds with a moral, you would surely love this book. I found it a bit of a slog from time to time, but Lewis demands our attention. A favorite quote from the Green Lady, speaking to Ransom: \\"One goes into the forest to pick food, and already the thought of one fruit rather than another has grown up in one's mind. Then it may be one finds a different fruit and not the fruit one thought of. One joy was expected and another is given. . . You could send your soul after the good you had expected instead of turning it to the good you got. You could refuse the real good; you could make the real fruit taste insipid by thinking of the other.\\" Essentially . . . \\"it's all good\\" as they say. . . . Take what you get and declare it good."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra by C.S. Lewis is the story of a man named Ransom and his travels in the world of Venus. Ransom is a scientist who in the previous novel was kidnapped and brought to Malacandra, or Mars. In this novel, he has allied himself with the great Maleldil, creator of all, and is sent to Perelandra for reasons he does not know. When he lands there in his novelty white coffin, courtesy of Maleldil, he discovers a strange world fit for the goddess of love. He is guided by an unseen hand on this world and meets a woman called the Lady, who understands nothing of evil, and even disappointments like meeting Ransom instead of her lost mate the King are welcomed because she may learn from them. Basically, everything around her pleases her to a greater or lesser degree. While Ransom and the Lady are learning from eachother, they see a black spaceship that plummets into the sea. This heralds the arrival of all evil on Perelandra, and Ransom discovers his purpose: to hold it back and destroy it in whatever way he can.The themes in this book are taken straight out of the Christian Bible, and surprisingly work within the setting of Science fiction. This isn't a retelling of the Garden of Eden, it's more like a second chapter to it. Perelandra was tempted but had someone there to help it, and therefore comes out of it even more beautiful than it was before.C.S. Lewis creates an absolutely beautiful, perfect world that could be destroyed in an instant by evil. This apprehension puts people on the edges of their seats, and gives a sense of urgency to the novel. Lewis manages to incorporate fear of the dark, of being followed by strange things and noises, but he also puts in a feeling of safeness and calmness. Overall, this deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is my favorite book ever. C.S. Lewis is a master who can fuse theology and science fiction into the most beautiful novel I've read. Ransom is a marvelous protagonist who does not seem like the type to lead these theological musings. If you enjoyed any of Lewis' other books, especially his works of fiction, you will like the Deep Heaven Trilogy of which this book is the second."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is the second of three series that is not-so-well-known but a must-read of the CS Lewis collection. As in the first of the three, CS Lewis tells the Christian redemption story again through the narrative of Ransom and the characters on the second planet he visits, Perelandra. Personally I found it little slow-moving, but the highlight was when the main character has an epiphany and states, \\"I am Ransom,\\" realizing he is the messiah figure sent to redeem this planet from the stain and spread of an evil force. After this the book quickly wraps things up leaving the reader with a most beautiful ending."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Lewis continues strongly the work he began in \\"Out of the Silent Planet.\\" This volume contains even more overt morality and spiritual content than its predecessor. In this book, Lewis crafts a masterful tale of good and evil, human nature, and the reality of the unseen world. Lewis' rich imagination shines brightly in this thought-provoking story that will raise as many questions as it answers. It is longer than \\"Silent Planet,\\" and the story does in fact seem stretched thin at parts. However, this minor point is the only criticism that I have. This is a remarkable work that deserves its acclaim. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Perelandra continues the travels of Ransom. Unlike his accidental journey to Mars in Out of the Silent Planet, this time he is sent by angels to prevent the Adversary from sullying an incorrupt planet, a world newly endowed with life--Venus, or as the inhabitants call it, Perelandra. C.S. Lewis writes with his well-known descriptive power, portraying a warm, tropical world of great oceans and floating islands. Here, Ransom must keep those on Perelandra from falling for the temptations of pride, rebellion, self-pity, vanity, selfish ambition, and discontent.In this marvelous work, C.S. Lewis thrills with one of his greatest books. You will be drawn into Perelandra, and yet will not be bored with endless scenery descriptions or the like. The beauty of his writing is that he unveils a world in a few words, words filled with depth and meaning, and which add to the morals of the story. There is not a letter unconnected to the plot. It is a matchless work of science fiction/fantasy literature.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"This is a journey to Venus science fiction fantasy; the second in a space trilogy. Ransom (Godly) is a scientist sent to Venus (presumably by an angel) for reasons he did not know. He meets an innocent human-like woman upon arriving. She is searching for her King, who until Ransom, were the only people on Venus except for the myriad of unusual interactive animals. Ransom follows her as she makes her way across the floating islands of a water laden planet. As one progresses you will recognize the parallels to the Garden of Eden/Adam and Eve on earth. The forbidden fruit is the fixed, immovable land. Perelandra is a wonderful story, better than the first book, \\"Out of the silent planet\\".The story is told in first person by Ransom's earth friend. Ransom comes to the realization of his purpose for being sent to Venus: shortly after his arrival, his earth prot&eacute;g&eacute; Weston (an atheist), lands in a ship, only to by seduced by Satan. Weston then begins his vigil to confuse and corrupt the woman----she grows \\"old\\". Eventually a long mental and physical battle ensues between Weston and Ransom. Ransom was sent to stop the corruption, but he was losing the battle; he new he had to kill him. Venus would keep its innocence.In this novel Lewis asks himself questions, then tries to answer them: on origins, life, and spirituality.

While perhaps the most esoteric, the quality of prose is there, and the story is as gripping as anything else Lewis ever wrote."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"At one point while reading I was overwhelmed and had to stop to catch my breath and my thoughts. If you have gotten to a point where reading the Bible seems like some stale old story, and wished that you could be overpowered and enraptured in its story once again, you want to read Perelandra."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"It goes without saying that C.S. Lewis is an amazing fictional author. The Narnia series were great, but I find that the Space Trilogy is more thought provoking and geared more towards my sort of audience (adult that is). I greatly enjoyed seeing another planet, starting fresh within a new-born and innocent context, being vexed - by yet another serpent. Not that the temptation towards sin was interesting in it of itself, but that I got to see an intense battle take place on Perelandra between Ransom (the good guy) and the demon possessed Weston over the soul of Green Lady; thus the future outcome of the well being of that planet. The intensity sprung from this insatiable longing for the life of that planet to steer away from the same mistakes that humanity made from the very beginning on our planet. There is certainly a valuable lesson to take from this book. Perhaps many lessons. Hopefully, through reading the trilogy, one will start to see the world in its disparity because it deprives itself from God."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is definitely the best of the trilogy. It is a thought-provoking novel that gives a clear vision of human nature, how our sinful nature came to be, and how it can be defeated. In Perelandra Lewis uses a less confrontational genre (the fictional novel) to deal with deep philosophical questions like &quot;If sin is bad for people, then why does God put that forbidden fruit-tree in the garden of Eden and allow sin into the world?&quot; And the explanation he offers in this novel is deeply satisfying. Overall, this book is a great read. Lewis is definitely the master of writing fiction that is both beautiful in literary style and philosophically interesting."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Take out the Christian allegories and you still have a superb novel. . .include them and you have a spiritual masterpiece of almost biblical proportions. Perelandra cuts to the quick; atheists, evolutionists and anti-Christians won't be able to endure it.If you want to understand the Garden of Eden from our own Bible, read Perelandra. Lewis understood it. This book is light years ahead of &quot;Out Of The Silent Planet&quot;, though Silent Planet created an adequate preface to the trilogy."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"The view that this is not Science Fiction must come from a lack of the context of what has historically been considered Science Fiction. This book would fit very nicely with the older sci-fi set, which was much closer to fantasy than it was to modern sci-fi. Personally, I set the book into the genre of Christian Existentialist fiction. Here you have Lewis at the peak of his allegorical prowess weaving a wonderfully striking tale about the temptation of the Queen of Perelandra that teaches our own hearts about the sheer disgustingness of evil and the great hope we have if we let go of our need for control and let God be God."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"In this, the second book of CS Lewis's Space Trilogy, we find Dr. Ransom off on another interplanetary adventure, this time to Venus. Instead of finding himself on an \`old' planet, like he did on Malacandra, he finds that life on Perelandra (Venus) is relatively new; in fact, the woman he meets there is still in an \`unfallen' state. In other words, she is in a state of innocence much like Eve was in the Garden of Eden.Ransom knows he has been sent to Perelandra for a purpose, but he does not know what that purpose is. He soon finds out. Weston, his old rival and former captor, shows up on the planet. Ransom soon discovers that Weston is possessed by an evil force, and calls him the 'Unman.' He then spends all his time trying to protect the woman and keep her from \`falling,' so that the fate of the new planet will not be like Earth's.This book continues in the allegorical style set forth in the first part of the series Out of the Silent Planet, though Perelandra takes it one step further. This book is more of a religious work than the first one, though, and the moral implications set forth in Planet are both enlarged and expanded. More than just a story of the fall, this book details the true ramifications of the battle of good and evil. It dares explore such questions as why God allows temptation in the world and why we should make our will subordinate to his.To fans of Milton, the story will seem somewhat familiar, and undoubtedly Lewis used much of Paradise Lost as a basis for this work. The fact that he published a preface to Milton's work the same year this book was written seems hardly coincidental. Still, this book teems with freshness and a unique insight that only CS Lewis can provide. This is a classic work by the master of Christian apology."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, and proceeded on to the sequel.

The cover art is not appropriate, since it shows snakelike, unpleasant-looking creatures whereas Perelandra had only beautiful creatures, being an unfallen Paradise of a world."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Too many who review this book, and indeed this is unfortunately the case with many books, tend to place themselves in judgment of the message of the book rather than the skill and captivating nature of the writer.Make no mistake, Lewis has a message here. He uses fiction, (science fiction even if you make allowances for the writing of this before the dawn of the genre as we now see it) as a vehicle for a most deliberate and targeted presentation of the Eden narratives of the Bible and the philosophical questions that underpin them.Lewis makes it work wonderfully. Lewis' contemporary and close friend J.R.R. Tolkien often criticized Lewis about this penchant for allegory, a form Tolkien pruported to despise in all its forms when he identified it. But Lewis utilizes a marvelous command of the English language and a mature, polished writing style that should leave the reader enjoying the story if s/he will just allow themselves to be carried with it. Agreement with the allegorical underpinnings is not required to enjoy and appreciate the read.This book begs to be read twice. Once for the literary experience and then again to delve into the allegorical meanings if you wish. There are few works that stand the test of enjoying it whether you agree with that or not.This book does!"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"C. S. Lewis is one of those few writers whose works will be read, studied, and enjoyed 100, 200, 500 years after his death. He is both a fantastic story-teller and a brilliant philosopher--thus, his works deal with both the mundane and the sublime, often at the same time.Perelandra is a good example of Lewis's ability to tell a good story while getting a higher point across. The second installment in his celebrated Space Trilogy (make sure you read &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; first) finds his hero, Ransom, swept away from Earth again on a mysterious mission to the planet Perelandra. Without giving too much of the story away, Ransom finds himself given the seemingly impossible task of preventing evil from Earth from polluting the pristine, unearthly paradise of Perelandra. To carry out this mission, Ransom finds himself grappling, both intellectually and physically, with a force of pure evil.Let the reader beware: Perelandra is written in a more archaic style than we are used to today, and thus may be a difficult read for someone with a short-attention span. For a reader with an expansive imagination and a patient love for detailed descriptive writing, the book is a treasure and will be highly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"I have read this book twice quite a few years ago and I plan to read it at least one more time.

This book has such a different tone than the first in the series. I felt the theological overtones of Out of the Silent Planet were fairly subtle. Ransom was meeting members of the races on Mars, learning their language, exploring their culture. The language barrier was huge, and for much of the book I felt I was stumbling along with Ransom, learning words which had unfamiliar sounds and expressing major concepts in metaphors. In Perelandra, which takes place on Venus, the struggle to communicate has eased up immensely. Actually, Ransom has to simplify much of what he says because the \\"Eve\\" figure is so innocent, never having encountered sin or evil. This is basically a retelling and expansion of the Garden of Eden. Perelandra is paradise, described in stunning (and lengthy!) detail. Bubble trees, singing winds, silver flowers, mermaids, an ocean \\"dotted with islands in every direction, rising and falling with the swell.\\" It is Ransom's mission to try to stop the Fall from occurring on this planet, complete with a debate and then a battle between good and evil. As Ransom begins to recognize evil, there were moments I found truly chilling.Christianity is completely unveiled in Perelandra; there are numerous references, and the characters' debates and discussions often get heavy. There was so much to think about! I could reread this book endless times and find new threads of thought and insight.Out of the Silent Planet was good, but I didn't have that \\"ready to devour the rest of the series\\" feeling after finishing it.

This sci-fi adventure is a theological meditation on sin and temptation. In many ways it's a re-telling of the first three chapters of Genesis, with a twist. What would it be like if the world were unspoiled, if sin had never entered in, if the first parents had resisted the serpent's temptations? In Perelandra Ransom is sent to young world to help the first woman battle against the temptations of the Evil One.I highly recommend this book. Easily the best in the trilogy, and I rank Perelandra among Lewis' best books (along with Mere Christianity, 'Till We Have Faces, The Screwtape Letters, and The Magician's Nephew).Read it if you have a pulse. (And especially if you want to think more about the first few chapters of Genesis)"},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"In C.S. Lewis' &quot;Perelandra,&quot; a sequel to his &quot;Out of the Silent Planet,&quot; Lewis again chronicles the adventures of philologist Dr. Elwin Ransom in an alien atmosphere. Ransom is this time transported to Venus, known to its denizens as Perelandra, to stop an all-powerful demonic apparition from world-domination with his knowledge of ethics, as opposed to physical superiority. Lewis uses much Christian symbolism in this sci-fi novel, as Perelandra's ruler is an effigy of Christ and the central antagonist an effigy of the snake in the garden of Eden. Lewis was not unfamiliar with Christian symbolism, as it abounds in all of his works, including &quot;The Magician's Nephew,&quot; wherein the major protagonists represented Adam and Eve and the major antagonist again represented the snake in the garden of Eden. In that novel, an effigy of God himself was also supplied, as the lion Aslan created a mythic world in less then 10 minutes. Lewis focuses too much on Christian symbolism in this novel, however, as he downplays the sci-fi/adventure elements in favor of the aforementioned Christian symbolism. It degrades the novel as a whole, I think, but that is one small flaw and is easily made up for when the protagonist's journey ensues. This is a wonderful, if somewhat flawed, novel, and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"In this book, Lewis stimulates the senses with his descriptions of bubble trees, floating islands, colorful skies, beautiful sounds and strange creatures. (It was a compliment to Lewis when one reader complained of being seasick after reading about the floating islands.) From the standpoint of imaginative scene painting, Lewis is at his best in PERELANDRA. His plot involves a wonderful twist on an old story: the Genesis fall of mankind. It is no coincidence that Lewis was lecturing on Milton at the same time that he was composing PERELANDRA. In fact, reading Lewis's PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, John Milton's PARADISE LOST, and Lewis's PERELANDRA in this order forms a nice trilogy, one I recommend trying. The chief shortcoming of PERELANDRA is exactly what the reader from Eureka, CA says: the story drags in the middle. The action and forward movement of the plot are too slow for my taste. Lewis's tendancy towards repetitive writing also slows things at times, especially near the very end when he goes through several pages of &quot;praise be he&quot; statements. Despite these pecadillos, the book is definitely worth reading for the beauty, the intriguing plot, and for background to THAT HIDEOUS STRENGTH."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"When I was reading the first book in this series, \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" (1938), several people commented to me that the sequel, \\"Perelandra\\" (1943), was much better. As a result, my expectations were fairly high going into this book. My expectations were not met, as I found this to be a very disappointing book. While the first book was very imaginative and free flowing, this one was much less imaginative and felt very forced and contrived. Lewis' conception of the planet was the one area where he allowed his imagination to really shine. For his Venusians though, he reverted back to what are essentially humans, as he retells the story of Adam and Eve.The story is narrated by a friend of Dr. Ransom, who was summoned to see Ransom at his cottage and learns that Ransom is to be sent to Perelandra (Venus) to counter the diabolical forces of the bent Oyarsa who is trying to subvert the people of that world. Since the book's narration is written from the future, we already know that Dr. Ransom has successfully made the trip to Perelandra and back. This differs from the first book, in which we didn't know what would happen to him, which added to the suspense.Dr. Ransom is sent to Perelandra in what appears to be a coffin, powered by supernatural forces. Once there, he encounters the Lady, who is the Eve for her planet. Shortly after that, he discovers that Weston has also traveled to Perelandra, and that he is in fact the agent of the bent Oyarsa who is attempting to cause the fall of humanity on that planet as occurred on Earth. While Weston thinks he is spreading his new faith, he clearly is being controlled by a diabolical force and ultimately only his body remains as the domination becomes more complete.There are some interesting moral discussions, as Weston (or the Un-man as he is then referred to) and Ransom try to win over the Lady with their words. Ultimately though, Ransom is called upon to use physical violence to destroy the demon/Weston, and I question what Lewis was trying to say with this turn of events. Is he indicating that violence is a justifiable method of spreading your message? Lewis took the higher moral ground when one compares \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" with what he perceived to be Stapledon's message in \\"The Last and First Men\\", but here he seems to be taking the low road. He appears to be taking the position that it is okay to turn to violence to push one's beliefs when one's words prove to be insufficient.This book is not completely without merit, but it is not nearly as good, in my opinion, as \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\". It is a bit longer than the first book, but at 190 pages it is still fairly short for a novel. While it is not necessary to read \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" before reading this book, it certainly does fill in the back story and enhances the experience. \\"Perelandra\\" was originally published in 1943, and has also been published under the alternate title of \\"Voyage to Venus\\"."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Lewis was a master at keeping the reader engaged and keeping the plot flowing. This work is tense and relevant, easily my favorite of from the trilogy, although Out of the Silent Planet is a close second."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"What if other planets within our galaxy contained intelligent life? And not only that, but what if those planets were part of a war against largely unseen beings, some of which had infiltrated Earth without our knowing it? This is part of the premise of Lewis's space trilogy, and this second book of his space trilogy continues to follow that theme.The story follows Dr. Ransom as he is sent to the planet Venus (known as Perelandra to the other space-faring beings) to be it's protector. He arrives on the planet, knowing nothing about it, including the details of what he should be doing. And as he is disoriented by his initial arrival, we travel with him both geographically and philosophically as he determines the purpose of his trip.A warning to potential readers: compared to Lewis's first book in the series \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", this book feels far more philosophical. While a large part of the first book involved Ransom running for his life, the latter half of this book largely involves a battle of minds and wills. If you're not used to following those types of conversations (or they just don't interest you), it's possible you won't enjoy this book as much. I'll confess to getting lost a few times myself, but I'll admit that I've never felt as much in suspense by the mere idea of someone making a correct decisions as I have with this book.Also to Lewis's credit, his descriptions of the planet are incredibly detailed while also being fairly dreamlike. At times, I felt disappointed by today's discoveries of science because after reading the first two books, I like his idea of what Venus and Mars could be like than the reality of what they are. This is a testament to the fantastical ideas and descriptions he puts forth of what other planets could be like.One complaint that could be leveled against the book is that a plot that largely starts in a philosophical manner ends in a way that is largely physical. This kind of thing has led to a lot of terrible science fiction books and movies that started with promise and ended with brute force. In this case, I believe it works because the thought process to the end is laid out well, but it might catch you off guard if you expect the battle of the mind to end there."},{"Title":"Perelandra, a novel","review":"Although placed as book two of Lewis' space trilogy and therefore a novel of space travel it really is not a novel at all, nor is it really a book about traveling to Venus. Lewis is a very cleaver writer and also a very solid Christian. He uses this form of writing to promote Christianity or rather to prove Christianity. At a time when great thinkers said Adam and Eve was myth and could not be taken literally from the Bible Lewis set out to show how it could be shown all the Bible said was true about Adam and Eve. So this book is actually an apologetic about Adam and Eve and Original sin. He simply dressed it in something novel people would find made the religious aspect of his writing easier to swallow. So although his writing can be tedious and seems away from the actually story, it really is the opposite, the story of the the planet and the Paradise he has found himself in and the pure woman he deals with are actually irrelevant to his real intent. His battle with the \\"Unman\\" and his position as savoir is the really basis of the story.So here C.S. Lewis has used his genius and Christianity not to tell a tale of space travel but to give his readers a chance to look at another Adam and Eve and what might have really happen in the Garden of Eden.Yet this Eve knew of Christ's coming into our world in fact she knew a secret of his coming we don't understand; as we understand a part she doesn't. So Lewis is portraying other worlds in space that have not fallen to the Devil - yet. And it is here that one must read carefully to really understand Lewis' Christianity.Still one can read this book simply for the excitement of Ransom's exploration of a strange new land and a very pure woman who doesn't understand evil. He explores and learns and struggles knowing he is there for a reason and trying to figure that out.So whether a theological treatise on Original Sin or exploration into space and a new planet, it is a very good story."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats","review":"Helen Vendler has created a scholarly, insightful look at the odes of John Keats. The odes comprise about a dozen pages; Vendler's analysis is nearly 300 pages. She analyzes in thoughtful detail six classic odes of Keats, not in isolation, but by emphasizing their complex interrelationships. She argues that each poem reflects the odes preceding it and shaped the subsequent odes. As she states, \\"For the poet, the completion of one poem is the stimulus for the next; this is particularly true for poems of the same genre.\\"Not surprisingly, Vendler assumes that the reader is reasonably familiar with Keats' better known poetry (Hyperion, Endymion, and, of course, the Odes). As Spenser, Milton, and Wordsworth significantly influenced Keats, some familiarity with these poets is helpful. I found that Vendler requires attention and thought, but in return she provides insightful commentary that leads to a deeper appreciation of Keats' poetic genius.On occasion Vendler's style becomes unnecessarily convoluted. But these instances are rare lapses; her writing is characterized by a clarity that is often absent in modern criticism.She scrupulously credits ideas originating with others, explicitly identifies points of disagreement and differences in interpretation and in the process introduces the reader to a wide range of Keatsian studies. I gained a greater appreciation for modern literary criticism. I even enjoyed reading Vendler's detailed footnotes."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats","review":"After five years since I first studied this work on Keats' Odes (and after continual feasting on her &quot;Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets&quot;), I have returned to Vendler's volume to renewed appreciation of her respectful insight into Keats' creations and processes. The same respectfulness and confident humility that graces her Shakespeare criticism flourishes here - and warrants at least a brief expression of consensus with earlier laudatory reviews.Most significantly for the lover of Keats, Vendler integrates the life and creativity of the seven or so months during which he produced odes that &quot;belong to that group of works in whch the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.&quot; She makes explicit the implicit signs of connection among and growth through the Odes (and a key portion of Fall of Hyperion). Connections with Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton are interwoven skillfully -- as integral parts of Keats' context as were the works of nature and art that are explicitly addressed in the poems.Vendler's work extends much deeper than I can fully follow, and some of it will leave all but English majors in the dust. Let's not let that discourage the rest of us amateur Keats enjoyers - the Introduction alone plus the initial discussion of each of the Odes contain indispensable caresses for the heart of mere mortals."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats","review":"Helen Vendler&quot; The Odes of John Keats' gives the reader an opportunity to see how the six great odes written in 1819 came to be. She shows how the poems are linked together through words, images, and ideas, starting with the 'Ode to Psyche&quot; and ending with the great ode&quot;To Autumn.&quot; Through a close reading of each poem, an examination of each image, and a view of the rhetorical trope, from reduplication to enumeration, which underlies each poem, Vendler provides the reader with a deep understanding of Keats's artistic concerns and meanings.. She demonstrates why Keats' achievement is so extraordinary and provides the critical reader with a method by which s/he may enter into the mind of the poet. For any lover of Keats' poetry, and for any lover of belles lettres, this is a book which belongs in your library."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats","review":"OK, I'll be the odd voice out. This book is worth reading. The evocation of the thoughts and ideas swirling around Keats during the time in which he wrote the Odes is thorough and fascinating. If you want get a sense for the poetry and aesthetic currents that *might* have informed Keats, then this is a beautiful book to read.My problem with Vendler is that, all too often (though by no means always), she writes as though what *she* thinks must be what *Keats* thought. She makes claims for Keats' creative thought as though her opinions were given. This is the basis for three stars. In truth, Vendler really has little to no idea what Keats was thinking when he wrote the Odes (nothing beyond what he reveals in his letters). I don't argue with her effort to trace what *might* have been at the root of his thought, but even if her opinion is informed, it remains conjecture. When you immerse yourself in this book, just remember that you are not immersing yourself in the mind or world of Keats, but the mind and world of Vendler. She can't and doesn't speak for John Keats. She speaks for the erudite and exhaustive reader who is Helen Vendler."},{"Title":"The Passage of the Light: The Recursive Science Fiction of Barry N. Malzberg","review":"I bought this recently because it includes the short novel, \\"Herovitt's World\\"(1973), which is a neglected classic-basically, it's a devastatingly funny portrait of a hack SF writer, who's on the verge of a psychological collapse. I read that book about a decade ago, and I'm glad to say that it holds up upon re-reading.The other stories in \\"Passage of the Light\\" are also quite good albeit not as great. (Basically, this is an anthology of Malzberg's stories which are about SF and or SF writing.) If you only know Malzberg from such depressing and bewildering novels like \\"Beyond Apollo\\", then give this a try, since all of the stories are highly entertaining and funny and sometimes even brillant. The only downside of this collection is that it doesn't include \\"Galaxies\\", which is probably Malzberg's best novel after H.W.

Out of the blue, an elderly Negro Joseph \\"adopts\\" Thomas raising him to adulthood in the Rocky Mountains. Thomas leaves and falls in love, but Ned still lingers waiting for revenge.Edward Lassiter left the CIA to become a wealthy highly regarded business consultant. When his former boss asks for Edward to help on a mission, he readily agrees. Edward is to deliver a cache of weapons to Nicaraguan freedom fighters. However, everything goes wrong and he is forced to hide. Only his former assistant Jenny Albrighton and an elderly Negro who looks so familiar to Edward named Joseph tries to help Edward survive what is a conspiracy of the highest magnitude.This is a well-done and very creative paranormal action novel centering on two distinct yet connected tales occurring over a century plus apart. The tales interweave as debut author Jasper Newton for the most part smoothly moves the audience on an enjoyable ride back and forth between centuries. The key characters are fully developed so that what happens to them seems genuine, even coming out of retirement to work in the \\"Cold\\" for the CIA.

The plots are interwoven in a manner that allows the reader to have the &quot;aha&quot; about the connections between two time periods and one supportive black man. The main characters are engaging and much can be said about the symbolism each brings to the story.

I thought this would be fine, as I am very familiar with Adobe products, i.e. Photoshop, Framemaker etc, and while not very familiar with Illustrator, have at least used it to open, close and make minor changes to graphics. I thought this would help me trawl through the basics in a couple of hours, instead of giving me a major headache. The problems kicked in about page 45. Everything was quite clear up to that, there is a clearly explained system of exclamation marks, bullet points etc to help you on your way. I found that the explanations using pen tools and paths very difficult to understand and although following the step-by-step procedures, they did not make sense. I figured I was just being an idiot, but I asked 2 other long-term Illustrator users to try and follow these instructions, to their bafflement. Now, I am only half way through the book, and it may improve, I will give it another 10 pages before giving up! But I would not recommend this for beginners."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Illustrator 8.0","review":"it's my first illustrator book i ever bought.

I almost couldn't believe how logical and straight forward this basic idea was, and how few of its practices our national school system follows. Dr. William Glasser wrote a classic that will never be read or truly understood by most educators in our dumbed down, American education system. When I read the book, I cheered loudly, then realized that it was almost a lost cause. My wife attended several gradeless colleges that used this method of education, but when she tried to get a job, every major employer would not accept the type of student reports those schools had issued to her. Each job she applied for required only \\"grades\\" with numbers or letters from the familiar 4.o system. She was required to get her reports analyzed by a \\"legitimate\\" school system and translated into grades or numbers and only one university in the entire state offered to do so. My wife is a brilliant woman whose education shows through very clearly. Her non-traditional colleges were obviously educating students rather than attempting to place everything into a convenient category or number system. None of those wonderful gradeless colleges are operating anymore. I strongly wish that this book would become required reading for all educators in this country."},{"Title":"Schools Without Failure","review":"This book should be read by every School Board Member, Superintendent, Administrator and teacher.

At first, when you eye the glittery pink cover with Paris decked out in a BCBG dress, I know you're thinking, \\"What kind of garbage could possibly lie within these glossy, photograph-laden pages?\\" Well, as it turns out, more than you might think. Okay, so Paris hasn't written a complex adult novel, but her book is entertaining, interesting, and provides a good peek into her life.I wouldn't exactly call this an autobiography- there are some autobiographical things in there, but it's mostly just showing you Paris behind the scenes as she shows you what it's like to be rich, young, and beautiful. She gives you her fashion do's and don'ts, advice on how to be just like her (not all of it is to be taken seriously, though!), stories from her childhood, the making of The Simple Life, and much more. And, if you are looking for good-quality pictures, you have come to the right book, because it features 300 photos of Paris, old and new.So, overall, go ahead and read this book if you don't hate Paris Hilton and want something entertaining to read. If you want something more substance-filled, maybe it would be better to read something else."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton is exactly what I thought she was, a spoiled little daddy's girl who thinks everyone should be like her, and it shows through in this book. The whole book is pretty much made up of pictures of her, some with her family and friends. There is probably only about 500 words in this book and the writing sounds like her, but she didn't write the whole thing herself (shocker!!)

But all I really learned about her from this book is that she's totally shallow, disrespectful, rude, and lives in a fantasy world with no clue about reality.A lot of her comments totally took me by surprise, and half the time I couldn't believe she was serious.I also thought the photo's might also include her house, rooms in the house, cars, closets, etc to show us how she lives.

While Hilton does seem to wrestle with the core Husserlian concept of the directedness of thought intentionality, ontologically, she never seems go beyond the insights implied by mere Heideggerian Destruktion. At least we know who Derrida's daddy is, though.After struggling with this brick of a text, I would suggest relaxing with some light reading: Nicole-Smith'sCritique of Pure Reason (Philosophical Classics)or possibly Richie'sTractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Routledge Classics)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I recieved this book as a gag gift from a friend of mine who knows how I feel about Paris Hilton (I shutter to think that a contribution to the sales of this book has been made in my honor!).

She has no concept of reality and is so deluded by her fame and fortune I believe that she truely sees herself as the center of the universe. Why oh why do people continue to praise her? She has proven herself time and again to be a most unworhty icon. The book annoyed me more than anything and I wish I hadn't read it. Though it did feed that little monster in me that secretly loves to hate Paris Hilton, by providing a plethora of material on which to gorge.

Actually I'm supposed to \\"love to hate\\" this worthless waste of life. She's supposed to be the girl who has it all, and we're supposed to jealously covet her glamorous lifestyle accoutrements, or something.But actually I just hate her, period. It's a very simple, unalloyed form of hatred. Because this one is just so utterly obnoxious, so eminently unlikable, so supremely ungifted in every respect other than the monetary, that she ought to rouse a sense of outrage at the injustice of life in anybody with the slightest notion of equity.First off, let's face the facts here: Paris Hilton is \\"famous\\" for one reason, and one only: she happened to \\"accidentally\\" star in an amateur stag film with her sleazy ex-boyfriend. The fact that she's the Hilton heiress made her porno performance interesting, and the fact of her performance made the Hilton heiress thing interesting - but otherwise, would anybody on earth give a damn about some spoiled hotel scion? Would even the most abject pervert bother to download this bony tramp's grainy sex romp if her dad was a cart-push at WalMart (you know, the wall store)? But the combination of marginal celebrity with \\"sex scandal\\" is enough to get people re-interested in the likes of PeeWee Herman, so yeah, why not Paris Hilton. I just want to make it clear that this is the SOLE basis of her noteworthiness at this moment in tabloid history.Sure, there was \\"The Simple Life,\\" her \\"reality\\" show (the word reality has absolutely no meaning left whatsoever) with Nicole Richie, in which they slum it up with a bunch of farmhands in Alabama (or wherever) to illustrate the hilarious differences between their lives of privilege and those of the hicks in the sticks. But again I ask you - would the ratings have been as high as they lamentably were if the media hadn't been all over her little porn stunt in the weeks prior? I'm definitely not going to argue that the American people generally are possessed of anything remotely resembling taste, but still. I really don't think the timing of the \\"scandal\\" was a coincidence, either. Gee, what do you know, nobody even knew or cared who the hell she was, then suddenly just before her show comes out, she achieves world fame as a camcorded meat puppet. How convenient.So she refers to it in her book as \\"something I wasn't too proud of,\\" in between telling you all about her favorite hair products. But the real meat of the book is her advice to all the young girls who want to be just like her (and by the way, I can hear parents going \\"please, oh please, I'll buy you tickets to Marilyn Manson if you just burn that \`Simple Life' DVD\\"). How can you, too, O impressionable 10 year old, be a \\"jet-setting, tiara-wearing socialite\\"? Well, I'll distill it down for you. First of all, be born into old money. Second, accidentally star in an amateur stag flick.

And don't release your \\"cd\\" of which you know no one is going to think u can sing.Just go back home and live with mommy and daddy. Just dothe world a favor. Now that would be hot. If you just left, vanished. Anyway, I think you have more flaws just besides your size 11 feet. Perhaps a start would be to examine your personality. U might just discover some new findings. But in sum, we all know this book is not worth buying. It is a waste of time.And thanks for the pointers, but I don't exactly want to be the next \\"Paris the Heiress.\\"\\"Ladies and gentlemen, Paris has left the building.\\"Audience: Cheers and shouts-\\"Don't come back now, you hear!\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"First of all, there is no way I would pay one red cent for this trash.

Hey you women out there who dont get mens side, and you men who think she's a dimwit. Adults make videotapes all the time, since when are adults called sluts just because some snoopy fool stole a tape? Just because she's rich doesnt mean people can label her anything they choose. She is beautiful, works hard now, and intelligent because she uses her mind in the right way. She doesnt hurt people so leave her be. If you dont like something, close your eyes, or your kids eyes and change the channel. Media has to be responsible, but 99% is a parents responsibility to take care of their own children and stop blaming outer forces. Except in other cases.. but thats another story.

Since it's pronounced like 'airess' and not 'hairess', the indefinite article would have to be 'an.' Also, keep in mind of rule that an indefinite article is 'a' if the next word in a given sentence starts with a consonant--and, in this case, the consonant was silent."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I totally agree with Jenise...

The book was probably intended to be bought and loved by teen readers as myself, not to be checked out by angry middle-aged people who hate even the thought of Paris and her dog, Tinkerbell. If you scoff at the idea of even THINKING of her, DO US ALL A FAVOR AND SHUT UR MOUTHS AND QUIT READING THE BOOK!!!! IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH THAN WHY DON'T YOU JUST TEAR YOUR EYES OUT SO YOU CAN'T TAKE ONE MORE LOOK AT THE BOOK! IT BORES ME AT HOW SOOOO MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN AND COMPLAIN ABOUT HER BOOK.

So ya, me and Paris are a lot alike...ive also met her a few times and went shopping with her, and she is nothing like people think, she is actually pretty smart, not dumb, and shes so sweet too! So newayz, I really love this book and pretty much live by it, cuz it really is my life as an heiress!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"... However, I still was disappointed by this book.The reader will not learn anything new about the woman who hides behind the media image. Well, apart from the fact that MAC's Prrr lipglass is her favourite lipgloss.I bought this expecting an actual autobiography (she's still under 30, but there is a lot to talk about), but didn't find it. In all honesty, this book was published to publicise her reality show, music album, perfumes and movie \`The House Of Wax' (she actually gives fans a major spoiler by what she says).There are lots of nice pictures and the actual writing that is here is light and fun, so the more attentive fans will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I originally read this book to get some fashion ideas. As it has a lot of colourful pictures. the clothes she wears in it only suit her, and we all can't wear designer clothes. i was looking for more casual look. I couldn't find many other books with many pictures as this one. I will review this book for the writings and pictures.It was quite interesting how she explain how she gets men to do things for her. Like if she is at a hotel with a lot of luggage and she cant carry them all, she \\"try's to look helpless\\" she says it never fails. She said other things that can seem manipulative to others, but I would see it as childish. For this reason I can see why this wouldn't be interesting to some people.Pro's A lot of good colourful pictures like i said.Con's If you look for insight of depth to her character, u won't find it here."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is a how-to on how to be an heiress. While some may argue that Paris Hilton only put her name on this work and didn't author it, I can assure you that she has penned it herself, like totally. It is overwhelmingly obvious that an experienced, educated writer did not type this up. She describes how one should behave and present herself when aspiring to become an heiress, even going so far as proclaiming that she believes everyone chooses their life on earth before they are born. She was smart enough to pick a life full of wealth, fame and privileges, why anything less? While I believe everyone does choose their life before birth... it is certainly not based upon anything materialistic or egocentric. Lessons to learn are the focal point, well, the only point. After all, what of those in poverty or places of violence, etc.?Furthermore, I DO NOT understand how someone with hundreds of millions of dollars has absolutely NO intention of earning a college degree. This book reads like a how-to straight out of junior high. There are no misspellings or problems with grammar, capitalization or punctuation, of course, but search inside this book and see that the content is very immature for her age. Did she even graduate from high school? All of her career aspirations revolve around fame and admiration: acting, modeling, singing, writing a book on how to be like her, etc. Look at me, me, me, me!! That's HOT! Well, it's not so hot; what about a priceless college education and a degree no one can ever take away from you? If one looks at real royalty all over the globe, attaining an education is an absolute MUST. If I had as much money as she did I would attend classes until I died or ran out of things to study, whichever came first. College? AS IF!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton is probably a nice person who is loved by her family and friends, who hasn't hurt anyone. But, as she mentioned in her book, she hasn't worked one day in her life. What can I possibly learn from a person like that? Paris says that in order to be an heiress, you need to be born into the right family. Not to be blunt, but DUH!!! The book is somewhat entertaining because you can't keep but not taking Paris seriously at all. So she wants to be a model - run to your rich daddy. A singer? A rich daddy. An actress? Thanks to the rich daddy. She has millions, yet she dedicates her life to partying and pampering herself instead of putting a part of that money into something useful like curing cancer or feeding hungry children. But there is so much you can expect from a blonde, lazy airhead like her."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Ok,we all know who Paris Hilton is for obvious no surprise reasons. She's been in the tabloids enough and her \\"video\\" seems to depict her greatly. And even though I have many pictures of her in a binder along with her sister and other stars, I'm still contemplating exactly what kind of \\"star\\" she really is. Though, she is pretty, reading her book made me nauseous. Interested in how a socialite like her lived was what I planned to read, and instead only read to find out how much of a snob she really is. Paris hasn't had to do one thing in her lifetime, only having every little thing she ever desired handed to her on a silver platter. I basically found out things I was all ready quite aware of by just looking at her: she's over privileged, a wild partier, and spoiled brat. In her book, she blabs on about nonsense that in reality is just plain ridiculous. She only prefers flying 1st class and private. That you should never vacation to somewhere with bad cell phone reception, never go out when it's raining unless you have a \\"Gucci\\" umbrella, always lose your cell phones every chance u get, be born into the right family and if you're going to be an heiress, have a great name. Sound interesting, well if it does read the book, but if you're smart, you won't. Self-conceited Paris just doesn't want to stop. Saying in her book, it's great getting paid to have people fuss over you, and I also found out she sued to get $15 million dollars out of her \\"unfortunate\\" video accident. Like she doesn't all ready have enough money. So, if you're a complete fool and want to be something you're not, pick up this book and learn how to be a illiterate good-for-nothing-heiress. That's hot... I think not!!!!! I'm a big fan of Nicky Hilton. I think she's so much better than Paris. At least Nicky has done something with her life, creating handbags and working since the age of 17."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I haven't really wrote an insulting review for a few days, and I'm trying to grow up a little bit and be more mature, but when I saw this....gosh I just exploded in laughter!!! THis book is worth 0 stars!!!The facts are Paris Hilton is plainly famous for really no reason at all!!! Yeah, her mommy and her daddy own a chain of hotels!!! Yet, she is plainly untalented, that only relys on her looks for anything!!! The only thing she is good for is stupid amatuer porn movies!!!She, also gets her own tv show and writes a book for no reason at all!!! So, ummmmm..... What the F*ck???!!! Why in the hell would I waste my time reading about a nobody, who is nothing but a dumb @$$!!! I know little 5 year olds that have more talent in one finger that Paris has in her entire body!!! People actually make money from taking pictures of this slut!!!Why, people like her I don't know,..... well maybe for her looks, I never said she wasn't hot; but being hot doesn't save you..... from being a dumb blonde if you are one!!! Now, MTV has got all of the weak minded fools following her now, along with airing stupid tv shows that have nothing to do with music at all, and promotes hero worship of amatuer porn star!!!I agree with another reviewer, when they said this is good source for toilet paper, oh boy 192 pages of good quality toilet paper!!! Better yet,... I just say tourch the book and make smores, sing camp fire songs, and tell ghost stories!!!Wow, I really want to read about a spoiled rich slut, who some fools actually make richer by buying this piece of sh*t!!! People how about reading something that has meaning!!! This book, is another way to make what's her name, who I don't care about richer!!! I bet, you that Paris is laughing as she gets away with stealing your money!!!Plainly, I will say this book doesn't deserve a star, and I quote \\"This is plainly a waste of trees!!!\\" \\"F*ck you Paris Hilton!!!\\"With all my heart,anonymous \\"who cares\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"You gotta be kidding!?!

I was given this book to check it out (don't pay, go to the library and check it out). While it was amusing, with some funny antidotes that a writer helped Paris out with, it was ultimately a boring book that didn't give any depth into who she hopes to become (she hasn't become anyone interesting yet. The book left a lot to be desire and made one feel more and more that she really was a spoiled party girl who had nothing better to do than to poke fun at reality (for 99.99% of the people in the world) and show off the fact that she's rich. While I think it's great that Paris has so much on the table as far as projects, anyone could with the money, fame and backing she has. My advice, skip the book; you will get a better sense of her if you watch her on one of those entertainment shows."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I got this book thinking it would be way more interesting than it actullay was. I am not a huge Paris fan, but think she is interesting. But her book was NOT! It was like a reading a trash or gossip magazine about someone. I could not finish the book. I was that bored with it.

I don't know if there was a ghostwriter or what, or if Paris actually wrote every word after she came back from all those parties not drunk, but this \\"autobiography\\" (seriously, what is this thing really??) does not come across as intelligent. I'm usually perceptive to sarcasm, but I wouldn't have noticed that if I hadn't read the amazon reviews.An intelligent person, much like a book worth reading, will usually have a point. Whatever this thing Paris has published in her name, unfortunately, lacks that crucial aspect.Two starts for the glossy pages. I definitely appreciate a hundred pictures of Paris that come along. I can't remember the last time I read a book with pictures in it, but hey - that's hot."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Why would you people buy the book and then actually read it only to be so enraged that you bothered to write a review.

I've also learned from Paris and I appreciate how she is so candid about friendships and dating which is an immense help to high schoolers."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"As I stand I am usually someone who defends and protects celebrities against the ravaging \\"vicious\\" people out there who mis-understand them... And in this case I must stand by my own beliefs.While reading the book I came to realize this is actually more of an \\"Advertisement\\". She mentions 100+ products, stores, restaurants, and surely enough I am confident that there was some more of \\"payback\\" for our beloved paris...This book leads me to 2 conclusions: 1. Paris is not some stupid girl, she is a businesswoman in pink. and 2. Paris hilton acts her age.We must all remember she is only 23/24 (23 when the book was written) and that she is simply living her life. I dont know many girls who dont go out and party as much as she does, and actually know some who do it more so. Alot of harsh reviews come her way because of her \\"video\\" and people who judge her quickly, but through reading the book you get to see her as a person, a real one, which we should all take time to do for everyone.Pros: Book is great inspiration to be who you wanna be, to have standards, and is straight-forward about alot of things some people are just to arrogant to say.Pictures are really cute and its fun to see Paris in all her liveliness!Cons: Alot of \\"ads\\" throughout the book that I found somewhat commercial and at times, annoying.Written for young girls 12+.---Book is really mature, spoken by an american young woman. Is appropriate nearly for all ages, nothing inappropriate that I wouldnt let a kid read/see."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Like, Paris Hilton wrote a book! In this book, Paris basically explains how she lives her glamorous life, and how you should copy her in order to live it too. Eat either caviar or fast food, to prove how you can eat greasy junk all the time and still be skinny with perfect skin. Never drink alcohol, and especially not champagne, because it's too predictable. Never fly commercial airlines- if you can't buy a jet, make friends with those who do. But Paris' goal in life, basically, is to be attractive to men. All of the things she tells readers to do are a means to getting a boyfriend. The better boyfriend you get, the better you are, she explains. I don't like this perspective. If she's going to spin her life and say she doesn't really party or drink, she should also say she contributes to lots of philanthropic causes and values herself as a kind, unique person. But she doesn't go that far, and that bothers me. Lie if you want, but make it a good lie, an important one, so that teen readers will idolize a better version of you. Do the things you do so that you're cool, not so boys will think you're cool. The guy you snag isn't the only telling thing about you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I don't like the book anymore than I like Paris. THose who love the book say that it's fun how Paris tells them where to go, what to do, ect like an heiress. Well, do we NEED to have someone tell us what to do? Do we need to act like someone else to be fabulous? Her life is not our life, any \\"tips\\" is kind of worthless, do you think? And why do we need to act a certain way if we agree every one of us is unique and beautiful? Would acting stupid and shallow and superficial be acceptable if you live a carefree life? It's like saying if you are born in war, it's ok for you to kill. It's not her fault she was born into privileges. But to be born into privilege and take it for granted, many rich spoiled kids manage to be smart you know."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I read half the book in one sitting, and would of read it all had my eyes not wanted to die.I love Paris, and you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"this book sux...but i guess paris wanna-bes would kinda like it...cuase its realli ALL ABOUT HER...however...i would like to praise paris...good job paris! u actually know how to write something more than 100 pages! i'm so proud u can actually sit ur butt down and write down this sh*t!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Hmm.

This book is definately worth $15.00 if you are a true Paris Hilton fan.If you just know of her, then this isn't the book for you. I figured she would really go into her life and say things that we could learn from her.She puts useless and (I hate to say this BUT...) ridiculous things in her book.For instance, on her top 23 steps to being a Heiress she puts that you should be born into a rich and famous family. She says if you can control everything in your life, why not control which family your born into? That is really stupid...there is no way on earth that you can choose that. She talks about the simple life and everything. It is a real page turner and it's kinda addictive no matter how stupid and useless it is. It kinda reminded be of a little girl's diary, because she really just puts things that happened in a childish way.Her grammar and everything is really bad, because it's hard to get into a book whenever the things the person is saying is stupid.Hopefully, Nicole Richie's book will be better. Some people say that Nicole didn't really write hers, but I know for a fact that Paris wrote this.If she didn't, the person who DID write it must be just as ditzy as her. If I were you, I would stick to watching the Simple Life if you wanna know more about Paris Hilton. This book won't really do much for you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"this book made me laugh.. she's funny.. great pics- i love her clothing.. brags a bit too much, and still has yet to prove that she's actually intelligent"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book and Paris for that matter has taken on a life of its own. The whole book is suppose to be taken lightly. Some people are seeming to get very worked up about a book written by an heiress that was done for herself and done for fun. This is not suppose to be heavy, serious literature. I think Paris is fabulous. She is a beautiful, young, thin girl who has the world at her feet. You go girl!!!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book was not intended to be the most intellectual read out there guys! It was meant to be lighthearted and fun. But I do agree that you would at least have to like Paris Hilton before enjoying the book.It is not a confessions book as the title says, but more of a look into her life a little and her sense of humor lingering on every page. There are however MANY pictures so if you're a true Paris fan you'll enjoy those. I wasn't a fan before reading the book but I liked her. After reading the book I really like her alot more now and I love the fact that she loves animals. That shows she has heart.There are some neat tid-bits about her and overall I enjoyed this easy, fun read. Paris fans, this book is a must-have. However if you don't care for her then I don't think you'll care that much for her book. If you're looking for a read that's more serious and thought-provoking then I suggest you try something else! :-)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"come on people,seriously..those of you who are critical, what did you expect? i have to say that paris is a person as we all are--the only difference is that she has had a very wealthy life. she hasnt had to deal with most of the aggravations in life that lack of finances can bring. there is nothing wrong with this girl telling it like it is AS SHE KNOWS IT. you cant attack someone for telling their side of the story when this is the only thing theyve known..thatd be totally unfair. im glad that someone doesnt have to have a life of dred and aggravation all the time. im sure she has her own problems, but its not fair to attack her for sharing her life. i cant believe that anyone who picked up this book expected to read anything different than we did..i enjoyed it..it humored me"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Well, actually I'not saying this cause I'm a Paris fan, I wasn't when I read this book. It was from a cousin and I started to read the front page, and then the next, I simply couldn't stopped! I started to read the whole thing and it's one of my favorite books ever! Now I see her TV show, I have the DVD's, I haver her 3 perfumes for men, I have her record, I buy every single magazine in where she appears,'I'll buy a watch soon and can't wait for her world tour and her new stuff. She's releasing shoes, a clothing line, new handbags, jewerly, sunnies, wigs, new perfumes, OMG this gir is amazng, she's gone so far...so haters, better start liking Paris because SHE CAME TO STAY!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book was awsome! People writing bad reviews either just hate paris and were just trying to down her overall book reviews (and most probably didnt even read the book). Or they read the book expecting some philisophical journey.Hello, people, it's paris hilton!!!Her book is really good. I read it cover to cover and couldnt put it down! She gives advice on how to channel your inner heiress while giving you a look into her personal life. The book isn't like some books about celebrities that just restate tidbits about their lives from magazines. It's original material i've never read before.Some people might say the reason she didnt put in a whole long chapter about the sex video is becuase she's scared. The truth is, she has a lot of young fans whose parents probably wouldnt let them read the book if it had sex-related things in it.She stats at the beginning of the book \\"I haven't tried to correct whats been written about me so far because, well, gossips believe whatever they want anyway.\\"I love that because it's so true!Even if she did try to say \\"I didnt do that.\\" or \\"that's not the whole story.\\" or \\"That's totally ridiculous!\\" Most people wouldn't beleive her anyway because everyday we've got things shoved at us from the media about how horrible she is. Everyone loves to trash Paris and yet she goes about her life, not hiding because of what people think about her but embracing it and laughing along with us about her screw-ups and hook-ups.This book is definatly on my Favorites list. Paris keeps things fun, light-hearted, and glamorous and if you are so-serious-you-walk-around-all-day-with-a-scowl-on-your-face-reading-the-New-York-Times-and-constantly-checking-the-stock-market, you probably won't appreciate this book. But if you love-life-and-ridin-in-your-car-with-the-top-down-putting-on-lip-gloss kind of thing, this book will soon become a fav. for you.Give it a chance. Give Paris a chance.I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!I'd give it a billion stars if possible!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris could have atleast made the paper soft so u could use it as toilet paper!!!!PS. paris- do u have a lazy or is ur eye just trying to get away from your face!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book along with the book Titled \\"The Pimp Game\\" by Mickey Royal were the two best books I ever read.

Half the things she says are elaborated or downright lies, and if you don't know that much about her by now, don't even waste your time reading. It's entertaining nonetheless, the pictures are great anyway, and she spends half the book instructing YOU too on how to be an heiress. \\"Loves it.\\"If you're not already a [diehard] fan of hers, don't bother picking up this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I loved this book! !!!!!!!!!

I am female, but more of an anti-socialite, tomboyish introspect- obsessed with the occult, and obscure subjects such as metaphysics, philosophy, psychology, astrophysiognomy, theosophy, astrology, numerology, and ascended master dialogues- among many. So naturally I was drawn to her book in order to take a peek into the life of someone who was seemingly a microcosm of what Contemporary Western Society are all about. The most interesting thing I find about the whole Anti-Paris phenomenon, is that those who criticize her are subjectively criticizing aspects of themselves they see in her. These qualities may or may not exist, for they are a reflection of themselves. 'If you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you'. (Nietzsche) So for many, Paris is a mirror into their own inner selves, because once you have a public profile it is literally impossible to escape criticism in one form or another- and why do people judge? To detract from their own shortcomings.Indeed we are a fickle society. But the inner Paris, I was soon to discover- is a far cry from the spoiled, fickle, man-eating party-animal the notorious media make her out ot be. She is a beautiful, sociable, fashionable and fun loving girl who values her family, friends- and is quite worldly and experienced, in her own unique way. I think the problem isn't about her- it's about the people who criticize her, and the dissapointments they have about themselves on a subconscious level, about the fact that their life has failed to live up to their expectations of what they thought it would be like. This is a broad statement, it may not apply to everyone who hates Paris but there would certainly be some who fit into this category.I see her as an admirable person... with shortcomings, as we all have, because we're human. There are qualities of hers I would love to intergrate into my own personality. She has a wonderful aura and must have had many lifetimes of practical experience to have earned the current life contract she has now and the privileges that have come with it. Nothing we have in our current lives are random- in some way, in past lives we have earned them. But it is also appropriate to note that self-sacrifice is the highest form of spiritual service and the purest way we can express ourselves in this world. I also admire her attitude where she is able to block out the criticism she gets. Cut her some flak- it takes a lot of nerve to have a public profile like hers. Most of the people who criticise or hate her would buckle under the pressure in an instant, if they were in her position.*re reads review*, and concludes:I've really gone off the deep end this time. I need to go to bed now."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"All I can say is I hope her parents are proud. 2 sex tapes, that is all she is good for. She only is famous because her parents are rich. She is a joke and I blame her parents for the making of a rotten girl!! Seeing your daughter in these situations just makes you think WHAT DID I DO WRONG... She is just an idiot and you should see her before her plastic surgery and her BROWN eyes!!!! GO to www. awfulplastic surgery.com and you will see how different she looked, MY MY what money can buy, BLue contacts and all.

Their living the nice lifestyles that people envy. They have everything family, friends, boyfiends, nice clothes, nice bodies, and nice cars. They could also do everything like Paris has her own fragrance, jewelry, book, show, and now a music album. In some ways, I do think that Paris is a good role models for girls because she believes how everyone should live their life to the fullest and not take anything too seriously because life is too short. What I like about Paris is she's confident and she's a girly girl. She likes to dress all cute and sexy. She loves the color Pink and she likes Madonna. I enjoy reading the book because you get the learn things about her like her favorite places, her favorite colors, and advices on what to wear. It make her seems like an all-American girl. I do wish I could be like her. Having fun and being beautiful 24/7. But I don't like how she gives bad advices like she should try to dress super sexy and revealing like showing your navel. That only attractes unwanted boys. Boys that want your body instead. Like my teacher said, \\"they're not thinking of you as person from the head but they're thinking of you from the [...] head\\" meaning they only want you for sex and not for who you are. But I do recommend this book for girls who want an insight on what it's really like to be heiress and build their inner confidence."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book was not at all to be taken seriously. Paris has a very privileged barbie doll life that is truly just fun to read about. I really liked this book because I think Paris just wants to have fun, which is probably why she \\"wrote\\" the book: TO HAVE FUN.Paris: she's tall, blonde, and has over 1,000 pairs of shoes. She is very glam, and to be honest, every girl young or old wants a bit of glam. I believe Paris brought us into her world in this book so we could ooh and ahh at pretty things and show us her lifestyle. Some people make Paris out to be a malicious person, obviously I do not know her personally, but I think its unfair for others to ridicule and treat her with disrespect just because she has taken advantage of what was given to her. She has a life in the limelight, which is under a microscope 24/7, and she takes it with ease and poise. Of course she has made mistakes, because under the thick tan and Chanel sunglasses, there is a real person who makes mistakes. They are just more publicized than yours and mine. I personally believe paris is a nice lady who is thankful for the life given her and is looking for a fun time. Is that so bad? Its a fun chick book that I thoroughly enjoyed and will read again."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is great for anyone who wants to find their 'inner heiress' which sadly suits me to a T. People shouldn't put Paris down for being a bubbly blonde who has loads of money, and makes the most of life. She can't help what she was born into, and I think anyone would be exactly the same in her situation. Everyones different, and Paris just knows how to work it to her benefit.She also doesnt try to make people conform to 'body beautiful' standards and is realistic with her diet in this book, unlike some other role models to young people.This book isnt patronising, it's just Paris, and thats the way it should be. Oh, and i'm glad she got a ghost writer, I mean, if she wrote it, it would take forever to proof read and edit."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose is a sad book.Paris Hilton has nothing.She can't write, she has no insights to live.This is a worthless book written by an empty little girl who never grew up."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I love the pictures are really pretty! the other people on here may not like it but Paris is very sweet& prettty She reminds me of me I love her Im like really a fan of her and would love to personally know her!

This book is not worth the time of even reading. The only thing that I liked about it was the nice pictures of all of her outfits. She seems so shallow and empty. What made me laugh was her How to be an heireiss. One example was tell everyone what they want to hear. Another one was have flawless skin. First off, you have to be lucky to have great skin,born with it or just take care of like not smoking or drinking that is my own advice. Act ditzy or act bored. These things that makes you believe that she is so shallow and not so smart.Also her diet made me really like are u serious. Eat chocolate all the time,fries and eat carbs all the time. Are you kidding me? This is not something you would really would not hear a rich girl say this.I like Paris for her fashion. She is truly a fashion icon. She has great taste and knows how to put things together. Plus we like the same colors.I also love her perfume. It smells sooooo goood. Lastly I loved her show Simple Life. Her and Nicole were so funny on the show.Other than that, I don't see why she wrote a book. It has dumb chapters. How to be an Heiress,I'm with Paris,Warm and Fuzzy. I do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I didn't purchase this book because I'm no fan of Paris Hilton. I did read it though, in one complete sitting. Think of it as a really thick magazine similar to one of those special editions fashion mags occassionally drop on you and you've got what this book is about.I'll say it's a satisfying read. It's detailed enough for fans of hers to enjoy, funny enough for people neutral about her to chuckle to, and detestably self-absorbed enough for people who hate her to hate her even more.In short, it has everything for everybody.It's difficult for me to rate this book because I'm aware that this book aims to do nothing more than to simply be pleasing, and succeeds perfectly in that. I'd complain that there's nothing in there that you don't really know about Paris, and there aren't really any points when you can actually sit up and pay real attention to, although you'll be guaranteed to have a good chuckle along the way. The overall aftertaste I get of this book is that it's just too slick, too clean. It feels, tastes, and acts like a cute little PR and personality-selling business formula that doesn't stray off even for a while. The result is like listening to an overplayed catchy pop-dance song on the local hit radio station: it's enjoyable, it's very likeable, it's undeniably appealing, but it's also mediocre."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"C'mon guys, your bad reviews are about Paris Hilton's character, not this book. The book itself is silly, campy and fun, although it is not very interesting. I was disappointed that this book was not more personal and was not at all juicy.

Sh'es got something that Nicole Richie doesn't , p aris' book was deffinitely not what I would call a \\"book\\" It was just a fun read for people to laugh at , I always bring this book with me to sleepovers to let people laugh over it. I mean things like the doggy diary were hilarious and the rules man that was hilarious , i recall something to do with losing your mobile pone to prevent your calls or something like that and her fashion don'ts it seemed like she wanted people to see her gross outfits and laugh at her , she was showing off quite a bit but it is quite funny and a book that everyone would bitch about. But I give props for paris for being brave enough to publish a book like this something hilarious but still giving the public what they already know of her , an heiress snob , oh yeah n u can also see she actually has brown hair and brown eyes in some photos so yeah... .,\\" My favourite section was the last section about how shes changed and her self perceptions has changed and how she has goals now , I dont really think she wrote the last bits but oh well at least shes smart enough to put it in.

You can always use a good read from Paris Hilton."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Despite what others will say to bash Paris, I liked this book. It was a cute little publishing of her life and how she lives today. It seems like she has gotten better at a lot of things and this shows that she is not being petty living off her parents wealth. She is in fact, out on her own doing things and working hard. She recently appeared on American Dreams and I saw major improvement in her acting ability. She has movies in process and an album. Criticizing her and calling her stupid will not make you any smarter. Saying she's ugly will not make you any prettier. Give the girl credit for trying. She may not be perfect or be flawless, but who is? I hope to be just as talented as her one day. I respect her and believe she is only being human. If you were her, you'd be just the same. Plus, how can we judge someone we don't even know. This book is cute.

But despite that, I actually enjoyed it...a lot. Underneth the pink sparkles and use's of the words \\"fun\\" and \\"hot\\", this book has a certain depth to it. The kind that you can only get out of a book that will actually make you happy, make you smile, make you giggle. It's that kind of book that you can read when you want to loosen up, when you need a beach, airplane, or other read. It's the kind of book that you consider a \\"guilty pleasure\\".

Seriously, I enjoyed this tale/how-to-guide, it made me laugh, just what it was supposed to do. I'm pretty sure this book wasn't meant to be taken too seriously. It's just a book about a girl and her life and it's funny, witty, and smart, with clever advice. i feel sorry for those of you who only read the book to gain new material for better Paris Hilton bashing, you all need to get over yourselves. The only thing you have against this girl is that she has more money than you and is prettier than you. Everyone should read this book! Paris is fab!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"That was the exact question I asked when hearing the news, it was so surprising to me, that I just had to read it. Connfessions Of An Heiress reads less like confessions, and more like a guide to be an heiress. I highly doubt the majority of the readers of this book will be heiresses so most of the info you get from this book is useless, but at the same time, somewhat fascinating, cause Paris is on such a different level than most people out there, sometimes while reading I just wanted to say \\"Most of us can't afford that, so you are pretty much preaching to the choir.\\" Confessions Of An Heiress is by no means a bad book, it's an easy and enjoyable read that can be easily finished in one sitting. The book has many many pictures so it's already low page count of under 200 pages is even lower when it comes to just text. Paris may be spoiled, and this book pretty much confirms that, but she knows it, and I like that about her. At least she's not trying to be fake. All and all, if you were looking for crazy dark secrets and groundbreaking confessions from one of America's most famous heiress, be sure to be disapointed, but if you just wanna read some casual talk about things like clothes to friends to Tinkerbelle (she even writes a few paragraphs in her dog's perspective to show others what Tink's diary would be like)this book will do you just fine."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"if you dont like paris, dont review this and dont buy the book. take it for what it is, adorable. she goes through her past, and brings along tons of pictures of herself, her family, and her friends. its nice to look at when you have some free time, but isnt a must have."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"this book isn't supposed to be taken seriously. it's a fun look at hilton's life, written by hilton in a (read the title) tongue-in-chic (cheek) manner. it's fun, it's eye candy, it's entertaining. it won't win any great literature awards, and it wasn't written to win them."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Confessions of an Heiress is a great book for girls wanting to find their inner heiresses.

Paris Hilton is the epitimy of why alot of these young Hollywood starlets suck. Paris, Jessica Simpson, Brittney Spears, Nicole Ritchie and Lindsey Lohan! I just don't understand the appeal. Why they suck?1.Their looks are highly overated.2.They have no class what so ever.3.Always in the tabloids over scandalous nonsense.4.They have no talent or substance.5.They have very ugly toes (I have a big foot fetish so women with ugly feet is a big turnoff).So on that note I will just stick with Hilary Swank, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane, Sandra Bullock and Faith Hill.Why?1.They are all naturally beautiful women.2.They are very classy and sincere.3.They are never in the tabloids for negative publicity.4.They are all very talented( Hilary is a two time Oscar winner need I say more).5.And they all have very beautiful feet and sexy toes.And that's all I got to say about that."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Most people who reviewed this probably didn't even buy the book.

And you're wrong. I thought the book was good. After all, she is famous for being famous so all of you haters should have known what to expect. You're the moron's if you actaully expected something in the likes of Charles Dickens. It's an heiress, for Christ's sake! Personally, I think that you haters don't realize that Paris has the last laugh. Any press is good press and if you're talking about her then you spread her legecy and she's obviously making some kind of impact on you pin heads!

In this book, Paris has the guts to admit her unique and polemic life style without boundaries, which only a true brave girl could do. She has a very wise, witty, and above all, fun way to describe her thoughts and values, what makes this read light and a breakthrough. It's interesting how a girl can create a major controversy, leading us to conclude she has something to tell others, or else people would make no big deal of it.

Want proof? (...)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I've never been Paris Hilton's number one fan. In fact, I've never really been a fan of her's at all. I never understood why a girl like her got famous for walking on the red carpet in trashy, skin-baring outfits and partying til dawn. I never understood why Paris Hilton is constantly in magazines, whether it's just gossip or a real article. I never understood why she was considered a pop icon. I just didn't understand it, until The Simple Life came out.I became a fan of Paris Hilton when I saw The Simple Life. She was just so funny to watch on TV, and I knew she was simply a blonde tart with a heart--I knew she was a celebrity that was special. She wasn't just another celebrity that would be in the spotlight one day and out the door the next day. In other words, I knew she'd be around for a while. She's the kind of celebrity that you'd be telling your children about. (Well, you won't be telling them about that scandal, but let's move on, shall we?)Anyway, aside from her trashy outfits and bad party habits, I started to like Paris. Whenever I read a gossipy article about her, I tried to defend her in anyway that I could. I know I must sound crazy, but if you try and push aside her bad qualities, this tart would be a perfect young Hollywood role model!Anyway, about the book. My best friend bought it for me for my birthday, knowing that I am a Paris fanatic (no, I am not gay, I am straight, people, so don't even ask.) and I was thrilled. I began reading the book instantly. Even though I think Paris didn't write the book herself, I really did enjoy it. I think she had a little bit of help from somebody, but I do think she wrote some of it.It was a fairly good book overall. It was humerous, and if you like Paris, you'll love this book.

I want mine soon but it will be with someone I want because I really want to surrender to some guy that I met on the internet over a year ago and we still haven't met yet. He's in the Navy and he does deep sub rescue. It's so neat"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I enjoyed Paris's book a lot, I can not get enough of her. It is funny to hear her perspective on the social scence and other objectives that she brings to the table. A lot of them seem unrealistic to the average person, but it seems unreal how much attention one person can get. The pictures throughout the book seem so clear almost like you are in the same room with her. The Ultimate Heiress is Paris and I love her for it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I checked this out for reasons I still am unsure of. What I found was exactly what you've come to expect from Paris Hilton: Walking away wondering 'Why the hell did I pay attention to this girl?'Confessions of an Heiress is occasionally witty, (no thanks to the ghostwriter who ACTUALLY wrote this: Do we really expect she penned this herself. yeah, right! That would inevitably interfere with her partying lifestyle!) but really odd in it's view of a lifestyle that maybe 5 people can actually relate to.I got the sense that Paris really wanted to give the audience a sense that she has some depth behind the party girl...but my impression was the 'depth' had the quivalent of a bird bath in August! I really think she's good at being a 'party girl' and an Heiress, because she hasn't been raised any other way. And the lifestyle she describes? Well, let's just say those millions of hers will make some plastic surgeon VERY happy some day.Overall, if you enjoy listening to a spoiled Rich Girl prattle on about her life, and you want to help give Paris the impression that she is actually EARNING money, they buy her book. Otherwise...it just wouldn't interest the average adult reader, and could border on insulting anyone who earns their own living."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I was very unimpressed with the book. I was excited to sit down and have a nice relaxing evening looking into Paris' life and what she had to say...I fell asleep within 30 pages! I gave th ebook a second chance; and it was as unimpressive the second read as the first. My advice is to save your money and get a different book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"For her to ruin the literary market. What is it with these publishing giants these days putting out this crap? What happened to literary value and art? It's all about the money these days, as we can all plainly see, from the cruddy stuff being churned out. It, IMO, is especially offensive to struggling artists. As someone majoring in creative writing and minoring in theater, it saddens me to see that the industry is going downhill by putting out this garbage. And no, I'm not jealous of Paris. From what I see, she is a very ignorant, shallow young lady who gets by in life on flirting and being cute. And no matter what she does (i.e. calling those black boys that disgusting n-word that shouldn't even exist), she is forgiven for it, all because she is beautiful and rich, whereas if someone like, say, Al Franken or J.K. Rowling did it, they would lose fan base fast (unless, of course, they used plastic surgery to turn into Ken and Barbie dolls). Unfortunately, though, this is American culture of the twenty-first century, where people like Paris and William Hung are our sources of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and pick up some real literary work by the Bronte sisters, Flannery O' Connor, or William Faulkner. You will be glad you did.Avoid."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Frankly, I've had enough of this woman. There are 2 types of persons who reside in high society; those that revel in their image (which, sorry, gets old), and those that lay low, are highly intelligent, and quite eccentric. Certain persons in history are quite interesting to read about, however, Paris is not one of them. She has a horrible sense of fashion, limited vocabulary, and is rediculously boring. Yet, her publiscist is someone who deserves \\"mad props.\\" The ability to market a moron and make bank off of her is remarkable. But, the purchasing of Hilton paraphernalia by the masses is simply more evidence of the dumbing down of Americans. Oh, and I'm a real platinum blonde - do you think Paris would even understand these words?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Saddens me that paper, money and people's time were wasted on such a shallow, selfish, immoral product."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"The only reason this book was published is for one thing. Can you guess why? If you said \\"for money\\" you're showing some signs of common sense. This is aimed at two types of people, girls ranging from 12-21 and sex hungry boys between the ages of 15-21. Being a 16 year old male I can say honestly, Paris Hilton is truly ugly. (I could name atleast 75 other women in the entertainment buisness hotter than her) She has zero class no intelligence or any positive physical appearence. Yet she has more money than you (whom ever is reading this now) or I. Welcome to America, eh? It is scary though, seeing young girls look up to a woman (i'm using the term loosely here no doubt) like Paris Hilton. To any young kid reading this, don't let trends or mtv decide who you as a human being are. Or you will become as shallow as they are. Be who you were meant to be and only you.No matter what anybody say."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"... exactly WHY Paris Hilton is famous? What has she done that's worthwhile, creative or groundbreaking?It really makes me weep for humanity when I see a book like this on the shelves. It really makes me weep for humanity when I turn on one of the corporate-owned T.V. stations like 'E!' where Paris is portrayed as some kind of living goddess, who we should all aspire to become.I haven't read this book, although I've read lengthy excerpts from it, and I have to say that it's very self-absorbed and boring. What depresses me is that some people worship this woman, who has done absolutely NOTHING for the world. There is no hope for the human race."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I flipped through this book at the local bookstore where it was displayed prominently. I could not actually read it, as some of the things printed were so disgusting I had to put it down.What is the fascination with this girl? I guess it is because she is rich and everyone likes glitter or glamor or whatever.But she is also extremely shallow, immature, ignorant and immoral.The book as a whole is downright stupid, but I was offended by the part that said 'only have billionaire friends' That's right, people! Only hang out with folks who have big bank accounts. Judge people on how much money they have. This of course, would mean such selfless individuals as Ghandi, Mother Teresa and Jesus Christ would not be good enough for Miss Hilton to associate with (not that she has any idea who any of these people are).I find it ironic that someone who has never had to support herself, who has absolutely no idea where money comes from, or how hard it is to actually earn it, is so judgmental toward those of us who actually WORK for our upkeep! (I believe the term is Paris-ite!) She and her druggie friend proved in their disgusting show that they would never be able to support themselves if their lives depended on it, so who are they to look down their noses at normal hardworking people? They could not even make it through high school, let alone real life!Many reviews on here call her brave and say people are just envious. Brave? For putting herself out into the celebrity life? She lives for that! Real bravery is to be 37 years old and fighting cancer for a second time because you would like to be around to help your husband raise your two children. Or to slave away at some job, where a thankless boss gets angry and calls you a ni**er (Paris is familiar with this word!) but you can not quit, because you are raising three orphaned grandkids. These are actual people that I know, and the world is full of many more just like them, trying to get by on their own hard work. Too bad the world is so busy worshipping this trashy celebrity who thinks of herself as some kind of special royalty.And no, there is nothing here of which to be envious. Money can be a burden, as it has in this case. This girl has absolutely no concept of real life. She will always be an immature idiot, as she has never had the opportunity to learn and grow. Just buy your way out of everything.Stop worshipping this person and maybe she will go away and find something useful for herself to do."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I happened to browse this book during my recent visit to a bookstore.

I realize that it is idiocy to even rate this crappy book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton is trash with money. No class, compassion or cultural awareness. She offers nothing in here. I gasped in horror at seeing it at an ex-girlfriend's house and that is how I know what is in it. Hopefully at one point she will come to understand that she should have gone to college instead using daddy's hotel money to become famous for having no talent and no beauty.

I almost didn't vote because I saw her billboard in Times Square saying \\"Vote Or Die!\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Do not be fooled by a 3-star rating. This is an \\"either you hate it or you love it\\" book. The vast majority rated on the ends of the spectrum.This bratty little girl is being fed by a sadly malnourished America. We'd be better to occupy ourselves with something that matters. Paris does not. She is the most useless, empty person I've seen in a long, long time. The only reason I'd pay attention to her life at all is to try and figure out where we've failed in instilling values in our citizens and what can be done to reduce or eliminate our celebrity worship. It's distressing, depressing, and pathetic.About the book, I agree with the reviewer who said, \\"The writing is very simplistic, the tone is overly shallow, and there seems to be more pictures than words.\\" It perfectly describes Paris Hilton herself: simplistic, overly shallow, more pictures than words.Waste of money, waste of a life."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"You can't help yourself but after the fact you're wondering what the fascination actually was. Because we get to hear from a privileged girl who never had to prove herself to become famous and enjoy the finest this world has to offer? Because we're curious to contemplate the monster this shamelessly shallow society has produced?Don't spend your money on it. Go to a bookstore, time yourself and speed-read it in a minute top.

Giving her the title credit of author, whom I suspect is marginally literate, is a bigger joke than the actual book itself. Self-promotion at its all time low.I don't know what is worse: Her teenage followers, who wouldn't know a good book if Hemingway slapped them over the head with a copy of For Whom The Bell Tolls, or, the fact that trees died to make the paper for this junk. Actually, I'm more surprised her fans knew where to buy books.As for it's infantile premise, I guess it could be useful for those Upper East Side, trust fund girls worth 300 million dollars and who spend their life snorting coke and dancing on table tops in trendy, Manhattan nightclubs. If you fit into that demographic, then yes, this is for you. As for the rest of the teenage female population, work at becoming a doctor, or a lawyer ,or maybe a CEO, not a white-thrash member of the Lucky Sperm Club."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I had such higher expectations for this book. I wanted to hear the real story, and the writing is terrible and the book is so shallow. I learned more about life as a heiress reading Bergdorf Blondes. For the money, at least Paris Hilton could have given us some good info or inside story!I did see that she is really a pretty girl & has beautiful hair under those cheesy hair extensions she wears. The pictures were fun to look at, but it would have been nice if there had been captions."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"The sooner this annoying, talentless media whore develops a cocaine habit and fades back into the obscurity which she is so obviously destined for - the better. I'm sick and tired of seeing her on TV and the cover of Magazines, but hey, somebody must be interested in her, because the media wouldn't bother otherwise. It's pretty pathetic that a seedy DIY porn movie has brought her all of this fame (ok, infamy) and she's milking it for all it's worth. As for the claim that this book is supposed to be \\"tongue in cheek\\", she wouldn't know wit if it came out the U-bend of the toilet and bit her on her over-pampered privileged ass. C'mon in Paris, your 15 minutes is nearly up...."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton's Confessions of an Heiress is an interesting book. You have to take it with a grain of salt, or you'll be dumber afterwards for reading it. The subtitle says it all; the book is tongue and cheek. She does have some actual advice, like eat whatever you want because you only live once and other things on that level. But she also suggests that a girl should only choose to be born out of a rich family. It's not to be taken seriously.The book is fun and has a lot of pictures of her, her family and other celebrities. The target audience is for younger girls who strive to be popular (Hilton refers to them as heiresses) and in our superficial world, I think young girls will get a kick out of it. Nothing good, but nothing bad. If you like Hilton, you'll enjoy it and if you don't, you'll like her even less."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I got this book because I love the Simple Life and I wanted to give Paris the benefit of the doubt. She's beautiful and I liked her show, so why should I hate her instantly?The writing lived up to my expectations. It was clearly written by a girl who isn't incredibly versed (or perhaps by her ghostwriters). However, I did find myself agreeing with minor quotes like, \\"Accept free stuff. If people want to give it to me, why shouldn't I take it?\\" and \\"When I see people in embarrassing situations, I never laugh at them because I always feel really bad for them. I know how they feel.\\"There were parts when Hilton actually made fun of herself. She lists things that an heiress would do as if everyone reading could do the same. She laughs at her wealth and the emphasis the media places on it.I got the sense from the book that Hilton is a carefree girl out to have a good time. The many photos littering this book prove she has a flair for fashion and fun.The pages aren't dripping with literary genius or philosophical breakthroughs. They're simply a representation of a glamorous life that some people can't get enough of. Fans don't love Hilton for her wit; they love her for her beauty and her sense of fun. That is exactly what you get from this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Well - this book does answer one question - what do rich people do with all their photos? They publish a book!For the fans of Paris Hilton (perhaps her family, maybe some teenage girls, etc.) this is probably a must-have. Here, in one shiny book, are hundreds of pictures of Paris. Different clothes, different poses, pics with pooch - you name it! In between the pics are snip-its of \\"Paris Wisdom\\" such as fashion dos and don'ts, the Paris diet, make-up tips, etc. And, if you are a big fan of the color pink - you'll be happy to know that it is used liberally throughout!I shouldn't be too harsh - afterall, my friend's daughter thinks Paris rules and uses her book like a bible (scary thought - huh!). For the rest of us - you can always use the pictures to wallpaper your... doghouse, perhaps????"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I am confused. Are coloring books now making it into the best sellers list? The least Paris could have done is hired a decent writer (she can certainly afford it)!

Trust me, much better books are available by authors like Pam Rosenthal, Nancy Madore, Suzanne Enoch or even Julia Quinn."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"hi,i just read Paris Hilton's book. And i really could not get into it. She needs to actually talk intelligently and go outside of a 50 word vocabulary.

Paris, your inexplicable 15 minutes are up. Please just go away and stop reminding us why our cultural landscape is so depressingly barren."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I would like to take this moment to say that just because your rich, famous and beautiful, doesn't mean you should be allowed to sell a book. Looking over the fact that it was most likely written by a ghost-writer, this entire book is giving young women the wrong idea about what to idolize. Hilton is spending large periods of this book telling how to make people treat you with reverance and respect, not realizing that the reverance she is receiving is utterly and entirely false, given to her only because she is, as I stated before, rich, famous and beautiful. Instead of having to wear a pretty little tiara to get people to look at you and fawn over you, accomplish something more than parties and booze to be treated as a respected equal.All in all, this book lowers the standards of of the publishing house it was accepted by. If your seeking depth behind the blond locks and pretty clothes, you will end this book thoroughly disapointed. I think no more of Hilton than I ever had originally, and in fact, truth be told, I think less of her, for this book proves all the things I've thought of her, with her not thinking its a bad thing at all.If you buy this book, buy it as a sort of emblem to everything a girl shouldn't look up to and should never try to be. One should actually have intelligence behind that pretty little face."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris took me by the hand and showed me her values, some secrets, and how one can me more like her.

It really stimiulated my mind, it reminded me of the complex converging story lines of Charles Dickens best works. Her use of the full lexicon of the English language rivals that of William Shakespeare. In fact, she was even able to invent some new vocabulary, that was not in any dictionary. Her marvelous use of metaphor recalls that of the great Russian master Dostoyevsky. There were even some clearly outragously allegorical chapters, in the style of Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal.\\" By the last chapter the mastery of Paris brought me to tears! I RAN OUT OF TISSUES!!!!!!!!

It doesn't take much time to read, due to the amount of photos taking up space, so it's an easy read, and a very funny insight into her life!I've never really known much about Paris Hilton until The Simple Life came along, which I still haven't seen, but I want! Then she really came to my attention, and although she's the kind of girl I would love to be (tall, and pretty), I never really knew about the Hiltons, never mind how to correctly pronounce heiress! I see her a lot more in magazines now, due to her last relationship with Backstreet Boy Nick Carter (who features prominently in the book) and her One Night In Paris video! Her sister, Nicky, is also coming out more, thanks to her short lived marriage.Most of the photos are gorgeous - she's definitely camera-friendly, unlike some people, and there's rarely a bad photo among them. Unless they're the ones she's deliberately put in. Which is a relief when you find out she's not entirely perfect.This is definitely a tongue in cheek book, although there's no mention of the video circling of her in compromising positions, just that she's made her \\"mistakes\\". It's definitely worthwhile getting it, as it's funny, and she has a great way of talking about things, whereas not going into every major detail about her life."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I bought the Paris Hilton book : ] for 2 bucks and it was brand new.

Put your hateful energy on someone hateful, like yourself, not someone who only has nice things to say, like Paris. If you have a sense of humor, you can enjoy this book.

I would consider it criminal if you do not read this masterpiece. Paris Hilton is a tour de force and I \\"Got Blow\\"n away by Miss Hilton's brilliance. We all knew Paris has tremendous talent, brains, and sophistication and this book proves that she is so much more than just some rich girl who put a sex tape on the internet. Confessions was not only a wild romp in the club, it was an endearing peek at the life at a blonde pillar of society. Paris I love you. Keep writing. When you're old and saggy you'll always have your mind."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"First of all, let's just get this out of the way. Noone actually belives that she actually wrote this book do they? Because her IQ is lower then my BAC, and yes I'm still alive so that's less than one for those of you who don't know. Second I think I read somewhere that they actaully tested her IQ against that of a bar of soap. The scores were equal, but I think I'll withdraw that. I don't want to insult the soap. But in anycase onwards. So... baiscally a spoiled... _17(|-|, decided that she was important enough to have someone ghostwrite a book about her, so she could go about attempting to find... Certain diseases to add to her personal collection. And then published it. Probably without the knowledge to even read it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I think that this is a good book. I thought it wouldn't be as readable but the photos of her are nice. She can shift from sexy to fun to conservative to wild to just out there in the outfits she wears. Very diverse. She even admits that she turns down on some clothes when she shops, just leaves them on the rack. Paris Hilton is honest about herself and even makes fun of herself in this book in some places. She does clear rumors about things written about her. She even reads the tabloids and magazines with her in it on planes when most celebrites refuse to do it. She does have pictures with former boyfriend Nick Carter, but doesn't say anything about their recent breakup. She mentions how close she is to her sister, her parents, her small dog Tinkerbell, and family. This is a good escapism book for anyone. This avoids the \\"I'm a celebrity\\" mentality of some books as she talks about her inner self and the pitfalls of fame despite the success she does have. Her writing's okay, but she could have explained more about this unexpected fame or the infamous sex tape that she really wants to avoid. That being an heiress doesn't mean that she's overly rich. When people hear Hilton, they think of that major upscale hotel chain and they're putting that high pressure on her. I'm surprised that it didn't sell very well. I learned a lot about Paris in this book, why she's a well known person with Simple Life, and why she wants to branch out into acting, music, more moeling and other entertainment aspects."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"As a big fan of Paris, I was anxious to get my hands on this book! I found the book very witty, very humorous, and very tongue-in-cheek, just as the subtitle suggests. Other reviews are criticizing the book, but I don't think most of them have even read it. Or if they did, they obviously took it way too seriously. This book is meant to be a funny, witty read!I really enjoyed the book. I loved Paris' various rules to be an heiress (which has nothing to do with money or where you live, it's really all about a state of mind), her \\"Heiress Dos\\" and \\"Heiress Don'ts\\" (which were really funny!), and her advice about just having confidence in yourself. Many people will be skeptical thinking what Paris could possibly write that actually substantial, but this book would prove them wrong! The advice here is actually very useful, and goes to prove that Paris is a real person, and is NOT wrapped up in her self-image as everyone thinks she is. She's a real girl, with a real head on her shoulders, and she is able to make fun and laugh at herself, which is totally important! You have to laugh at yourself, and not take everything so seriously. That's basically the point Paris is trying to get across. She doesn't take herself seriously, and that's what I loved about this book! She has a section about her pose/outfit/picture nightmares, and even talks about other people making fun of her, and she just laughs at it, and that's what I love about Paris the most! She just wants to have a good time, and she stresses that in her book. Just be confident and have fun, life is too short to be worry about what others will think of you, and I think the message here is very important, especially to people who are insecure about themselves.Apart from the actual pages, there are hundreds of beautiful photos of Paris, along with her friends, family, and her not-so-glamorous photos!I love the book, and I'm anticipating Paris' other upcoming projects, like her several films, and her album which she is still working on!

It claims to instruct on becoming an heiress, but evidently Paris is not your average heiress. She constructs the heiress as an 'other' but encourages readers to become one. For those (presumably few) people who would like to be like her, this is a great read. For those who enjoy quality photography and/or overloads of pink, don't bother reading it - just look at it.For me, it was a fascinating insight into the mind of Paris Hilton, and foregrounded the things that are important to her in life. This is integral to her media image, as we need to know where she's coming from. She obviously wants to be understood and liked by her fans.If you're at all interested in celebrity or popular culture, this is the (auto?) biography of the most powerful celebrity of the moment."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is great I think any girl can relate.

You can't escape this $350m heiress, socialite and celebutante. She is always photographed on the red carpet and is a regular on gossip coloumns. One way or another she always manages to shock people! Yet again she shocked the world - by writing this book.When i first came across the book, I thought it had all of Paris's secrets that the Press were dying to know. But infact, this book is simply a guide on how to be like er... Paris.The book is split into 12 chapters which include:- \\"My other half - Nicky\\", \\"How to be a heiress\\" and \\"My favourite accessories\\". It has 174 pages which are crammed full of pictures.The book is full of advice on how to be like Paris herself and is helpful for very insecure people because in the 1st chapter, she gives plenty of advice on how to be self-confident.I recommend this book to Paris Hilton wannabes and clever people that feel they are too clever and want to take it down a notch."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"i love this book i read it in less than 8 hours its so cool and if people think shes stupid shes taking that stupidity straight to the bank i think paris is a genius"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris is hot. That's all she needs. Fans to love her like me."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I never read this book but I know Paris is hot. I love her. I can't tell you how much a fan i am of her. Paris is so hot. I sent her an e-mail I hope she responds. And you know I don't care what other people have to say. She doesn't need other people's opinions. Paris doesn't even have to talk for herself. And don't even say she's stupid because that just makes me love her even more. That's what her fans are for like me. I'm probrally gonna pick this up soon. You know why? Cause I love her and she's hot. Paris is the best model ever."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This book is filled with a lot of sexy pictures of no other than Paris herself. I flipped through this book and it has some pretty hot pictures. Especially the back cover(you can look at that through the search this book option). If you want Paris next to you in bed or if you think Paris is a sexy ***** then this book is definently for you. If not then stay away from it. She isn't hurting society at all. If anything she made it better with her burger commercial and such."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"ok... i totally disagree with most of these reviews. haha! they are just jelous that they dont have what paris does! she has the money... so she spends it. why woudnt she? dont hate jus tbecause she can do whatever she wants, when she wants. shes an icon, because there are so many who idol her! she is famous, because america loves her! She was born rich, and she cant help that! omg get over it alredy... stop hatin! and as for the book, i lvoed it! omg who are those other reviews fooling? get off of it alredy, no amount of people will ever be able to wipe her off of the red carpet! and thats just the way it is! mwah! loves it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This was a great book. Tells of the life and times of the ever so popular PARIS HILTON!! She is honest and somewhat funny. I read the other reviews still purchased the book and enjoyed it. Maybe everyone else is just slightly jealous of the money or maybe her looks. Could be her personality but to say this is boring or blah and bland is absurd. So what if we live in a three bedroom two bath home and are middle class, can't hate those we live to watch on Access Hollywood or the 5 o'clock news. Get over it you love to hate her!! Buy the book you will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"this book if full of beautiful pictures. i especially like the car shot in the last chapter. i understand that some of the work was done in australia. i used to stay up all night due to the time zone difference. i could go on, but a little mystery is a good thing...the words are interesting too. empowerment is a good thing, learn it..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I used to be intrigued with Paris and read this book with joy BUT now that Paris has become ALL TOO SELF IMPORTANT and blurts out the MOST insipid statements about anyone and anything she basically knows NOTHING about..... She has become just another rich party girl who doesn't care about anything but herself! I can only hope her image is mostly fabricated and what the press wants us to believe."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"This is a fun read. If you are a Paris Hilton fan, this book is great. If you don't like her, why are you buying the book and then trashing it. Grow up people!!What is it that people don't like about the FABULOUS Paris Hilton? The one thing people think about Paris is that she's famous for being rich. How can this be true? She is a model,actress...she works hard. There are so many other 'famous rich kids' out there we hear nothing about because they are trying to live the life of a socialite. Live it up! You're only young once.So really, what don't you like about Paris Hilton? The fact that she's got a great body - she is not flocking to get breast implants like everyone else these days; she likes to have fun - if you were her age, wouldn't you want to be having fun?; she can get any guy she wants - umm, have you seen simon rex? Break me off a piece!; fabulous clothes - she can indulge in the greates apparel. The list can go on forever.I think Paris Hilton is a lot of fun. She brings out a little bit of 'naughtiness' in all of us. Paris, if you're ever in town let's kick it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"people who have a passion to hate ms. hilton: if you don't like paris then don't read the book! and another thing, don't write things like she's so fake; at least she's living life!!! i thought this book was pretty good. if you have low self esteem you should probably try and read this cuz it really helps boost self-confidence."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"i haven't read this book so i can not give an actual review. i just read a few of the reviews on here and have to say that people need to lighten up on paris. first of all clearly something is interesting about her or else why would you even attempt to read her book. If you were born rich and cute you know you would be out partying it up. people who are bothered by paris are people who are jealous that she has it so easy."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris you rock,this book is the best pink paper thing I've ever read..What's not to love? Smile pretty for the picture Paris.Girls,Guys,and everything in between love Paris.YOU GO MISS HILTON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Are you people serious? To the ones who gave negative reviews, you are so immature. You only hate her because you want what she has. Hey shes young, rich and gorgeous, she knows it and isnt afraid to be herself. You all need to get over it and stop being so hateful, seriously, its sad."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Everyone loves Paris Hilton cause she is beautiful & rich & did i say beautiful i saw her on a late nite talk show & she said the book is sorta like a parody book & not to be take literaly like one of her tips of fame was to be born in a rich family lol like everyone could be born into a rich family so people lighten up & stop hatin' on her plus Nicole Ritchie is also very beautiful & i would like to see more of her maybe also a book i know shes making a CD so that will be cool so Paris & Nicole i look forward to the simple life 3"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I think Paris rocks and I can't wait to read her book. I think its going to be really fun and enjyable. I wish people would stop dissing Paris so much because they don't know her and its not cool to judge people."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris Hilton has not only proved she is a talented actress, model, and over all it-girl, but now she can add accomplished writer to her resume. I find her book to be laugh out loud funny but at the same time strangely thought provoking. Anyone who did not enjoy the book or who doesn't like Paris Hilton is merely jealous of all her success."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"When I got this book I was expecting more of a memoir. But that wasn't the case. I opened the book to find hundred of pictures. The pictures outweighed the actually text, which is cool if you are a huge Paris addict. If you're going to get the book, get it cause it's fun and it's better than a handmade scrapbook or shrine. But if you're going to buy it fun in depth descriptions or her life wait off on it. She'll most likely write another book when she's older that can satify that desire"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"If I want Paris Hilton, all I need to do is search a bunch of porn sites. Why is she famous? She has no talent or intelligence. She isn't really that good looking either.Get a life, read a real book. Ask your local librarian for help, she can show you where the classics are."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I confess. I'm less of a Paris fan after reading this one. I also believe I've lost more than a few brain cells at the completion of this garbage. A couple positives first. First, there were many beautiful pictures of her and her family/friends. Second, it was an easy read. Now to the negative. Paris gives advice on \\"how to be an heiress\\" all of which is completely ridiculous! I felt like she was poking fun at her fan base with suggestions of eating unhealthy and acting like a total imbecile. Every chance she gets she brags about her life and indirectly makes fun of people who haven't lived the way she has.My advice is wait to buy this poo at a yard sale for 50 cents and no more! And only buy it if you need something to read while you take a dump and be sure to flush this \\"book\\" down as well."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I hate to say this but I really like this book. It's like a guilty pleasure. More than a year ago, I found it at a book store in my favorite shopping mall and decided to take a peek in it. After a few pages, I found myself laughing and took this book home. When I finished it the first time, I thought \\"This is a really funny book. What kind of a person is this. Quite self-absorb. Still, it's really funny.\\" Then, it was left on shelf. Anyway, yesterday I was bored, too lazy to find a new book, I picked it up hoping to get relax, instead I got to think hard about it. Really look behind the book, I think she's pretty smart. She doesn't seem to work that hard, just go out partying and maybe famous for being in a sex tape, but the girl's now really making money for going to a party, releasing purfumes, endorsing products, designing stuff, etc. Even having a record deal! What kind of a person will make money just to go to party and have some fun, which you're going to do that by yourself anyway? And hey! for many of you who don't like her, I think some of you already bought (aka giving her your money) her stuff, right? Something in the book are totally ridiculous like \\"choosing a family you are born into,... blah blah blah...\\" but some are pretty sharp. Of course, this is not \\"The Alchemist\\", but I don't think she'll feel embarass to say when she was young, she'd written something like this. Just give it a good laugh and a try. After all, it's just a guilty pleasure!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I like Paris Hilton, and I don't honestly take this book seriously. Its adorable and its meant to be taken as such. If you're fascinated with Paris Hilton then check it out. This book features photos, advice on how to live like an heiress, that's why I don't take it seriously, and confessions by the hotel heiress herself. I do not believe that this book was written by Paris herself, instead I think it was ghostwritten, come on Paris Hilton writing a book? Yeah right!! Anyway its cute, check it out, if anything for a few laughs."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I don't understand some of the people who post the really bad reviews. If you hate, Paris, don't read about her. If you like her, then this book won't disappoint. I think it was a fun, entertaining read. Also readThe Socialite and the Bodyguard (Harlequin Intrigue Series)recently, a fiction book that could have been inspired by her. Enjoyed both."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I thought the book was funny and cute. It's meant to be a joke! It's the most picked up book off my bookshelf. Everyone reads it and laughs and looks at the pictures. As far as her sex tape is concerned, I use to work in a video duplication shop in Santa Barbra and you wouldn't believe how many married couples make \\"home videos\\" and want them converted to dvd. It's their business, not mine, and if I wanted to humiliate them I could have but the only reason anyone cares that Paris Hilton did it is because it's Paris Hilton! If it were your neighbors you wouldn't care! It's a fun book to have a laugh at and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"I like to browse through the best sellers, but I am shocked that this is one of them! I did not buy it, as I am not about to support such overexposed, materialistic hype. Of course, it does not take long to read it, as it is mostly photographs.This kind of trashy read is just the kind of thing that kids do not need to be looking up to. Her 'rules' on how to be an heiress are just plain sick! Act ditzy?! Always have more than one cell phone?! Only wear an outfit once?! Only have billionaire friends?! Only date cute guys?! If this isn't shallow, materialistic and disgusting, I do not know what is! (and yet, the book is flying off the shelves!) It is sad that crap like this gets printed, but publishers do it for the $$. It is even sadder that people spend their hard earned money on this. Do you really think Paris would want to be YOUR friend? Only if you are a billionaire!Perhaps if Ms. Hilton actually had something to be proud of, other than sex videos, partying and lots of money that she did not earn herself, maybe she would not have to make such a repulsive 'book'. A good role model has education, intelligence, works hard, and always thinks of others. This girl is not it. If you like Hollywood glamour, look at the photos, but the book is really a waste."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"The last name Hilton will go down with the likes of Hemingway, Burroughs, Dickens, Shakespeare, Nabokov, Dostoevsky, Camus, Mann, Kafka, Sophocles, Homer, and St. John; in that it is the exact opposite of any of these great writers. I feel bad putting them in the same sentence as \\"Hilton\\", but I thought it'd create a sad and possibly hilarious contrast.Anyway, about the \\"book\\". It was a great masturbatory aid. You can be sure that Hilton's svelte physique, supple chest, and pigeon-like nose will help you reach the very top of Xanadu."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"Paris,You're probably wondering why so many people would hate your \\"perfectness.\\" Well, let me explain a few things to you. First off, ever since you assembled yourself into the spotlight and made a show by doing every little thing you possibly could without having to work like most others, hmm it might be a start to explain you. For example, most people would actually, \\"Work\\" to achieve things like getting a book published, a cd recorded, a part in a movie, yet, u can't seem to define work. Work to most people is \\"striving hard and working everyday of their lives to accomplish what they dream to do in life.\\" Yet, to you, work is just pout and show how adorable you are and at an instant just get to do everything because, oh, you're a little itty bitty Hilton.And oh my, did we mention how much talent you have? I mean it really must take talent to write such a pathetic book, make a $ex tape, And a ludicrous tv show. Then you skip around in flimsy clothing like some stripper, get everything handed to you and now you really wonder why no one likes you and why such 'horrible' things happen to you. I mean gee, I wonder why someone would release your such 'private tape'? Oh and now you wonder why people hack into your cell phone? Oh and steal your social security number? Hmm....maybe so people can make you lose it so you'll go away so no one has to look at you for the rest of their lives. So, please do us a favor and don't write a confessions of an heiress Pt. 2. And don't release your \\"cd\\" of which you know no one is going to think u can sing.Just go back home and live with mommy and daddy. Just dothe world a favor. Now that would be hot. If you just left, vanished. Anyway, I think you have more flaws just besides your size 11 feet. Perhaps a start would be to examine your personality. U might just discover some new findings. But in sum, we all know this book is not worth buying. It is a waste of time.[...]"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"If you can make it all the way to page 2 without heaving the book into a roaring fire, Paris exposes herself for what she is (No, not in that way!)Her quote is, \\"The greatest SIN in life is to be boring.\\"Come on. I understand that this is an overstatement, something like when you tell a friend, \\"I'm going to kill you if don't stop it.\\" You're obviously not going to kill anyone; it is just an exaggerated, emotional statement. But to state that the GREATEST SIN IN LIFE IS TO BE BORING?That sums up this book. Ms. Hilton is such a vapid, mindless, insipid, vacuous, undereducated, uber-bimbo, I truly believe that she believes \\"boring\\" is the greatest sin.With a ridiculous mindset like that, fortunately, she saves us from having to read past page 2."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"If you could get the impression once in a while that she isn't serious under the joking tone some editor has injected here, this might work for a laugh. But I think Paris Hilton is all-too serious: this IS how she lives, thinks, acts. I didn't buy this, by the way, my cousin has it and I read it over there. Before anyone wastes money on this book, give the purchase price to charity, invest it on a pyramid scheme, drop it for someone else to find. Do not, via your purchase, encourage this girl to hire someone to write a sequel!Someone hide all of Paris Hilton's recording devices before she writes--I mean dictates--again!!!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Heiress: A Tongue-in-Chic Peek Behind the Pose","review":"As Ambrose Bierce once said \\"The covers of this book are too far apart\\" and that about sums its up.
