I first read it when I was about seventeen, and I loved it as much this time as I did then. It is truly a joy to read such wonderful writing and be so sweetly entertained.The character of Emma is so fully realized and believable. Her ineptness as a matchmaker simply adds to her appeal, and makes you love her even more for her shortcomings. And the inevitable romance that finally comes to be near the end of the novel is so completely rewarding, that you will be smiling broadly as you read the last few pages.Of Austen's novels, I've only read Emma and Pride and Prejudice.

Nothing agrees with me more than rereading my now favorite book. Though the language is challenging for a young or first time Jane Austin reader it is well worth wading through the odd words and strange grammer to see into the heart of the story.The story touches so close to my heart it is a pleasure to read and dream of that someday romance with me in the place of any one of Austin's ladies. Now if I can find a man as gentlemanly, handsome and kind as Mr. Kingley."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder.Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol or marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults.Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I love reading romance novels from 18th century and Emma kept me glued to my kindle. It is a long book, but worth every page."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Just to note: This review is of the Almost Sunday Publishing kindle edition.If you are like me, you want to buy books at the cheapest price you can get, while still getting good quality. Good news! The kindle version of this book is flawless as far as I can tell. It is simply the text, with chapters that you can jump to. There are NO annoying pictures among the text at all.The story itself is VERY good, and easy to read even though it was written over 200 years ago. I found it very amusing to read Emma's antics, and I could definitely relate to her and the other characters. For more on the plot, you can easy look at the other versions.The bottom-line is if you are looking for Austen for a low price, this one is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Out of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is perhaps the most unique and the most beloved. Unlike all the others, Emma is a wealthy young woman who does not have the pressure of making a good marriage to ensure her happiness and in fact is determined never to wed. Likewise, due to the affections of her father and governess, Emma has been indulged and encouraged all her life into behaving just as she pleases, and as one of the few members of nobility in the small county of Highbury she is a big fish in a very small pond. Due to this, she considers herself superior to others and confident of her own perception of things: to put it simply, she is a snob. Yet she is not dislikeable - she is loving, well-mannered and kind, and deep down she realises that many of her actions are folly - it just takes her a while to get to these conclusions.Crediting herself for the recent marriage of her governess to the estimable Mr Weston, Emma takes it upon herself to play matchmaker for Highbury's society. Her eye is fixed on the eligible clergyman Mr Elton as an excellent match for her new friend Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure birth and minimal wealth. Despite the cynicism of Mr Knightley, an old family friend and the caution of her dear Mrs Weston, Emma is too wrapped up in her own opinions of how human hearts work to heed their advice...Further irony is found in the fact that whilst Emma is busy organising the hearts and minds of those around her, she has utterly no regard for her own and finds on many occasions that her perceptions of people were completely mistaken. But this is where readers' affection for her lies: she is beloved *for* her faults, not in spite of them, and such imperfections make her a rich, understandable character. Furthermore, these faults give her room to grow and improve as a person, and she is not the same Emma at the end of the book as she was at the beginning.\\"Emma\\" is also filled with many memorable supporting characters, very few of which are painted in black and white terms - rather they are small portraits of true human life, each with their own good and bad attributes. There is the talkative Miss Bates and her niece Miss Jane Fairfax (who Emma is cool toward due to the fact she detracts attention away from herself), the pretentious Eltons, Emma's sister and brother-in-law, and the and the dashing Frank Churchill, (Mr Weston's son) on whom rest many hopes by his family of an alliance with Miss Woodhouse.Austen writes in beautifully delicate language, which is filled with many of her best moments of wit and insight into the human condition, especially in her themes of social hierarchy and acceptable forms of manners. It is a common belief that authors of the past are hardly ever critical of their own times or station - Austen gloriously proves these narrow-minded people wrong as she weaves together her characters and their various ways of life with commentary on them all. Like all such reads, it's not for a lazy reader as it needs your constant attention and care. But like all truly good literature, it is well worth the effort and considered the best novel in the Jane Austen canon."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Written by renowned author Jane Austen, Emma is quite an intimidating book to attempt at first glance and takes some patience to read; yet the patience is greatly rewarded. 21-year-old Emma Woodhouse is young, beautiful, rich and witty. She finds satisfaction in her successes and pleasure in the art of matchmaking for others. In her arrogance, she believes that she knows what is right for everyone, and is determined to \\"set the world straight\\", appointing herself cupid for all of Highbury. Fortunately, Emma is eventually \\"enlightened\\", drawn out of her self-delusion, and everything works out in the end. Jane Austen's admirable style and incomparable charm gets away with the happy ending without seeming like a sappy soap opera.The characters in Emma are many, yet all incredibly human. Through wonderfully witty dialogue, these characters are depicted with amazing clarity. Emma's confidence in her knowledge of the world and ability to plan out the lives of others is simply hilarious! It's impossible not to fall in love with her wit, humor, good intentions, and ignorance. Of course, the paranoid Mr. Woodhouse, the talkative Miss Bates, and the innocent Harriet are also memorable characters. The wonders, complications, and misunderstandings of love and marriage are told brilliantly in this entertaining novel!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"A wonderful read! This is a story about a girl named Emma. She is pretty, wealthy, and a little bit haughty. And why not, since she is of a social standing where she feels she's entitled to look down on those inferior to her position. Even though she had such superior airs, I still couldn't help but liking Emma.She tries to play matchmaker to a new friend, and it's a disaster. Despite her actions, I couldn't dislike the character of Emma. She does feel guilty and remorse when she realizes her actions causes turmoil and pain for others. She feels horrible when she realizes her misconceptions of others. She is contrite and sorry for the trouble she causes to those around her.I think one of the things I liked best about this book was the characters. There were so many places where I laughed aloud at Emma's father for his eccentricity and odd behaviors, or reading Emma's thoughts on certain people. It was really a delight to read!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Almost universally, I find books to be far superior to their movie version, and I think most avid readers would be inclined to agree. However, in this case, without having seen the film first, I never would have considered reading this book because I often steer away from classics, finding them difficult to understand and hard to follow. I was quite enamoured with the highly romantic film Emma starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam that I felt inspired to listen to this audiobook. The reader did an outstanding job of making me feel as though the story was happening around me and I was a part of this community, and actively participating in their festivities.Of course, my analytical mind couldn't help comparing and contrasting the book with the film. There are so many different characters, many of whom had very minor roles, or were spoken of but never appeared in any actual scene. Having seen the film first, it was far easier to \\"know\\" who everyone was, and how they related to each other. The book had many more scenes that filled in more details and had deeper character development, which drew me into the story more intensely than before. There were aspects of the film that seemed more romantic (the interactions between Emma and Mr Knightly, for example), and I preferred the way the film ended as compared to the book. But in both versions, Mr. Knightly was extremely swoon-worthy!!!I feel very inspired to read the book in print, now that I am sure to understand and appreciate it to its fullest. And I have just ordered the DVD film version starring Kate Beckensale, which is reputed to be the most romantic of all!! I have officially been \\"turned-on\\" to Jane Austen, and plan to read her other books, comparing and contrasting them to their respective film versions as I have so enjoyed doing with Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Siri Amster- OlszewskiAugust 24, 2006Emma, by Jane Austen, was one of the most enjoyable books I have read recently. I chose to read Emma because, having read and loved Pride and Prejudice by the same author, I wanted to explore her other books as well. The characters in Austen's stories are both intriguing and comical and her description of the era in which they take place creates a clear view of society in those timesI was enchanted with Emma because Austen beautifully blends together a simple story of a girl and a documentation of the societal behaviors of the time. It provides insights into the life and social customs of a lady living in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.One of the book's principle topics is marriage. The main character, Emma, approves of matchmaking for marriage and, through her, the reader gets a view into the different motives for marriage. For some people, marriage was simply a way to advance in social status; for others, marriage was for love. In Emma's time, marriages had to be matched according to social status. One could not marry below their status. Marrying too far above one's status could end up disastrously.The book tells the story of Emma Woodhouse who is a pretty, wealthy, poised, and clever young woman. Her mother died when she was too young to remember or miss her and was raised mainly by her governess, Miss Taylor. Miss Taylor behaved like a best friend rather than a governess due to her mild temper and love for Emma. Therefore, Emma grew up without any firm rules or structure. This freedom caused her to think quite highly of herself and of her opinions. It was her excessive self-confidence that led her to often make mistakes creating misfortunes for others and embarrassment for herself.Jane Austen, by the style of her writing, creates some well-defined character while including other character that are left more open to the reader interpretations. For example, while Emma's faults are very apparent, I found her innocence to be charming and it created sympathy for her character. Other examples of characters like Emma are Jain Fairfax, Harriet Smith, and Mr. Elton. In contrast the character of Mr. Knightly, the family friend is set in stone. Within the first few pages of the book he is established as the moral role model of the story. Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. Weston, Mrs. Weston (the former Miss Taylor), Frank Churchill, and Miss Bates are all other characters that give off a particular feeling, the feeling that Austen intended. These characters all have good and bad qualities, all of which are left up to the interpretation of the reader. The novel is written in third person, however the detached narrator often sees through Emma's point of view. Having the effect of a not so neutral bystander.I highly recommend Emma to anyone who enjoys a light-hearted, witty book that captivates and enchants. While reading this book you will find yourself captivated in the pages of one of Jane Austen's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I admit, it has been a few years since I read Emma. I haven't gotten to read the rest of Austen's works (yet!), but I think she is a fine writer. As a writer, that's a high compliment. I don't mean to say she's, well, fine.. I mean she is fine and honed and respectable.. and great.I picked this book up at my library when I was tired of random teen angst-based novels about first boyfriends and horrible pasts. I wanted something written with real language, with a style. I wanted something old and truly good, like the classics I had read and been read as a young child. I wanted something with SUBSTANCE.Because of this, it took me awhile to get back in the habit of really reading. For a week or so, Emma lay in a drawer, only partway read. It was difficult not to skim and my head would swim with the small print and dark pages. I lamented, but shrugged it off as life got busy.I came out of the shower one day, with an urge to get back into it, and ended up standing, hair wet, in front of my dresser, book rooted up out of the confines of my underthings, and wasting time.I read it constantly until I finished it, as I always do when reading a new book, but this one was different. This one invoked a hunger in me, and I was definitely satisfied when it came to an end.The constant little subplots and dramas surrounding arrogant, but rather good-natured Emma, the engaging characters, with such distinct and memorable personalities, and the wonderful twist of the ending (everyone else says they were so sure, but I, for one, was surprised, I admit) were all...wonderful. Austen is, I say again, a fine writer, and no wonder she is of the classics.I have heard, as well, that she did not think anyone else would love Emma. I ask, how could you not? The people who are so vehement about her flaws clearly have many of the same. She is one of the most enjoyable heroines I have had the pleasure of visiting, among such \\"flawed\\" characters as Anne Shirley (her incessant daydreaming and such a temper! ;), in all my years of reading. And that's a very long time."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen perfects the art of character development in Emma. The long, twisted plot carefully and slowly develops each character using rich detail that makes the characters come alive with personality. Without the rich detail and character development, I do not feel this book would have stood the test of time and become the classic that it is. Emma is a heart-warming book with enough orneriness mixed in to make it amusing."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" exceeded my expectations! I loved this movie! This is one of the best romantic stories I have in my colletion. Gwyneth Paltro portrayed Emma to perfection! The on sreen sizzle between Emma and Mr. Knightly made the movie believable.

Jane Austen sentences long and convoluted at times. However, I love reading about that English era so I stuck with it and enjoyed. Austen certainly has insight into human nature and as you read, you will recognize the traits and apply them to people you know."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I found Emma to be a pretty good book. However, for me it seemed to take to long for them to actually say anything & get to the point."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This is my second attempt at reading Emma. When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.4.5 stars.You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is a master storyteller.

That said, I still like it a great deal.Emma is funny. If you liked Pride and Prejudice, then you'll love Emma.However, I like Austen's darker, heavier books, like Persuasion and Mansfield Park.Emma is long, far longer than S&S; or Persuasion, but it's also fluffier. Emma is rich, very quite rich, so she doesn't have the problems of the Bennett girls in P&P; or the girls in S&S;, or even the gentler money problems of the ladies in Persuasion.Emma is Jane's fantasy, what she might have done if she were rich.If you like Jane Austen, you'll like Emma.If you like Jane Austen's sharp, stinging wit, try one of her others.V."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I think this is Jane Austen's best novel. Its main character is lovable but incredibly flawed. Her saving grace is that she is prepared to acknowledge her repeated errors. The other characters are also both interesting and believable, though the hero Mr Knightley is a bit too good to be true - but then most of Austen's heroes are a bit bloodless except for Darcy and perhaps Willoughby. Emma, the novel, is also a mystery. Both the two subsidiary leads, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax seem to have secrets which are not revealed until the end of the novel. The backdrop of privilege and patronage with its ever present snobbery and prejudice are gently but critically presented.

However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her &quot;friend&quot; Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this &quot;little gem&quot; for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I hate it. So boring.

I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo, action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair.

First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic.

I agree 100%. Sometimes you must read a sentence a dozen times; then, maybe, you have an inkling of what Ms. Austen is trying to say. Maybe not.

However, at the end of the novel the character succumbs to societal pressures and marries the man (Mr. Knightely) that desires her companionship. That shows that her character's personality is not as strong as it seems. Throughout the whole novel she lets the reader believe that nobody could ever modify her view on marriage. Yet, I feel that the love story was very touching, not many people are dedicated to a person to the point where they will wait for them for as long as needed. Love conquers all is a saying that I have always wished to be true, but never thought that it was possible. Emma swore that she would never change her mind on this issue, but after admitting to herself that she was in love with this man, she desired to be with him as much as he did with her. After reading this novel, I realized that people can have soul mates, and that if you really love someone, never let them go because you never know what will happen.

This leaves her as the mistress of her estate, with much leisure time to interact with her socially acceptable neighbors and to try her hand at matchmaking.At first Emma's schemes seem to be going well. She decides that her new friend Harriet, although not of the same social level as Emma, would be perfect for Mr. Elton, a well-connected neighbor. Everything seems to be as Emma had hoped.... until it all falls apart in misunderstanding and hurt feelings.Emma is stubborn, though, and refuses to give up even when things among her social circle get more and more confused. Will she be a successful matchmaker? Will she decide to give up her determination never to get married?I found the characters in this novel very dull and shallow. I didn't find Emma at all appealing, nor did I like any of the other characters in this book. Some of the writing is beautiful and it was interesting to get a glimpse into what life was like at this time, but I found the plot utterly predictable and was a bit frustrated that it took so long for all of the mistakes to sort themselves out."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"True to Jane Austen's prediction that with the creation of her character Emma was a person that not many people would like, Emma is one of the least likable characters in British literature.This snobby, rich and manipulating heroine was despicable to the end, yet the book was hilarious to read. The characterizations were complete and read like real and interesting people. There were the irriating Bates', the hypochondriac Father, the dashing and elegant neighbor and brother-in-law, the accomplished Jane Fairfax that Emma is fiercely jealous of, and the fawning lower class friend Emma wants to &quot;set up.&quot;The comic exchanges between characters, the complexity of the plot and the witty back-and-forth between the &quot;players&quot; makes reading Emma a lot of fun indeed. You don't have to like or agree with Emma the character to enjoy this great piece of literature. If not for Jane Austen's intriguing use of the English language that just sucks you in and holds you captive, I could have never gotten through this book with so much joy and entertainment for my clear disdain of the puppeteer Emma.However, that's what makes the book a masterpiece and why we still enjoy it 200 years later. For a more true, well-rounded heroine, I prefer Anne of Persuasion and Elizabeth of Pride and Prejudice. Both novels have likable leading characters created by Jane Austen.Emma is rich with complexity and rife with interesting, funny interludes and dialogue between the characters. Depite it's flawed main character, it was highly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Those who gave this book a three or lower must not know how to appreciate formal writing. I'M SORRY! MOST OF WHAT THEY SAID IN THE BOOK MUST HAVE GONE RIGHT OVER YOUR HEADS! Those who thought it was boring, it did have a plot because HELLO! that was the time period and that's what they did. Go out and learn something for once. Some people can be so stubborn. Hey, go out and read Remains of the Day. That was about a butler. And it was great. Emma was a good book. It's a good story. But I guess some people are to busy staring at the TV screen to notice. I recommend the movie Godzilla for you guys. Packed with action and (guess what?) no plot."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I absolutely loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, but I found Emma to be pretty boring.

I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book was excellent I recommend this book to every young lady out there. But then again books have there problems this book kind of has some problems. Sorry Jane Austen fans! Nicholas Sparks is better :]"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"...and still my favorite (yes, even over Pride and Prejudice). It a good one to start with if you've never read one of Austen's novels before."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"My mom got this book from the library not long after we saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow. She found out in the movie credits that it was based on a book (we caught the movie on TV by chance) and found out it was by Jane Austen. Since her favorite book is Pride and Prejudice (which she had tried to get me to read for years without success) she read the book, as I did soon after. It's funny that even though Emma is one of Austen's longer books, it took only one movie to render it perfectly, whereas the much shorter Pride and Prejudice needed seven videos altogether!However, this is a review about the book, not the movie. Ahem. The book was great, and like all Austen's books never loses your interest. It is a bit drawn out and your mind may wander a bit during the course of the story, but it was a great story. Emma, the character Austen said no one would like, is much more likeable to me than the pathetic sop that is Fanny of Mansfield Park. She is much different than all other Austen characters; she is rich and has a thirty thousand pound dowry (at least I think so, I forget exactly; I read the book a while ago) which is a lot compared to the other penniless heroines who have at the most a thousand pounds. She is twenty-one, handsome, and though her snobbery is a turn off at the start of the book, you can't help but fall for her charms. She is, as the reviews say, irresistible. And Mr. Knightly is just like most other Austen heroes; a real dreamy guy -sigh- I'm so jealous of these girls. He's not romantic though, and unlike other books, the romance is a minimum, with barely an, \\"I love you\\" in sight.The situations are original and entertaining, and the mismatches of Emma the would-be matchmaker (with no sight in mind of marriage for herself) are very amusing. I would recommend this book to any Austen fan, but for beginners I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or Northanger Abbey, as they are shorter and much lighter, funnier stories. Emma is a bit more quaint. My only complaint is the speeches of that girl who talks too much, what's-her-name; she talks for pages on end, interrupts herself and is in general much more boring than amusing. Highly recommended, buy it now!!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I confess: I often read Jane Austen as an exercise in self-discipline. However, caution should be exercised in reading her books. Little surprises turn up which force a certain circumspection of all characters and events. In \\"Emma\\", we meet with the practice of \\"giving up\\" children, illegitimacy and the concomitant existence of, and suspicion of, extra-marital sex, flirting clergymen who, naturally, view courtship as a Machiavellian enterprise, egotism, snobbery, hypochondria and maybe even a little attention deficit disorder--heroes, heroines, villains alike. It is a great tour de force. Austen draws her characters well--who hasn't met a Miss Bates or a Mrs. Elton in their lifetime? Finally, also watch out for those little dollops of wisdom interspersed throughout--they pop up, wake you up and then are gone, leaving you in the midst of the question of just what is the best way to prepare a piglet's leg."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's book Emma is creatively woven together with the characteristics of Emma Woodhouse, a young lady with much prestige. Even though the flaws of her character are questionable, her intentions are clear. Her role as a matchmaker during a unique time period creates a diversion from reality in the high social class where Emma resides. The encouragement by one lucky guess pushes her to create absolute non-sense. A reader only hopes to read faster in order to reveal and figure out the out come of all her mistakes. Emma hooks readers, addicting them to the humor and \\"tangled mess\\" in which she finds herself. This beautifully illustrated book quickly creates an exclusive impression every time it is read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"As with all of Austen's novels, the reader will find the breadth of human character within the cover. The novel demonstrates a biting wit as well as a sentimenal side. I first read this book when I was fifteen and I was absolutely captivated. If you have not read this book then you are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book was wonderfully uplifting and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely, and I believe you will as well, if you like amusing stories dealing with romance, confusion, friendship, matchmaking, and true love. Do not listen to some of the other reviews that say this book is a rip-off of Clueless. Obviously the people who posted those are incredibly ignorant, especially since Emma came out a very long time before Clueless, and if anyone was eligible to sue, it would be Jane Austen (if she was still alive) suing the makers of Clueless. Again, this was a very enjoyable book, and I would definately recommend it to anybody!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Actually, every Jane Austen is essential, so the title of this review is pretty unnecessary.I just finished Emma. I've had this book on my shelf for over a year, hesitant to read it because I've seen the movie (the Gwyneth version) about 100 times. I was worried that there would be no suspense in the book for me, having memorized the movie characters so well.I needn't have worried. Books are never the same as movies. I found even more to love about Emma as I read this book, and grew to like other characters (such as Jane Fairfax) more, and other characters, such as Frank Churchill less. While this book did not hold the suspense for me that Pride and Prejudice does (still!), it was nonetheless a great read and I can't wait to reread it next summer."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I am not normally a fan of this type of novel (hell, I read science fiction), but I read this book for an English AP class this summer, and I must say that I liked it. As a snapshot of English social life at the time it was written, it is faultless. The plot, while somewhat inconsequential by today's so-called &quot;standards&quot;, is entertaining, and leaves the reader in a state of suspense up 'till the conclusion. The dialogue is also very charming, witty, and definately a product of it's time, but relevant. There are novels throughout the history of literature that stand as epoches for certain time periods, and Emma can be realistically called one of them. It wraps up the early 19th century English social life period very well, and more realistically and less sense of being dated than Pride and Prejudice or some of Jane Austen's other novels (or those of her contemporaries.) If you like this type of novel it is a must read, or, if you're like me, it is something interesting to pick up when you want something different from what you usually read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this novel!! I'm also glad that before reading this novel I read Jane Austen's other famous works because I had practice with Austen's confusing vocabulary. Once I got used to it I was able to appreciate what was truly happening with Emma. I highly recommend this book to young girls that have a pedestrian outlook on love, because after reading this novel I learned that love isn't always about emotions but you have got to be sensible as well. Emma is a woman to be emulated, not because of her match-making attitude but of her convictions and strenght. She does not need a man to complete herself, but after finally allowing her eyes to open she does find bliss with the man she loves. I can go on and on about this novel, but then what would be the use of reading?? Get yourself a copy now! You won't regret it.."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This was a book that I 'tried' to read in 5th grade and fell asleep, now years later I decided to give it another shot. To my suprise, Emma was a delightful book. At times it may seem boring, but at those times I learned to savor the details that I did read. I thoroughly enjoyed all the characters and plot twists. Jane Austin is an absolutely amazing author! I do not reccomend this book to younger kids who have trouble reading or get bored easily, but it is perfect for teenagers and up, esspecially girls. :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Having been a devoted fan since early childhood, I have read all of Miss Austen's books at least twice, and I find this the most endearing. 'Emma' is a dazzling combination of wit, not-too-dreadful mishaps, mild drama, and affectionate, though insightful, looks at society.Emma, though a little petted and given to overconfidence in her intellect (brilliant people often struggle so), is definitely endearing (even more so than Gwyneth Paltrow). And, of course, Miss Austen's inventive method of relating dialogue is delightful. Of Mr. Woodhouse, the definitive hypochondriac: &quot;He was afraid they should have a very bad drive...He did not know what they had best do...&quot; Jane Austen has a splendid way of drawing the characters through such dialogue - it is almost as if they come alive.If you ever read one book of Miss Austen's, read 'Emma'!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I listened to this as an audio book which is a somewhat different experience than reading it. I often listen to books when I commute and this did keep me occupied for many miles. I appreciate much of Austen's writing and her interesting character portrayal. It's also very interesting to note the rigid social structure of that time and place. However if I had to have read this in print, I doubt that I would have gotten through it.As others have said, the central character, Emma, is just not very likable. She is very rich, very spoiled, an only child who was pampered by a governess and a highly indulgent father and is granted the highest respect from everyone in their town due to nothing but her fortunate social position. This is not a person who is plagued by self-doubt! She believes that she is the cleverest person around and has no qualms about manipulating others. When not manipulating, she is abundant in her very, very snobbish judgments of others. True, she matures somewhat in the year that the novel covers, repenting of her past misdeeds and promising to become a better person. Still it's too little/too late for my taste and I can only wonder that the \\"hero\\" who appears to be a candidate for sainthood, has chosen Emma as his beloved. I think he would have been better off with any of the other women in the novel.There are so many other novels of the period that far surpass this one; don't waste your time on Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"My first Jane Austen and I loved it!! A story of hope in a hopeless situation. The ending was a bit far fetched. All in all a delightful read that I will read again. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of Emma, is often very hard to like. She is spoiled, impulsive, conceited, and rich. However, Austen's writing is, as always, richly detailed, light-hearted, and sharp-witted, which makes this classic book a must-read for anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater, read women's or historical fiction, or dreamed of living in a time where women were oppressed but sure looked pretty doing it. If you read Austen in high school or when you were younger and found yourself bored to tears, I would suggest going back to give it another try. I read Pride and Prejudice when I was a young teen, and thought it was incredibly lame--who writes a romance without a long, passionate kiss? However, when I went back to Jane after watching a few of the movies, I found it surprisingly playful and humorous, with strong female and male characters, some excellent dramatic moments, and solid comic relief.Emma is definitely not my favorite Austen book. Emma is simply too manipulative and naive at the same time for me to really root for her or against her. But the quality of the writing alone is worth the trip. I've read this a few times now, and I always find something fresh in the dialogue, the observations, the interactions between female characters, and female and male characters. So, if it's been awhile, you're looking to read it for the first time, or you're simply looking for a well-written diversion, this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma was such a character who in my opinion, was a little bit too conceited - she had thought to know of the feelings of other people that made her feel very confident of her match-making skills; and yet, when these matches failed to be, she thought the failures were all her doing too! Just the same, as in any chick-lit novels, everything was well and as it should be towards the end.It took me almost three weeks to finish this book, and I questioned myself why. It just didn't have that pull on me that I sometimes found myself browsing the net rather than reading the book. It's always a struggle for me to read 18th century writings; I always have to go back and reread for a more thorough understanding of what's being said. This is my second book by Jane Austen, and I'm probably getting tired of all the ceremonious ways of her period. Still, I could not fault the writing, being from a long ago era and true to it; it also elicited \`hate and like' feelings towards the characters which is a sure indication of good literature...But still, I labored through it...so three stars to be fair to Ms. Austen and to myself."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well. During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions. She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her. However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person. She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination. I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures. Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates. But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.However, over all, I enjoyed this book. I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then. At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" isn't the most sophisticated or complex of Jane Austen's book but is my favorite by far. The characters, especially Emma, are funny and moving. I'm such a romantic and this is just delightfully fulfilling."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"EMMA\\" may very well be my favorite Austen novel :) \\"PERSUASION\\" may be a close second, or possibly a tie for first!Jane Austen was so witty and engaging.

How easy it has become to be \\"well read\\"!!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I purchased this copy of Emma and it was the first time I read it. The second Jane Austen I've read. I must say that I enjoyed Emma much more than Pride and Prejudice. I absolutely loved the humor in Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"By E.G. (AP)\\"Seldom, very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken...\\" This was a hard lesson for twenty-one year old Emma Woodhouse to come by. Emma takes on the role of a matchmaker, believing it is in her power to arrange marriages. Predictably, Emma eventually fails at her task. Failure causes Emma to lose innocence and become less ignorant to what in fact she can control.Emma is of a rich family; she's good looking, and she's clever. Emma is held in awe by most, especially her father who believes she is flawless. With such qualities and ideals at her disposal, Emma has very little to distress or vex her. The same circumstances convince her that she will never marry and promote naivete making reality a hard concept for Emma to grasp.Emma lacks knowledge of societal expectations especially where marriage is concerned. Taking place during the Victorian time period, one was expected to marry inside his class. Emma doesn't grasp this ideal which leads to failure and disappointment in her pursuit of making matches.Emma tries to acquaint Mr. Knightley with Harriet and to a certain extent, Jane. Emma discovers that she's once again led herself and Harriet astray. This instance in the book along with the knowledge that Mr. Knightley is one of few that can see faults in Emma, foreshadows an eventual change in plot. This is also the point in the story that a change in Emma's character becomes evident.When reading Emma, allow yourself plenty of time. There are many intricate details Involving who's interested in who that are interwoven into the plot and would be easy to pass by if not reading leisurely. It may be helpful to read a passage twice if you find yourself questioning what just took place. In order to fully enjoy the story; don't hurry through the book.A few of the characters have similar names. Sometimes the only thing separating one person from another is a subtle Miss or Ms. This can be frustrating if you don't fully grasp whom the book is speaking of. Again, read slowly and reread a passage if there's confusion about who the talked of subject is.Some characters are void of the story for an extensive amount of the book. This is also frustrating, as it may be hard to recall what role the character plays. It's beneficial to jot down character names and a few descriptors about them so when they reappear, their role can be recalled. Or, you may want to take time to flip back in the book and reread the scene in which they first appeared.Jane Austen did an exceptional job of writing satirically in order to portray silly ideals that Emma and society held. The standards for which marriages were arranged by become superficial and absurd through Austen's diction. Because it is apparent to the reader that Emma is chasing a dead end with her beliefs of who has taken interest in who, it's humorous when Emma comes to this realization herself. Austen chose exaggerated adjectives of perfection to describe Emma this creates a snicker because obviously Emma is not perfect but rather nave.Emma recalls memories of high school dance date set-ups that went wrong. It's comical to think back on either playing the role of matchmaker or having been the victim of a matchmaker when the quest for a date to the homecoming dance or prom is thrown into full effect. Most times the involvement of a third party misconstrues things much like Emma did. Feelings can be hurt similar to those of the characters in Emma making the matchmaker feel foolish but hopefully providing a lesson to all involved."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is a great story, the heroine, depicted to be a selfish woman, who has been raised to believe she has no flaws, shows us through the book, how she learns tobe a woman that many people would dream to be. She shows true nature, adn acts as any human would. Her ongoing task to matchmake all her friends end in disaster, but in the end all is well. She handles her problems as one should, adn learns not to think so highly of herself. People say that it is too &quot;worldy&quot; but the book is one of the classics, Jane Austen outdid herself, this is my favourite Jane Austen book, it shows us that we all have flaws,a d that no one is ever perfect."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I really thought this book was wonderful! It was the first Jane Austen book I've read and I loved it! It was easy for me to keep the characters staight because I saw the movie first but totally enjoyed it the book too. Most people who gave this book a bad review called it, &quot;boring&quot;. One thing you should know: Jane Austen is not a writer of action novels. She likes to spread the story out. For anyone who have read her other novels, you know what I mean. If you found this boring, you should wait until your a little older to read this one. Although I like P&amp;P better, this was definatly not a bad book if your in the right mode to read it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I love this book because it's timeless. True, it's set in the 1800's, but this book could have been written today. I know it's hard to sympathize with Emma, but deep down she just wants to see everyone happy. I love the part where she finds her own match right under her nose. I recommend this book to everyone who likes historical romances."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I'm just wondering what kind of a world those clueless people live in, to think Jane Austen is robbing some 90s movie of its story?"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"On a personal note I loved the book as I do all other Jane Austen classics, but I'm not going to trash anyone else's opinion. No one book can ever be loved by everyone. For other readers that enjoyed this as much as I did don't get upset when others don't like it, they just don't WANT to have to translate the different dialect from a different country over a century ago. It's not that they can't, but the more modern setting suits them better. It is true you do have to be a serious reader to get through this novel. If you loose hope in the first few chapters you're not giving it enough time, at this point you've just been introduced to the characters, dialect, and culture of these people. The first 4 or 5 chapters are the hardest, but that's because you're having to learn so much with out any aids to guide you. For everyone who did not enjoy this no one should scoff at your taste, but in the future don't trash mine either. We have different taste neither is betteror worse, just different. For anyone interested, yes, their is a plot but you have to understand Jane Austen's style to see it. If you like a challenge and you like to have your heart pounding in tune with the characters this is a book for you. Bye the way, I am now 16 but I read three of Jane Austen's novels as a freshmen in high school.

Dominating the novel is the character of Emma Woodhouse--vital, Interesting, complex, and predisposed to playing power games with other people's emotions. Austen called her a heroine &quot;no one but myself would like,&quot; but she endures as one of Austen's immortal creations. Charting how Emma's disastrous foray as a matchmaker precipitates a crisis in the small provincial world of Highbury, and in her own heart, this novel of self-deceit and self-discovery sparkles with intelligence, wit, and irony. In fact, as critics say,Emma is indeed a fine piece of work which was was written, surprisingly, by someone who lived a rather secluded life. It has all the Austen trademarks, as the constant concern over marriage and social status, which was a poignant and true characteristic of her time."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen was a truly gifted author whose simple stories, memorable characters, and insights into human nature make her writings as relevant today as they were in the early 1800's.Emma is the story of an attractive and fortunate young woman who has never had anything really bad happen in her life, and who believes herself to be much more wise and worldly than she actually is. For one who has led such a sheltered existence, never leaving home or intending to marry, Emma believes herself possessed of incredible powers of perception and feels that she knows what is best for those she loves far better than they could possibly know for themselves. It is this belief of hers that causes her to meddle in the affairs of those close to her, creating chaos, confusion, and misunderstandings everywhere. Her well-intentioned interference produes comical results and eventually teaches her a valuable lession about minding one's own beeswax.I was sorry to see this book end"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I have read few books written with such a brilliant pen. There is more than a touch of sarcasm when Austen writes of society, but this is perhaps what keeps this book so alive. It is surprising how little society has really changed since the Victorian era. Emma comes across as a spoilt child, but lovable, as there is a shade of Emma in all of us. We all share the need to be involved in everything, and meddle with everyone's affairs, and there is a tale of unrequited love in all of our histories, even for a short time.

There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line.

Emma was hard to sympathize with in the begining. She is naive, snobbish and presumptuous. By the end, however, I was praying for her and Knightley to get together. Austen is witty as usual. She is a wonderful narrator. You might wanna check out Pride and Prejudice, which I loved. Her writing is Romantic though, so if that's not your thing, you should think twice before picking up an Austen. She may be wordy, but her writing is by no means difficult to read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book was pretty good, but I didn't really get into it until about 2/3 of the way in.

Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best.

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma prides herself on her matchmaking ability. The happiness of the marriage of her former governess is her obvious proof. When she takes on Harriet Smith as her charge and determines to find the perfect match for her, her attempts fail time and time again. Disappointed in the outcome of her attempts, she resolves to only contribute to Harriet's happiness as her friend. In the end, when it seems that a match for Harriet may finally be made between Harriet and Mr. Knightley, only then does Emma realize the truth she has denied for so long and the folly of what she worked so hard for may cost her heart.Emma is a classic by Jane Austen and this is my first time reading one of Austen's works. I certainly understand why the book is considered a classic. Austen engages the reader who wonders about the outcome until the very end. The style in which it is written requires thought and time to truly understand the story. It is definitely not one that can be read through at a high speed and still comprehended at a high level.

Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious. Since she has lived nearly twenty-one years with very little to distress or vex her, carefree Emma spends her time match-making for her friends. But when she undertakes the office of matching pretty, but not very bright Harriet Smith with the local Vicar she gets more than she bargains for.The characters are rich and consistent, and Austen again gives us, the ridiculous; mr. woodhouse, Miss Bates. The scoundrel who pretends to be an angel of light;Frank Churchill. The concerned friends; Mrs. Weston, Mr. knightly. Then there is Emma, who belongs in a class of her own. She is the most fortunate, yet the most flawed Austen heroine, which flaws only endear her all the more. And in the end they pay off, when she falls in love with someone as imperfect as herself.The language and diolouge are as shining, bright, and charming as the characters themselves. Overall this novel can do nothing but please, just as Austen's novels before and after Emma show. A must-read for Austen fans."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Wonderful!

Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are among the best, wrongly taking credit for pairing her governess Miss Taylor with their neighbor Mr.Weston.

I had seen the movie, but I wanted to read the book, too. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; not only that, but I would thouroughly recommend it to others, because I loved it that much!!! I was appaled to read the reviews of the 1 and 2 star people. I can see that these people don't read very much at all and only, say, Babysitter's Club Books or some crap like that. I know that a lot of people hate reading in general and so, therefore could not possibly comprehend a wonderful novel like Emma. They obviously don't recognize classic literature when they &quot;read&quot; it! I liked this book because of the wonderful characters. I especially liked Mr.Knightely! Jane Austen is a wonderful author and I'm working on my 3rd book by her, which I'm really enjoying!! If you enjoy reading REAL literature, I would certainly recommend Emma, by Jane Austen!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I, like several other people who responded, have half a brain and taste in literature and therefore greatly enjoyed this novel. Not only does it have excellent plot, amusing dialogue, and a happy ending but it also lends a great amount of insight into this time in history. I am 18 years old and have read this book several times, surprisingly enough before any films were released, and can honestly say that it was my favorite novel ever written. Obviously those who only gave it one or two stars are more at home reading such low class literary works as Stephen King novels, which certainly have more excitement but don't actually require any real thought. I don't believe that the responses of such people to real literary works would really have any true value in my opinion since they quite apparently have no real intelligence or taste in literture whatsoever. My advice to such people would be to avoid real books and to stick to what they are actually capable of understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I've always been a fan of the British actress Prunella Scales and already own some of her readings of classic novels, including Cranford which she handles delightfully.So it was a big disappointment to find that she seems to have completely misjudged her narration of Emma. One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature. How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel. However, after reading the first chapter, I put it down to go onto a different novel. A few months and a few novels passed and I again picked it up to try again. History does, indeed, repeat itself. Another chapter down, I went to another novel.Finally, after owning the book for 8 months, I decided it was time to just do it. So, I refused to allow myself to put it down again for another novel. It took me about twelve chapters to become involved in any character besides Mr. Knightly and to enjoy the story... but it did come.Had I reviewed this book before chapter 12, I would have said, &quot;No way... this book is too slow and long winded!&quot; However, after finishing it, I appreciate the author and the story more than I did before.I will say this much, however: I have discovered that I am a reader of Charlotte Bronte, but a viewer of Jane Austin movies adapted to film."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece. Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I think most people are already familiar with the story of Emma, and many are probably also familiar with the back-story, which is that Jane Austen decided to write about a character which she thought \\"nobody but myself will much like.\\" I dare say there are plenty of people who indeed do not like Emma Woodhouse, but I have loved plenty of books, TV shows, and movies centered on a character I disliked (or even hated) far more than Emma, whose faults do not, at least, include witlessness, stupidity, or true ugliness of character.Added to Emma's attractiveness as a protagonist and other well-rounded characters that we may love or hate, is Jane Austen's excellent prose and story plotting, and, most importantly, her cutting humor and social commentary. Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Her mother has died and she lives with her father and her governess. Her family is at the very top of social standings in town, and Emma is all too aware of it. The starting point is her governess's engagement to a good man, which Emma imagines she has engineered by herself. Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book is light-hearted and fun to read if you have a decent attention span. Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better. All in all, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I also expected more, but i liked it a lot. And yes, it is for serious readers (you cant read Jane Austen if youre not one). Is funny and I liked Emma a lot. Although mr. Knightley was too old :p But is great. You must read it."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself. I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is a touching, comeing of age story. It is about a young girl who is close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for?

Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one.

(Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Be warned: this book is slow. very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed. She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom. Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. it just could have been much shortened."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"This was the first time I had \\"read\\" Emma. What have I been missing? This is a beautiful book, and beautifully read in this CD version. I don't think literature gets any better than this. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during English class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching.

In her first page, she suggests that the young Emma has perhaps had her own way in things too often. In her first chapter, we learn that Emma credits herself with having arranged the fortunate marriage of her governess to a wealthy neighbor, and believes herself more than ready to manage the social affairs of her hometown of Highbury.\\"Emma\\" is perhaps Jane Austen's most delicious romantic comedy, built around the match-making attempts of Miss Woodhouse, and the mangled relationships and social disasters that ensue. Although Emma means well, she ignores the advice of her good older friend Mr. Knightley to leave well enough alone, begining with her attempts to raise up the social status of her friend Harriet Smith. In the end, amid the ruins of her plans, Emma may face some difficult choices, and a fateful but priceless conversation with Mr. Knighley about her future.The comedy ripples through every chapter. Austen's supporting cast is well-chosen and well-written; this is a fun novel, and much more than a comedy of manners.

However, she changes slowly (as opposed to the ever upsetting sudden growth that happens so often in other books) and even finds the classic romance of her own. Austin has a way of depicting things that describe so much more than she says. By the end I loved Emma, and even her most annoying companions.

This story not only lacks any action or plot of sorts but insists on spending copious amounts of pages on meaningless blabber. I had to make a summary of the novel. It took only 1 page. My teahcer could not criticise my summary. I had covered EVERYTHING in the novel! I found Emma to be one of the most irritating characters ever created, for those who boldly state she is the greatest 'heroine', I will say, Joan of Ark was a heroine, Mary mother of Jesus was a heroine, Mother Teresa was a heroine, EMMA is a pretentios, self absorbed, controling, spoilt, BORING individual and should be left in her time and not studied in ours.

If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences.

Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old.

I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma complete illustrated novel by Jane AustenAusten's witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful.

It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma (Summer Classics)","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans. Filled with the wit, the scandal, the light-hearted fun and the 17th century morals we have come to expect.

Not her best work but worth a read."},{"Title":"Advanced Option Pricing Models","review":"Katz's book on Advanced Options Pricing offers traders additional insight into limitations and errors found in traditional pricing models. For those of us that write mechanical options trading systems, particularly combination models, Jeff's book is a must read. If you are an options price researcher looking for in depth advanced pricingmodel discovery, analysis and mathematics, this book is probably not for you. However, if you are looking at ways to improve your existing models thus converging the error between empirically derived options system equity curves and those equity curves derived from options models, you should read this book. As most traders know, efficient entry and exit points in the market often occur during periods when pricing models break down, so the more you can learn about options behavior during this transient period, the better your overall trading system will be."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"The recipes in this cook book are truly exceptional.

The only caveat would be for folks who don't have access to a good asian grocery store to find the ingredients or those who don't have the patience to do detailed prep work.

When you make something from a recipe in this book, it will taste like the dish you tried at his restaurant (assuming you can find the same quality of ingredients of course). Nobu is beyond generous to share his trade secrets with the rest of us in this gorgeous well written relatively easy to follow book. I keep it on my kitchen counter! Remember, making sushi requires time, time to develop the skills. There is no substitute for lessons and practice (along with the proper tools and most importantly the ability to acquire and discern quality sushi/sashimi fish), but this book can have you eating the genius of Nobu at home!"},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"Wonderful plate presentations.

I was truly amazed by the quality of the dishes and his creativity. Hence, I was more than excited to learn that he had a cookbook.This book is made for cooks of all levels. All the techniques and ingredients are thoroughly explained and the recipes are complicated enough to make interesting dishes. Nobu Matsuhisa also lets you into his life and accomplishments. Quite impressive!I also liked the list of Japanese grocerie stores available by neighborhood. I went to one, Mitsuwa, and was really impressed with the quality of the fish.I'm very glad I got this book. I'm still gonna stop by Matsuhisa every time I'm in LA but now, I can impress my guests with a &quot;Nobu&quot; dish."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"Nobu's food is very tasty. I've eaten there once several years back. This book contains some of his signature dishes (at least at the time). My impression, though, is that this book is more a piece of marketing for a celebrity chef with outlets in several countries. We get to know that De Niro likes a special dish and we can then try that dish when we visit his restaurant.Nobu is basically doing fish in a very Japanese manner but with the introduction of ingredients from the west. I'm sure that he has a credibility problem in Japan so he has put in sections to show he knows his stuff, e.g. how to fillet an eel the traditional way, with the traditional knife, etc.Even though Nobu is cooking Japanese style, don't expect to learn much about Japanese high-end cooking from this book. Japanese high-end is much more traditional. For instance the flavours are more subtle. In my view you are actually better of learning some of the Japanese traditional cooking first. Then you might want to get this book to see how a creative mind has done something with it. Without that basis, I would say that this book is just the standard celebrity chef marketing. But I wonder how many would actually go down that route. The first hurdle is the availability of English language cookbooks in the high end (but there are a few). The second hurdle is the availability of fresh fish and other ingredients. Original ingredients are so important. You need the expensive Japanese Spinach instead of the standard western spinach for examples.The books is between two and three stars only."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"If you are quite experience in the kitchen, you should be able to follow the recipes.

We have all of the Nobu cookbooks and have used the recipes in all of them. We haven't used all of the recipes, just some from all. Just as we haven't used all of the recipes from all of our other cookbooks, it holds the same here. I can tell you that we've been able to find some of the more exotic items and have created a few of the specialty (well, special to us) dishes with great results!The photographs do the food justice. I'm not interested in the name dropping, it's not the reason I purchased the set of cookbooks as well, so that part of the reading is \\"whatever\\" for us.As far as the sushi goes, practice and a good set of knives makes all of the difference for cutting the sushi and sashimi.

This was a very good transaction, thank you"},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"I love the local L.A. Nobu restaurants (Matsuhisa and Ubon), and I enjoyed the book from a purely entertainment perspective. The photographs are beautiful, and I found some of the recipes to be fairly do-able. However, it is noteworthy to mention that quite a few ingredients are difficult if not impossible to find in the U.S., even at Japanese specialty markets (Nobu himself admits that he included recipes that have &quot;many ingredients that can only be found in Japan.&quot;). These are interesting, but I don't make it to Japan often enough to be able to whip these dishes up for my dinner parties.Another thing I found somewhat annoying was all of the Hollywood name-dropping the book is peppered with. I don't really care which celebrities have dined in the various Nobu restaurants, nor do I care what their favorite dishes are. The fact that Nobu once made lunch for Princess Di was equally unimportant to me. The thing I really appreciated was learning more about the quality and &quot;kokoro&quot; (heart) that goes into some of the dishes I've enjoyed at Matsuhisa. The book definitely inspired me to go and eat there again soon!"},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"'nobu THE cookbook' by Nobuyuki Matsuhisa is Nobu's first cookbook and as he has a new title on the bookstands now, I thought it was high time I got around to reviewing it.For starters, I must say I rank photographic flash way down on my list of criteria for a good cookbook. I have very little use for cookbooks used to grace a coffee table, since I have no coffee table. So, If impressive looking cookbooks from famous chefs is your cup of tea, then this is an excellent book. Otherwise, it doesn't do a lot for me.For starters, while the book deals almost exclusively with fish cookery and raw fish dishes, the introductory material on techniques, especially knife techniques is pretty thin. The story on sushi prep is that it takes years to learn everything you need to know about good knife techniques, and we are given but a half a page without even some pictures of the types of knives used in the three techniques described.I will say that most of the recipes are relatively simple, as long as you have the right skills, but the ingredients for a lot of the dishes are somewhere between difficult and impossible to find. The poster boy for this state of affairs is abalone. Throughout my whole life, I have never seen fresh abalone available on the east coast fishmonger's counter. Now, I suspect this Pacific shellfish is endangered almost to the point of extinction. But, as Bob Kinkaid so eloquently says in his cookbook, high end restaurants can get things which are simply beyond the reach of the average shopper.If this were a book on classic Japanese cookery, I would have a higher opinion of it, but it is a song to the virtues of Nobu Matsuhisa. It is a very pretty song, well graced with paeons from business partner Robert DeNiro, best bud, Martha Stewart, and about twenty testimonial blurbs from the culinary greats.If your thing is good books on and about celebrity chefs, buy this book. But, if your interest is Japanese cooking in general, start with Shizuo Tsuji's 'Japanese Cooking, A Simple Art'."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"While many of the recipes we have tried from this book have produced excellent results, it is not for the novice nor for the cook who cannot find exotic ingredients. We live in the San Francisco Bay area and must make special trips to the Asian seafood markets because the local grocer, although high-end, does not carry the exotic varieties of fish and shellfish that he uses. He does not offer suggestions for substitutions.The food is very good, but you can tell that this is definitely a vanity cookbook. I don't think most home chefs could use this book - it is definitely for the obsessive foodie who would go to any lengths to prepare his recipes. Good for special occasions or for those who have a lot of time and resources for foods."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"After sampling a variety of creations at Nobu-London, I was thrilled to receive this cookbook. However, in the hours between receiving it and reading it, I pondered the seemingly inevitable: I thought I'd be let down, and would discover a shallow book assembled by the Nobu marketing staff.My passing qualms were misplaced, and I couldn't be more pleased. The writing is lucid, the book readable, the advice welcome and reasonable, the recipes clear, and the range of dishes exciting. Already, I've made 2 superb appetizers, and have a main course marinating in the fridge. Other dishes are to come. My spouse, a non-sushi-eater until a few years ago, has glowed about the dishes sampled thus far, and is anticipating many more soon.This is not anybody's main cookbook (or even in the main set), but should accessorize any amateur chef's collection when in the mood for fusion food and inspired/inspiring combinations."},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"I am a big fan of Nobu's art; a miraculously simple, yet greatly inventive Japanese-Peruvian cuisine.This book gives a representative sample of what Nobu's is capable of.- RECIPES: step-by-step, easy to follow, and do not require sophisticated equipment. The pictures are nice and self-explanatory. In fact, Nobu's trademark dishes (New Style Sashimi, Tiraditos and Ceviches) are quite easy to reproduce with little effort or time. The only reason why I did not give this book a perfect mark is that I felt some sauces missed the mark, as if they were lacking an ingredient (my Matsuhisa Dressing trials greatly differ from the one I tasted in Nobu's restaurants). Plus, on rare occasions, the editor fails to specify which type of vegetable oils must be used (ex: in the spicy creamy sauce).- INGREDIENTS: many are easy to find in North America. Some are almost impossible to acquire if you do not live in a major city (for example Maui onions, sansho, etc.). Nevertheless, most of these ingredients can be successfully substituted with more common ingredients; for example, Menegi for Chives, Yuzu for lemon and lime juice, Monkfish liver for Duck or Goose Foie Gras, and so on.Like other viewers, I couldn't care less if Kenny G., Gandhi or Rasputin have been Nobu's clients.

They used an eight colour separation process (absurdly expensive) for all the fish pictures, and try as you might you can't really see the dots that compose the image, at least not without a magnifying glass.Nobu's aim is to proudly lay himself open to his public. He doesn't fear revealing his secrets because he's confident enough to know his style and character are unique to him. He wants to inspire amateur chefs.Here are three of the simpler dishes that anyone could make.1) Sea urchin in a shiitake mushroom cap, wrapped in steamed spinach, served on an egg sauce with a spoonful of salmon roe2) Asparagus topped with salmon roe3) Steamed monkfish liver with caviarAs the saying goes, the media is the message and the pictures actually help the amateur chef no end. With the superb pictures that accompany the recipes, you can execute these dishes almost from the name of the recipe alone. Without the pictures, you can't.One caveat. Nobu is a name dropper. I've no doubt that Robert De Niro, Martha Stewart, Ken takakura, and Linda Evans really are his friends but he mentions famous names too often for my taste. On the other hand when I went to Nobu Tokyo during Nobu week, he was there and toured the dining room. He stopped by our table and signed a copy of his book for me. So he's not too proud to smile and have chat with us rabble; he really likes his customers.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Nobu: The Cookbook","review":"I bought this book because it is one of the only cookbooks I have found to contain recipes for Monkfish Liver (Ankimo), which I have frequently been in search of. I haven't tried any of the other recipes, although anyone who does must be prepared to go on some serious hunting missions for some hard-to-find ingredients. Also, I too was put off by Nobu's shameless name dropping-- why do Kenny G, Madonna and other celeb quotes get more of a spotlight than Ducasse, Keller and other major chefs?

Even fewer competently navigate all the way to a believable ending. Kristin Hannah gets five stars from me for coming through on both counts. Both her hero and heroine are in a world of pain from their pasts. They are relationship cripples. The story revolves around their halting steps toward wholeness and each other. Their process is psychologically complex and believable. Add to that a nifty time travel element and a little magic - and you have a compelling story. As an author, I was especially fascinated by the book's theory on writing and reincarnation. It gave me goose bumps! A word of warning: this book is dark. If you're looking for a light, bubbly read - forget it. Rape and abuse are not subjects for the squeamish. But for those readers looking for depth and compassion in a storyline, this book is worth it!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"\\"When Lightning Strikes\\" definitely struck a chord with me.The basic plot of the book is as follows. Alaina (Lainie) Costanza is a romance writer, but she's no wimpy, frou-frou darling. Nope, she chain-smokes, drinks on occasion, wears tacky outfits, and is generally a hell-raiser. There are reasons for her behavior I'll get to in a moment; suffice it to say that only two things are keeping her together at this point: her writing talent, and her teenage daughter, Kelly.John Killian is an outlaw, a former Texas Ranger who feels like he's lost everything. His wife died years ago and he couldn't save her; once that happened, he felt his soul rip apart, and decided to live down to his reputation. Now he's the leader of a notorious bunch of outlaws.How do these two relate? It's not as simple as it appears at first. At first, Lainie gets thrown back from her time (early 1990s) to Killian's time (late 1800s); Killian isn't exactly overjoyed to see her. Lainie is in a state of shock at first, thinking it's all a dream.But it's not.Instead, Lainie finds out slowly that Killian is her soulmate. And that she, in an earlier life, was the wife that left him alone. And as she and Killian learn to trust each other again, they overcome nearly insurmountable problems.Item 1: Lainie was gangraped at least once. Used to do drugs. Her parents abandoned her, and the foster system didn't work. Her daughter is the result of the rape; she kept her daughter and loves her, which shows enormous strength of character. (As if being creative and reaching for her dreams wasn't enough strength for anyone; well, this is a romance, and I suppose this is a bigger \\"hook\\" to grab the reader.)Item 2: Killian was a Texas Ranger, as I said before, and was a very good law enforcement officer. He was married to Emily (Lainie's previous incarnation), and was sent off on a mission to Mexico. While there, he got thrown in jail; she waited for a long time, then, (perhaps after being raped and abused herself because her husband was gone -- she lived on the Texas frontier alone), ended up killing herself. That's how John became a villain; he felt like he must be one, because his beloved wife had left him like that. And he blamed himself for being thrown in jail, and couldn't forgive himself.Both characters are looking for salvation, and in this book, they find it. In each other, granted, but that's what they needed. Both needed a second chance with the other, to be able to love and be loved in return. They get that chance through an unusual twist; they don't want to give it up, yet if Lainie doesn't return to the 20th century, Kelly will be put in foster care -- and Lainie knows all about _that_.So, she and Killian believe it's a choice between love of parent for child and love for each other, and both make love to each other with a sadness that is palpable. Instead of being joyous, they are miserable; they know this is all they are ever likely to have. Yet, how could they pass it up?How Ms. Hannah brought off the obligatory happy ending is up to you to find out; I will say that I enjoyed it and found it reasonably realistic. (I still wonder, though, how Killian found the 20th century, what he found to do, how Lainie was able to get him the ID she'd so blithely talked about, and what Kelly thought of him. This book demands a sequel.)So, even though some of the historical details one of the editorial reviews talked about were missing (Lainie doesn't spend much time on detail; she does talk about what the men wear and a lot about the scenery), this book deserves five stars. For more than one reason; it's not every book that shows that love, even a love like this, can be funny, sexy, sweet, poignant, and sad, all by turns.Yet love, in real life, _is_ like this. And that is why I'd give \\"When Lightning Strikes\\" five stars.Two more things. The character of Viloula is wonderful; check her out. She might live in the late 1800s, but she's a modern woman indeed, and I believed fully in her characterization. Also, Ms. Hannah is to be commended for how she writes her love scenes; the dialogue and description crackles with life, and it shows exactly how Lainie loses what barriers she has left and surrenders to love. And to herself.Highly recommended. And by far the best book Ms. Hannah has ever written."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"When Lightening Strikes, is a great time travel/fantasy romance story by Kristin Hannah. Alaina Costanza is thrown back into time, captured into the latest romance story she is writing. Unbeknownst to Alaina, her villain character, Killian, is actually her soul mate, reaching across time and space to Alaina to rectify the loss and love in both of their lives in the late 1870's.I thought the concept was ingenious and really enjoyed this book of time-travel! I also found it interesting that Hannah picked out several elements from her book, The Enchantment, and used those elements in this book! I thought it very clever!Hannah once again paints a heroine who is strong and determined, with supporting characters that are as equally believable. The reader is immediately drawn into the story, and I thought that the story line moved great! This is the last book of Hannah's that I had left to read, and it, too, did not disappoint me.Kristin Hannah has quickly become one of my favorite authors due to her ability to draw the reader intensely into the heart and plot of the story, with believable and true to life characters. Her love stories are warm and sensitive, with the heroine able to overcome obstacles in her life, and embrace love once again. I have found that all of Hannah's books contain messages of struggle, hope and love. And as always, once you fall in love with the characters in her books, you are dying for a sequel!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I have really liked all of Hannah's books and I couldn't get through this one fast enough. It was awful. The subject was good, but all the rest just seemed like she was trying to fill pages. I am still a big fan of hers, I just didn't like this one."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"When I got this book out of the library I was so enthralled after reading it that I had to buy my own copy, instantly (thanks Barbara's Books!).The emotional tone is darker than most romances, but sometimes this is good. The heroine is a former junkie turned romance writer, a bitter single mother whose sole joy is her teenage daughter. When a storm strikes, our heroine is surprised to find herself in the western world of her latest novel - and kidnapped by the sexy outlaw villain! Is it a dream, or has she really gone back in time...The next time someone derides romances as being full of silly plots, bland heroes and vapid heroines I will be sure to throw this book at them (gently of course!)."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I must tell you, I almost didn't finish reading this book. I was about a third of the way through and found the characters to be abrasive and unappealing and the pace too slow. I finished the book this morning and ended up sobbing through about the last third of the book! Somewhere along the way it absolutely grabbed me and pulled me in. This author has a wonderful way with words. Her discriptions are amazing. It was one of my favorite time travel stories."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"Everything she writes is pure gold, I've read every book she's released and can't wait to get a hold of Fly Away!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"This book is beyond crap. I felt like my IQ dipped while reading it. As much as I love Kristin Hannah's more recent novels, When Lightning Strikes was issued in 1994 and, unfortunately, is NOTHING like her thought provoking, intelligent recent works. This book by Hannah is pure 100% romance novel and as such is full of the kind of mindless obtuse drivel associated with that genre. The narration throughout is a confusing mind numbing endless torrent of wishy washy back-and-forth thinking, and obsessive compulsive analyzing and over-analyzing on both Lainie and Killian's part. The female protagonist, Lainie, was freakishly schizophrenic, unsexy, unattractive and, frankly, it concerned me that this woman was a mother. This book is full of W-T-F! such as Lanie is a 35 year old woman who underwent years of therapy yet has no self esteem and is still an emotional cripple. She is supposedly a survivor of rape yet she has slept with \\"thousands of men.\\" That doesn't sound like a victim of rape to me. She is supposed to be street smart yet she attempts an escape by \\"walking\\" out into the blistering desert instead of taking a horse. I honestly wished Lainie's character would disappear and leave poor Killian (the male romantic interest) alone so he could be a regular guy and ride off into the sunset free of all the female crazy that was imposed on him. In the literary romance genre the male romantic interest projects what the author (and reader) wants him to think and feel. Having a female author \\"describe\\" what a man is thinking can be a tricky task which if not handled with a degree of realism can insult the reader's intelligence. Unfortunately, such is the case here. Killian is unconvincing and blatantly contrived. In real life men do not agonize neurotically over things like women do nor are they wishy-washy. If they did and if they were, well, men would be women. Maybe that's part of the allure of romance novels -- the men are physically men but emotionally women. Consequently, some readers can have their cake and eat it too. Me, I like men to be men. I want them to think and act like men even when they're fictitious. Killian's character is also either deeply religious or he has Tourette's Syndrome because he constantly and endlessly repeats the phrase \\"Jesus, Lainie!\\" I'm betting on Tourette's. The \\"sex scenes\\", although erotic and well written are long and drawn out (literally page after page) and are almost comical given the main characters are so flakey and unsexy. I usually breeze through Ms. Hannah's novels but not this one. When Lightning Strikes was an absolute unpleasant chore to read. I have recommended many of Hannah's novels but this one gets a major thumbs down from me. Thankfully Hannah has matured and evolved in her writing and has proven she can do much better. I STRONGLY encourage readers to invest in her more recent novels and to skip this one. It is THAT bad."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I had a difficult time getting \\"into\\" this story. In fact, I never did enjoy much of anything about it. Sorry, Kristin. I finally gave up & just put it on my bookshelf, mostly unread."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"Let me say that I love a good time-travel romance.Alaina \\"Lainie\\" and Killian each have scarred pasts. They meet up when Lainie finds herself in 1896 Arizona. Unfortunately for half the book she considers herself dreaming. Of course, Killian thinks she might be crazy but there is a pull between the two of them with plenty of tension. I would have enjoyed seeing a smoother transition of their love for each other. Their relationship is bumpy and I was surprised that Killian considered letting his men have their way with her.I can't put a handle on Ms. Hannah's books yet since this is only my second one that I've read of hers. It seems like there is plenty of promise when the books start out but everything should flow smoother. I would still consider reading other books of hers; I am just hoping that her writing style will improve."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I've read many of Kristin Hannah's books and enjoyed most of them. This was a total flop, in my opinion. Trying to be serious, it was almost comical and I had a hard time finishing it. Hannah has a very unique style, but missed the mark with this one."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I love time-travel romances and this was definitely a good one. I just finished reading it and enjoyed it so much I came here to look the author up. The book is quite interesting all the way through. It has an interesting storyline and is well-written. It left a few questions unanswered that I would have liked answered (like how the heroin knew some of the things that she knew) but I still consider it a very good book worth reading. I wish there was a sequel."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"Theirs is the kind of love every woman dreams about whether she admits it or not. To love and be loved completely, across time, no matter the barriers, to change the past, thus changing the future, it boggles the mind and it takes a very special writer, story teller, to make it believable, and Kristin Hannah does it as if retelling her own story. Brovo Ms Hannah. One of my all time favorite time-travel romances, and one that I plan to keep and read again, and again and again.................."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"This is not your standard romance, not even your standard time travel romance. It is also not a light and frothy read. It is is an unusually strong, quite dark, very passionate roller coaster ride.Its strength is not is plotting - which has a nice unique twist - but its characterisation. I have read many, many romances, and not found two lovers like these. They are people with crippling pasts, of abuse and genuine regret, who meet each other, and somehow, find it in themselves to trust once more. The romance feels genuine and compelling. There is humour, grit and grace here, and I felt touched by a genuine sense of love and the possiblity of miracles.A definite keeper.Edited to add that I just reread it again in Nov 2009 and still love it. It hasn't dated, and the characters search for redemption really is moving. I really enjoyed spending time with them."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I really thought from the reviews that I would enjoy this book.

Halfway through it fizzled out for me and I just didn't care even to skim to the end to find out what happened."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"This book was more than I was expecting!The author gave the characters very believable 'real' images, not fantasy characters.

It really makes you believe that the impossible is possible!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"Haven't read it yet but know I'll love it..Looking forward to reading it. Can't wait..I know it will be the best"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"While I liked the book, I couldn't help wondering how these characters would live together at the end. I have read several of Kristin Hannah's books and have always had a sense of the life ahead for the lovers. In this case, I was left uncertain. As always she gives us characters that are out of the ordinary for the genre. They have problems and have experienced loss, yet they will always take risks to become better people. It is that quality in Kirstin's character developement and her strong narrative that pulls the reader into her stories. I'm a fan and hope you will be as well, though I must admit this novel isn't as stunning as all her others."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"When Lightning Strikes is not your average time-traveling romance. It introduces you to two very interesting and unique characters. Alaina Costanza (Lainie), an edgy, wise-cracking romance writer with a rough past, and John Killian, or just Killian as he is mainly known, the villian from the historical western she is in the midst of writing. So when she gets struck by lightning, she gets way more than she bargained for!This book made me laugh, and at the same time it pulled at my heart. The chemistry between the two leads and their fighting that attraction was realistic and heartwrenching. Even though this is a romance, I was unsure of how it was going to end, it was a real nail-biter! I couldn't finish soon enough, and when I did, it left me feeling fulfilled. I couldn't recommend this book more!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"I do not recommend this book. It started out pretty good but fizzeled out fast. The middle was very slow and the ending was soft. I kept reading in hopes of it getting better but was sorely dissapointed."},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"After reading other wonderful time travel stories by other authors, I was excited to come across this one. What a disappointment. While the first 1/3 of the book kept my interest, after that it was a struggle to even go on with it. I ended up just skimming the pages to get through it. At first, it was interesting with the time travel and her confusion with the whole thing. After that, tho, it just got old. I didn't find the characters interesting, and I felt like it was just the same drama repeated page after page. I got tired of her crying. Do yourself a favor, and spend you money on &quot;Knight In Shining Armour.&quot; THAT is a great time travel story!"},{"Title":"When Lightning Strikes","review":"Two plots unwind and they are both unbelievable. This highly stylized novel lacks credibility all around. Unlike a novel like \\"D'entre les Morts\\" written by Pierre Boileau where plots elements push beyond the envelope, Boileau still told the story with credibility and that is what made it work. This novel fails in that respect and is relegated to nothing more than kinship to typical glossy romance novels. All gloss and no substance."},{"Title":"The Gendered Atom: Reflections on the Sexual Psychology of Science","review":"This book is another in the postmod or feminist genre which tries to argue that notions of \`truth', \`objectivity' and \`universality'--indicative of scientific knowledge--are to be questioned. Why these notions are to be questioned is due to the assumption that the knowledge, theories and presuppositions held by scientists (who historically, and at present, are predominantly male), have been pervaded by socio-cultural biases and in the case of gender, by a male gender bias. It's not that males outnumber females in the scientific establishment, but that theories, concepts, hypotheses, research directions and even presuppositions are completely pervaded by a male gender psychological bias; a bias that, according to feminists, gets established in the male at the pre-Oedipal phase of development. The male--having to make a separate break with the mother--acquires a \\"separate self\\" with traits that reflect that separation: autonomous, separate, isolated, self-determining, rigid, insensitive, competitive, aggressive, objective, etc. For females, the separation is different in that traits like, intimacy, emotion, influence of Other, compassion, community, sensitivity, nurturing, receptivity, sympathy--what is called the \\"self-in-relation\\" develops.Where the author sees male traits biasing the investigation into the origin of matter is the whole notion of classical atomism; a reductionist programme of searching for the fundamental building blocks of nature. He notes that feminists see a striking correspondence between atomism and the psychological persona of the stereotypical male. These traits supposedly pre-filter and bias how they see and generate suppositions and theories about the basic stuff of the world. So atoms are then seen as separate, autonomous, individual, other, inanimate, cold, non-relational, solid, fundamental objects whose mechanical motions in the spacial void are subject to impersonal and universal laws. What male scientists declare are universal and objective are really projections of their own male-based, biased unconscious.Roszak makes a further case for his claims by showing that recent developments in physics and mathematics (chaos theory, complexity, emergence and quantum mechanics) have overturned the notion of the classical atom (which never existed in the first place according to him) and have gone beyond the reductionist programme of trying to reveal nature's most fundamental units. These new developments are part of the recent sea-change occurring in the sciences where \`deep community,' \`relatedness,' \`complexity,' \`communication,'--all stereotypical feminine characteristics--are behind these new non-reductive fields of inquiry.Here are some problems with the book's arguments. First off, virtually all the new developments that the author cites as part of that paradigm shift in the sciences such chaos theory, complexity, and emergence or even quantum mechanics, have been single-handedly authored by men.Secondly, seeing a correspondence between atomism and the supposed male persona does not establish causation. It does not follow that because the scientific enterprise is supposedly \`stereotypically' male that theories of matter will also be \`stereotypically male'. Atomism arose to try to answer the problem about how small stuff could be continually divided; it had nothing to do with being macho. Atomism was one of a number of theories of matter that a few Greeks held to be true; whereas, a much greater number of Greek philosophers had different and incompatible theories to atomism.Thirdly, the classical atom did exist and was necessary in the explanation behind Dalton's theory of quantitative chemistry, Boyle's law, Bernoulli's kinetic theory of gases, Clerk Maxwell's contributions to thermodynamics Clausius' atomic theory of heat and Boltzmann's statistical mechanics. In 1905, Einstein explained Brownian motion by assuming that a large number of atoms--colliding with pollen grains--made them move about randomly. Yet Einstein developed the quintessential relational and complex theory called general relativity where time, space, energy and mass are all interrelated. Newton, a devout classical atomist, created a theory that is an exemplar of relatedness and complexity where everything is attracted to everything else: universal gravitation. Faraday developed the concept of the electromagnetic field (and speculated that all phenomena are interrelated) and Clerk Maxwell gave this electromagnetic field its mathematical formalism. Mendeleev ordered atoms by increasing atomic number and in a periodic manner.Lynn Margulis and Barbara McClintock are cited as examples of cooperation, communication and empathy in biology. But it is a cliche to say that men see competition and women see cooperation. One could find many examples to the contrary in science. And saying that women who see competition have adopted the male gender bias in their respective field is simply ad hoc explaining away of evidence to the contrary (the footnote about female sociobotanists). In biology, one can find as many examples of male biologists seeing cooperation as competition. Reciprocal altruism, ESS strategies, kin selection, group selectionism, biogeography, ecology, prisoner's dilemma strategy, etc., are all concepts originated by men. There are as many women Darwinists as there are male Darwinists.On page 132, the author reverses his position by noting that the history of science has been an attempt to search ever deeper into the various domains of nature where we are finding an increasing complexity, subtlety and rich set of relationships. I would say this reads not unlike a process of learning how to read, play chess, or learn chemistry, etc. where the subject starts by learning the letters, the \`atoms' of the discipline then larger \`words', followed by still larger complexes and behavior. If this is so, then gender bias is irrelevant as it applies to the notion of atomism and science. The only sea-change in the sciences is the move to the complexity level in understanding nature. If physics was women-dominated, I would say that it would go through the same stages of theorizing and experimentation--starting from the four elements, to atoms, to leptons and quarks.Sometimes the book reads like one big indictment against the scientific enterprise--especially when it comes to environmental destruction. But all these accusations are misplaced as the author repeatedly refers to the application of science, not science proper. Frankenstein (mentioned throughout the book) may be a critique about applying science; but it says absolutely *nothing* about science."},{"Title":"The Gendered Atom: Reflections on the Sexual Psychology of Science","review":"From my experience, men do definitely attempt to suppress women - to belittle, badger, beat and humiliate women for the purpose of keeping a master-slave relationship alive to their own advantage. Even the best intentioned of men find it nearly impossible to resist taking advantage. Governments fund construction to create jobs, jobs that are predominately male. Women must struggle to earn enough for rent. Many will compromise themselves to ally with a man just for financial support. This is no new idea. To say the contrary is akin to the arguments Southerners gave for keeping blacks under slavery. Science is just one of the realms in which this stance peeks its head above the grass. Another is modern corporate farming. See the DVD \\"Food, Inc.\\" to see this well described manifestation. Four fictional film depictions that give the same idea of callous abuse is Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan starring Christopher Lambert, Instinct starring Anthony Hopkins, Amistad again with Hopkins and Amazing Grace with Ioan Gruffudd. For some nasty depictions of the abuse toward women try Germaine Greer's Female Eunuch, Women and Madness by Phyllis Chesler or Margaret Atwood's Surfacing. We need not even broach the vast field of the Holocaust, of many peoples."},{"Title":"The Gendered Atom: Reflections on the Sexual Psychology of Science","review":"Since I am a scientist, I was curious and picked up this book. I can barely manage to struggle through a page or two without wanting to vomit.Roszak clearly knew nothing whatsoever about science. He has some sort of distorted fantastical strawman in mind when he thinks about science, which he attacks over and over. Anyone who likes this book is highly suspect, in my opinion, and needs to actually learn something about science instead of just regurgitating this ridiculous nonsense."},{"Title":"The Gendered Atom: Reflections on the Sexual Psychology of Science","review":"Let me begin with: Please don't buy this book. If you must punish yourself, go to your friendly neighbourhood library and try it on for size. Or beat yourself with a belt. Both at once might even make the book seem less painful by comparison.Roszak threads an incredible amount of thinly-veiled propaganda and poorly-researched assumptions into this book. He starts with the interesting and fairly believable theory that science has been biased by a male-centered culture. Then he proceeds to completely lose credibility with gaping logical vacuums. Allow me to demonstrate:My favourite example is the way he describes Richard Dawkins' work (which is far more interesting and credible than his own, by the way); Roszak explains that Dawkins views genes as \\"gangsters\\" and \\"war-gamers\\", and then proceeds to say he likens genes to these things \\"...in order to impose a defunct Social Darwinist ethic upon their [the genes'] behaviour.\\" (pg.130) Oh, so do you mean he's trying to pull the old Social-Darwinism-for-genes trick? That cunning villain! Oh, wait. Social Darwinism FOR GENES, that would be, er, plain old DARWINISM, am I correct? So Roszak treats real Darwinism and the theory of evolution as if it had sprung from its own misguided off-shoot, thus betraying his complete ignorance on the subject.Roszak directly implies elsewhere that atheists and Christians are equally fanciful in their ways of explaining existence, since Christians posit that God created everything, but that GOD existed eternally, and atheists posit that the world exists because its basic parts have always existed.The problem of an elegant explanation emerges here. Is he trying to say that it makes no difference to the credibility of these ideas that one group happens to invent a completely unnecessary and unscientific (in that it is not provable) intermediate step? He makes cutting comments about any other person he mentions who happens not to be a raging theist. His tragic lack of understanding of atheism (and existentialism) leads him to very obviously imply that non-theists are bitter, cynical people who have incredibly dark world-views and no conscience. He also describes the idea that the world has no inherent profound meaning as \\"macho\\" (pg.82), which is a strange way of putting things, to say the least. Ideas which he finds demoralizing on a personal level take an unnecessary beating in this book.When describing the way that human beings treat the environment, Roszak waxes on about Mother Earth and gives the impression that we all have to be slushy sentimental goddess-worshippers to be true environmentalists. He never once mentions any of the perfectly logical reasons why we may not want to destroy our environment, such as: we will all die if our resources run out. Ergo, don't ravage the planet. But apparently my desire to maintain an ecological harmony just isn't good enough, because it doesn't stem from an outrage against the profaning of our Mother by filthy patriarchal scientist hands.In conclusion, don't read this if you are expecting anything truly stimulating. Do read it if you are expecting a theatre of the absurd. It has earned its single star by virtue of its incredible strangeness, and its car-wreck quality of sickened fascination."},{"Title":"The Gendered Atom: Reflections on the Sexual Psychology of Science","review":"In this book, one of the best I have ever read, Roszak helps us see how we shape our own lives, our relationships, and our collective future, and how science was formed and how it shapes our lives in its image ... and he does all this in an easy-to-read, non-technical way. Indeed, his approach is unique. He has taught Frankenstein to college kids for 30 years, as a metaphor that predicted and described the shadow side of where we stand today. He uses that gothic horror story of a mad scientist to show how it presciently described modern science ... and from there he shows the next steps we and science can and must take, to go beyond Frankenstein's modern counterpart, Dr. Strangelove, by integrating the feminine relationship aspects of reality with science's vaunted worldview of utter objectivity and isolated particles. All this, he sets into incredibly accessible form, weaving it into the story of the trip he and his wife took to Switzerland to see where Mary Shelley, summering with Percy and Lord Byron, wrote Frankenstein ... and weaving in simple explanations of the strange discoveries and worldviews of modern physics by the (coincidence? ) that exactly there, where Frankenstein conceived his monster, now stands CERN, the European center for subatomic research. Add together Frankenstein, the feminist critique of modern science, four centuries of history (Roszak is a History professor), and a personal travel tale, and, alchemically, he creates a stunning clarification of our past and present and a clear map of our possible future."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"this book is stunningly encouraging.It taught me how to organize my life.But I do think Thoreau was overtly against modern utensils.

I expected Thoreau to write about discovering who he is in life and how society has found itself withering away from nature with all the advances in humanity.Instead though, I found a book that quite literally is a journal of what he pretty much did there in the woods. In all honesty, this book should have been called \\"What I did in the woods\\" because for the most part, that is what this book entails. He talks about his daily ventures around the lake and whatnot. This may sound exciting and all, but anyone who has picked up this book probably has gone out and at least attempted to enjoy nature. I don't need someone else to write about something that I try to do on a regular basis.There are some good moments in the book, like when he talks about meeting an individual who just works and works and for what? Moments like those was what I expected because it showed problems we Americans face every day. I did not expect however him talking about how deep Walden pond is or what the rabbits were doing around his cabin. Really Thoreau? What amazing revelation people find out of him talking of that stuff is beyond me.Don't get me wrong this is a good book but I believe really overrated. Some of these reviews are hilarious though talking about how \\"deep\\" the book is. I can just as easily write about going out for a walk anyday and be glad if someone called that \\"deep.\\" People writing those reviews makes me wonder when was the last time they went out for a nice walk in the woods."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Isn't it a little bit incongruous to desire to detach yourself from society, seeking self-reliance, and then write a book about it? Just an observation...While Thoreau is a curious individual - sort of a poor-man's G.K. Chesterton - he always seems to come up short. The Virtue of Civil Disobedience reads more like self-satire than a serious attempt at political philosophy. And while Walden is rich and fulfilling, it is ultimately just a vehicle for Thoreau to make baseless claims predicated upon his treasury of tidbits and odd knowledge.Had Thoreau been blessed with living in the modern world, he could have just written \\"Living by a Pond on Your Own For Dummies\\" and saved himself (and us) a lot of trouble.Instead of \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" I recommend anything by Lysander Spooner (particularly \\"No Treason\\")Instead of \\"Walden\\" I recommend \\"Two Years Before the Mast.\\" It's both more relevant than Walden, and a heck of a lot Closer To Nature."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Walden and Civil Disobedience was bought as a gift and was exactly what he wanted. Has't put it down since he got it"},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"This collection has Henry David Thoreau's two most famous works: Walden and \\"Civil Disobedience.\\" Both are immortal literary works that should be read by all; anyone who does not have them would do well to get them here.Walden is one of the great classics of American letters. It has been somewhat unfortunately tainted by its reputation as the \\"treehugger's Bible,\\" but this misses the point. Thoreau obviously loved nature and was one of the nation's first environmentalists - indeed, modern day environmentalism can be traced directly to him -, but the core of the book is not a simple stating of nature's virtues. Thoreau lays down nothing less than a philosophy of life. Like \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" Walden preaches the virtues of individual liberty and the importance of Man over State. Thoreau raises some staggeringly deep existential questions: If a man does not depend on the State but still resides within its boundaries, need he pledge allegiance? Need he pay taxes? Thoreau tells us how to get the most out of life by living simply. Indeed, much like Rousseau, he seemed to basically believe that the true essence and spirit of man resides in the state of nature. He assures us that, if all lived as simply as he did at Walden, there would be very little theft, crime, violence, envy, or jealousy. He urges us all to live our own lives as we see fit, neither depending on or heeding others, and to avoid merely becoming another mindless drone in conformist society.\\"Resistance to Civil Government\\" - or \\"Civil Disobedience,\\" as it became known - is an essential part of American literature, culture, and history. Even more remarkably, it is undeniable proof that great literature can have a real effect on the world even long after it is written and ignored. The essay is world famous as the founding text of civil disobedience, i.e., non-violent protest, and its effect on such luminaries as Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King was profound, thus sealing its immortality. This alone makes it essential for all.However, it is easy to forget that the essay is a masterpiece in itself. Essentially Thoreau's highly individual expression of his mentor Emerson's self-reliance doctrine applied to government, it has a wealth of depth and nuance despite its brevity. The words are few but the implications endless; it has enough food for proverbial thought to last a lifetime. The gist is very clear, but the implications have spoken very differently to many different people. The work's nature - and Thoreau's generally - is such that it and he are championed by everyone from neocons to libertarians to liberals, and the truly notable thing is that all are justified. This underscores the importance of reading the essay for ourselves.Its main query is \\"What does the individual owe the state?,\\" the answer being a resounding \\"Nothing.\\" Thoreau takes the maxim that the government that governs least governs best to its logical conclusion by wishing for one that governs not at all - a brave wish very few have seriously dared to make or even conceive. He makes a highly principled stand for individual rights and autonomy, arguing very persuasively that people should be able to go about their business without interference. This of course sounds very much like current libertarians, and their position has indeed hardly ever been better argued. Many related and implied issues - protests against taxation, conscription, etc. - also seem to support them. However, it is important to remember that the essay's crux and most famous section - Thoreau's account of a night spent in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because he did not want to support war or slavery - was and is immensely liberal. Few issues can be more central to current liberalism than an anti-war stance, and slavery was the era's great liberal cause. All this must be kept firmly in mind amid the many attempts to reduce Thoreau to a current party platform. He was at once too simple and too complex for this and would not have suffered himself to be thus reduced; nor does the essay justify it.Integral as all this is, the work's core point is arguably a new self-reliance argument above and beyond immediate practical considerations. Thoreau certainly had a practical, political streak, especially compared to relative idealists like Emerson, but he thought individuality more sacred than anything. He articulated this more fully elsewhere, but it is very present here. His work is thus in many ways the best kind of self-help material - and, unlike the mass of current self-help tripe littering bookshelves, is intellectually and even aesthetically pleasing. Thoreau was the most thoroughly local writer that can be imagined, but his willingness to look deep inside himself for the eternal truths present in all people has made him an inspiration to millions and millions of people from across the political spectrum and indeed the world. This essay is a major part of his legacy and thus one of the very few works that literally everyone should read. Few can be the same afterward, and it will change many lives; it is nothing less than one of the most important documents ever written, and its value simply cannot be exaggerated.This collection is an excellent primer for those new to Thoreau, and those who have not already done so should open their minds to him immediately - and once done, they will never be closed again."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Well Walden and Civil Dis. are both amazing essays and in that matter books. The fact that they have said so much and the genius that Thoreau remains to be is absolute. As E. B. White said if anyone attempted to recapture the way that Thoreau writes it would be impossible, the book would be torn and burned. His truth on simplicity is something that I myself and all should take into concept especially in these troubled times. I have read both works many times and continue to learn something new every single time. Absolute praise to Walden especially. I have personally learned that schools actually have it required to read \\"Where I lived and What I lived for.\\" However difficult the message is for anyone the fact that it is taught in schools puts it up on the scale for anyone. To put up an argument against this book is tough because it will be rebuked again and again unless you write an entire book trying to show these things wrong ( Moby-Dick ). Well anyway this is a must, I have read absolute tons of books and I have still found Walden still of my absolute favorites. So get this, it's amazing."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"I read most of Walden while backpacking the wilderness coast of Washington State alone. This was appropriate as the book is the author's account of two years spent largely by himself in a hand-made cottage on the edge of a pond. In it he details not only the minutiae of his solitary project, but opens into one of the heights of transcendental philosophy. I anticipated Thoreau's seminal work was powerful, but actually reading it was electrifying. No, I didn't agree with all of his positions. At times he turns tricks of hollow rhetoric though his arguments are nevertheless beautifully constructed. Over all, though, I came away changed and recharged to live a life more essentially meaningful; to simplify my day to achieve goals that last while experiencing as much as possible in every moment. My love of God and Creation were renewed. Classic."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Thoreau lived for two years and two months at Walden Pond. He said the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation. Henry Thoreau asked hard questions.He related that when the Masschusetts Bay Colony was founded, earthen houses were built. They were convenient and suitable and they had the advantage of putting everyone in a position of equality and not making the poorer inhabitants feel discouraged. It distressed Thoreau that a good deal of the money spent for shelter and dress was for show, uneconomical.He farmed organically because he was only a squatter. He found that by working for about six weeks he could meet all of the annual expenses of living. He claimed that memorable events transpired in the morning.Thoreau went to the woods because he wished to live deliberately. The sounds of the railroad penetrated the woods. Visitors were frequent during three seasons. In the wintertime basically he had only himself for company and some of the animals.In any season, the woods were surprisingly dark at night. Because he had no helpers or animals to assist him in cultivating the fields he felt that he ws more intimate with the beans in his beanfield. Songs have suggested that husbandry is a sacred art.The scenery of Walden was on a humble scale. The first ice was especially interesting. He reported seeing fox, jays, chickadees, and red squirrels in the the winter.In CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE he asserts that in a government that imprisons unjustly, the place of a just man is in prison. Thoreau underwent an overnight jail stay when he failed to pay a poll tax."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Walden is H. D. Thoreau's return to \`wildness', but with a rucksack.It is a protest against the existing civilized world, where men are \`serfs of the soil with no time to be anything but a machine.' They act as \`slave-drivers of themselves'. Why don't they live \`as simply as I then did' with plenty of leisure time for \`a written word, the choiciest of relics?'Walden is a retreat from status, appearance and jealousy. As Jonathan Levin states in his excellent introduction: \`Walden is written in defense of the value of the individual in the social / economic machinery.'But, Thoreau's return to \`wildness' is in no way a return to nature: \`Nature is hard to overcome, but she must be overcome.' \`The animal in us perhaps cannot be wholly expelled. We are yet not pure.'Thoreau's motto is: \`A command over our passions and over the external senses of the body is declared by the Ved to be indispensable in the mind's approximation to God. Chastity is the flowering of men.' (!)His dream of personal freedom and individual autarchy (\`drink water from the pond') is in today's environment totally impossible. More, Thoreau contradicts himself by stating:' if we know all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the description of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular results at that point.' This is not less than plain determinism.Civil DisobedienceThis short pamphlet translates perfectly the US dream of uninhibited freedom: \`that government is best which governs not at all'. But, Thoreau clearly understands that \`no government' is not a possibility, only a \`better government'.His civil disobedience (not paying taxes) is a protest against a government whose policies are illegal and immoral: \`to hold slaves, and to make war on Mexico.'More, it oppresses its own population: \`There will never be a really free and enlightened State until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived.'Henry David Thoreau's impossible \`wildness' dream with all its contradictions as well as his highly relevant \`Civil Disobedience' message remain a classic in US and Western literature.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"A previous reviewer asked what Thoreau might think of how society has developed commercially since he wrote this book.

In fact, what strikes me is that we as a Western society have not overcome many of the issues pointed out by Thoreau 150 years ago. Thoreau left Concord MA &quot;disdainful of America's growing commercialism and industrialism&quot;, the slavish materialism of that society then. One wonders what he'll say if he would see the extend today - in the post Coca-Cola society. But then Thoreau was a man who clearly stepped to his own drum. Becuase of slavery, he refused to support the state on moral grounds. How would his views have been tolerated today?I am not luddite, but my favourite quote from the book is this: &quot;We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing to communicate&quot;. Does this say something about the Internet, newsmedia and our contemporary information overload, or what?I liked the introduction and footnotes of Meyer. Just enough to provide context and explanation, but never intrusive. This book is as relevant today as it was during Thoreau's lifetime. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Anyone who prefers Emerson above Thoreau surely does so with a view to increasing his own popularity. Thoreau is too outspoken to be liked by everyone--indeed, to identify more with him is a kind of social suicide. But then, Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not here to please anybody, but rather to be authentically what he was.To find a modern western man who so thoroughly embodies the wisdom of antiquity is as rare as &quot;the tooth of a dragon, or the hair of a phoenix.&quot; Henry David Thoreau is such a man. More than a mere combination of past, present and future, he joins together the most mundane, prosaic and ordinary considerations of daily life with the loftiest and noble thoughts of mankind. Furthermore, he perceives the spiritual aspirations and practices of east and west as one coherent whole. He was well acquainted with the classics of both hemispheres--The Tao de Ching, The Bhagavad-gita, Vedic writings, The Iliad and more--and here, distilled for us common folk, is that wisdom as seen from the his viewpoint. Bertrand Russell has given what would seem the crown laurel to Thoreau calling him &quot;a pure romantic&quot;-in contrast to the weak romanticism of Victor Hugo, or the rather soft variety found in Emerson.During his lifetime, 700 or so of the 1,000 copies he had printed of &quot;Walden&quot; wound up in his parents' attic, ostensibly making him a failure as a writer. Since then he has become a literary god, and without doubt one of the most influential writers of the past 200 years. It was Thoreau's tract entitled Civil Disobedience, written because of his objection to paying tax to the American government--a so-called democracy involved in slave trade, westward expansion, displacement of indigenous population and imperialistic annexation of Mexico--that gave fuel to human rights movements in the 20th Century. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. based their efforts on this small but amazingly powerful essay, which only goes to show that Confucius--one of Thoreau's favorite sage authors--was right; the thought of an intelligent man sitting in his room can kill a king and destroy his country. And so it was that slavery was abolished in the United States, India attained home rule and racial integration in the U.S. progressed.Since the industrial revolution in the 18th Century, the central goal of western technological society has been economic growth. And to achieve an economic growth that is endless, corporations in the latter half of the 20th century have encouraged consumption that is mindless. But by the dawn of the 21st century, this central project has proven to be obsolete, for nature cannot sustain endless economic growth, and neither can the people in general. Nature has rebelled by refusing to absorb the transgressions against her dignity (pollution), and humanity has expressed insurgence through psychological and physical disease. Dr. Willis Harman has discussed the matter in detail in his book, &quot;Global Mind Change&quot; but, though more than a decade has passed since its publication, the important and timely points that it makes have yet to be assimilated by the public. Thoreau, however, was already tuned in to this problem way back in the 1840's. Astrologers attribute an overlap of a little more than 200 years between astrological ages, and this puts Thoreau in with the new Aquarians.His observations--on economy, simplicity, learning, human nature, participation mystique when close to nature and the close proximity of God--are unpresuming, candid and at times downright hilarious. I say Henry David Thoreau is a philosopher sage amongst the American transcendentalists, and a man who was not unconcerned about his less educated or enlightened fellows. He took tremendous pains to share himself with us through his writings, and there are many innovations of his that are already being practiced by posterity. Not the least of these is the growing awareness that ADULT EDUCATION for men and women can be a lifelong pursuit. I agree with Dr. Harman that this is on its way to becoming the new central project of western society, known as it is presently by the name, The Personal Growth Movement.In Walden the seeker will find lucid clues as to what the Aquarian Age is all about, its characteristics and even the means of cultivating the new consciousness. But this is not a book for people who like easy reading. Henry would demand of you that you read it with the same diligence and deliberation as it was written. It took him five years of refinement before he was satisfied with the manuscript. Walden will provide you and your descendants with many more years of pleasure and enlightenment than that."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"H.D. Thoreau is the first and most important figure in U.S. Radicalism. This collection provides the essential background for the latent radicalism inherent in American politics, especially as it was vocalized in the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements of the 1960's.Disobedience is the shorter of the texts, but probably more important. It is an attempt to justify moral anarchism and a call to act on individual judgements about justice.Walden can be interpreted as an important treatise against consumerism and the dangers of specialization, as well as an appreciation of the natural environment. Those interested in anti-globalization/anti-free trade movements would do well to read Walden to gain an understanding of where anti-consumerism came from and an examination of its ethical implications. However, it also pays to remember that Walden is a failed experiment and, in the end, Thoreau returns to Cambridge.Thoreau, as political philosophy, has certain problems. Moral anarchy and denial of the social contract is difficult to replace in civil society--Thoreau makes no more than the most vague references as to what could replace it, seeming to rely on the fact that his personal sense of justice is universal.Nevertheless, Thoreau's conscience has resonance and is as relevant today as ever. His rejection of consumerism as the basis for society and its stratification also teaches important lessons.Thoreau represents that first step in understanding the other part of American political thought--extremely different from that of the Constitution and Federalist Papers--but with profound connections to the work of Dr. Martin Luther King."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"Scorning the mass slavery of modern industrial society, Thoreau conducted his most famous experiment in life: to live in solitude in a shack he builds himself on the edge of Walden Pond, on the land of Emerson, with whom he lived as a handyman and pupil. Thoreau, clearly, was no less radical than his mentor, Emerson, though he differs at least in the fact that he was not merely content with preaching, but actually strove to put his ideals into practice. The book is a profound statement of Transcendentalist individualism and self-reliance and a hymn to nature, contentment and joy. He recounts, at one point, the episode in 1845, during which he was imprisoned for one night for defying the local government and not paying his poll-tax. He mentions, in passing, how he allowed a runaway black slave to have safe passage through the region. His retreat into solitude was partly impelled by his disgust with the war with Mexico, and partly because he could not accept that he could live under a governemnt that was also a slave's government. Thoreau, a neo-Cynic, a modern stoic, emphasises a return to the basic, uncomplicated life, free from the cares and fetters of what he calls &quot;odd-fellow society&quot; and celebrates, above all, simplicity, magnanimity and trust. Glorying in the animal vitality of his body (though he was singularly unable to appreciate women) his ruminations encompass the most prosaic details of life in the woods, such as the migrations of birds, fishing, his own bean-farm, along with powerful insights into self-improvement, learning, generosity and other topics, interspersed with allusions to his favourite literature, the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer and the texts of ancient Hindu philosophy and religion. A refreshing and inspiring encounter with a fascinating individual in the history of letters."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"The Penguin Classics edition of Walden and Civil Disobedience is a well-edited volume which brings together these two great American masterworks into one inexpensive and convenient package. The introductory material and notes, though not excessive, provide enough guidance to favorably enhance the contemporary reader's experience of these classic texts. Though Thoreau's language may seem antiquated to today's reader, his message is still as vital now as it was 150 years ago.Walden is a manifesto of nonconformity and individualism, expressed in an inspirational combination of philosophy, poetry, and natural history. Beginning in 1845, Thoreau spent two years living in a small cabin in the woods near Walden Pond. Embarking on this sojourn of solitude was an attempt to escape the distractions, conventions, and frivolous fashions of urban society, to reconnect with the essentials of existence, and to get at the very root of life. By practicing a simpler way of living, engaging in a more direct relationship with nature, and replacing the hubbub of civilization with quiet contemplation, Thoreau hoped to experience life more fully and richly. The materialistic culture of modern, civilized society distracts us from finding our true direction in life. Solitude and introspection are the means by which to recover one's bearings. Thoreau urges readers to forget how society says you should live and to live by your own compass, by what you feel is right. Disregard public opinion and take command of your own fate.In Civil Disobedience, a short essay first published in 1849, Thoreau asserts that when a government acts in a way contrary to the conscience of one of its individual subjects, that individual has a duty to deny any allegiance to that government by ceasing to pay taxes and refusing to obey unjust laws. While Thoreau was focused on the issues of slavery and the Mexican-American War, much of the rhetoric in Civil Disobedience is broad enough that it can be used as an inspirational rallying cry for dissenters of every stripe, from anarchists to Tea Partiers. In Thoreau's view, all governments are inherently corrupt. Just because democracy is based on majority rule doesn't make it any less corrupt, because the approval of the majority is no guarantee of justice and right. Instead of waiting for their government to become just, citizens should behave justly, even if that means breaking the law.The Penguin Classics edition is an excellent presentation of these two great works. The introduction by Michael Meyer provides valuable historical and biographical context. Meyer examines Thoreau's thoughts on slavery before, during, and after the writing of these two pieces, and focuses on how Thoreau's conception of an appropriate reaction to this unjust institution changed over time. This edition also contains helpful endnotes which clarify some of the historical references that may be obscure to 21st century readers. If you've never read Thoreau before, the Penguin edition offers a great introduction to the man and his work."},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"I bought this book after much searching for it in local bookshops.

Walden: or, Life in the Woods, based on his experiment in subsistence living between 1845 and 1847, was one of only two books published in his lifetime. Neither was a commercial success. His 'time' came later, and could plausibly be said to be still continuing. By the end of the nineteenth century a vast amount of his writing was in print, including much taken from the 39 notebooks of daily jottings that constituted his Journal. Each generation since has warmed to one or another facet of his writing - his philosophy, observation of nature, simple living, and refusal to pay taxes to a government that supported slavery and waged the Mexican-American War.For purists, it is all too easy to pick holes. Thoreau's philosophy was far from rigorous in an academic sense; many of his observations from nature were not scientifically robust; building his log cabin only one and a half miles from his parents' home and continuing to buy essentials in Concord (he was on his way to the shoe-menders when arrested for non-payment of taxes), he cannot credibly be said to have cut himself off from society; and for his refusal to pay taxes he spent only one night in the local lock-up before an aunt paid his debt. But to pick holes would be to risk missing several important points. First and foremost, he did succeed in sustaining himself at a basic level for fully two years. His diet was essentially, though not exclusively, vegetarian; he drank only water; kept no pets or other livestock; and seems never to have even thought of acquiring and maintaining a family. In so doing, he successfully demonstrated that living in such a way demands only a very small cash income, so that it is not necessary to work anything like \\"full-time\\", thus releasing much time for walking, reading, contemplation and writing. He derived great personal satisfaction from that lifestyle and took particular pleasure in his cabin, built by his own hands.The book is not an easy read and a measure of sympathy with the undertaking will be required to get most readers beyond the opening chapters. Even, then, all but the most enthusiastic would have to concede that the book is patchy. However, some of the best patches serve to make the whole worthwhile. Such a passage is a description of a hawk in flight found on page 210 of this edition (\\"On the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge...\\"). Incidentally, to get the absolute most out this passage, and the whole book, readers will need to know the length of a perch (as in rod, pole and perch, 40 to a furlong).

He exemplified the idea which perhaps as much as any other has come to be at the heart of the American creed. \\"If a man does not keep pace to his companion, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\\"Throreau when he went into the woods of Walden Pond on July 4, 1845 , a journey in solitude which would last just two years and two months, was the archetypal American individualist. He was the man 'doing his own thing' living in accordance with what only he could know was right for himself. This idea of 'radical individualism' has become part of the American common faith. Its abuses are legion and may be disastrous, but it also has brought about not simply 'better mousetraps' but a whole vast world of innovations and innovators, the like of which Mankind has never known before.Thoreau as he writes in his introduction went to the woods to explore not simply the natural world, the outdoors he so much loved. He went to the woods to truly go more deeply into and know himself. As he says in his introduction:\\" I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me.\\"Thoreau in that enigmatic, epigrammatic aphoristic style, he shared with his great mentor and fellow pioneering poet- philosopher, Emerson connects the world within with the world without , connects the Concord woods with the Cosmos . He creates a work in 'Walden' of singular beauty and of its own special economy and principles in thought.Thoreau was too an abolitionist, an opponent of the Mexican war, a civil disobedient who refused to pay the poll tax-, a pioneerwhose followers would include Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.But in his close looking at the world of nature and the world of himself he was first a great explorer of life and reality going out alone in his own way- however geographically close he may have been to home.His words and his wisdom waken us even today to the hope of new and better worlds i.e. he also embodied the spirit of a great American optimism.The great individual teaches us even in dark hours to find new worlds in ourselves outside our own darknesses. \\" There are new worlds yet to be born\\" he writes, \\" The sun is but a morning star\\""},{"Title":"Walden and on the Duty of Civil Disobedience (Signet Classics)","review":"I Love Thoreau, and while I haven't had a chance to read this yet, I am sure I will not be dissappointed.

Actual text analyses and discussion are good in parts, but miss or ignore major thematic issues that most other NT surveys spend a lot of time on (the conflict in the early Church between Judaic and Hellenized Christians in Acts for instance). Also, the organization is pretty haphazard; Raymond Brown's NT Intro is a lot better organized and also provides a lot more in-depth discussion of a wider range of issues. This book loses one star for its poor organization and occasional neglected topics.The authors are generally fair and balanced, except on the issue of women's ordination as raised by another reviewer. The section on 1 Corinthians 14 is especially ridiculous, with the authors interpreting the passage to read the exact OPPOSITE (i.e. men should not criticize the women who speak up in church) of what every other translation I have ever read. NIV, King James, NRSV, NAB, RSV = all wrong, and the authors of this book evidently are brilliant Greek linguists. Pretty unlikely! Rather the authors are blatantly twisting Paul's words to agree with their own agenda. Loses another star for this ham-fisted partisanship...All in all, not a terrible book, has some merit, but the author's lack of structure and deliberately obtuse interpetation of some aspects of the Pauline epistles make this a less than optimal intro to the New Testament."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"I have already read three chapters, and I have learned a great deal. I actually look forward to reading more of the book because I am learning things I didn't know that are important to my having a greater knowledge of the word of God."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"This is a good introduction to the books of the NT for seminary students and lay people. The set up is nice and organized. It also gives the reader a historical background of the NT (pp. 1-87). Like all other intros the book deals with the background, authorship, dating, and summaries of each book. The only problem I have with this book is the New Perspective tendencies. For instance, here is what the authors have to say about the doctrine of justification (the article by which the church stands or falls):&quot;Justification&quot; in modern English has legal overtones, and justification is often understood as God as judge freeing human sinners from the punishment due their sin. But Paul took this term from the covenantal language of Israel, where it describes being in a right covenantal relationship with God. To be made righteous therefore means, for Paul, to leave a rebellious relationship in which one opposes what God wants and to enter into a positive relationship in which one seeks to follow God's will (p. 308).The authors, by this statement, have kicked out the foundation by which the church stands. No longer is justification understood as a legal action, but as a familial relational thing. Thus, justification is not about having the perfect righteousness of Christ imputed to one's record, but about pursuing God's will (i.e., obeying His commandments). Though Achtemeier, Green, and Thompson would resist all attempts to be labelled Romanists, they have paved the way to Rome by this statement (of course it is no surprise that N. T. Wright recommends this book). Don't discard the whole book just because of that one anti-evangelical statement (like I said above there are good and useful things in the book), but one should be wary of the soteriological perspective that is being expounded here."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"The text is wordy and often redundant. Some issues are discussed with far too much detail and reiteration while others are statements without meaningful diatribe.I did enjoy the historical presentations but the spiritual presentations were difficult to cull through and not very enlightening."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"There have been a number of helpful New Testament introductions written for the Evangelical community, including the older volume by Guthrie and the newer work by Carson, Moo and Morris. And there have been many fine NT theologies as well. Volumes by Ladd, Caird and Guthrie, among others, have served the Evangelical community well.This new volume offers a bit of both worlds: introductory matters, as well as theological concerns. Written for students and lay people, it will serve as a good intermediary text. Advanced students may find it wanting in areas, but it does offer, if in brief form, some of the latest scholarship on the NT.The three authors all teach interpretation at American seminaries. They have all produced a number of outstanding works on aspects of the NT. Green for example has authored the well received New International Commentary on Luke; Meye Thompson wrote on 1-3 John for the IVP New Testament Commentary Series, and Achtemeier did the Hermeneia commentary on 1 Peter.This volume is especially good on Jesus and the Gospels. Indeed, along with sections on introductory matters and Acts, it takes up the first half of the book. The remainder of the book offers brief chapters on the other 22 books of the New testament. Each chapter concludes with a short bibliography of recent works, usually half of which are commentaries.The chapters highlight the usual concerns: matters of authorship and historical setting, theological themes and literary issues. Photos, maps and supplementary text blocks all contribute to a highly usable and informative volume.The study is neither too technical nor too detailed to be lost on a lay person or beginning student. Yet it is scholarly and up-to-date enough to be of use to more advanced students as well. As with all theological works, there will be some areas of disagreement.For example, since none of the three authors comes from a Reformed perspective (not that they need to), there are areas in which one might beg to differ. Perhaps the most obvious example of this arises in the chapter on Romans. One passage in which quite a lot of ink has been spilled is Romans 7 and the identity of the \\"I\\" who struggles with sin.While a number of options present themselves, many argue that Paul is describing his own experience as a believer (and by implication that of all other believers). Pick up any 10 good commentaries on Romans, and perhaps as many as half will argue this position Yet in this volume the authors simply dismiss such an interpretation as \\"impossible\\".One would have thought that careful scholars such as Cranfield, Murray, and Dunn, for example, would not embark upon such impossible hermeneutical assignments!But leaving aside the occasional theological quibble, this volume well serves its purpose as an introductory text on basic NT matters. Others may go into more background detail (such as the volume by Carson, Moo and Morris, or more fully examine the theological or literary aspects (Ladd, or Caird - in addition to his NT Theology, see his invaluable Language and Imagery of the Bible), but this volume will fill a niche and should enjoy a long run with students of the NT."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"Paul Achtemeier, Joel Green, and Marianne Meye Thompson are respected New Testament scholars at Union Theological Seminary (Virginia), Asbury Theological Seminary, and Fuller Theological Seminary respectively. \\"Introducing the New Testament\\" is (as you might guess) an introductory textbook for those just beginning their study of the New Testament; their intended audience appears to be theology majors and those just beginning seminary.The format of the book lends itself well to classroom use. Of this books 25 chapters, 18 deal with a particular book (or highly related books, e.g. 1, 2, 3 John)--covering its content, its context, its author, and its recipient. It then traces the literary flow of the New Testament book, showing what the author's major purpose and themes are. The section follows with an introduction to some scholarly debates concerning the Biblical book, and some helpful resources for further reading.The remaining 7 chapters are more topical in nature and are titled \\"Chapter 1: What is the New Testament?\\" \\"Chapter 2: The World of the New Testament,\\" \\"Chapter 3: The Nature of the Gospels,\\" Chapter 8: Jesus of Nazareth,\\" \\"Chapter 10: Letters in the New Testament,\\" \\"Chapter 11: Paul and His World,\\" and \\"Chapter 25: The Formation of the New Testament Cannon.\\" Each of these covers its subject from a variety of angles and introduces various schools of thought on the subject, while the authors do come down on particular sides of debate, they do so in such a way as to leave the questions open so that the reader can come to his own conclusions. Again, there is a concluding summary and resources for further reading.This book has been helpful for this reader in many ways. When reading commentaries, it is easy for one to \\"lose the forest for the trees.\\" That is to say that when one narrow his focus too narrowly--to one particular verse in a Biblical book or the like--he can lose the general argument and flow of the book. Achtemeier, Green, and Thompson do a great service by keeping each book's major argument/theme in mind and show how the particular outline of the book and even particular verses serve to advance that argument/theme. Often, they are good at providing the reader with a memorable summary statement in the book's narrative which speaks to the heart of the issue at hand. Also, this reader appreciated the generous amount of pictures, maps, charts, and \\"shaded boxes\\" that speak to tangential issues.However, while this book has many merits, it is not without its flaws. While its treatment of the Gospels and Catholic (non-Pauline) epistles were excellent, their treatment of Paul's letters was disappointing. Throughout the book, the authors seem to make a conscious effort to attract a wide readership by avoiding doctrinal issues (a bit of a problem in itself), but in the Pauline epistles, they break this pattern and come down forcefully on a particular issue. This issue is not communion, baptism, the relationship between faith and works, or the like, but rather they come down strongly in favor of womens' ordination. In so doing, they appeal to Galatians 3:28 (out of context), they appeal to 1 Corinthians 14(?!), and even appeal to the idea that Ephesians was written by a women, not Paul (?!?!)! Because of these poorly developed, illogical, and speculative arguments, the authors do lose a degree of credibility. Other negative aspects of the book are relatively few and far between. The only others that really stick out are their argument that Scripture is fallible (e.g. p. 456) and that the Book of Revelation is primarily about the first century Church's struggle against the Roman Empire, and not so much about the modern Church's situation.In all, those who are interested in beginning New Testament scholarship would do well to read this book. Professors who are looking for a basic textbook would do well to assign this one, but I would recommend Martin Franzmann's similar (and more orthodox) \\"The Word of the Lord Grows.\\" Mildly recommended."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"No single volume survey of the New Testament is going to be suited to all tastes. Just as different denominations and traditions have come to interpret and apply biblical teachings in different ways (one must remember that the choice of literal interpretation is still a hermenuetic choice, still an interpretation), so too will they have different documents and teachings that develop their own traditions more fully. However, the broader trend among seminaries is toward a more ecumenical approach, made necessary not in the least by the fact that many (if not most) seminaries can no longer cater to an exclusive denominational pool of potential students, but rather, in order to keep enrollment up and the doors open, must appeal to a wider range of learners.Thus, there has a been a great number of New Testament surveys written in broad-based, ecumenical mindsets over the past generation. This volume, by Achtemeier, Green and Thompson is one of the latest, best volumes in this field. Designed as a primary textbook for introductory courses in New Testament studies, it approaches the subject through a primarily Western, liberal-theological approach; by liberal I refer here to the traditions of biblical studies that finds root in post-Enlightenment circles in northern Europe, Britain, and later North America, not the ever-changing political term.The authors cover the primary topics of interest for any such introductory course must address: historical origins of the writing and canonical development, the historical setting of Jesus and the apostles, the cultural setting in which the early church began to form, and various traditions that arose around the gospels and apostolic letters. Achtemeier, Green and Thompson devote a chapter each to each of the gospels, as well as a separate, general, somewhat integrative chapter on Jesus of Nazareth. These chapters highlight literary differences, differences in audience and intention, as well as connections between the writings.The authors look at the Acts of the Apostles and the apostolics letters in logical groupings (the letters to the Corinthians share a chapter, the letters of John share a chapter, etc.). There are independent chapters on Paul, the idea of letters, the book of Revelation, and the canonical development of the New Testament independent from the chapters on the letters themselves. Some chapters, such as that on the letter to James, is longer, dealing with both the letter and the historical figure of James.Achtemeier, Green and Thompson use the full range of literary and historical tools available in this study -- ancient languages, documentary evidence (including outside writings), literary critical analysis tools, and more. This is not a theological text -- while the authors address different ways in which the text is received and understood, there is no particular dogmatic angle espoused here. No text can be free from bias, but given the intention to produce a text usable by a wide audience, this one does a reasonably good job at remaining objective.The text itself is interesting and accessible, presupposes no particular in-depth knowledge of languages, history, or theology, although these studies certainly don't hurt! There are boxes, charts, line-art drawings, pictures, graphs, suggestions for further readings after each chapter, and a reasonable index. The look and feel of the book is nice and inviting."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"This book is a bible student's dream come true. It is written in an engaging manner. The scholarship is superb. The book's structure, theological content, and balanced treatment, make it a valuable resource for New Testament Study. At a time when there is a proliferation of books and monographs on biblical subjects, Achtemeier, Green, and Thompson, produce a jewel for the serious student of scripture. This book is destined to become an instant classic."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"Paul J. Achtemeier, Joel B. Green, and Marianne Meye Thompson have provided seminary students and other interested Christians with a very good survey text of the New Testament. While generally from the evangelical end of the spectrum, the authors often do not agree with traditional views of authorship, theology, or other elements associated with the text. And regardless of whether they agree with modern scholarship on any given issue, they continually engage with such scholarship, making this text more valuable than one that simply accepts (broadly speaking) traditional views or that lines up with one particular theological tradition.The structure of most chapters is intriguing. While many texts deal first with questions of authorship and introductory background material, most chapters of Introducing the New Testament take a very different tack. While background information is introduced at the beginning of the chapter as needed, the authors generally get into a short commentary on the book in question as quickly as possible and let many background issues get discussed in that context. Questions of authorship and dating usually are left until the end of the chapter. There are exceptions to this pattern in chapters devoted to more complicated texts (e.g., Hebrews, Revelation), but this structure occurs enough times in the text that it could be considered normative.The book's few weaknesses are visual and stylistic in nature. More photos and maps would break up the lengthy text and make it more appealing, even if they made for a longer book. And at too many points, the text could have used more editing; many sentences could be shortened for stronger effect.Still, those are relatively minor complaints. Introducing the New Testament is a book from which most Christians looking to dive into New Testament studies should profit."},{"Title":"Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology","review":"I have found this to be a well-written, interesting book.

For me this is so far the most helpful textbook on the subject that i've found. Luke Timothy Johnson's The Writings of The New Testament is also very well done and useful and is similar to this book.

Beginners and experienced meditators alike will benefit from this handy guide.Part 1 features a \\"Before You Begin\\" section that explains meditation and provides tips for preparation, body positioning, establishing a daily practice, and more. Part 2 features 140 individual meditation techniques described in step-by-step detail. The organization and presentation of the meditation techniques is what makes \\"The Meditation Bible\\" so appealing and user-friendly. The techniques are divided into eight categories:1. Calming and Centering2. Living Mindfully3. Healing Body, Mind, & Spirit4. Get Moving5. Love and Compassion6. Problem Solving7. Manifesting Your Dreams8. Connecting to the DivineFor each of the 140 techniques found in the book, the author outlines the benefits of the technique, describes the best time to use it, and includes clear and concise instructions for practicing the technique. The majority of the techniques are not oriented toward any specific spiritual path, instead providing practical meditation methods that will appeal to all readers. The techniques found in the section called \\"Connecting to the Divine\\" cover a wide variety of spiritual traditions, including Christian, Buddhist, Quaker, Jewish, Native American, Taoist, and many others.Experienced meditators may recognize some of the techniques -- The Microcosmic Orbit, The Distracted Mind, Watching Your Breath -- but many of the techniques are creative and unique.

Howard. While Solomon Kane might not be as important as Howard's principal creation, Conan the Cimmerian, this wonderfully brutal English Puritan is a fascinating creation and full of the Howard out worldly magic.Kane is perhaps a darker character than Conan (who was pretty dark himself), and certainly more mysterious and strange. Kane is an English puritan that feels compelled through some odd, inner voice (perhaps the word of God) to wander, of all places, Africa. The Africa of Solomon Kane is a world of supernatural magic and gibbering daemons - a land where all legends and myths (including the lost kingdom of Atlantis, vampires, and the winged harpies of Jason, to name a few) find a home. Kane faces them all with a sword, flintlock pistol, and a terrible sense of Justice and defense of the weak.Perhaps my favorite piece was a brief fragment of a story called \\"Death's Black Riders,\\" where Howard describes death sweeping like a dark wind through the corporal bodies of Solomon Kane and his mount, leaving both mysteriously transformed. It is a beautifully done page or so and suggests that perhaps Howard saw Kane as God's Angel of Death, walking the earth.What was it about Howard that is so gripping and memorable? Well, he wrote of a kind of epic, romantic heroism - a barbaric purity, that is sorely missing in today's society and certainly in today's writing. He wrote about heroes and kings, black gods and slavering devils. Boys and men will always find something to treasure in Robert E. Howard.Heck, the magnificent Del Ray editions are even illustrated, this one by Gary Gianni who does a great job in visualizing the stark, harshness of this death dealing puritan. What a Godsend for Howard fans. Highly recommended and then some. -Mykal Banta"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) is considered one of the best pulp adventure writers during the era when the genre was in its heyday. Best known for his character Conan the Barbarian, my personal favorite is Solomon Kane, a fanatical Puritan from 16th century England whose literary travels take him from England to Germany's Black Forest and then on to Africa.A strange mixture of religious fanaticism and wanderlust result in a character with more complex and stronger motives than Howard's other characters. Combined with larger than life characters, a darker Christianity, exotic locales, survivals from the ancient world and the result is pulp heroic fiction at its finest.The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane is the first time all of Howard's Kane stories have been put together under one cover. The fourteen stories (three of which are fragments) and four poems are heavily illustrated by Gary Gianni.What is fascinating about the stories is their combination results in a much longer novel. Like the Conan stories, each story builds on the other though each can be enjoyed on its own merits. The first story, Skull in the Stars, introduces us to the wandering Puritan as he encounters a supernatural horror on an English moor. The third story (Red Shadows) moves our hero from England to Africa on a quest for vengeance and justice and we are introduced to N'Longa, an African juju man who features prominently in the closing story cycle. The next story and two fragments find Kane wandering Germany's Black Forest and finally in Moon of Skulls, Kane returns to Africa for a dramatic rescue. Then, after a poetic encounter with Sir Francis Drake back in England and a diversion with pirates off the coast of England, Kane once again returns to the Dark Continent and begins his trek across the entire continent of Africa going from west to east that takes six stories and one poem to tell. The closing two poems (each a variant of the other) finds our much older hero back in his beloved home town of Devon, but with an ending that lets you know the adventures will never cease as long as Solomon Kane's heart beats.However, one caveat. Following the mores and tropes of heroic pulp fiction in its Golden Age, women and people of color are sometimes presented in ways that would offend the sensitive reader and I would encourage them to enjoy Howard's other works, but for those who can let Howard tell his tales on his own terms, the stories of Solomon Kane offer a rich diversion that last long after the final page is turned."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"With the exception of his Conan Stories, I consider the tales of Howard's driven, Puritan adventurer Solomon Kane to be his best work. I would also consider this to be Howard's most complex character. While characters like Conan, Kull, El-Borak, could almost be considered reincarnations of the same character, Kane is most unique. He's not a man driven to a life of adventure for the love of it or for monetary gain, but rather it is his zealous quest to bring justice and the Lord's retribution down upon those who commit evil.Also, Kane is quite different physically than Howards other characters. He's no muscle-bound behemoth, but tall, rather gaunt by comparison, but still strong of arm and sword and also armed with musket and pistol.These stories, set in the 16th century are pure an unedited versions of the original Howard stories and as such, do contain rather strong racial stereotypes, particularly of blacks. The stories are also among Howard's most atmospheric. One wonders how a man who rarely left his home of Cross Plains, Texas could so vividly describe, and capture the feel of darkest Africa.Among the best stories in the collection are:\\"Red Shadows\\" This was REH's first published Solomon Kane story. Kane finds a young girl, raped and beaten by a gang of brigands led by the villainous Le Loup. When the girl dies in his arms, Kane grimly declares to seek revenge. He devotes the next few years to making life a living hell for Le Loup and his comrades, finally killing them in the French mountains. Le Loup alone narrowly escapes, but with Kane on his trail, a trail which leads them both into deepest, darkest Africa. Here they meet again, but Le Loup has enlisted the support of a tribal chief. In turn, Kane gains the support of the village witch doctor named N'Longa, and together they see that justice is done.\\"The Hills of the Dead\\" Declaring Kane his \\"blood-brother\\", N'Longa the witch-doctor gives Kane a magic wooden staff, which will protect him in his travels. Kane finds himself impulsively drawn to the jungle and soon his travels lead to a city of vampires! But not to worry; his magic staffproves a suitable match for the loathsome creatures. Just the same, he finds there are too many of them for him to handle alone and so, going into a trance, he contacts N'Longa, who is able to join Kane in spirit by sending his soul to inhabit the borrowed body of a local native. Together they track down the vampires' home and exterminate them all.\\"The Footfalls Within\\" Kane comes across Arab slave-traders driving their slaves to market. A young girl falls, exhausted, and the slavers decide to amuse themselves by skinning her alive. Kane rushes to her rescue but is overwhelmed and taken prisoner A short while later, both slavers and slaves happen upon an ancient and very spooky mausoleum. Though they sense evil about the place, the lead slaver decides to break open the thing, intendiing to divest it of whatever riches may have been buried there with its dead. But Kane hears scary, elephantine footfalls from within, as of some giant THING pacing back and forth. This was a very strong Kane tale, really more horrific than most and Howard does a fantastic job of building up tension.Those may be my favorites but this collection, brilliantly illustrated by Gary Gianni is fantastic from cover-to-cover. If you've never read Solomon Kane then by all means get this book!"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I have read other Robert E. Howard books, but had not really noticed Solomon Kane until I began hearing about the movie that was being made about him. The book is beautifully written. The details are superb. The reader is transported to the side of Kane as he moves from adventure to adventure. Wish he had written more."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"For gratuitous mind candy, Robert Howard can't be beat. Maybe because buried in the swashbuckling adventures of Solomon Kane, there is the occasional gem of insight or thought provoking rumination that never gets run into the ground, but raises this characters adventures (and Kull's, too, I believe) above mere pulp. Not for everyone and, yes, the racial bias grates, though it is not nearly as bad as some from that era...or from some of the comments I have read lately sparked by online political stories.

But Conan wasn't the first archetypal adventurer to spring from Howard's fertile imagination.\\"He was a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan..A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things..Wayward and restless as the win, he was consistent in only one respect--he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such was Solomon Kane.\\"Collected in this volume, lavishly illustrated by award-winning artist Garyl Gianni, are all of the stories and poems that make up the thrilling sage of the dour and deadly Puritan, Solomon Kane. Together they constitute a sprawling epic of weird fantasy adventure that stretches from sixteeth-century England to remote African jungles where no white man has set foot. Here are shudder-inducing tales of vengeful ghosts and bloodthirsty demons, of dark sorceries wileded by evil men and women, all opposed by a grim avenger armed with a fanatic's faith and a warrior's savage heart.This edition also features exclusive story fragments, a biography of Howard by scholar Rusty Burke, and \\"In Memoriam,\\" H.P.

GechterReview from Spectrum, Vol. 1, #18June 1999THE SAVAGE TALES OF SOLOMON KANEBy Robert E. Howard; Illustrated by GaryGianni: limited edition book published byWandering StarDespite our society's becoming increasingly visually-oriented, new editions of illustrated books have become a rarity, and the ones that are published can usually be found in the children's section of the bookstore.Such was not always the case. During the \\"golden age\\" of illustration, around the turn of the century, numerous artists decorated a multitude of fine books. Probably the most famous of these are the Scribners editions (re-released beginning in the 1980s) illustrated by N.C. Wyeth: Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Robinson Crusoe, Robin Hood, The Last of the Mohicans, and many others. But sharing the spotlight with Wyeth were such giants as Maxfield Parish, Frank Schoonover, Alphonse Parish Jessie Wilcox Smith, Arthur Kackham, Howard Chandler Christy, John R. Neill, and others.In recent years notable illustrated editions appeared from time to time: an occasional Stephen King novel (The Talisman, for instance); Berni Wrightson's Frankenstein: Alan Lee's The Mabinogion. Though art book collections have provided fans with an abundance of treats during the past twenty years (comprehensive-or nearly comprehensive-editions of everything from Michaelangelo and DaVinci to illustration giants such as J.C. Leyendecker, Alphonse Mucha, Norman Rockwell, and Maxfield Parrish to fantasy/ SF artists such as Frank Frazetta and Michael Whalen), these were not illustrated texts.In fact, about the only person to carry on the tradition of illustrated books in a substantial way is Barry Moser, the Massachusetts artists whose wood engravings have been much copied (the art you see on Barnes and Noble store sacks and in their stores is done by a Moser clone), but who also works in watercolors, pen and ink, and other media. Some of his editions are monumental: though the quality of John Tenniel's Alice in Wonderland is undeniable, for our money Moser's annotated edition (and the accompanying Alice Through the Looking Glass) stands as one of the greatest illustrated books ever. Nearly as excellent are his editions of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Recently, British publisher Wandering Star decided that Robert E. Howard's work deserved to be treated to a set of exquisite illustrated books. (During the sixties, seventies, and eighties, Donald Grant produced his own high-quality editions of Howard's work, including Conan, but these are out of print.) The first of Wandering Star's editions is now available, and The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane is everything that a book lover (and Robert E. Howard fan) could have hoped for.Chicago artist Gary Gianni spent a year producing over two hundred-- yes, two hundred illustrations for this book. Spectrum readers will remember him as our feature interview in issue 15 (September 1998). At the time, what we saw and h e a r d about the book certainly sounded impressive; but of Huckleberry Finn. course it's one thing to be dazzled by a handful of promotional illustrations, and quite another to be moved by the finished product.The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane is, quite simply, the finest illustrated book we've seen in a long, long time. The love for the material is obvious from both Gianni and the publisher. Kane (as, again, our readers may remember) is a sixteenth/seventeenth century wandering Puritan soldier who flees England to escape the persecution that Queen Elizabeth is inflicting upon his faith. At least that's what he tells himself; just as important is his innate restlessness. He refuses to sit idly by while evil takes hold in the world: he will take the battle to the enemy: \\"I work the will of God. While evil flourishes and wrongs grow rank, while men are persecuted and women wronged, while weak things, human or animal, are maltreated, there is no rest for me beneath the skies, nor peace at any board or bed.\\" [For more details on the Solomon Kane stories, see our article in issue 15.)What Gianni has managed to do is capture the passion and intensity of the character and the stories and translate them into paintings and pen and ink drawings. The color work pays appropriate tribute to N.C. Wyeth, which is not a bad place to start. Perhaps what stands out most about these paintings is the extraordinary sense of design--elements aren't merely tossed haphazardly onto the canvas, but placed. One such work is deceptively simple: Kane stands over his vanquished, winged creature and looks skyward as more prepare to attack (this is the painting that was the model for the Randy Bowen Kane sculpture). One of the things that sets this apart from your run-of-the-mill sword and sorcery paperback cover is the care Gianni used to intertwine the two main characters. The monster is practically wrapped around Kane, creating a tension and menace that normally would not come from a dead body. It is as if the Khyber Rifles creature has Kane planted to the ground (the monster's arm covers both of Kane's feet), holding him until the winged demons in flight can attack and prevail upon the Puritan.Another intriguing work, from a formal standpoint, is a scene of Kane on some stairs facing off against a group of pirates below. No matter where the eye starts, Gianni makes sure it moves in a way that provides the viewer with all the information. For us for starting point always seems to be the side of the staircase because it's the brightest large area in the painting. From there the eye goes up the left side of the painting to the archway, where it crosses a second arch behind it. This leads down to the gun in Solomon Kane's right hand. The arm leads up to his face. From there, the painting has three parallel lines of action (the shadow of Kane's left arm on the wall: the arm itself holding the gun: and Kane's left leg pointing to the stairs), all leading to the man at the bottom of the stairs. From there the eye sweeps around the bottom of the painting to the mass of pirates holding the woman hostage, until you're back where you began.We don't mean to turn this review into a meticulous art appreciation course, but when an artist takes the effort to compose a picture instead of merely cranking it out, it deserves at least a slight pause to admire the work. And yet as good as the color plates are, they actually pale beside the black and white work. Gianni perfectly translates Howard's words into illustrations. In fact, considering the stories themselves, black and white is probably more appropriate for the artwork, anyway. (It's a testament to Gianni's ability that he can put splashes of bright color onto the paintings without ruining the mood established in the stories.)With the pen and ink drawings, it's easy to trace Gianni's lineage. Primary is Roy Krenkel, whose book The Sowers of the Thunder (Donald Grant, 1973; later reprinted in paperback by Zebra Books, 1975) provided the blueprint for the design of Savage Tales. Krenkel's scratchy pen drawings burst with energy, and his association with Frank Frazetta and Al Williamson provided EC comic book readers with some of the greatest comic art in history. Krenkel himself was an admirer of (among others) Franklin Booth, the influential and extraordinary turn-of-the-century illustrator who managed to create meticulous woodcut effects with pen and ink drawings. Krenkel also admired Booth's contemporary, Joseph Clement Coll, whose dazzling pen and ink work decorated numerous adventure stories. Gianni's comic book work owes an obvious debt to Michael Kaluta (himself a Krenkel Frazetta/Williamson fan), whose Shadow comics contain some of the best pulp-related illustrations ever. (Years later, Gianni would also draw Shadow comics.) Ironically, Kaluta himself illustrated a couple of Howard books The Lost Valley of Iskander: The Swords of Shahrazar; Fax Collector's Editions) in the mid-seventies.Gianni's Solomon Kane looks a lot like the Shadow, in fact, except for the large white collar: dressed all in black, with a large hat and sometimes a long coat, too. In many drawings the coat snaps about in the wind-- Gianni uses it to make the reader feel the windy African plains. Likewise the reader can feel the oppressive heat and dusty environs. The artist makes the land come alive, whether it's the ancient cities buried away in the jungles, the ruthless pirates, or the hideous monsters. If any complaint could be leveled at Gianni, it is that at times he put too much work into some of the drawings that appear too small for the reader to appreciate the abundance of detail. Crowd scenes, for instance, are rendered with such care that at times we wanted a quarter-page illustration to be given an entire page just so we could better appreciate Gianni's art. Of course, if every drawing were reproduced as large as we wished, the book's page count would explode and make the price prohibitive.Aside from the artwork, the quality of the book itself is phenomenal. The cloth cover and stitch binding should provide durability that will allow for numerous re-readings (and purchasers will want to re-read these stories). The gilt-edged top matches the gold-embossed front cover that includes the title of the book, a drawing of Solomon Kane, and a facsimile signature of Robert E. Howard's, (The gold looks beautiful set against the dark blue cloth.) The dust jacket cover reproduces another Gianni painting, and yet another painting appears on the embossed slipcase that holds the book.Production statistics aside, it's what's inside the book that counts, and here the publisher has carefully designed every aspect. Because of the number of illustrations that Gianni created, every double-page spread of text has at least one drawing, and often two (again, much like Krenkel's Sowers of the Thunder). Moreover, Gianni, like Krenkel, has designed an \\"icon\\" for each main story that appears throughout that story on the upper right hand page: a sword for \\"Red Shadows\\": a skeleton peeking from around a door for \\"Rattle of Bones\\": a sword, dagger, and pistol for \\"The Blue Flame of Vengeance\\"; Kane's famous \\"cat-head\\" staff for \\"The Hills of the Dead\\": and so on.Gianni has written a brief forward to the book introducing the reader to the material. Following that comes a short essay of appreciation for Howard by H.P. Lovecraft. After the stories, Rusty Burke has written a short biography of Howard, And the final section of the appendix contains an extravagance that perhaps only we at Spectrum can appreciate: a word-by-word comparison of the stories as they were originally published in Weird Tales (or elsewhere) versus Howard's manuscripts-- a comma removed here, a hyphen there, etc. It's not that we're going to compare all this, line by line, to the stories in this book. But it shows that Wandering Star was obsessive about being as faithful to Howard as possible. We like that. Finally, every book in the 1050-copy print run is numbered and signed by Gianni.A couple of bonuses are included in the volume. The first is a folder that includes an extra set of plates. It's a nice addition, though. we're not sure what to do with them except put them in the slipcase next to the book that reproduces the same art. Perhaps less fanatical collector-types would tack them to the wall or something. More extraordinary is a twelve-minute CD that includes a reading of Howard's Solomon Kane poems with a musical score. The reading is by Paul Blake, and the music by Paul and Michael Berrow, Peter Dale, Roger Taylor, and Jake Roberts. When we saw advance announcements listing the CD, we braced ourselves: just how much effort would be put into a limited pressing? Well, Blake's vocal rendering is marvelous, and it is complemented quite nicely by the music. The best is \\"Solomon Kane's Homecoming.\\" Not only is it the best of Howard's Kane poems (and one of his best poems overall), but its alternating long, soaring high notes and low, metronomic rhythmic beats create a film score-worthy soundtrack that captures both Kane's glorious God-inspired victories and his treks through dark jungles in the heart of darkness.So is The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane the ultimate Kane book? Its competition are the editions of Red Shadows released by Donald Grant, a 1968 version (reprinted in 197 1) with magnificent illustrations by Jeff Jones, and a 1978 version with all-new Jones art. The first edition is primitive by Grant's later standards-- it is small (5\\" x 7.5\\") and contains only four interior paintings and two very small black and white illustrations. The '78 edition is a more elegant affair-the book is larger (6.5\\" x 9.5\\") and contains nine interior paintings, three drawings, plus new dust jacket art.Savage Tales does contain two pieces not in Red Shadows, the fragment \\"Death's Black Riders,\\" and more importantly a variant version of \\"Solomon Kane's Homecoming.\\" The design of the entire package-- from the number of illustrations to the slipcase-- also is first-rate. And if the artwork itself doesn't make us forget Jones's stunning earlier paintings, Gianni will surely forgive us, as Jones is one of America's greatest artists.Finally, there is good news ahead: Gianni is currently working on a follow-up for Wandering Star-- a deluxe edition of Robert E. Howard's Bran Mak Morn stories.The book retails for $150.(If you've never heard of Solomon Kane before and don't want to spend $150 to find out if you like the stories, check out the 1995 Baen Books paperback, Solomon Kane. If your tastes are anything like ours, you'll soon want the Wandering Star hardcover as your permanent library edition.)RATING: * * * * *"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"....he made me root for a Roundhead (well...most of the time anyway)!

Howard was a gifted writer and Kane one of his unique creations!p.s. To any Howard scholars out there, examine Howards religiosity in the light of Kane. The stories seem to have a sense of religious recombination or perhaps better, they might give some insights into Howards Journey to Rome. \\"Chapter\\" headings by Chesterton (an amazing Catholic convert/apologist/writer) and a Puritan utilizing the Catholic concept of Purgatory?

Fell apart before first reading was over. Good advertisement for Kindle, but I like a book in my hand, not a computer."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I'm not going to review the stories. Go to a literary criticism site if you need to be told what someone else thinks of them before you read them yourself. For my part I felt caught up in the action and ran the risk of passing my stop when I read from the book during my commute, so vivid and engrossing did I find the narrative in these tales. Your mileage will certainly vary depending on your tastes, and the sensibilities of an author writing in the late 1920s may offend some.For those searching for background so they can run or play Solomon Kane-themed games, this is your encyclopedia.The book is well made, though I find most of today's paperback covers a bit on the flimsy side. Fortunately there are no \\"clever\\" marketing ploys like cutouts, so the book sits nicely in the hands and doesn't fight the reader or get snagged on clothing.The cover has a nice color plate depicting the hero, Solomon Kane, and inside there are lavish B&W; illustrations and four full-page B&W; plates produced specially for this volume. The artwork is nice, but positioned oddly in some places, in the middle of the text, forcing the reader to skip over the space taken up by the drawing, often during a tense action sequence. Why the art was placed like this is a mystery, since had it been to one side or the other the text could have flowed much cleaner. I found this distracting and drop a star for it.The text has been \\"restored\\" by an editorial team, and there are a few pages containing the details of the redactions for the keen collector or scholar of Howard's work.I almost forgot: There is a forward by the illustrator, and a memorial by H.P. Lovecraft written at the time of Howard's death that serves as an introduction of sorts to the book.Even though there is a lot of whitespace in this Trade Paperback (a trait of the format that makes me angry usually) the presence of the artwork makes good use of much of it and at least justifies the otherwise wasted tree. In this volume the whitespace serves to present the text and artwork beautifully (for the most part).All in all an excellent way to get to know Robert E. Howard's Puritan hero."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"In the harsh glare of 21st Century enlightenment, Robert E. Howard has done himself no favors. Racism, sexism, anarchism, and religious intolerance abound in his works. Still, I find that they inspire in spite of these elements, not because of them. Howard was a product of his time and place as much as the characters he created. In death, he need not apologize for his literary ignorance, and his fans should feel no need to justify their appreciation for his work.This volume contains the entirety of his Solomon Kane canon, so there's a fair share of story fragments and synopses. Still, the stories he completed more than make up for it. Yes, they're hokey and formulaic, but the emotion found in those words place them somewhere between Lovecraft's florid prose and the wall-to-wall action of his Conan work. There's an inherent melancholy and tragedy that runs through the stories, painting Solomon Kane as a flawed hero in a world that is moving on without him. He will not survive the coming period of enlightenment any more than the lost savage cities of Africa that he helps destroy. This self-awareness is what takes Solomon Kane beyond fanfic or adolescent wish fulfillment, and, to court blasphemy, makes him a stronger character than Conan.If you enjoy Stephen King's Roland from The Dark Tower series of books and comics, this is surely an inspiration to ol' Steve. If you like Conan but wish he had more depth, this is for you. Just lament that once you reach the end, there is no more.Oh, and while I'm notoriously gentle with books, I had no issues whatsoever with the binding despite taking it back and forth to work to read on my lunch break. I've never been a fan of the cellophane treatment that starts to peel away from the edges of these sorts of covers, but that's a problem that plagues many softcover books on my shelf from a variety of publishers, and hardly worthy of docking a star for. It still reads just fine."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"The 1 star rating is for the binding. Just like the other reviewer said, this book fell apart after only a couple days of reading it."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Disjointed stories. Some were not even complete. Writing was less than juvenile. Would not recommend to anyone who liked the recent movie."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Like many others, I first got acquainted with Howards work through Conan, and lamented the \\"readability coating\\" later added to his work by other authors (L. Sprague de Camp, Lynn Carter, etc). Solomon Kane's adventures forced me to review such opinion: they are dull and immature; a work in progress rather than a finished literary work (even by pulp fiction standards).In Conan's stories, Howard's narrative shortcomings are balanced by the fact that they play a role in the the course of the story. Conan brutishness, ethnocentrism and lack of scruples are understandable and even enjoyable in the excellent setting of the Hiborian Age.In Solomon Kane's saga, instead, the ethnocentric comments of the author seem totally gratuitous, the setting of the stories is unverisimilar, and half of the time one doesn't understand why the character acts like he does. One is willing to do an intellectual parenthesis for a congenial barbarian of a mythical era, but no so for a somber, socially handicapped and sanctimonious English Calvinst of the XVI century. The character never really connects.All of the above would be forgivable if the plots were engaging; unfortunately that's not the case, they are far-fetched and uninteresting.The black ink illustrations by Gari Gianni are the best part of the book: they are so good, that they almost succeed in conferring to the poor stories an aura of verisimilitude and decadence, in a way parallel to how Frazetta did with Conan.In my eyes, this book only for the very fans of Howard's, or some collector who might want to place the rest of his work in context, but it doesn't have much worth per se. But even this endeavor might be frustrated by the poor binding of the book: it literally comes apart in your hands.Gonzalo D&iacute;az"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"The gathering together of Robert E. Howard's stories into these collections, not only the one I am reviewing here but the others in the series as well, is not only an obvious labor of love to those who undertook the project, but an exercise in the preservation of some really worthy fiction that might easily have been lost to time. I truly enjoyed every story in this book, which served to introduce me to Howard's Kane tales. I'd unreservedly recommend this book and the other Howard titles to anyone who is a fan of R.E.H., who appreciates a good old fashioned sort of adventure yarn, or who knows anyone who does. A project like presenting high quality 1920s and 1930s pulp fiction material to today's market deserves support!"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Solomon Kane is definitely a different kind of hero cast in a different era. Although these stories were written some time ago, the character lives on to this day. Howard knows how to spin a tale that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat not suspecting what will happen next. Howard was a gifted and masterful storyteller taking an unlikely character to unlikely places and making you see and hear the action like it was really happening. Howard's tales of Kane are incredibly imaginative yet still feel true to form as if they could be real. He does a fantastic job of injecting enough realism to make the characters almost seem possible. This collection of stories also has some excellent illustrations that help carry the story and are very well. An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard is known today as the creator of Conan, but in his brief life he produced a number of singular characters for a variety of pulp fiction genres. One of his earlier and most distinctive was a grim-visaged, black-clad Puritan warrior named Solomon Kane.Many of Howard's creations, like Conan, have a catch-as-catch-can approach to morality, if they consider it at all. Not Kane.\\"It has fallen upon me, now and again in my sojourns through the world, to ease various evil men of their lives,\\" he explains in \\"The Castle Of The Devil\\" \\"Devil\\" is one of four story fragments that appear here along with nine full Kane stories and three poems.While not all of them are equally inspired, all resonate with the singularity of the main character, half-swashbuckler, half-fantasy hero, wandering through Europe and Africa following the call of God and his own willful urges.Two of the stories, the early \\"Red Shadows\\" (1928) and the later \\"Wings Of The Night\\" (1932) are first-rank Howard stories, masterpieces of mood and pulsing suspense. \\"Shadows\\" gives us a classic revenge tale served up with style, while \\"Wings\\" is a complex character study that pits Kane against a rare defeat. Two others, \\"The Footfalls Within\\" (1931) and \\"The Hills Of The Dead\\" (1930), are just a cut below, not as well-crafted but imbued with that Howard quality of primitive power that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.Add to that some other stories that, while pat at times (see \\"A Rattle Of Bones\\") and convoluted at others (\\"Skulls In The Stars\\"), have flashes of the same dark power. Kane isn't evil; in fact he's something of a maniacal do-gooder. In \\"Footfalls\\" he gets so caught up watching helplessly as a line of blacks are force-marched into slavery he bites down on his forearm \\"until his teeth met in the flesh\\". Other stories have him spending years chasing down the murderers of women and villagers he never knew in life.This book is the first time all the known Solomon Kane items have been collected in one place. Publisher Del Ray does even better by employing the talents of illustrator Gary Gianni from first page to last. Too bad they don't mirror their sterling Conan collections with some Kane-focused scholarly essays. All that's offered instead is a general biography on Howard and a contemporary obituary by his friend and fellow legend H.P. Lovecraft.That Howard could be a purple writer is evident here at times, like with the frustrating, overlong \\"Moon Of Skulls\\" with its half-baked lost-civilization theme. He could frustrate just as much with what he didn't write. \\"The Castle Of The Devil\\" sets up to be his best European-set adventure before abruptly stopping. \\"Hawk Of Basti\\" catches up with Kane for a rare ocean-borne adventure Howard also didn't finish. Even the poems seem misplaced stories.Howard's sudden death in 1936 cheated us of further Kane adventures, though Howard himself had apparently dropped the character well before then. Given the progression of Howard's art in his last short years, with its sturdier plot construction and cinematic scene changes, one can only wonder what else might have been possible.What is here is good all the same, an entertaining corrective for those who think Howard only wrote for barbarians."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Solomon Kane, the Puritan avenger. I loved the character from the moment I heard of him. He cuts quite a dashing figure despite, or perhaps because of his somber mode of dress. Kane is not very representative of Puritans, but he nonetheless embodies the stereotype quite well. Fanatical in personality, unadorned in both speech and deportment, and convinced of the absolute sovereignty of God.\\"He never sought to analyze his motives and he never wavered once his mind was made up. Though he always acted on impulse, he firmly believed that all his actions were governed by cold and logical reasonings. He was a man born out of his time--a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan, though the last assertion would have shocked him unspeakably. An atavist of the days of blind chivalry he was, a knight-errant in the somber clothes of a fanatic. A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, and urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things, avenge all crimes against right and justice. Wayward and restless as the wind, he was consistent in only one respect--he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such was Solomon Kane.\\"I think the most remarkable facet of his personality is his steadfastness. Swashbuckling heroes of penny dreadfuls typically wield a sword pretty well, but Kane is completely incorruptible. There is simply no point in trying to tempt him because he knows God always triumphs in the end, so there is no point in delaying the inevitable. In fact, he might as well just get on with killing the wicked and be done with it.My favorite story of the collection is Wings in the Night. Kane finds the remnant of a colony of harpies driven south into Africa by Jason in the Age of Heroes. He fights off an attack by the harpies, and badly wounded, recuperates in a local village that has been forced to offer up a sacrifice from amongst themselves in exchange for the protection afforded by the proximity of the harpies against the more vicious tribes living nearby. Initially, the village enjoys a period of respite because the harpies fear Kane, but eventually they simply decide to massacre the villagers for sport whilst avoiding Kane as best they can.Uncharacteristically, Kane curses the heavens for the cruelty of the world, because the villagers had placed a naive trust in him that he knew would come to naught. Yet he could not leave them to the harpies, and he did not have the weapons to overcome the harpies' superior numbers, so he simply waited until doom arrived. Kane of course cleanses the earth of the vile creatures, the but the cost is terrible. There is no attempt to justify this in the name of a greater good or explain God's ways to man, Kane simply avenges the fallen and moves on.An interesting facet of the Kane stories is the idea that the old magic is fading away from the world. Kane, being a tool of God's justice, always defeats the evil creatures he finds before him, even when greater men than he have previously failed. Like the work of his friend Lovecraft, the world of Solomon Kane is full of dark magic that is literally incomprehensible to mere men, but unlike Lovecraft's worlds, justice does indeed prosper at the hands of Solomon Kane. I was reminded of Tim Powers' The Drawing of the Dark and The Anubis Gates.In both of these books, strange magic lingers from the early ages of the world, but the reign of magic over the Earth has been forever broken, even though a vestige of its former power remains. For Powers, there is indeed a pivotal act in history that has rendered everything forever different, and there is a likeness to be seen in Solomon Kane. Kane vanquishes a demon sealed away in East Africa by King Solomon himself, precisely because he is a lesser man than King Solomon. Unlike his namesake, Kane serves faithfully, and so can now vanquish what was formerly merely restrained.Thus it is somehow fitting that several of the Kane stories remained unfinished, because Kane himself was about completing unfinished business."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"In many ways, Solomon Kane is R E Howard's most intriguing character. As dark and conflicted as his creator and as brilliantly conceived as one could hope, Solomon Kane leaps off the page in the stories and poems presented in this collection. As with the previous editions, the editors make no changes to Howard's work aside from cleaning up typos and deleting all pastiche material. As for the quality of the stories themselves, while all are readable, some are simply outstanding. Red Shadows (originally titled by Howard Solomon Kane but later retitled by him upon submission to Weird Tales) and Wings in the Night are the standouts here. Each shows Howard's puritan fanatic at his most vengeful, and each displays mistakes made by the protagonist, giving him a more human, identifiable feel. As an added bonus, the duel at the end of Red Shadows is simply breathtaking. All of the other stories, while not as accomplished as these two, are well worth the read. As is well known by connoisseurs of his work, Howard was an accomplished poet as well as a brilliant prose writer, and this shows both in the lengthy poems centering on Solomon (of which, Solomon Kane's Homecoming is the moody best) and in the shorter poems he appended to some of the stories. Adding to this wealth of riches is H P Lovecraft's In Memoriam, written shortly after howard's untimely suicide, as well as brilliant artwork capturing strikingly Howard's vision of 16th Century Europe and Africa. Unfortunately for some unaccountable reason, the editors did not see fit to provide us with an essay placing Solomon Kane in context of Howard's broader work or detailing to us the various physical, emotional, and economic situations that caused Howard to write his characters in certain ways as they have done with all the other collections in this series. For that reason alone, I can't give the book five stars. Still, for all the above reasons, this is a phenomenal read anyone willing to give it a try should enjoy."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"It is often lamented (esp. by the senior citizens) that \\"good-old\\" things of the past are not to be found nowadays, since the taste has gone to \\"dogs\\"! I do not belong to that age-group, but after reading works of R.E.Howard I am finding everything else, esp. the so-called \\"saga\\"-s/\\"chronicles\\"/\\"epics\\" that have flooded the fantasy market with their herculean size and very high percentage of broodings & ponderings, absolutely stale. It is true that these works may not be politically correct as per the prevalent norms, but they are very high on entertainment quotient, for which purpose they had been written and they are read. The narratives are swiftly paced, the characters are drawn in bold strokes of white and (mostly) black with magnanimous splashes of red, and the descriptions are absolutely breathtaking. I don't know exactly how Howard had developed his vocabulary and syntactical style, but every time I read any of his works (esp. those concerning Solomon Kane) I am amazed anew as to why nobody else could ever attain the height that he scaled again-and-again. Dear readers, please give yourself a break from the masochistic pleasures of reading the works of the present-day pretenders, and read the originals. They will blow your mind!The only reason for which I deducted a star was because I had expected Del Ray to append the portions written by Ray Bradbury et.al. to complete the fragments left behind by Howard, and that expectation was not fulfilled. If you are not having any such expectations, then buy this book and give yourself a 5-star treat!"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"It is a mistake to write off the character of Solomon Kane as simply being a Puritan fanatic. It is inaccurate and an injustice. It is a strange sort of fanatic that hates the inquisition and the witch hunters, as much as, he does necromancers and murderers. Kane is in the ancient British and Irish tradition of a man who goes forth to wander the world after he receives the call- guided solely by his deep inner trust in his God. That is why he can walk the dark and wild places of the earth unscathed. That is why monsters and devils hold no terror for him. He simply trusts in the Lord to guide him to where he can do the most good. Kane is a Puritan in the original sense of the word, a single individual that has no tolerance for corruption whether it exists in the World- or the Church. He doesn't preach, for he doesn't need to- his actions, and his sword, speak for him. He needs no priest to mediate between himself and his Creator. Kane has gone beyond faith, for his is the sure and implacable knowledge that God exists. This is what makes him such a dangerous foe- you can't scare him and you can't make a deal with him. He obeys only the inner voice that guides him. I can see why the weak and corrupt would paint such a man as a fanatic.Solomon Kane was Howard's first creation. In my opinion, he was also his best. There is an element present here that is missing from the later characters- something higher.It is a joy to see these stories reprinted again in a single volume- with illustration and design worthy of the subject."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"If you think Conan is Howard's best do yourself a favor and read 'Solomon Kane'. I only wish Howard could have written more. This book has all of Howard's Solomon Kane stories unedited, &amp; some great illustrations on almost every page. And one of the stories 'The Footfalls Within' is in its original form for the first time since it was published in the 1930s. A great value for the price."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Just wanted fans to know - an excellent movie has been made of Solomon Kane. I've only read bits and pieces of Kane, but am a huge Conan fan. I'll say this - in this film, they've captured Howard like nothing since Conan the Barbarian, and even better. It is an amazing film, great action, and some set pieces that absolutely SCREAM RE Howard. Get online, try to find it, and pressure someone, anyone, to distribute it. It is a blast, and really sets up the character for an ongoing series of films. This is what Hollywood should be making, not Rush Hour 99, or whatever."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Well read Solomon Kane tales, by an excellent reader. A must have for the long road trips should you be a R.E. Howard fan. There was a problem getting the Cds to play and it required the download of another reader. Otherwise, it is a great compilation."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"&quot;The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane&quot; collects together all the unedited, original stories and poems about the puritan adventurer and fantasy hero Solomon Kane. Author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) created many classic fantasy heroes in the pulp magazines of the 1920s and 30s, such as Conan the Cimmerian, and Solomon Kane is one of his most unique and intriguing creations for modern readers. Solomon Kane appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; Magazine, and his stories combined swashbuckling adventure with supernatural horrors. Howard describes Kane as a &quot;fanatic,&quot; who is called by God to travel the world destroying evil. Kane is compulsive, obsessive, grim, and will NOT be swayed from his quest. He encounters sword-swinging villains, vile black magic, and hideous creatures as his wanders the globe in his ceaseless crusade.If you haven't heard of Solomon Kane, buy this book immediately and fall into a world of action, horror, history, and the fantastic -- all centered on this vengeful and driven Puritan swordsman of the late 16th/early 17th century. The stories are presented un-edited, which means the inclusion of many racial stereotypes and attitudes prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s.This paperback is a reprint of an expensive limited-edition hardback. Aside from the stories themselves, it includes all of Howard's unfinished fragments. Earlier editions had author Ramsey Campbell finish these incomplete stories, but I prefer to read them exactly as Howard left them. Fabulous black and white illustrations by Gary Gianni adorn almost every page, scattered around the borders of the text, with an occasional full-page illustration. Gianni has an unerring eye for period detail, and his envisioning of Solomon Kane is dead-on. For the reference of new readers, the editors include two essays on Howard's life. First, a memoriam written by H. P. Lovecraft (who corresponded with Howard for years) on the occasion of Howard's suicide in 1936. Second, scholar Rusty Burke provides a short but information overview of the Howard's life. For the extremist, there is also an appendix of textual notes on the stories.Here are the stories, fragments, and poems you will find inside...SKULLS IN THE STARS: Solomon Kane finds a wraith-like monster guarding a lonely road in rural England. A short spooky tale; a good introduction to the character.THE RIGHT HAND OF DOOM: A condemned wizard seeks revenge on the man who betrayed him. This is very short piece, more like a vignette, and Kane has only a small role in the story.RED SHADOWS: (Originally published as &quot;Solomon Kane&quot;) Kane vows vengeance against a bandit who killed a girl, and chases him into Africa, where he encounters sinister magic and furious swordplay. A real mini-epic, with Howard's word magic at its best.RATTLE OF BONES: In the Black Forest of Germany, Kane finds a mysterious inn with a hideous secret. A fine, short horror piece.CASTLE OF THE DEVIL: (Fragment) Solomon Kane decides to investigate a tyrannical baron. Only four pages were completed.DEATH'S BLACK RIDERS: (Fragment) Kane meets a shadowy ghost rider on the road. Howard completed only a page.THE MOON OF SKULLS: The longest story -- almost a short novel! To rescue a kidnapped girl, Kane enters a lost city in Africa lorded over by an evil queen.THE ONE BLACK STAIN: A four-page poem where Solomon Kane meets Sir Francis Drake. Unusual and stirring.THE BLUE FLAME OF VENGEANCE: (Previously titled &quot;Blades of the Brotherhood&quot;) On another vengeance trail, Solomon Kane battles pirates on the English coast. There's no fantasy element -- it's a straightforward historical action tale -- but Howard's fiery writing makes this one of the best stories.THE HILLS OF THE DEAD: Deep in Africa again, Kane joins forces with a shaman to take on a horde of the walking dead.HAWK OF BASTI: (Fragment) A good start to a story, but the manuscript stops just as it gets interesting. Kane delves deeper into the jungles to find a tyrannical lost civilization.THE RETURN OF SIR RICHARD GRENVILLE: Two-page poem, with Kane fighting side by side with a ghost.WINGS IN THE NIGHT: In the best story of all, Kane battles a race of bloodthirsty winged humanoids on an African plateau. Howard's writing reaches levels of feverish, raw madness, creating an intense experience. A fine example of his passionate style and theme of affirming life through seemingly hopeless struggle.THE FOOTFALLS WITHIN: Another superb story, which will appeal to fans of horror writer (and Howard pen-pal) H. P. Lovecraft. Slavers capture Solomon Kane, but they have an unpleasant rendezvous with an ancient crypt that imprisons something that should not be disturbed. Howard delves deep into dread and primordial terror in this one.THE CHILDREN OF ASSHUR: (Fragment) Kane stumbles across a lost city of Assyrians. This is a lengthy fragment, about thirty pages, and might have been a one of the best stories if Howard had finished it.SOLOMON KANE'S HOMECOMING: (Poem) After years of wandering, our puritan hero comes back to England and remembers some of his adventures. This short poem is the perfect way to end the saga of Solomon Kane, and is reprinted here in two versions.&quot;The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane&quot; is a volume not to be missed for fans of fantasy, pulp literature, and historical adventure. If you've only read Howard's Conan stories, here's your chance to expand to one of his other brilliant creations in a beautiful volume."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Long before Robert Howard conceived of Conan there was Solomon Kane. A Puritan Englishman from the 16th century, Kane wandered the earth with no particular destination in mind but where God should send him. Like all of Howard's characters, Kane is an adventurer, but unusual in that he sees himself as a tool of God's justice. And it is a very Puritanical God indeed that Kane serves. This is not a God of mercy but one who destroys all evil in His path, using Solomon Kane as his tool.I must confess that I like these stories even more than the Conan tales. Solomon Kane is a driven character with a brooding personality I find more appealing than Conan. This book contains all the published stories about Kane and six previously unpublished manuscripts from the Glenn Lord collection. As with the other Robert Howard books published by Del Rey, this one includes superb illustrations. The frontspiece by Gary Gianni perfectly captures Kane's grim visage.Anyone who enjoys reading the old pulp adventure tales should get this book. Howard was a true master of the genre. The stories, poetry, and essay on Howard by H.P. Lovecraft are all great reads now just as when they were first published. My favorite pieces are the fragment &quot;Castle of the Devil,&quot; &quot;Rattle of Bones,&quot; and the poem &quot;The One Black Stain&quot; which places Kane with Sir Francis Drake. But you can hardly go wrong with any part of this book."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Solomon Kane... pious servant of God, adventurer, death dealer. Evil must perish from this earth, and with a curse an oath to God was sworn. It is his quest and his curse. These aren't your typical good versus evil stories. They contain within them, for those willing to look, the characteristic complexity, and hypocrisy, of human nature that is found throughout Robert E. Howard's body of work. Solomon Kane battles men, monsters, sorcery... and himself.The Solomon Kane stories broke new, artistic ground on many levels, but perhaps the most significant breakthrough dealt with what Robert E. Howard is most known for in modern times... the father of the literary genre Sword and Sorcery. The Solomon Kane stories were the first modern Sword and Sorcery, and Kane the first Sword and Sorcery character (published in 1928). These stories blended for the first time historical advetnure, fantasy, and supernatural horror in modern prose. Not only excellent stories, but the first of their kind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"As the greatest writer of yarns of pure adventure, Howard's stories are excellently paced and never drag. They grab you by your throat upon the first page and don't let go.Solomon Kane is one of the more likeable characters from Howard's typewriter. Like Conan, he is a praeternaturally strong fighter. There's just enough psychoanalyzing in here to make him interesting. Kane is a \\"Puritan,\\" but Kane's Puritanism means in essence that he imagines himself the instrument of God's predestined vengeance upon the unworthy and unholy, that he might \\"ease them from their lives.\\" In the grip of a grim wanderlust, he is the kinsman of the Wandering Jew, or of Melmoth the Wanderer. His determination is not for his own sake. Unlike Conan, he is driven by more than a will to survive; he is doing the Lord's will.I suspect that Kane is less well known than Conan largely because many of Kane's tales take place in the Africa of pulp fiction, full of witch doctors and violently sensual tribal empresses. This sort of thing makes people in the twenty-first century understandably nervous. The daintily politically correct will not have the stomach for this, and people with a jaundiced eye towards racial politics are sure to find many faults; but then these people are unlikely to get a taste for classic pulp adventure. It isn't as bad as you fear in any case. Kane's righteousness is such that he willingly unsheaths his sword in defence of Black people as White: this redeems Kane from the worst accusations that could be laid at his charge.The illustrations are nicely done in an appropriately classical style. Howard's prose is presented without serious editing or tinkering, and the apparatus notes any serious variations."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard is most famous for his character Conan. However, Howard was writing adventure characters long before Conan. Among the more popular of these is his English Puritan swordsman, Solomon Kane.Kane is definitely an interesting character. He shares certain traits with Conan, including fighting skill, a love of adventure, and a nefarious past. Unlike Conan, Kane is a far more righteous in his motivations. While Conan was never evil, he was definitely a man who allowed himself to be ruled by his passions. He did what he believed necessary for his survival. If that happened to be the right thing, so much the better. If he engaged in thievery (which he often did), he did so without hesitation. Kane's passions are more submerged, obscured by his hatred of what he believes to be \\"evil\\". He hunts murderers, thieves, and demons because he wishes to inflict punishment on them.The tales found in this volume are all terrific. While some are better than others, not once did I feel like I had wasted my time upon reaching the end of a story, which is always a possibility while reading an anthology. Howard's imagery is vivid, as Kane chases ghosts and fights duels in England, and pursues French bandits, evil kingdoms, and flying monsters in Africa. The stories are by turns funny, exhilarating, chilling, and creepy, and always satisfying. While Howard's prose had its \\"purple\\" moments, he never takes the reader out of the story by overwriting.The only real complaint I have with this volume is aimed at its editors. The first Conan collection included a couple of essays that examined how Howard created Conan, the nature of Conan cycle of stories, and general insights into Howard's state of mind. \\"Solomon Kane\\" has no such essays. This is unfortunate, as some of the stories in this volume are unfinished fragments, without any explanation for why Howard never finished them. Some insight into why Howard departed slightly from his more usual \\"barbarian\\" approach with the Puritan Kane (although, the \\"Anglo-Saxon Barbarian\\" is always just below the surface) would have been nice.However, this is a minor concern that in no way reduces enjoyment of this volume, or its rating. It is excellent."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Just a few words about the Kindle edition of this book.This is - by far - the best kindle edition of any book I have yet bought.

Howard. Howard, a native of Texas and best known perhaps for creating the Conan character, was a fascinating adventure author who incorporated much of his love of history, Celtic lore, exotic locales, and Atlantean myth in his stories. Howard was a friend and correspondent of H. P. Lovecraft and together their work forms a unique contribution to pulp literature, much of it being printed in the pulp magazine _Weird Tales_. Solomon Kane was an early creation of Howard's and is quite a unique character. He is at once an English Puritan \\"fanatic\\" seeking to do God's work on earth by avenging the righteous and \\"easing evil men of their lives\\" and a landless wanderer who roams the earth. Howard describes Kane as \\"a strange blending of Puritan and Cavalier, with a touch of the ancient philosopher, and more than a touch of the pagan . . . A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things . . . Wayward and restless as the wind, he was consistent in only one respect - he was true to his ideals of justice and right. Such was Solomon Kane.\\" In these stories, Kane seeks to protect the innocents or avenge the lives of dying girls battling monsters and dark forces as well as darker men. Many of the tales take place in the Dark Continent of Africa, where black magic (the power of voodoo and ju-ju) are unleashed upon the land. Kane faces classic villains such as Le Loup (a dastardly French swordsmen who slays a girl who Kane avenges), Queen Nakari (an African vampiress queen), and the Fishhawk and the Brotherhood of pirates. The stories also features a tale of long ago races, including the last of the race of Atlantis. (Indeed, the Atlantean myth was to play a central role throughout Howard's stories.) In some of the later tales, Kane encounters the ju-ju man N'Longa who gives him a special staff with magical powers. This staff which is topped with the head of a cat plays an important role in some of the later stories in this collection. Many have already noted that Howard's tales are certainly not politically correct, although it must be noted that within the tales Kane defends both blacks and whites from monsters and avenges both races equally. Howard's view of Africa was very much a product of his time, and these tales show the conflict between the black and white races. Solomon Kane on the other hand is an individual motivated by the highest traditions of chivalry and honor.This book includes a brief tribute \\"In Memoriam\\" by H. P. Lovecraft written after Howard's tragic suicide. The book also includes the following stories and poems (some of them fragments):\\"Skulls in the Stars\\"\\"The Right Hand of Doom\\"\\"Red Shadows\\"\\"Rattle of Bones\\"\\"The Castle of the Devil\\"\\"Death's Black Riders\\"\\"The Moon of Skulls\\"\\"The One Black Stain\\"\\"The Blue Flame of Vengeance\\"\\"The Hills of the Dead\\"\\"Hawk of Basti\\"\\"The Return of Sir Richard Grenville\\"\\"Wings in the Night\\"\\"The Footfalls Within\\"\\"The Children of Asshur\\"\\"Solomon Kane's Homecoming\\"\\"Solomon Kane's Homecoming (Variant)\\"The book also includes a brief biography of Robert E. Howard, showing his life as a writer cut short by an all-too-tragic and early death. The book is illustrated by Gary Gianni.Solomon Kane represents a unique figure in pulp literature, a swashbuckling English Puritan motivated by a desire to see God's justice and vengeance upon the earth. Howard's writing is superb and his historical, geographical, and anthropological knowledge is shown throughout. Howard was widely read in these areas and this book is sure to provide enjoyment to those who enjoy a good tale of swashbuckling adventure set in exotic locations."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard, the Creator of Conan the Barbarian, brings you nine action packed tales of the occult, featuring Solomon Kane. Kane is a puritan adventurer who feels like he is doing God's will. He wanders the world during the 17th Century and vanquishes evil with a sword and two pistols. His unwavering faith fuels his drive and determination as he protects the weak from evil men, evil spirits, and evil beasts.Robert E. Howard knows how to write a hero, action, and horror. Solomon Kane is a force of reckoning, the action is exciting, and the horror is chilling. If you like a mix of Heroic, Epic, and Dark Fantasy, you really need to buy this book.The book itself is 432 pages and contains stories, fragments of stories, poems, and a biography of Robert E. Howard. At the cover price of $16.95 or the Amazon Price of $11.53, this is a great deal.There is horror, gore, and violence, so you might want to use discretion if you are getting it for pre-teens.Warning:These are the original works from the 1920's and 1930's, so they are racist and sexist. Africans are simple savages with spears and bones through their noses that will drop down and worship anybody with a boom stick. Women are helpless damsels in distress that swoon, faint, or swoon then faint.Overall:The book is really worth buying if you have any interest in swashbuckling tales of adventure.Buy it if you like authors like David Gemmell or H.P. Lovecraft.Buy it if you like manly men that take care of business like Conan, Indiana Jones, or Van Helsing.Buy it if you like spooky stuff like spirits, demons, and the unknown.Avoid it if you can't handle violence or gore.Avoid it if you want loads of dialogue. Solomon is a man of action.Avoid it if the mentality of the 1920's may offend you."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Damon Knight once wrote that Robert E. Howard \\"had the maniac's advantage of believing everything he wrote\\" (19), which gave his works a kind of credibility. Knight was writing about Conan, but he could just as easily have been referring to Solomon Kane, a character first invented by Howard when he was in high school. The prose of Howard's stories might be purple, and the plots might be preposterous. But his swashbuckling hero has a life that allows him to sweep through the action and to carry the day.Captain Solomon Kane, for those not in the know, is a black-robed, slouch-hatted Puritan swordsman living in Elizabethan times. I can't say that I would love to have him for my next-door neighbor. He has no more sense of humor than the proverbial skeleton at the feast. And he has no sense of tact or diplomacy. He never lies. Moreover, he is just the sort of fellow who might decide that he knows what is good for me-- and set about correcting my flaws with a fanatic's zeal. But if I were being plagued with a surfeit of wizards, demons, pirates, or vampire queens... Well, Solomon Kane is a good man to have around. He has a long record of assisting such characters into death with his rapier, his flintlock pistols, or his powerful hands.It might be tempting to say that Kane never has a milimicrosecond's moment of doubt or temptation from his ideals. But that would not be strictly true. Here he is when an African queen offers him the chance to be king alongside her:Solomon's brain reeled. Perhaps it was the woman's fierce magnetic personality, the dynamic power she instilled in her fiery words, but at the moment her wild plan seemed not at all wild and impossible. Lurid and chaotic visions flamed through the Puritan's brain-- Europe torn by civil and religious strife, betrayed by her rulers, tottering-- aye, Europe was in desperate straits now, and might prove an easy victim for some strong savage race of conquerors. What man can truthfully say that in his heart there lurks not a yearning for power and conquest? (109)Howard indicates over and over that there are darker motives for Kane's actions than he is willing to acknowledge. He sometimes has flashes of rage and loses his icy self-control. He sometimes has visions that seem to be primitive racial memories of an earlier time. And sometimes -- as here-- there are moments of temptation. They don't last. But they are there.I rather like the longish, rambling stories the best-- the ones that have lots of captures and escapes, reversals and counter-reversals, and twists and turns. These are the ones that usually stretch out for a fairly long period of time and which have villains named Le Loup, the Gorilla Killer, Nakari, the Atlantan Priest, and Jonas Hardraker the Fishhawk. Stories of this sort include \\"Red Shadows,\\" \\"The Moon of Skulls,\\" \\"Blue Flames of Vengeance,\\" and \\"Wings in the Night\\". Some stories like \\"Skulls in the Stars\\" and \\"Rattle of Bones\\" are short, tight, and competent-- but much too quickly resolved for my taste. Other stories like \\"The Right Hand of Doom\\" are merely short and predictable. \\"The One Black Stain\\" is a piece of doggeral about the encounter between Kane and Sir Francis Drake. It is mildly entertaining.\\"Castle of the Devil,\\" \\"Death's Black Riders,\\" and \\"Hawk of Basti\\" are fragments. Some paperback collections used versions of these stories that were completed by Ramsey Campbell. Campbell is a good writer, and he did a credible job. But I am something of a purist. I would rather see the fragments alone, for all their limitations. The editors of this book have kept the fragments in their original form._The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane_ (1998) is a treat for the reader. It contains the stories, poems, and fragments listed above-- and others as well. It has a generous number of marvelous illustrations by Gary Gianni. It has H.P. Lovecraft's memorial tribute to Howard from _Weird Tales_. It has a good biographical essay by Howard scholar Rusty Burke. It has a generous section of bibliographical notes. You will not find classical literary writing in these pages. But you will find some full-blooded, colorful, imaginative pulp writing. It is great fun."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Dressed in black with the tall slouch-hat typical of Puritan fashion, and armed with sword, flint-locks, and, later, an ancient carved staff, Solomon Kane stalks the 16th century world from the remote reaches of Europe to the bloody decks of the high seas, and into the deepest, darkest African jungles. Whether it be a witch-cursed monstrosity, hell-spawned vampire, mutant throw-back, or just a wicked wretch of humankind, Solomon Kane will fight with equal determination and enthusiasm to see good triumph.Robert E. Howard's tales are so alive, you almost have to check yourself for wounds. Between the lines broods an ancient feeling of melancholy that lends such realism to the writing. And the beautiful, sweeping illustrations in this book by the award-winning artist Gary Gianni bring that classical story-telling feel to the fore-front.As with all of Howard's heroes, Solomon Kane is larger-than-life, fearless, and inherited of an ancestral fighting prowess and unconquerable spirit. But Kane's adventures are the product of his fanatical obsession to root-out and destroy evil in any form. He seeks no personal reward -- only claims to do the will of God. However, despite his staunch Puritan faith, his inner demons are almost as dark as those he combats. He is a man of violence, filled with a wander-lust to seek out what he judges as evil with a determination and recklessness that is psychotic.What makes Solomon Kane so endearing to read is, on one hand, Solomon Kane is the archetypal swash-buckler -- much like a character from a Robert Louis Stevenson adventure story. On the other hand (probably the left because left-handedness was once thought to be of the Devil), Kane is as foreboding as what he faces -- most often horrors as nightmarish as anything Edgar Allen Poe ever created.Reading these stories in this format is like a journey back to my childhood -- when the jungles of an old Tarzan movie were more real than anything documented on the National Geographic channel, and when a horror-comic hidden in a text book at school would make me too scared to sleep that night. It reminded me of when I was too young to be allowed to read such violent and terrifying tales but did so anyway because I knew therein were hidden truths of adventures still left in this world that my parents didn't want me to know about."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard came up with many characters, such as Conan, Kull, Bran Mak Morn and of course, Solomon Kane. Ironically, after Conan, I think of Solomon as Howard's great contribution to fantasy and adventure. Unlike the barbarian, Kane is all grim honor and business. He doesn't drink, party it up, or aspire to high positions of power like Conan. Instead, he just travels from place to place, administering justice where he sees it needed, and carrying on in search of his next adventure.Included in this collection are \\"Red Shadows\\", where Kane makes a promise to a dying girl to avenge her, and keeps that promise regardless of how long it takes (a theme that's been influential in my own writing); and \\"Wings of the Night\\", where Kane faces an ancient horror that even he may not be able to beat. And what's always cool about Howard is how his fragments can entrance you, like \\"Castle of the Devil\\". I read that and have still dreamt of how that story would play out.In the end, Kane stands as a polar opposite to Conan in a lot of ways, a product of a civilized world who still has the fire of a savage hero. And like Conan, it's often his will and spirit, as well as his steel, that will decide his fate against his foes.If you enjoyed Conan and want something a bit different, you can't go wrong with Solomon Kane."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Howard's Kane stories are much like his Kull or Conan... in short perfect for any Howard fan"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I was a little skeptical about the Puritan adventurer's tales, having only read Robert Howard's Conan (although other subsequent Conan writers, with the possible exception of Robert Jordan, don't hold a candle to Howard).

Howard was a master storyteller who wrote stories of some of the legendary characters of pulp fiction. Solomon Kane is one of them, as close to Conan as any of Howard's characters (with the exception of Bran Mak Morn). The problem with this, though, is that it doesn't exactly seem original. The same themes are found in Solomon Kane stories as in Conan stories, only instead of praising \\"Crom\\" Solomon Kane praises God. It's about savagery and murder, and considering what's right or wrong.Still, for it's time, Solomon Kane is a surprisingly unique character. A Puritan vagabond who kills as often as he prays, who never smiles, and has a trigger finger that works faster than he blinks. Many of his stories deal with Kane killing evil-doers and rescuing some form of damsel in distress. Occasionally he fights monsters or demons. But what's makes this story different than Conan is the outlook of Kane. Though the times in which these stories were written were thick with ignorance toward the opposite race and sex, Kane doesn't exactly look at things that way. An African named N'Longa, whom Kane meets in the story \\"Red Shadows\\" becomes Kane's closest ally and later gives him a weapon that has become apart of Kane's image. Though the undertones of the times is still apparent, Howard allows his own personal views shine out and isn't as influenced by the same things as he was in his Conan tales.Despite that, however, Kane isn't as well-known a character as Conan, and a little more difficult to accept. If you enjoy simple hack-and-slashers, this a good place to get those stories. Kane is a one way individual who never shows any real emotion beyond anger, and therefore the stories fester with this emotion. What can be said about these stories, though, is that they are excellently written, with dialogue that matches well to the times in which the stories were placed. If you're a Howard fan, get this book, especially for the extra information given in the appendices. If you're skeptical of Howard, then start with his Conan books and move up from there, so that you can feel the style in which he writes before continuing to his less popular characters."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I purchased this and other Robert E Howard kindle books in December for under $10.

My problem is that the binding is so poor that awhole bunch of pages just fell out within a week of my purchase."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I've never read any of Howard's stuff, nor am I a huge fan of pulp fantasy, but the premise of a Puritan avenger was intriguing enough for me to seek out this collection of Howard's Solomon Kane stories and poems. Set sometime in the Elizabethan era, the stories revolve around Kane, who strides the earth seeking to mete out divine justice at the end of his rapier or from the barrels of his matchlock pistols. Written in the 1930s and published mostly in Weird Tales, these are classic pulp stories, mixing the eerie and supernatural, with the exotic and wicked, and always with a heavy dose of action.The stories are more or less evenly split between those set in Europe and those set in Africa. Three of these, \\"Skulls in the Stars,\\" \\"The Right Hand of Doom,\\" and \\"Rattle of Bones,\\" are fairly straight-up horror/ghost stories in which Kane finds himself in a situation where he is a witness or participant in vengeance. More interesting is a longer story without any fantastical element called \\"The Blue Flame of Vengeance,\\" in which he helps a worthy young man against a tyrannical local lord in league with smuggler/pirates. The book includes two brief fragments of unfinished stories along the same themes. Kane's move to Africa is handled in the story \\"Red Shadows,\\" which details his years-long pursuit of a murderer called \\"The Wolf.\\"The African-set stories are much more colorful and action-packed on the whole, albeit tinged with rather unfortunate portrayals of Africans and Arabs. The modern reader will have to bear in mind that Howard was a young man in a small town in Texas in the 1930s when writing these, and the crude racial characteristics he ascribes were par for the course in pulp writing. In \\"The Moon of Skulls\\", Kane rescues a kidnapped European woman by tracking her to a lost city run by a sadistic evil priestess. The lost civilization theme appears again in two promising story fragments, \\"Hawk of Basti\\" and \\"The Children of Asshur,\\" the latter of which posits a thriving Assyrian city in the heart of Africa. Two of the better complete stories are \\"The Hills of the Dead\\" and \\"Wings in the Night.\\" In the first, Kane rather implausibly befriends a witch-doctor, who helps him smite down an army of zombie/vampire creatures with the aid of a magic staff and astral projection! In the latter, a race of avian carnivores destroys a village Kane is staying in, and so he must take his vengeance yet again. \\"The Footfalls Within\\" is a rather lame encounter with Arab slavers that leads to a Lovecraftian encounter with an ancient crypt deep in the jungle.On the whole, the stories are fairly one-dimensional pulpies. Kane is repeatedly described as a fanatic (without really ever spelling out what it is he's fanatical about), with a very personally arbitrated mandate to roam the world destroying evil in a never-ending crusade. He's a dour, humorless figure, with the requisite courage, stamina, speed, brawn, etc. to overcome all foes. Probably best taken in small doses, and only by those with a general taste for pulp fiction. The book does benefit greatly from the fantastic black and white line drawings of Gary Gianni, which appear throughout. They capture the period and essence of the stories perfectly, and are themselves much better than the stories they illustrate! The typography leaves something to be desired however, and the book is rather awkwardly sized, floppy, and hard to hold comfortably to read. Also included are a piece by Howard's contemporary H.P. Lovecraft and an brief biography of Howard."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Robert E. Howard wrote hundreds of great short stories and novellas. Solomon Kane, in my opinion, is his greatest creation and I wish that he had written more stories of the fanatical Kane fighting evil as only Kane does. Some of the stories in this book were never finished by Howard, and they are left as is by the publisher as unfinished. I can only wonder in what way Howard would have ended those couple stories had he finished them.If you are a fan of Conan, then you will also be a fan of the Solomon Kane adventures. I highly suggest you read as much work as you can by Robert E. Howard, starting with Conan and Solomon Kane."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"This collection of stories by Howard is sure to delight fans of the author who have not yet read these works; and fans of fantasy and dark fantasy should find the content appealing.

Well I decided to get this book and find out about him. Great character, great stories, and great writing style! Give it a try, Solomon Kane is a very unique character, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading these stories."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Solomon Kane is one of Robert E. Howard's most enigmatic characters. First appearing in 1928, there were nine short stories, three poems and four fragments written by Howard about the dour-faced Puritan avenger. All of these works appear in \\"The Savage Tales Of Solomon Kane\\" by Robert E. Howard. This edition contains all of Howard's published work on Kane, as well as the known fragments that were never completed. Also included is a dedication to Robert E. Howard by H.P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft admired Howard as a writer and as a man. Through their correspondence, they shared their ideas and experiences with each other, forming a friendship that lasted until Howard's death in 1936.Some of the Kane stories are much darker than others, but they all share the same dark mood, symbolic of Kane's time. Taking place sometime during the late 16th, early 17th centuries, the stories follow the Puritan avenger all over the globe. From England, Africa, Cathay, and beyond, Kane travels the world and goes where fate leads him, one day at a time.In all of the stories, Kane's personality is set in stone and does not alter. His path is never certain but his mission is: to right wrongs, help the helpless and avenge the fallen. All else is secondary in life for Solomon Kane.In \\"Skulls In The Stars\\", where we first meet Kane, he investigates a strange horror haunting a moor near a frightened village. In \\"Red Shadows\\", Kane finds a dying girl in the forest, swearing to avenge her death, and years later, meeting the murderer in a final showdown. Here we see that Kane's ability with the sword is truly amazing and Howard's descriptions of battle come to vivid life on the page. This story is also where we meet N'Longa, a powerful African Shaman, who becomes a recurring character in the Kane stories.In \\"The Hills Of The Dead\\", N'Longa gives Kane a mysterious wooden staff. In \\"Hawk Of Basti\\", Howard describes the strange artifact: \\"It was as long as a sword, hard as iron and sharpened at the smaller end. The other end was carved in the shape of a cat's head, and all up and down the stave were strange wavering lines and curious carvings.\\"The Kane stories give us a wide range of genre styles. From ghost stories, jungle adventures, swashbuckling duels, and even a somewhat loosely disguised Cthulhu Mythos tale is included. With all of these settings and styles, the mood is still that of a somber Puritan whose sole responsibility is to serve others and help in whatever capacity is needed.The book itself is arranged nicely. It is a large 9X6 paperback with interior artwork by Gary Gianni. In the back of the book, there are notes on the original Howard text, and a short biography on Robert E. Howard. I recommend getting this book if you like Howard's other work, if you like high adventure, and if you like tales that span a myriad of genres, landscapes, and adversaries. \\"The Savage Tales Of Solomon Kane\\" provides all of that in a complete, spine tingling package."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Ok this is pulp literature, son don't expect something like Borges or anything Solomon is just a stereotype there are some tales greater than life and that's all, but at least this is great adventure and straight action , the book contains some unfinished stories also, kind of curiosities for someone who really cares about RE Howard and pulps,"},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I love Howard's writing. I would love to read a novel dedicated to this Solomon Kane. Very interesting character. would recomend to anyone."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"I had no read any Howard in a very long time and was inspired by the recent movie, which I found very disappointing. These stories were great and engaging and I have a hard time reconciling some of the lower reviews with the stories I actually read.However, it must be said that these stories do not age well, probably reflecting popular attitudes towards Arabs and Africans and women in Howard's day, but often painful to read now. Were I not a white male American, I might well have been upset. As it was, I was just embarrassed."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"The writing is not as good as Conan, or as good as the Kull series, imo, but it is still fairly decent. Roughly at least equal to that of the better written Conan stories and novels by modern authors. Although this is done more in pulp fashion. So that the stories are mostly short or in some cases just fragments.You can see a little bit of Conan in Solomon Kane, or show I say you can see a little bit of Robert in Solomon, as Robert himself was blue eyed and a large figure. It is as if he lived through these stories himself as a way of expressing some of his political views, and a way of expressing his desires.Yes the stories can be formulaic. But the fact it is done with some intelligence and an internal consistency so that it felt like it could be a real world without it being necessarily real. And if the formula works, then why not? That's what some readers of Conan are looking for anyway. Although the Puritan Solomon Kane is not the lusty figure that Conan is.I will admit that it is a little hard to believe that someone traveling through Africa in Puritan garb is something that is practical. That was the only logic hole that I could not wrap my head around.The only thing I didn't like in here was the poetry. The poetry wasn't bad or anything, it just seemed somewhat distant and 3-rd person'ish and didn't really carry the flavor or spirit of the rest of the stories. Almost Tolkien like, without the weird mythology or language. Thankfully there isn't much poetry in here."},{"Title":"The Savage Tales of Solomon Kane","review":"Solomon Kane was one of Howard's lesser known characters, but still worth the read. Kane is a fanatical Puritan who stands on the side of justice and human dignity, in England and Africa, the two main settings of the story. You will find Howard's love of magic and mysticism in this work, as Kane befriends Necromancers and battles vampires and zombies. A different kind of Howard hero, but cut in the same mold as Conan, Kull and Bran Mac Morn, and I believe who Howard wanted to be. I read some of the Kane stories as a child, and some in comics devoted to the hero, but this volume brings them all together, including some fragments of uncompleted stories that made me wish all the more that Howard had not taken his own life at such a young age."},{"Title":"The Rolling Stones (Ace SF #73440)","review":"In 1952, another of Robert Heinlein's juvenile novels was published under three names. In the U.S., the title was \\"The Rolling Stones\\", in the U.K. it was called \\"Space Family Stone\\", and when it was published in \\"Boy's Life\\" magazine in the September - December issues, it was called \\"Tramp Space Ship\\".As with most, if not all of his novels aimed at a younger audience, there are characters which the younger reader can identify. In this case there are the twin boys Castor and Pollux Stone, two teenage math whizzes who think they are ready to head into space and make their fortune in trade. Unlike many of these novels though, this time Heinlein brings in a host of characters of all ages. We have the father, Robert Stone, who is a retired engineer, a former mayor of Lunar City, and who is now writing scripts for a serial program. There is the mother, Edith Stone, who is a doctor. There is the grandmother, Hazel Stone, who is also an engineer. They also have a younger sister, Meade, and their four-year-old brother, Lowell, who is a chess genius, and may be telepathic.This book is an entertaining adventure story, somewhat light on the science part of science fiction. Also, one scientific theory which Heinlein does talk about a bit, that the asteroid belt is the remains of a planet, is no longer considered viable. That shouldn't stop you from enjoying the story though, as the best thing about this book is the interaction between the characters. Each of the family members are geniuses, at least in some way, and perhaps each is more than a little crazy.The story starts with the twins looking to buy a space ship to start their enterprise, but when they go to talk to their father about their money which he keeps in trust, he refuses to allow them to start their business, and instead insists on their education. Things change though when their grandmother lends her voice, and ultimately when their mother chimes in as well, but things don't go exactly the way they want. Instead of their getting a ship, their father buys one and the entire family is going to come along as the Stones head for Mars.That doesn't stop the boys scheming though, as they come up with a plan to make money by bringing a cargo of broken-down bicycles which they intend to fix along the way to sell. That plan doesn't exactly go off as planned either. You will enjoy reading about their and the rest of the family's adventures. The Flat Cats of Mars is an enjoyable subplot, which will remind Star Trek fans of the Tribbles on Star Trek. David Gerrold has denied that he was aware of the Flat Cats and actually based the Tribbles episode off of the situation with rabbits in Australia.There is some connection between this book and some of Heinlein's other works, but it isn't completely clear how strong that link really is. Hazel, Castor and Pollux Stone all make a brief appearance in \\"The Number of the Beast\\". There is also a character called Hazel Stone who appears in \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\", \\"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\\", and \\"To Sail Beyond the Sunset\\", but the characters don't really act the same so one cannot be sure if they are intended to be the same person or not.This book has not won any awards, and yet I found it to be very enjoyable and while not at the top level of Heinlein's work, it fits in fairly well with his second tier works. This is definitely a good choice for younger readers who want to find out about Heinlein."},{"Title":"The Rolling Stones (Ace SF #73440)","review":"\\"The Rolling Stones\\" is one of my favorite science fiction stories. It is one of the stories I use to introduce my children to science fiction.The tale starts with a family living on the moon. The moon was settled long ago and has a decent sized population. Two teenage twin boys propose to their father that they be allowed to buy a space ship and head for Mars. They would like to go into business for themselves and become a tramp spaceship going from port to port around the solar system selling cargo. The father decides to buy a slightly bigger ship so the whole family can take a vacation. The ship needs some fixing up which is done by this family of engineers and then they head for Mars. They have some adventures along the way, more adventures on Mars and then they head for the asteroid belt.Robert Heilein is one of the most famous science fiction writers of all time, and with just cause. \\"The Rolling Stones\\" is one of his juveniles. He wrote the germ of the story for Boy's Life in 1952. Most of his other novels published during the 1950s have a similar flavor. I stay away from his novels written after the 1960s as he started writing more adult fiction with soft porn. But his juveniles are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Beowulf (Approaches to Teaching World Literature)","review":"Don't waste your money! There are no approaches.

Sorry, I am not much of photographer so it may be a bit blurry but you can still see the card images. The colors may appear to be a bit softer on the real cards than in the photos. I would describe them as having a Victorian style with watercolor like colors. You can see the images don't have great deal of detail, but what's there is to the point and there is enough detail for me to get impressions. In fact I prefer a simple deck to one that is busy. There are 2 flaws. The first is that the cardstock is thin and the second is that the back of the cards show if the card is upright or reversed. I prefer backs that don't indicate the direction of the card as if a card is being picked rather than dealt it would be known if the card is upright or not.I enjoyed the concept of these cards. They are aimed at getting the recipient to examine his or her journey and the reflect on the meaning of their situation. There are 4 season cards, symbol cards (examples are Heart, Wand, Rainbow, Hearth, and Wings) and journey cards. These are not angel cards in the sense they have a specific angel such as Archangel Michael on the card as you can see in the uploaded photos. For each angel journey card the book has a brief description to explain the picture image and what it represents. There a detailed section aimed to help you contemplate the message. An upright and reversed meaning is given. A guided journey to is offered in light of the message received. The journey section is followed by Room for Reflection, a section of questions to help you examine the message still further. For some perhaps certain sections will be more appealing than others.There are no reversals given for the season and symbol cards. Only keywords are given for the symbol cards as a suggestion of possible meanings. It is left to your intuition to ultimately decide the meaning for the symbol. For the season cards there are key thoughts, aspects and attitudes and a section on the meaning. The box is sturdy. Overall I like the card set as the aim is to help gain insight into your journey. It won't be my main deck, but I can see using it from time to time."},{"Title":"A Comprehensive French Grammar (Blackwell Reference Grammars)","review":"While trying to learn French in Montreal recently, I realized that while &quot;Introductory French Lesson&quot; type books were a good place to start, they were not really sufficient.

Weiner, Sr. (1896-1977) was a Shreveport architect known internationally for his work in the International style. The few buildings of his that are still standing are considered \\"priceless examples of modern-age architecture.\\" However, as a young architect, he was probably trained in classical, Beaux-Arts architecture. He definitely went to Venice, at least, to observe and sketch.\\"Venetian Houses and Details,\\" published when the author was 33, is a compilation of the author's skilled renderings of Venetian facades, courtyards, and decorative details, plus many photographs taken by his architect brother William of facades and architectural details such as windows, doors, and staircases. There are a few pen-and-ink elevations of architectural details. Buildings included are not only those found in urban Venice, but the surrounding countryside - both the country houses of the wealthy and working farm buildings. Sketches and photos are often identified by century or architectural style. The book has a foreword, but no text other than figure and photo captions; however, architectural histories of Venice are easy enough to find. Set designers and event planners looking for romantic inspiration should have a field day with this book."},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"There are a lot of astronomy picture books on the market, all featuring wonderful photographs. The Invisible Universe is simply THE most beautiful book in that genre that I've ever seen, inside and outside. David Malin is the best-known astronomical photographer in the world, and his work already appears in just about every astronomy book published this decade. This particular volume compiles much of his finest work in a big 14-by-16 format, laced with artwork of the sky and the constellations, strong scientific content, and well-written prose. A few years back, Malin put together a masterpiece called A View Of The Universe; this book is bigger and even more beautiful.There's something for every reader in this book. Each photograph takes up a full page, so you get its full stunning beauty. Short, readable descriptions written by Malin give very understandable and jargon-free scientific background to the astronomical phenomena in the pictures. The drawings of the sky and the constellations are also accompanied by prose laced with mythology and history. The book is pleasant to read as well as visually unmatched -- a wonderful combination.Whether you want a beautiful and well-written introduction to the wonders of the heavens, a collection of some of the finest astronomical photos ever taken, or even just a pretty book for your coffee table, I heartily and unreservedly recommend this book. It's all of the above."},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"I wasn't sure if Malin's &quot;Invisible Universe&quot; or Croswell's &quot;Magnificent Universe&quot; was the one to buy, so I bought both. For people who have wondered which of the two might be better, perhaps my review will help.Each book has its own strengths. Croswell's are the dark, glossy pages and the multitude of images from different sources. Malin's is image quality and size. Approximately 20 images are the same in both books (Croswell gives credit to Malin for using them). However, even though the pictures are identical, their appearance is not. In two-thirds of those twenty images there simply is no comparison. Croswell's images look &quot;small&quot; and &quot;soft,&quot; while Malin's large format sharpness and resolution are in a different class. The remaining one-third ranks about the same with Malin's trading off a slight increase in grain for a little more sharpness, resolution and, of course, size. The remaining images, in both books, in general, follow the same pattern. Croswell's are of decent quality and there are many of them to see (including about 20 from the Hubble). Malin's remaining range in quality from about the same as Croswell's to outstanding.There are, also, a couple of other things to keep in mind that other reviewers haven't mentioned. Croswell's pages though beautiful (they are glossy) are also subject to fingerprints at the mere touch. Also, Malin's ships wrapped in a bag whereas Croswell's is open and, therefore, subject to the curiosity (and fingerprints) of warehouse handlers, etc. This is the second &quot;Magnificent Universe&quot; I've gotten, the first had to go back since its condition upon arrival was unacceptable. One last thing, many of Croswell's pictures have an annoying border around them and do not take up the full page. Malin's main theme pictures are always full page.Which one should you buy? If you like quantity and can only afford one book, then the &quot;Magnificent Universe&quot; is the one for you. If you prefer quality and relaxed viewing, then Malin's is the better choice. If you like astronomical images and can afford both books, then get both of them. I'm keeping both. Happy buying."},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"I gave my husband a telescope for his birthday last summer, and have since become an astronomy widow - better than being a football widow! I wanted to give him a Christmas gift of something spectacular that wasn't technological, since I know nothing about it, and saw a review of this book. So I took a chance and bought it. What a success!The book is cumbersome because of its size, but the upside of that is that it forces you to sit down at a table and really LOOK at it - this is not a browsing book. Each image is more spectacular than the previous, and the photographs are so beautifully done, so artistic, that they look almost painterly. The realization that this stuff actually exists, is really out there, in all this color and glory, is tremendously exciting. A &quot;normal&quot;-sized book could never do the photographs justice - this book had to be this size. The Horsehead Nebula is so other-worldly, so amazing, that words fail me and only photos like these can describe it.This book, more than any other I've seen, transports me off the planet and makes me realize how unimaginably vast the universe really is - and fills me with awe that we silly humans with our puny little machines can actually see this much!I recommend this book without reservation to anyone with an interest in astronomy, art, photography... I sure am glad I gave it to US!"},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"I recently bought a copy of 'The Invisible Universe' for myself and I was blown away by each and every one of these astounding images that David Malin assembled and finally published in an appropriate format (finally a book whose size dares to do the content justice!). I am not (yet!) an expert on this subject matter, but it also proved to be a very interesting read with lots of interesting quotes and references. The oversized images convey the beauty of the subject matter as well as the purpose of science. They're not only very precise documentary photographs of constellations, nebulas and supernovas, but also a very poetic and artistic look (some of the images even reminded me of Ross Bleckner's paintings) at the vast universe that inspired me to let my imagination run wild. I applaud the people who made this book. It's a treasure! I especially appreciate the contrast of the vivid and saturated large photographs and the historic drawings and maps (and the juxtapositions of the two), which makes it more than just a pretty book but also a great reference for people like me, who are just starting to get into astronomy. I recommend this book for everyone who looks up at the stars and wonders if there is anything else out there. Carl Sagan would have loved this one!

I examined this monster one leisurely afternoon in a bookstore--and was grossly disappointed (but, thankfully, richer). Don't be fooled: Timothy Ferris wrote the Preface but *not* the main text; both are decidedly second-rate. And the text on each star/constellation was disappointingly short and relatively dry; snippets of intellectual interest shorn of any poetical flourish or keen insight, devoid of any real attempt to integrate classical and modern understanding (as suggested by the cover) that truly feeds our sense of Universal wonder (such as made Ferris' &quot;Whole Shebang&quot; such a marvelous book). This book is also *way* too big. Like some hypertrophic Abrams art monstrosity, this Mother of All Coffee-table Books requires a whole table to hold and view; even so, it is still unwieldy. Ditto the grossly oversized Hubble photos: Bigger is not always better, and these photos lack clarity, warmth, wonder or charm. Photowise, you'd be better of to buy one of several collections of Hubble photos. For sheer star lore and history of astronomy, look to &quot;The Glorious Constellations&quot; whose crisp, delicious prose, lucid Greek and Roman mythological images, analogies and stories, abundant drawings, illustrations and reproductions truly animate the constellations and stars in a delicious, heartful way. On the more positive side, apparently no license is needed to own the present beast; so if you like BIG and dry, go for it."},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"The Invisible Universe looks great. The book was shipped in good condition and overall -- a great transaction. Thanks"},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"One of the goals of this book is to try to link the ancient sources of the stars with our modern understanding of what is there. However, most of what is there is literally out of sight, inaccessible to human eyes, no matter how large the telescope to which they are applied. Thus the secrets of the universe are largely hidden, which is why our ancestors believed what their eyes told them, that Earth was at the center of creation, with the stars moving endlessly around it. The author has sought a middle course; recognizing the poetry and beauty in the stars as well as the remarkable fact that we can begin to understand how they came to be. Rather than diminishing their magic, understanding the stars increases the sense of wonder they create. Though it is true that charts and diagrams are part of the game, many astronomers are still affected by the perfect silence beneath the stars."},{"Title":"The Invisible Universe Ibs#521866","review":"Also check out:A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo AstronautsUniverse--Guy P.

This book is full of HUGE color photographs of Nebula, stars, planets and galaxies that are truly awe inspiring. I did, however, find myself a bit dissapointed. Many of the Hubble telescope pictures that I was hoping to see, were tiny on text pages while the big, blown up pictures were somewhat grainy and repetitive. Commonly, there were several pages in a row of the same majestic body shown from different perspectives.

The purpose of pictorial content is to support the text. That's what I expected and thus my criticism of this edition. The poem is given in its entirety, its flights of fancy as beautiful and poignant as ever: the poem itself is impeachable. The illustrations, however, show little regard for the subject matter or chronology of the poem. With Ms. Cotes it seems the artwork is what's important here and not the text. Didn't she read the poem? Cotes' illustrations are anachronisms and this is the problem. The setting appears to be France, Camelot depicted as an early twentieth century French city. (I know the character of Lancelot is a French contribution to the Arthurian Legend, but Cotes' interpretation is ridiculous!) The first illustration presents what appears to be a Parisian couple dressed in 1920's couture. In the background one sees an auto on a bridge and a city skyline hardly medieval.Tennyson's poem, composed between the years of 1832-42, drew its inspiration from Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte Darthur,\\" a compilation of Arthurian romances printed by William Caxton in 1485, in particular the romance \\"The Fair Maid of Astolat\\" in which a summary states: \\"(And, as the booke sayth, she keste such a love unto sir Launcelot that she cowde never withdraw hir loove, wherefore she dyed. And her name was Elayne le Blanke.)\\" Tennyson takes the story of Elaine and Lancelot and restructures it (\\"Lancelot and Elaine\\") in blank verse in his \\"Idylls of the King.\\" Elaine's story further inspired \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\" in which the maiden's unrequited love is a kind of curse which causes her to live a life of illusion through the images in the mirror on her wall. The curse \\"is on her\\" if she turns her back on the mirror, the life it reflects, turns to the window of her tower and looks out upon the reality of the outside world. The only way she can connect with reality and the world beyond and escape the curse is to weave the mirror's images into a tapestry.For textual support, then, one would expect artwork depicting medieval dress and architecture, knights with heraldic crests on their shields. Cotes' Lancelot, though astride a charger, wears a military trenchcoat vintage WWI, sports a medal-laden lapel and what appears to be \\"motorcycle\\" goggles riding above the brim of his helmet. Where's the rendering of the Golden Age of Chivalry?? In Part One, stanza three, \\"heavy barges\\" and \\"the shallop,\\" (a small sailboat), are given as a modern fishing boat with one of the crew setting or pulling a net. In the next stanza we see \\"reapers reaping early\\" wearing sunglasses as protection from the morning glare. In Part iv, stanza four, Cotes has the dead Fairy Lady float past a river or canal front, drifting by the facade of a twentieth century city (hardly the Camelot I envision) and promenade replete with sidewalk cafe and lounging patrons. (Strange, too, that Cotes' \\"Fairy Lady\\" sprouts wings when she's outside her tower. Perhaps the Lady only wears them when she \\"goes out?\\") Before Cotes sat down at her easel or drawing board, perhaps she should have consulted two beautiful nineteenth century renderings of The Lady of Shalott by William Holman Hunt and John William Waterhouse. Both paintings capture faithfully the medieval times of Arthuriana; it is apparent both artists read the text.If it weren't for its helpful back material, I would have given this edition only a one star rating. I recently shared Tennyson's beautiful story with my mother and purchased this illustrated version for her birthday present. What a disappointment! In the case of this illustrated version of \\"The Lady of Shalott,\\" the \\"search inside this book\\" feature would have been most helpful."},{"Title":"The lady of Shalott","review":"Lady of Shalott with illustrations by Howard Pyle:Book is wonderful to read, illustrations are Museum Quality Beautiful-Seller was DELIGHTFUL and very helpful!!"},{"Title":"The lady of Shalott","review":"\\"She knows not what the curse may be...\\"Living as a recluse, denying the inevitable curse of mankind---our mortality--- the Lady of Shalott finally breaks free of her prison when faced with a vision of love she cannot resist: Sir Lancelot.

What I have liked about some of the other illustrators in this series is their ability to re-interpret the poetry and add some modern context of their own. These illustrations don't do that.Still, the poem itself is grand. And this is a high quality, well-produced book. Just... a little girly."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Out of print? Sheese! I read this book when I was in high school, and even then I realized it was discussing more than a very intriguing passage to adulthood of a group of kids on a space ship. Through a very engaging story, filled with realistic human beings, you begin to see that countries and societies must also mature and grow, and a failure to do so can be deadly. This book also points out that isolation at the comfortable &quot;top of the heap&quot; creates jealousy and fear. My first reading left me thinking for weeks and looking at the adult society around me in a whole new way. The news about the Cold War even gained my notice. Science fiction became for me what it really is: a fascinating mirror of our own world which, projected safely into the future, could be starkly honest. As a reader this book was a rite of passage. I've neices and nephews who need to read this book. BRING IT BACK."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Clearly I disagree with the majority of reviewers that have posted their views on this book. There are a number of good things about it, and a number of bad.First the good things. It is easy to read and entertaining. There are some interesting ideas (some interesting ethical questions that are bandied about by the characters). The adventure part of the story is fun. And the main character is well written and you sympathise with her.Now the bad points. While the adventure is fun, it's too cartoony. This book would make a good movie, but doesn't work if you think about it. More importantly, Panshin seems to shy away from the real ethical questions, trying to portray everything in black and white terms. Without giving away the last half of the book, it's difficult to clarify. Simply put, the debates are too short and the people too polarised into one camp or another. It rings hollow. And the points they debate are not the most important ones, in my opinion.At any rate, it's a little disappointing because of the well-written main character and the interesting setup. If the book had been twice as long, it might have been able to work out its ethical dilemmas. As it is, everything is rammed through without deep thought. A pity."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"It's in my permanent library- I like it!

Mia Havero is a young girl living on one of those ships whose residents are abundantly aware of the perils of the \\"lack of moral discipline\\" of \\"Free-Birthers\\" who embrace complete freedom of reproduction, an uncontrolled birth rate and the resulting exponential growth in population. They've adopted the harsh but entirely effective social policy of subjecting their young people to the \\"Trial\\". Every young person is dropped and summarily abandoned into a thirty day survive-or-die test in the harsh and cruel environment of a frequently hostile colony planet. Those who survive return to the fold of the ship and are called \\"adults\\". Those who don't - well, they just don't!\\"Rite of Passage\\" is written from Mia's first person perspective as she grows through childhood, enters training for her time of Trial and is dropped onto the planet Tintera with her childhood friend, Jimmy Dentremont. At only 225 pages, \\"Rite of Passage\\" is a very short novel and for over 200 of those pages seems to be a rather typical coming of age story. It's reasonably well written with any number of heart-warming passages and some seriously thought-provoking essays and interludes on philosophy, education and ethics. In fact, the story concentrates so exclusively on Mia's education, evolution and the development of her character as she comes of age from self-centred girl child to mature young adult that any reader would be forgiven for forgetting that \\"Rite of Passage\\" won a Nebula Award as a science fiction novel!!It's Panshin's epilogue that pulls \\"Rite of Passage\\" from mere novel into the realm of \\"classic\\", an eye-opening, jaw-dropping dissertation on the results of the irresponsible or reckless exercise of power. In a manner that will remind you of the subtle, quiet, yet compelling style of Simak's best novels, Panshin touches on issues of killing, prejudice, hatred, power and responsibility. When Panshin seamlessly returns our thoughts to the context of a science fiction novel by discussing the destruction of an entire planet, he brutally reminds us that these issues are timeless and are likely to remain with humanity forever unless we make a conscious decision to grow beyond cruelty.\\"Rite of Passage\\" is a deeply moving novel likely to remain in your thoughts long after the final page is turned!Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I was able to read the entire story, and I was interested in turning the page. But I was never riveted, and on multiple occasions I felt the story was disjointed.I know this story won the 1968 Nebula Award, and so I am going against the popular opinion evidently. I did enjoy it, make no mistake, and I also recommended it to my 11 year old daughter. But, I found the story lacking in many ways when I compare it against what I expect from high quality science fiction.The focus was on morality, and the story makes no bones about that. No problems there. But, while I accept that a teenage girl is unpredictable on the best of days, I found the sudden changes in Mia's personality a little jarring. One day she's a simple thing, playing sports and being adventurous and then suddenly she's a philosopher examining multiple morality systems, then she's back to a normal 13 year old.What I found more interesting about this story than the primary topics of the author, was the absence of the familial system on the Ship. And yet, the author really never discusses it. He lays out the facts of the life on Ship, but never really speaks to how this system \\"works\\". I found it all rather depressing. I was also very curious as to how these children are supposed to develop without psychological issues (due to the manner in which they are - or are not as the case may be - raised).I don't know quite what to say except that I fail to see how this was a Nebula Award winner. I can't even see it as a nominee. On a 5 star system, I give it 3 stars. I see that it has merit, but I just don't see how it rates 5 stars. It just is not a fully fleshed out story. I believe this may have originally been delivered as a series of shorts in SF magazines perhaps? That might explain what I felt as I read it.I in no way felt I wasted my time or money. So, if this story interests you, I would give it a go. You may find it works better for you than for me, but even if not, I think you'll agree it was enjoyable in its way."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Mia Havero is a budding adolescent leading a sheltered life on \\"The Ship\\", a city-state located inside a spaceship.

They must survive, alone, for thirty days on a \\"Mudeater\\" colony world.Mia is a well-formed character, but more than a little snippy and hard to like. However, that is perfectly understandable for an adolescent who is too smart for her own good. My real problem was the plot. I thought the story was going to be about her Trial, and was unpleasantly surprised when it bogged down in the middle with details of her life aboard ship. I suppose the lengthy discussions of comparative moralities were supposed to be Mia's mental growth into an adult, but frankly, I couldn't see much difference between her character at the beginning of the book and her character at the end.

Revisiting it I'm very impressed. I suppose it is \\"charming\\" as one reviewer has it, in a sense; but there's a dark undercurrent to the charm - good and admirable people do terrible things. For that matter, the \\"Rite of Passage\\" itself is frequently fatal...This probably deserves a place as one of the top dozen or so SF novels.

The great shame is that both of these wonderful books are out of print.watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Rite of passage is extremely easy to read, and never slows down. It doesn't fill pages with useless bits. Every page has a point, every event has relevance. I think it should be back in print because it is very meaningful and should be recognised as brilliant. No Nebula winner should ever go out of print. The novel deals with real world issues such as growing up, while also delivering a hefty punch in the politics/morals department.

I worked there and had a discount. My first solid science fiction novel was Foundation, but even in the 70s I was deeply offended by the sexism and homophobia represented in that otherwise incredible novel. I looked for female characters, which explains why I wasn't reading every word from Le Guin at the time. In this novel I found my deepest concerns about where the world was headed: overpopulation and arogance. I also found a narrator who reflected my own life experience in surprising ways.I have reread the novel several times and it never fails to grab me. I read it to my sons when they were Mia's age. I bought enough used copies to teach the novel to high school students. I have art on my classroom walls the represent Mia's home and Mia Havero herself.For those who don't get it, pay attention.

This yearly award is given for the \\"best\\" novel as voted by the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.The science-fiction elements surrounding the story of a young girls rite of passage to adulthood are fairly standard: huge starships \\"seeded\\" habitable planets with colonist escaping Earth's destruction just prior to the obligatory atomic war. Fast forward 150 years and the crew of the starships routinely visit the colonies to barter raw materials for knowledge and technology. Suspicion and hostility mark the relationship between the starship dwellers with their closely held knowledge and the colonist scraping an existence on an alien planet without benefit of technology. This tense relationship is highlighted by the use of derogatory terms: \\"Grabbies\\" for the ship dwellers - since they are grabbing minerals and chemicals and \\"Mudeaters\\" for the colonist.With this as a background we are presented with a story told by Mia Havero, the daughter of one of the starships leaders, after she has completed her own rite of passage, also known as Trial. During this period all 14 year olds have to survive on a colonized planet for 30 days with a minimum of supplies. Suscessful completion of the trial bestows adult status on the individual. We are told of the fear and anxiety the teens experience, the lengthy preparations and the startling fact that not all candidates survive the trial. In Mia's group of 30 there were 12 that did not return. Without going into specific details - spoilers - this is a very concise plot summary.Having read this book twice I must admit that it does describe a thoughtful extrapolation of possible futures and a reasonably credible scheme for extra solar planetary colonization. My real problem has to do with the whole concept of the trial, which is in fact the crucial aspect of the book's plot. The entire idea just does not make common sense to this reader. Here we have a all-encompassing society of like minded individuals living in a starship - scientist, technicians, teachers, space pilots, doctors you name it, traveling thru space, visiting colony worlds seeded with their extended kin and how do they evaluate their children when the become 14 years old? Drop them off on one of these planets, one the teens have never visited and if they survive 30 days great, if not well too bad. Just what is the point? This is never adequately explained, I mean loosing 20 percent of your population to prove what? In fact nothing is explained - how did it this \\"trial\\" originated, did anyone object, what if someone is physically or mentally incapable of participating - what about them, can anyone refuse, do the other starships do the same thing, what if someone commits a crime during the trial - what then, and why the undercurrent of hostility towards the colonist, who, after all are refugees from Earth just like the starship dwellers. I just could not accept underlying concept of the \\"Rite of Passage\\".I do recommend the book since it does raise two controversial points that fans can cuss and discuss. One is the trial and the other is revealed at the very end of the book."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I have worn out at least two copies over the last 30+ years.

Not only did I (female) love it as an adult, both my teenage sons loved it, and have now tracked down their own copies in used book stores. It follows the heroine during her society's training for and entering their rite of passage (they are a space colony; at age 14 children must spend several weeks on a human colonized planet and survive. Many do not.), but in the process you really see the heroine grow up. Interesting issues of sustainable growth are indirectly raised, as well as those of personal responsibility. It's extremely readable. It's a great present for anyone from age 11 or 12 on. I STRONGLY recommend it!"},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"This story of a young girl growing up two-hundred years in the future is a book that kept me glued to the pages.

I re-read it at least once every two years, and no, you can't have my falling-apart copy. You can't even borrow it. I'd sooner loan you one of my arms or legs.In the beginning, the story may remind you of Heinlein's novella, Universe. But where in that work the punchline is the science, in this one it's the humanity. A young girl works up to, and then works through, her rite of passage to adulthood, and in the process gains much and loses even more, as always happens when we grow up. Be warned: it's not a &quot;kids' book&quot; though. This is for adults who remember, or who want to remember, what it was like to make the transition-- all the joys and all the sorrows. It's also great for young teens who are going through the process right now.Reviewers who think the politics and the moral issues are oversimplified have missed the point. When you're that age, politics and morals ARE that simple. Would they could always be.One of my 'top six best science fiction works of all time' picks."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I read a lot of science fiction as a teenager and young adult...the best way to describe this book is 'charming'. It is definitely science fiction, but the focus on the lead female adolescent character and how she changes as she explores her environment, makes the book very accessible for younger readers.While the book provides typical thought-provoking content in the plot and situations, the real beauty is watching the lead character change mentally and emotionally from a teenager to a young adult.This is my favorite coming-of-age story...I can't believe it is out of print. Get a paper copy if you can (I've seen it in some used book stores)"},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"At the end of the 22nd century, Earth has been destroyed and humanity has been divided into two distinct factions: those that live on Ships and those that live on a Colony. Residents of the Ships live in an advanced technological society that meets all a person's basic needs. Residents of a Colony live under conditions that are more akin to the 19th century instead of the 22nd.Within this milieu, Mia Havero is growing up. As she comes of age aboard a Ship, Mia's notions of the world around her are reshaped and reformed from those of a child into those of an adult. When a member of a Ship reaches the age of 14, each member of the Ship undergoes Trial. A period of 30 days where they are dropped on a Colony world to fend for themselves. If they survive, they return to the Ship as a full adult and member of the Ship's community.Rite of Passage is a wonderful coming of age tale. Mia's growth from a child who is upset at being uprooted from her traditional home -- being moved from one section of the Ship to another when she is 12 -- all the way to a young woman whose decision making processes mature into a very capable and thoughtful young adult are written exceptionally well. At every stage of Mia's growth, the decisions she was making and the explorations she was undertaking made sense given her age.For Mia, her Trial coalesces all that she has learned aboard Ship. She no longer has to rely on what other people think and believe -- whether that be her father, her tutor, or even her friends -- but can now make up her own mind in a logical, reasoned process. In essence as well as in fact, she has become an adult.Panshin's Rite of Passage is highly recommended to anyone who can relate to -- or remember -- the world at first slowly unfolding and then, as time passed, dramatically unraveling into the multi-faceted, multi-hued tapestry that any adult can recognize in the blink of an eye."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Alexei Panshin's &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; narrates the growth of a young girl from childhood to maturity. The story's heroine, Mia Havero, lives in a future where overpopulation has destroyed civilization on Earth, and where this holocaust's survivors live either in technological superiority traveling between the stars or marooned in medieval ignorance on colony worlds. The novel traces the evolution of Mia's attitude toward her Ship society's treatment of the culturally backwards &quot;Mudeaters&quot; as she prepares for and finally undergoes her &quot;rite of passage,&quot; a one month stranding in the wilds of a colony planet. The great strength of &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; is Panshin's descriptive genius. Panshin painstakingly constructs both Mia's ship and the primitive planets, describing both locales in a great wealth of detail and populating each with lifelike characters who mesh convincingly with their societies. His portrayal of Mia's psyche is handled with extraordinary insight, comparing favorably with the brilliant SF character studies of Robert Silverberg's &quot;Dying Inside&quot; and Philip K. Dick's &quot;Valis&quot; and &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer.&quot; He presents Mia's opinions and philosophies with a commendable lack of Ayn Rand style monologues, managing to bring them out naturally through the action of the novel.Marring these successes of &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; are two blemishes. First, the final metamorphosis of Mia'a attitude toward the colonies contains a slight inconsistency; without providing much plot detail, parts of the approach toward the colonies advocated by councilmember Persson with which Mia agrees conflict with her strong do-it-yourself streak that continues unabated throughout the novel. Finally, and more importantly, Mia's characterization lacks the passion and intensity that infuse the best character portraits. In an interview, Philip K. Dick said that after finishing &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer,&quot; he was driven to the hospital by hemorrhaging, brought about by the pain of losing his novel's protoganist Angel Archer, by having to write &quot;The End&quot; and surrender her to the reader like a father forced to offer his beloved daughter to her betrothed. This passion is transmitted to the reader of &quot;The Transmigration of Timothy Archer,&quot; and to the reader of &quot;Valis,&quot; and to the reader of &quot;Dying Inside.&quot; It is not tranmitted to the reader of &quot;Rite of Passage.&quot; The failure to strike this spark relegates &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; to a lesser position within the pantheon of SF classics."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"4.5 starsI missed this book growing up, though it was written just after my birth, so I come to it without the fond remembrances of youth. All I can say is \\"Wow\\".The only problem, in my opinion, with the book is the slow start. We have a very long setup in a rather short book before hitting the pay off. The payoff being the planetary adventure, then followed with the sucker-punch epilog which elevates the book above a typical young adult book. The horrible act approved, and implemented will cause you to think. You will see both sides of the argument, and you may in fact agree with the decision that was made.The epilog cleverly brings what seemed to be a throwaway detail of Mia's ethics assignments into focus, providing an example of the various theories Mia had discussed writing about.Of course the shortness of the work does prevent any more than a cursory view of minor characters but within the short space of the novel Panshin does make sure to portray both the good and bad of the ship folk and planet folk, provide a really nail-biting adventure on the planet and a hard-hitting ethical epilog. Something today's authors just can't seem to do in oversized books and series.This one is a classic for all ages and all times. A true successor to the Heinlein juveniles. I'll even say the spiritual successor even though Panshin may disagree with Heinlein's philosphies.Currently it has been reprinted by the Science Fiction Book Club, so is available at least there for now."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I first read this book more than 20 years ago. I remembered some of the basics of the plot but not too much more. It's the story of Mia Havero, aged 12 when the story begins and 14 when it ends. She's one of a number of priviledged survivors of a catastrophe, caused by unlimited population growth, which destroyed Planet Earth. She lives on a spaceship created in an asteroid, with access to education and technology, while less fortunate descendants of Earth's survivors live on colonies on planets scattered throughout the galaxy. In order to control population growth, the citizens of the Ships are sent down to planets for 30 days after they turn 14, to survive as best they can with some pretty extensive training and a limited amount of supplies and tools. This is the Rite of Passage.The story is told in 1st person and at times I felt it went into a bit too much detail, but Mia's voice is very convincing and I was impressed that the author -- who I think was in his 20s at the time he wrote this -- could write from the point of view of an adolescent girl so well. The future society he's created is very interesting and the book is a fast, easy read. But it's not simple. It raises a lot of moral questions which, when I read the book for the first time in my teens, mostly passed me by. After rereading it recently, I was left feeling actually quite shocked by the ending. The book is very thought-provoking, and like the best science fiction, it raises more questions than it answers. Highly recommended -- I gave it 4 stars only because I think it could have been a bit more tightly written and/or edited."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"On a list of my favorite novels of all time, Rite of Passage would be in the top five, maybe even number one. Not because it's great science fiction; as hard sci-fi, most of what it tries to do has been done better by other authors, notably Robert A. Heinlein. Summarized (as many reviewers here have already done), the story is simple, even simplistic: Mia Havero, a tween-age girl living in a future, asteroid-size spaceship, has to become an adult in her society by surviving trial, thirty days on a planet.I reread this book right after reading the Hunger Games trilogy, which brought some of the defects of Rite of Passage into high relief. How did Trial get started? How did this society, all things considered a decent, civilized society in contrast to the Hunger Games' Panem, allow this tradition to take hold? Especially as it seems to fail in its stated purpose of population control: In most Trial cohorts, few children actually die. Furthermore, the demographics of the ship seem a little sketchy, but I didn't work them out.Still, none of this is what makes Rite of Passage great, or diminishes it. It is perhaps my favorite book because it, more than any other, shaped my life-long ethics. In Rite of Passage, Trial is merely the backdrop for Mia Havero's own maturing ethics. The story begins with Mia as a self-centered 12-year-old, as most pre-adolescents are. She is not unlikeable, not at all, but it is only through a series of events -- as prosaic as her family moving into a new apartment or as dramatic as Trial itself -- that she begins to understand how her actions, her very existence, affect everyone around her. When things go very, very wrong during Trial, leaving two people dead -- one a sad elderly man who was kind to her -- she realizes that all her life she has seen herself as a hero in a world of \\"spear-carriers\\" -- spear carriers being her term for the minor characters in novels who serve no other function but to provide detail and color, or to assist the hero, or to be a minor obstacle in the path of the hero to be shot down without remorse. But, she now realizes, there are no spear carriers: all of us, bad and good, are heroes in our own story and none of us is merely a minor character. People are not just obstacles to be used and thrown away. It's a moment of insight I'd never seen in a story before, and her paragraph of dawning self-awareness is a classic I've carried with me ever since.Mia returns to the ship, having become an adult in the legal sense, as well as morally, and this sets up the book's final, devastating (to me at least) emotional and moral conflict, one I won't describe because I don't want to give away too many spoilers. But it's a great, if rather downbeat, ending that seals the emotional and moral impact of the book.This is a book I unhesitatingly recommend for anyone Mia's age and up. One warning, though. I had \\"story-time\\" with my daughters until they were teenagers, reading a chapter a night -- and when my eldest was about twelve I read this book to her. What I had forgotten was that, right after Mia's self-reflection on heroes and spear-carriers, there's a sex scene. A very nice one, actually, and one I wouldn't have minded my kids reading on their own, but I did feel a little pervy reading it to my 12-year-old. Oh well. Be warned."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I had read this book a long time ago and found it among my collection and reread it. I enjoyed it, Panshin writes well and he grafts a story that is seamless. He has planned his story and executes it from start to finish, pulling you along, you don't want to put the book down. He knows where he is going and he is skilled in drawing you in and getting you to follow him there.Central to the story is that all children are trained in preparation for their Rite of Passage, being dropped off on a random planet to see if they can survive on their own. One part I vividly remember from the first time I read this book, is when the kids kill a big cat with nothing but sticks and stones, and of course, dogs. It was a great scene when I was younger, but not so realistic now. Little kids throwing rocks would hit the dogs as much as the cat. The cat would have killed the bewildered dogs and not so smoothly die for demonstration purposes.His heroine is more of a contrived stereotype now that I am older also. But I can see that her character is being shown unrealistic by today's society. A young girl so completely ignored by her parents, living in such a sheltered and protected society without any real world goals or cares as she is, would be on drugs by the time she was 13. There is so little of the normal intensity of real childhood here. Adults often don't remember childhood, forgetting every thing but the fun parts, but to kids, there is drama and angst. It is lacking here, she is more like Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys. Panshin forgets that parents have to actually interact with their children to teach them their values and behaviors.I give it four stars because much of this is not so obvious during the story. It is well written and creates its own environment that is plausible and real to the reader. It is a great book for kids.The ending both times struck me as at right angles to the story. She seems to set a course that does not make sense of her life and experiences up to that point. It is clear to me that Panshin had his ending in mind before he wrote the story and is trying to make some moral point. The only way it fits is if you view Mia's life as an outcast who does not fit in anywhere and resolves to change society to suit her alienated life."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"This is a deep story with much more to it than appears at first. It is not just a startling twist on the idea of a spaceship-based society, but also on the coming-of-age story, but with a real twist: as the rebellious young heroine learns more about what her own culture really does, the reader realizes that there are real moral issues here, not just conflicts of style. Real evil often is done by &quot;nice&quot; people, and it's good to see an example of this worked out in fiction (where it's safer to let ourselves consider the presence of real moral choices). It's a rather timely topic for the present decade, which may be why this Nebula-winning book is now out of print! Do find this one if you're at all tempted."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"This gold-plated classic of mature juvenile sci-fi comes from an author who roundly criticizes R.A.Heinlein -- then masterly performs every R.A.H. trick and stylistic turn! The treatment of philosophies of coming-of-age are handled with pure excellence. The social dimensions of the culture(s) include strengths and flaws and never slip out of consistancy. Note to sex-nervous parents: As the young couple enter into adulthood, they do so as adults. Panshin does not titillate, but he does not pretend that sex does not happen (the bane of R.A.H's juveniles)."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I hated so many things about this book and found zero redeeming qualities. I will update with a full list of dislikes once I have a chance to gather my thoughts."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Good story about kids overcoming a great challenge, but also preachy and full of plot holes. Good for teens, not so much for well read scifi/fantasy fans."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Truly a different kind of read. The language was so skillful but simplistic and wholly suited to the protagonist, Mia. The first part was terrific: the voicing of a young girl but given as, more-or-less, memories of that girl as an older person. The growth, sometimes very subtle, of Mia until her official \\"rite\\" began was charming. I especially enjoyed Mia's wrap up of major philosophies - chuckled at a couple but had, at heart, to agree with her.Ironically enough, the \\"trial\\" or the actual rite of passage was a fairly short part of the book but that, I believe, is part of the book's beauty. The Trial was just that, a test. The test isn't where Mia learned, it is where she discovered what she has already learned really meant. That understanding was not what she (or I) had expected at all.The result was a look into the future of her ship-board civilization. A happy ending? If you consider change to be healthy even when accompanied by disturbance and discomfort, then the ship was moving toward a new understanding of where it fit into the universe. If you consider turmoil to be best avoided, then the \\"turtle\\" approach would have been your preference. How can one learn if one avoids disturbance and discomfort?I'm thinkin' tigers were about to be let loose.Really nice little read."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"Panshin has never made it to the first rank of SF authors, really, though this novel -- his first, though it took him a decade or two to get it published -- was recognized almost immediately as a \\"classic,\\" whatever that might mean. It's a couple of centuries in the future and mankind is now divided between those who live on a dozen asteroid-size Ships and those who descend from the colonists dropped by the Ships on a hundred or so planets (the \\"mudeaters\\" as they often are unkindly referred to on the Ships). Earth itself is gone, having committed suicide-by-overpopulation. Mia Havero is twelve, about to start her eighteen-month survival training course for Trial, which every fourteen-year-old on the Ship must undergo, no exceptions. Anyone who has read Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky (which I'm sure the author did) is familiar with the concept: One month spent by yourself on a planet with wild animals, and possibly aborigines or hostile colonists, with a minimum of equipment and only your brains and training to get you through. A significant fraction of the kids don't survive, of course, but those who do are officially adults. In anthropological terms, it's a rite of passage. But, of course, Panshin means it to be taken more broadly here. The coming-of-age process is a \\"rite of passage\\" we all must undergo, in all societies. At the beginning, Mia is afraid of anything and anyplace different. She has two points of stability in her life -- her father (now the head administrator of the Ship) and her residence block. Then she's forced to move to a new quad with all new people and no personal history, and that's her first real life-change. As she grows older and makes new friends, and finds a proto-boyfriend, and meets with her mentor (a political opponent of her father), and trains for her Trial, her horizons widen and she gradually gains self-confidence. And by the time she actually has to fend for herself on a world which is far more problematical and dangerous than anyone expected, her worldview is poised for a complete change in orientation. The Gregg Press classic reprint edition includes an Introduction by the author, describing how he got started writing and trying to sell science fiction, and how this particular work came to be, and what the results of it were in his own career -- and from what he says, he didn't really intend it to be a Young Adult novel, though it very much has that feeling. (That's not a criticism, either. Some of the best SF novels every written were meant for intelligent adolescent readers and have always been equally successful with adults.) He tells the story well and the characters are sympathetic -- bright but not infallible, though not necessarily the sort of kids you would have gotten along with yourself at that age. And there's a Heinleinian flavor in that the main characters take the time to discuss ethics and other social and philosophical issues, at an admittedly somewhat simplified level. The \\"sense of wonder\\" is certainly there. Panshin goes off the rails just a bit here and there, mostly in the telling of a couple of extended campfire stories which have nothing whatever to do with advancing the plot, but it's generally a very enjoyable book. But a \\"classic\\"? I don't think I would go that far."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"This book creates a dichotomy in a critical reader's mind. The book is well-written with nice character development and an interesting coming-of-age adventure, however, the overall concept is laughably silly. I would recommend this book to my teenage daughter but not to my adult sisters or brothers.Some reviewers have argued that a starkly simple moral tale is the point of the novel but I disagree. Without spoiling the book, the moral tale is about the evils of overpopulation, which had led to the destruction of Earth. However, the author was 28-years-old when the book was published in an era struggling with a sudden upsurge in the world's population; apparently, he had not worked out the logic and implications of his morality tale.The setting is a half-empty spaceship in a universe of over 100 colony worlds all of which are sparsely populated. Nevertheless, there are strict prohibitions against reproduction and the long-lived spaceship's couples are held to only one child or so every 40 years or so (the author is intentionally nebulous about the details but a close reading will provide these approximations). Apparently, the leaders of the spaceship believe that the short-lived inhabitants on the planets should not be allowed to govern themselves plus the tiny settlements on the 100+ planets should be held to the same strict prohibitions on birth.The adventure in which the morality lectures are tucked revolves around a further whittling of the population: when the ship's children turn 14, they must go on a \\"trial\\" where only a portion will survive. The author is purposely fuzzy about the math of his depopulation scheme but it would not take many generations for humans to be extinct in the galaxy, a result that the author ostensibly does not champion.The charm of the book is how well the author weaves an adventure story into a moral lecture. I would like to recommend it more highly but the logic comes crashing down for anyone who actually considers the rationale behind the moral that the young author was struggling to tell."},{"Title":"Rite of Passage","review":"I, too, can't believe this book is out of print!

The method itself is considered to be of limited use. The polar opposite of this book is Floyd Hunter's (1953) \\"Community Power Structure.\\" Hunter used a \\"Positional\\" method and determined that the elite govern in Atlanta.Dahl's book is good for what it is, but it is not what experts on local political power believe now.

Among these: elitism, pluralism, participatory democracy, representative democracy, technocracy, and so on. The basic text on pluralism? Robert Dahl's case study of New Haven, CT, published first in 1961.His argument was that, in this city, decision making power was divided among different groups. One set of groups was involved in, for instance, urban development. Another set in education policy within the city. Still another set of groups with respect to political nominations and elections. No single elite dominated across these issues. Hence, in his judgment, power was divided.Elected officials, too, had a role to play. The city's mayor, Richard Lee, was at the head of an \\"executive-centered coalition.\\"The central importance of this case study is its elaboration of pluralism, the politics of competing centers of power, in action. As such, it remains a classic in the world of political science."},{"Title":"Who governs?: Democracy and power in an American city","review":"Dahl's Who Governs is probably no less relevant today than it was in its own time. A fairly comprehensive quantitative and qualitative study of the political nature of the City of New Haven from its founding to approximately 1959, Dahl presents a view of American \\"democracy\\" as a democracy where resources of power are unevenly distributed, and not cumulatively held by one single segment of society. Power and government are pluralistic in a uniquely American sense in his New Haven of the past, and also \\"democratic\\" in an American understanding. In this book he gives us an idea of who and what groups are involved in power and making decisions in politics, and how those individuals at the top involve the middling and lower strata of society in their elevation to power and execution thereof.What's most interesting to me is that Dahl's conception of power under Mayor Lee in the 1950's approaches nearly a corporatist government structure based on groupings of power bases (ethnic, regional, intellectual, industry-based) and strategically selected political \\"representatives\\" of those distinct groups selected by the mayor. However, Dahl is clear to point out that although Lee ran an effective executive office that was able to effect a broad swath of policy changes, the citizens of New Haven never compromised or had compromised their \\"democratic creed\\" by the mayor's efforts.While interesting and certainly relevant to today's socio-political issues - especially his section on the levels of integration of immigrant minority groups into the political process - certainly a broader framework of understanding needs to be considered to understand American democracy and electoral politics as a whole. As expected Dahl is quick to remind the reader that New Haven has to be considered in a broader context of the entire United States. Even so, this work contains a number of concepts and frameworks that can be applied to a holistic understanding of the ever-evolving pluralistic nature of American politics and power."},{"Title":"Who governs?: Democracy and power in an American city","review":"First-rate analysis of the dynamics of power in the shaping of an American city.

In THE PRODIGAL TEXAN by Lynnette Kent, the author rounds out the series by focusing on Miranda Wright, the mayor of the town of Homestead, Texas, who is the reason this town still exists. She helped set up a program in which land that once belonged to private citizens is now being given away as part of a plan to bring in new blood to this dying town. While Miranda had been mentioned and appeared in all of the previous books, she is now front and center in this story, and the reader finally gets to find out what makes this woman tick. I found it very interesting that she was not what I had expected. In the previous books, Miranda comes across as somewhat rigid, very forceful, and totally in control. However, Miranda's past is one of a young girl who was considered the class dunce, and someone who would never achieve anything in life, let alone be a success at a prominent job. She proved the town wrong by running for mayor and winning. In the process, she made a few enemies, and angered others when she instituted the Homestead program.Jud Ritter is the black sheep of his family. He had left town years ago, partly due to a rumor that he had gotten the town slut pregnant. Jud is now back in town, and discovering that many of the townspeople still believed in these old rumors. Jud's brother Ethan won't speak to him, and Miranda is embarrassed to be associated with Jud because of an incident that happened four years ago right before she became mayor. A kiss which may have meant more to her than to Jud, she can't forget this embarrassing event and does not want to see Jud again. However, Jud is in town to help the local sheriff get to the bottom of the crimes being committed around town, seemingly associated with the Homestead program, and may be targeted now at Miranda. The two are forced together in more ways than one.This has been an enjoyable series from beginning to end, and THE PRODIGAL TEXAN is a fitting conclusion. The reader finally gets to know Miranda Wright, a woman who tries desperately to prove to herself and the town she grew up in that she can amount to something, that she was no longer that insecure girl who was kept back two grades. The reader will also be happy to find that the mystery behind the crimes committed in Homestead is finally revealed so there are no lose threads hanging. Jud Ritter and Miranda come across as two very unlikely soul mates, and one may even come to a conclusion that Jud Ritter is not a very likeable man at all. But as with all people, it sometimes takes a while to really get to know someone, and this truly is the case with Jud Ritter. His relationship with his brother Ethan also makes the story a very interesting read, as it shows how two brothers can be total opposites despite the fact that they had the same two parents. A subplot featuring Miranda's mother Nan and the hired hand, a much younger man named Cruz Martinez, enhances the already fascinating story. THE PRODIGAL TEXAN is almost two romances in one, since there is also much focus on Nan and Cruz's tale. The two plots mingle together quite nicely, as does the subplot of the mystery behind the crimes committed in Homestead, Texas. Readers will also be happy to see familiar characters from the previous books in the series. Reading THE PRODIGAL TEXAN is almost like coming home. Recommended for the plot line but also for its likeable characters, THE PRODIGAL TEXAN is a good example of how well written a Harlequin Superromance can be. - Courtesy of Love Romances."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Texan","review":"This was the last book in a series of Texas adventure books and they were all good books, of course, my heros have always been cowboys."},{"Title":"Frommer's Born to Shop Great Britain","review":"I use Super Shopper Suzy as my tour book guide and then fit in the museums and free sights in my favorite English towns & London.

Well, just like now, the couple that reaps the greatest wrath is that of a black man and a white woman. Here, Dr. Mumford shows that in the 1920s, demarcated areas of large cities became places where the races mixed surreptitiously, just as others would drink alcohol during Prohibition or engage in any other stigmatized practice.I enjoyed hearing of my hometown of Chicago in the same breath as New York City. Usually, academics focus on the latter and forget the former. This book was a breath of fresh air which reminded me that there was a long period when Chi-Town was the Second City. Dr. Mumford states that other cities, such as Cleveland and Detroit, had interzones. Graduate students in those localities may want to use this book to write their own specific research in this area.Even though this book covers sexual activities, it is far from sexy and that will disappoint many. This text does not give juicy accounts of people from 100 years ago talking about their own interracial sex lives. Instead, it is filled with quotes from police investigators discussing this activity. If you got a kick out of seeing the film \\"Mandingo\\" or reading about Malcolm Little's exploits \\"across the color line,\\" you will find nothing that titillating here.Dr. Mumford asserts that anti-vice advocates suppressed white prostitution and thus prostitution became a whiteman-blackwoman activity. This is not surprising since this sexual coupling was common before the Emancipation Proclamation. However, there are many racist people that would not hold company with blacks. Dr. Mumford suggests that white clients were more than happy to contract black prostitutes, but I imagine that in the pre-Civil Rights era, many clients would have said, \\"If I can't get a white woman, then I don't want anybody at all.\\" Dr. Mumford mentions that the Cotton Club had black entertainers and white audiences, but refused to allow black audiences inside. I wonder if the same dynamic happened in these interzones. Did white men go to brothels in black neighborhoods, but still in pursuit of white sex workers?Dr. Mumford actually discuss venues where Asian men danced with white women before talking of black-white couplings. Thus, he breaks the black-white binary that many Latino and Asian academics lament. However, he never mentions whether these brideless Asian men could have or tried to connect with African-American women. Other academics have noted that in California Asian Indian men married Mexicanas when their were no Asian women around to marry. Did the same thing happen in Chicago and NYC? Why does the author ignore the potential dynamic between groups of color?Dr. Mumford states that he is biracial and wants this book to be a source of strength for other biracial persons in America. While an admirable goal, I highly doubt this book would make biracial readers happy because it says nothing about happy mixed couples raising children with positive identities in a supportive community. This book was all about authorities trying to break up mixed couples and mixed couples usually getting together for X-rated activities or failing to be allowed to marry. While we grow from learning the tragedies of the past, reading of that past can be a bitter pill to swallow.Dr. Mumford includes a chapter on gay dynamics in these interzones. Gay studies enthusiasts may really want to peep this chapter. Dr. Mumford cites John D'Emilio, Jeffrey Weeks, and other gay studies experts. It truly shows how their founding work has influenced many aspects of the study of sexuality. Still, I found the gay chapter to be a bit cluttered.The back cover states that Dr. Mumford is an independent scholar who lives in Madison, Wisconsin. Any college should jump at the chance to hire this author, especially UW at Madison, given it lack of racial diversity and its controversies surrounding it. They would be foolish not to hire him for a tenure-track position immediately. In fact, any college in or around New York City or Chicago would greatly benefit by having such a rigorous and promising scholar in their history department. A guy this sharp who can write a book this strong should not be just floating out in the wind.Dr. Mumford's book mostly move chronologically, then, near the end of the book, he mentions \\"Birth of a Nation,\\" a film made in 1915, not the Roaring Twenties. This non-linear move doesn't make sense. I also thought the conclusory chapter was irrelevant. Dr. Mumford moves from police reports to theater to more police reports to a film. This vacillating between life and art may bother some readers, especially hardcore historians. However, since I think art influences life and culture heavily, I did not have a problem with it."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"Irving's book on the Alhambra and the surrounding territory of Granada remains one of the best guidebooks to the region--and one of the most entertaining travelogues ever written. Anyone who has visited (or plans to visit) southern Spain will be thrilled by the account of Irving's trip, but I'll go further: you need not ever go there to enjoy this classic work of history and humor.Irving stayed at the Alhambra for three months in 1829 and jotted down notes concerning its history and legends. Early in his visit, Irving was accosted by Mateo Ximenes, a credulous and indigent \\"son of the Alhambra\\" who soon proves a worthy and endearing companion, a guide to secret chambers, and a conveyor of whimsical traditions. A couple of years later, while in London, Irving wrote \\"The Alhambra,\\" describing his idiosyncratic hosts, recounting the millennium-old history of the Moorish occupation, and transcribing fresh versions of the palace's medieval legends and myths, many of which resemble stories from the \\"Arabian Nights.\\" The first edition appeared in 1832, a second American edition was published four years later, but Irving extensively revised and enlarged the book in 1851, incorporating material unavailable or unknown to him in the 1830s. This last edition is the one most commonly available today.The result is easily Irving's most accessible book, filled with wit and anecdote. Alongside the history of the Moorish kingdom of Granada, Irving intersperses tales (both historical and mythical) of enchanted caves, imprisoned princesses, and buried treasure. His admiration for Islamic heritage is obvious throughout: \\"The Arab invasion and conquest brought a higher civilization and a nobler style of thinking, into Gothic Spain.\\" And he regularly denounces the prejudices (both medieval and contemporary) \\"so strongly characteristic of the bigot zeal, which sometimes inflamed the Christian enterprises\\" and which have prevented his fellow Europeans from studying a rich and justifiably proud tradition.As Irving accurately summarizes, Moslem Spain was \\"a region of light amid Christian, yet benighted Europe; externally a warrior power fighting for existence; internally a realm devoted to literature, science, and the arts; where philosophy was cultivated with a passion . . . and where the luxuries of sense were transcended by those of thought and imagination.\\" Plus, the Islamic \\"occupiers\\" and Christian warriors certainly knew how to tell a good story. This book will delight both history and literature buffs."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"I don't always like to read classics, but when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book, I decided to try it, and I am very glad that I did. Irving's words, though written so many years before now, still paint eloquent pictures of the Spain of his time. I could almost see what he was seeing. The stories and legends are also wonderful and fascinating. An antique copy of this book is one of my most treasured gifts."},{"Title":"The Alhambra","review":"Many Americans know Washington Irving as the author of \\"the Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" and \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". Few realize that he was also a world traveler, scholarly fluent in Arabic and Spanish and something of an Hispanophile, to the say least.Irving's book is largely responsible for the widespread romantic image of Spain. It is a collection of observation, history, fairy tale, written in Irving's unique blend of romanticism and healthy skepticism. It is roughly framed by his journey to the Alhambra and his departure from it, an in between we are given a tour of the grounds and hear a few tales (including tales of Moorish ghosts on headless horses) which are roughly intertwined as in the Arabian Nights. Indeed, this little book is the 'Arabian Nights' of the west.Before visit the Alhambra read this book.

She writes here with understated passion and unqualified empathy for their plight.Anyone who wants to know why we have a fourty hour work should read this book. Addams writes about the desirablity of factory work over household work for young women, due both to the lack of isolation and the relatively short working hours, \\"only\\" from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week.Anyone who wants to know why we minimum wage laws, social security disability laws, age discrimination laws, social security laws, welfare laws, etc. should read this book. Addams writes about people earning pennies an hour, having their peak earning years in their twenties, being disabled in their thirties, and being dependent on children for financial support. The children, in turn had their education stop before high school so they can support their families.Anyone who wants to know why governments spend so much money on education should read this book. Addams writes about children having a choose limited to factory employment or household service, with the more intellectually oriented being doomed to spend a lifetime haunting public libraries and public lectures, but having virtually no chance of escaping the circumstance of their birth.Anyone who wants to know why poverty-stricken people are suspicious of political reform movements should read this book. Addams writes about the major efforts Chicago's political powerhouses made to help individual poverty-stricken people, and the irrelevance of wisdom advocating personal savings to people who could not pay for food for their family, or of wisdom urging them to stay out of taverns when they were a great source of personal help and friendship.One hundred and five years after Addams wrote this book, the United States is a far better place to live than it was then. But our country's improvements, urged by great progressive leaders like Addams, are under relentless right-wing assaults today. This book is extremely relevant to our country's future, if our future is going to continue to better than our past.The introduction of Charlene Haddock Seigfried, the past president of the Society for the Advancement of American philosophy, adds a great deal to this work, as it places Addams and her fellow reformers into the context of both their times and the prevailing systems of thought.Addams saw democracy as a way of life, and not just a series of electoral choices. She sought a major expansion of municipal services, to both improve the living standards of the desperately poor and to wean them away from dependence on corrupt political machines. She advocated the existence of \\"A reformer who really knew the people and their great human needs, who believed it was the business of government to serve them, and who further recognized the educative power of a sense of responsibility....\\"Addams addresses this book to the philanthropic community which provided the base of her financial support. She clearly saw them as providing seed money for demonstration projects to create greater governmental and societal commitment.It is fashionable in some quarters to say that nothing has been done and nothing can be done to improve the plight of the poverty-stricken. Anyone who believes that, or must deal with others who believe that, should read and quote liberally from this book."},{"Title":"Democracy and social ethics (The Citizen's library of economics, politics, and sociology)","review":"Jane Addams proceeds democracy into every aspect of life.

Well-written and insightful, &quot;Racial Attitudes in America&quot; is also very understandable for the curious observer of race relations. Schuman et al. analyze national survey data from the 1970s to the present in order to understand how the public feels about such important issues as affirmative action and other &quot;race-targeted&quot; policies. Moreover, the authors examine the extent to which prejudice and other negative racial attitudes are still widespread in the United States. Though extremely informative, the book devotes far more attention to examining trends in racial attitudes than to understanding the sources of them. Nonetheless, this book will provide a valuable starting point for any student or researcher interested in understanding the sources of racial attitudes."},{"Title":"Worship of the Heart: Essays on Jewish Prayer (Meotzar Horav)","review":"This is one of about a dozen volumes published after Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik's death (1903-1993) based on writings he never published. This one, the second of the posthumous volumes, contains ten essays on prayer. He offers his understanding of the purpose of prayer, the meaning of several specific prayers, and his concept of what God expects of people. This is the third of his posthumous book that I read - see my reviews of The Emergence of Ethical Man and Family Redeemed, the first and the last of the published posthumous volumes. In all three books, contrary to the current thinking of many Jews, Rabbi Soloveitchik frequently uses biblical and halakhic sources that show that Judaism expects its adherents to live a full, enjoyable, and natural life. However, in seeming contrast to this liberal approach, he insists that Jews sacrifice their desires and fully accept the dictates of halakhah.Rabbi Soloveitchik sees prayer as \\"the media through which man communicates with the Almighty God.\\" Prayer is \\"an expression of human nature.\\" People need to pray. They can experience God while praying. But this encounter can only be achieved when people pray with kavanah, deep concentration, because \\"the physical performances (of prayer) divorced from the inner experience is worthless.\\" For example, the basic theme of the Amidah prayer - the prayer recited while standing - is distress, and people who say this prayer should be conscious of their distress while saying it. Similarly, the purpose of the Shema prayer - \\"Hear, Israel, the Lord our God is one\\" - is a \\"declaration, confession, profession of faith,\\" and people should feel and understand the verse's meaning while reciting it.Prayer, he teaches, should prompt people to stop being passive, to become involved with the world, \\"improving creation, of confronting evil and destructive forces, of protecting himself against the disease of natural catastrophes, approaching the world with an optimistic philosophy of activism.\\" People need to understand that God is not only \\"the source and root of truth and light, of fact and value...but also that He is the origin of beauty, of the delightful and the pleasant\\" and these creations should not be ignored. \\"Only through coming in contact with the beautiful and exalted may one apprehend God...feel the embrace of the Creator, and the warm breath of infinity.\\"God is not found in books, even holy books, but only when one experiences the beauties and difficulties of life. \\"Only when man lives through the great encounter with the unknown in the night of doubt, suffering incessant dread and depression, does he experience the daybreak of a cheerful faith, full of promise of delivery and bliss.\\" Contrary to the views of some people, \\"accepting the yoke of Heaven signifies the fulfillment of both the natural law and moral law.\\"People must understand that prophecy, communication with God, has not ceased. God speaks to man through \\"the immediate, living, avid concrete and fleeting world of sense perception and sensation. Being, in all its dimensions, is a revelation. God wills the cosmic process and speaks through it.\\"But, Rabbi Soloveitchik states, Judaism insists that people sacrifice themselves whenever halakhah (Jewish laws as interpreted by the rabbis) demands that the Jew perform certain acts. \\"The most satisfactory offering to God is the conquest of one's culturally-conditioned desires if they are opposed to God's will. Halakhah did not prescribe total withdrawal from life or an asceticism of the flesh. On the contrary, Halakhah wants man to enjoy God's world.\\" One example is mentioned in his book Family Redeemed: husbands should enjoy the benefits of married life; however, because ancient halakhah demands it, they should know that Judaism does not allow their wives to participate fully in Jewish life.In summary, Rabbi Soloveitchik teaches that people need to understand that God did not create the world so that is should be ignored, God is revealed in the laws of nature and the beauties of the world; and prayer, like many other things, is a natural phenomenon, a human need, a way of expressing love and distress, and communicating with oneself and with God. Jews should live a full natural life. However, they must observe all the dictates of halakhah."},{"Title":"Worship of the Heart: Essays on Jewish Prayer (Meotzar Horav)","review":"The teachings of the Rav always deepen understanding and strengthen love of learning and davvening."},{"Title":"Dadisms: What He Says and What He Really Means","review":"If you think you're the only person whose dad said \\"Not under this roof, you're not\\" or \\"You're not going out in THAT!\\" then this series is going to broaden your horizons!

Each and every piece can stand on it's own, and putting them all together is very meaningful. I shared this with my own children to appreciate Handel's work as they listened and looked. I have this out right after Thanksgiving, and leave it out until Easter. Often it is picked up by visitors and becomes a great subject of conversation. It would be a great addition to any home library, as well as a perfect memorial book for a church."},{"Title":"Messiah: Calligraphic Word Pictures Inspired by the Music and Text of George Frederick Handel's Messiah, With Notes by the Artist","review":"There really are no words adequate to describe this book. As Handel's music lifts the spirit of the text, Timothy Bott's use of lettering, size, color and placement of words on the page in the description of the text is unique in my experience, in its ability to touch the soul. This is a book you will want to keep close by all year long, to be touched again and again by its inspiring and deeply meaningful expression of the Christmas/Resurrection story."},{"Title":"Messiah: Calligraphic Word Pictures Inspired by the Music and Text of George Frederick Handel's Messiah, With Notes by the Artist","review":"Messiah: Calligraphic Word Pictures Inspired by the Music and Text of Handel's Messiah. Stunning, brilliant, thought-provoking, colorful and very moving."},{"Title":"Messiah: Calligraphic Word Pictures Inspired by the Music and Text of George Frederick Handel's Messiah, With Notes by the Artist","review":"For those who know and love Handel's immortal oratorio Messiah, this beautifully-designed book is like a heavenly Godsend from above. The calligraphy that Timothy Botts adopts for the different sections of the text is tasteful and appropriate to the Biblical text and the nuances of Handel's music as well. What strikes the reader is that the calligraphy so graphically depicts the words of the oratorio that you don't need to be a Messiah lover to appreciate the calligraphy of the text.Every page is a feast for the eyes and Botts copes with the demands of the text and the music admirably. For example, in the pages of the Hallelujah Chorus, Botts includes the phrase \\"For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth\\" exactly five times, just like in the musical text as we hear it. Also, he uses more florid lettering for the \\"Rejoice greatly\\" section of the soprano's aria, with serious lettering for the middle section, \\"He is the righteous Saviour\\", just as it should be in the actual oratorio. And in the \\"For unto us\\" chorus, you have the cries of \\"Wonderful Counsellor\\" in big, bold and flashy letterings at the bottom of the page, with the first part of the chorus building up to those exclamatory declamations. I could go on and on about the examples, but then there are too many to fit into one review. In short, all the different calligraphic styles integrate themselves into the whole work very nicely for a cohesive whole.The helpful thing about this book is that in addition to the visual feast that Botts provides for us with his tasteful calligraphy, he also has notes on the side of the word-pictures to explain how each different calligraphic style works in relation to the text and the music. Reading these notes, you can see how much thought he put into the word-paintings of this book, so that they matched not only the words but Handel's glorious music as well. The only point of note is that there is a slight inaccuracy in the \\"Trumpet shall sound\\" passage, because Botts illustrates the words \\"For this corruptible must put on incorruptible...\\" rather than \\"...must put on incorruption...\\", but this word-painting still comes across as an effective calligraphic pictorial representation of this verse.Overall, though, this is an absolutely divine and heavenly Messiah book that can exist both as a companion to Handel's oratorio and as an independent book of its own. It's sad to know that it is out of print, for it could put CD librettos to shame before long. I strongly recommend this otherwise cherishable book to everyone who loves the Handel Messiah, and urge everyone to find a copy to accompany their existing recordings, including Pinnock, Gardiner and Solti."},{"Title":"Messiah: Calligraphic Word Pictures Inspired by the Music and Text of George Frederick Handel's Messiah, With Notes by the Artist","review":"This is a lovely book.

More recently, there have been sacred texts of major religions, along with the likes of Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Ernest Thayer, Clement Clarke Moore, Bob Dylan, and Ani DiFranco. Verse is the genesis of literature. The language of verse is so appealing that the works of these poets has endured for hundreds or thousands of years.Nevertheless, if there were verse novels when I was a kid, it was a secret to me. It has been in the last dozen years that the genre has really taken off, with exceptional works by Karen Hesse, Mel Glenn, Sonya Sones, Virginia Euwer Wolff, Ron Koertge, and Ann Turner, among others.Great verse novels are typically filled with wonderful language. I love how the form permits an author to incorporate this language into a sophisticated story while paring the words to a minimum. How each poem in the book can present a complete, unique, little picture. How the form allows authors to present the perspectives of multiple characters in a single book.Such is the case with JINX, a gem of a verse novel, written by Australian author Margaret Wild. JINX is the name Jen gives herself when her teenage world comes completely unglued. We get to see and hear from Jen, as well as friends, parents, and stepparents, as they all try to find their way.jen's mom will writeJen's mom writes advertising copy.She specializes in white goods:washing machines, dryers, fridges,freezers, dishwashers.She hates these applianceshulkingin corners,power-hungry and fractious.One day, she will have a wood stove,and she'll write about things that matter--she will write about birth and death,about love and the absence of love,about fathers and children,about mothers and daughters,about lovers and friends.She'll write about the whole goddamnwonderful, awful businessof loving and being loved.One of the most intriguing characters of the book is Grace, Jen's sister whose Down's syndrome was detected early enough that her mom had the option of terminating the pregnancy.

Shortlisted by the Australian Children's Book Council for Book of the Year for Older Readers, it should gain similar attention here.And who knows?

She says that if you go out with her you will die.Before she started dating, she was boring old Jen who never stayed out late and always turned her homework in on time. Now she is all alone, boyfriend-less and depressed.Towards the end of the book we find her trying to find her way back to being Jen, and no longer Jinx.Written in poetry style, JINX is kind of depressing, even the end of the book.

Unlike other teenagers, Jen is absolutely perfect in every way. She always hands in her homework on time, she can always be counted on, she never stays out late, she's boring, dull, safe, etc. That is, until Jen's very first boyfriend dies. To Jen, it's just a streak of bad luck. Until her second boyfriend dies as well. Jen, now referring to herself as Jinx, for that's what she now is, a jinx, is alone, angry, and a curse. Forced to live her life now in what could almost be classified in seclusion, Jinx begins fighting her way back to Jen, where she will now happily return to being dull, safe, boring, Jen.When I first began reading this book, I was shocked to see that it was a novel written in verse, as the back cover almost led you to believe that it was an actual novel. And, even though I have never read a novel written in verse, I was quite pleased with this one. JINX is a poignant look at a teenage girl who goes from being unhappy with her life for being perfect, to being unhappy with her life for being unlucky. During the tremendous turn of events, Jinx realizes that her life was great before tragedy struck, and wishes that she had never been unhappy with being known as perfect Jen. Margaret Wild has created a wonderful verse novel filled with the emotions that teenagers, both male and female, feel everyday in their lives. A wonderful book for all, especially those going through what they believe is turmoil.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I don't like to read gory serial killer/stalker details, and I almost bailed out on this. Instead, I just skipped the occasional brief chapters in italics which are from the mind of the killer. The rest of the book totally hooked me and was well worth it. The characters are original without being too wacky, and the Mississippi setting is a refreshing change. He also does a good job of integrating technical material into the story, which makes it more interesting without being pedantic."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"EROS is a high end, very expensive, intensely private and ultra-kinky erotic on-line chat room service. When several normally high frequency users of the service drop off line but continue to allow the almost exorbitant debits to be charged to their bank accounts, Harper Cole, the EROS systems operator, becomes suspicious and worried. As a skilled internet derivatives, commodities and futures trader, he is well aware of the power of money and is justifiably concerned that something has happened to this set of vanishing customers. Further investigation with the help of his colleague, Miles Turner (a very eccentric geek type with extraordinary computer skills) morphs these worries into an ironclad certainty that these customers have been murdered by another EROS customer whom they label \\"Brahma\\".They also discover that Brahma has murdered a male EROS customer and stolen his on-line EROS persona to trap unwitting victims.When they bring their suspicions to the attention of the authorities, local police and the FBI immediately place him and Miles as #1 and #2 on the suspect list for the string of brutal serial killings concentrating their efforts, of course, in this completely wrong direction. Cole and Turner realize that their own freedom, not to mention the lives of other EROS subscribers, depend on their trapping the killer themselves. Concocting an elaborate on-line false identity, they conduct an elaborate ruse to bring the killer into the open but time after time, the brilliant killer sniffs out his pursuers and remains one step ahead of them. They come to realize that they are now targets and, not only have they placed themselves in dire peril, but they've managed to endanger Cole's child, the mother of his child and his trusting wife.Greg Iles has created a plot with the potential to sizzle off the page - sex, brutality, blood and guts, computer technology, cat and mouse games with an insanely brilliant and devious killer - but, sadly, \\"Mortal Fear\\" is actually an overly long, under-edited series of sadly missed opportunities.\\"Mortal Fear\\" could have delved into the sociological ramifications of on-line sex as a form of infidelity. It didn't. \\"Mortal Fear\\" could have dug deeply into the legal issues of \\"right to privacy\\". It didn't. \\"Mortal Fear\\" could have discussed the psychological impact of incest on its participants and victims. It didn't. \\"Mortal Fear\\" could have provided some absolutely fascinating sidebars on the science of transplants, hemophilia and the pineal gland, in particular. It didn't. (I know, I know ... that came out of left field but if you actually bother to read \\"Mortal Fear\\" after reading this review, you'll discover how these things fit into Iles' plot!) \\"Mortal Fear\\" could have discussed the esoteric art of serial killer profiling in considerably greater detail. It didn't. On top of that, each and every one of his characters were quite flat. There was lots of action, lots of dialogue and lots of movement but none of it really seemed to lift the story off the page into believability.Frankly, a poor effort overall in comparison to some of his other page turners such as \\"Turning Angel\\". Not recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is why I don't like it when people recomend books, films, or music. Everyone has different tastes and you can only tell someone what you like, not what they would like. This is the case with the book Mortal Fear by Greg Iles. It came highly recomended by a good friend of mine and I thought I'd give it a go. I've read about 200 pages and to put it simpley I just didn't care how it turned out.First off, I really had trouble suspending my disbelief. Try as I might, I really don't believe anyone would pay that exorbatant amount of money to be on a sex website. Second, the story tended to drag....ALOT!! At times I literally forgot what I was reading because nothing integral to the plot was happening. There were a few times where I skipped over entire parts because it just seemed to drone on needlessly. But the worst part is that I had no idea what was going on, who the main characters were, or even what thier names are. The main character is some kind of investor who runs a high priced sex website. There's six women who have been murdured. The main character isn't compelling at all. So much so that for the first 75 pages I couldn't even remember his name. Where Ian Flemming's James Bond is the world's greatest spy, Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne is the most highly trained goverment agent, and Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt is a famous undersea explorer, this guy was just a painfully average shmoe. There's really nothing special about him that makes you want to see what happens to him. Some may find that appealing but I don't. The murdurs aren't compelling either. I said \\"okay they're dead...so what?'. Not a good sign.Maybe it's that I grew up watching James Bond movies or that serial killers hold no fascination for me but this book really did absolutley nothing for me. I expected alot more. And it failed to deliver on just about every level. So much so that I'm not going to finish it. That's two in a row."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"love this book fantastic history he is the best the tile says it all . i recomend this audio story. the best love it love it,"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I really enjoy Greg Iles work. As I have said in other reviews, he is simply the best in the mystery thriller area. But this is not his best. It is too long, too lurid in some respects. And his characters don't have the depth of some of his other characters as in Blood Memory. But this is still a good read. I wish the publisher could have found a better print method of showing us what was being written on line when the characters were logged onto EROS as contrasted with the basic story line. But maybe they used the best method possible. I just found the bold type in a different font distracting. And I wanted more of the \\"bad guy.\\" I wanted more interaction with him, more insight. I admit I am not sure how Iles could have given us that since we were learning about the bad guy from the good guy.

Rarely does someone succeed on all levels but in this case Iles comes close. First of all, he succeeds on a literary level. The writing is erudite, mesemrizing, even poetic. One is drawn to Harper Cole and his life instantly. An options trader by day, erotic web site sysops by night, he becomes involved in a something that spins out of control. The fact that he is married, lives in Mississippi and has deep and dark secrets of his own only adds to the story.Yes, there is a serial killer but he is not your average \\"capture torture mutilate\\" slug. There is something going on that escapes detection except to those few with the intelligence to ask questions. This brings me to another strong point of the book: All four main characters (including the bad guy) are very smart and this is reflected not only in their conversations but in their very lives - their actions and feelings.The killer in this case is not a \\"stranger beside you\\" but a true stranger whose own life contains enough material for a room of psychiatric couches. He is a gifted, driven pathetic creature who shows that genius does not lead to logical thinking or moral actions. Everyone in the story makes moral choices and all pay the consequences. Another good offering by Iles."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I think Greg Iles is one of the best in his genre, far better than Grisham. This book is no exception. A bit lengthy, and some of it a little unbelieveable, but still keeps you hanging right up until the end. Dead Sleep was great too - if not better than Mortal Fear - but because Mortal Fear introduces the characters of FBI agents Baxter and Lenz, and there is something big that happens in Mortal Fear that is alluded to in Dead Sleep, it's a bit of a bummer if you read Dead Sleep first (like I did) because you kind of see it coming."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Well written, excellent book.

As a history buff, for many years I've been interested in all accounts of the Nazi/Third Reich Regime, but which I ultimately got only after having read Mortal Fear and being completely engrossed in the terrifying plot, which Mr. Iles tells with his exquisite writing style. I will be reading more from Mr. Iles in the upcoming weeks and months, as I feel he will not disappoint, but will keep me reading through the night, on many a night.

This was a very exciting thriller that I found difficult to put down. The plot involved a doctor and his wife/concubine who were working on some twisted scientific theory, gathering specimins for their experiments. Well, there's more to it than that of course, but in comes the main character, Harper Cole who works as a SYSOP for this website. Harper has some secrets that come into play and eventually lead the killers to his doorstep. Harper was certainly a flawed character who was attempting to do the 'right' thing. Harper is married to Drewe, a local doctor. Drewe is the sister of Erin, who is the mother of Holly. Unknown to Drewe, her husband is the father of her sister's daughter.Oh-oh, that could be trouble. Drewe was probably the most likable character in the book and she turned out to be a lot stronger than I or her husband expected. Anyway, this book has plenty of action and plenty of great subplots going on dealing with the family situation and in the end they all tie in together. This is the second book I've read by Greg Iles and the second one that was over 600 pages and definately did not seem that long. This is a quick read and and easy recommend.

[clich&eacute;d but true]. iles draws the characters out. you not only get to know who they are, but you get the feel For them. any author that can do that for a story already rates 4 stars. but the plot, the turns, makes me give it a five. the line where the doctor thanked miles in his journal for the list makes you wonder about miles and his role in all this.what i really enjoyed about this story was the dialogue. he doesn't spill the characters guts in one session, but instead over several. iles lets you into their minds bit by bit.very tempting or infuriating, whichever way you want to look at it.my favorite character has to be miles. i was disappointed that he wasn't mentioned as much as i would have liked.one bad thing about the story though was krislov's role. she was the owner of EROS, but iles rarely even mentioned her. the way the story was told, she took cues from miles. i didn't go for that. he should have clarified her role more.other than that the book was absublutely wonderful. and yes i'm an anne rice fan, and yes i'm a net freak. i agree with the review on the front cover. i hadn't even noticed it until i finished reading the book. hehe.you can read all the reviews you want, but you'll never know if you'll like any story unless you read it yourself. you're never gonna find a book that everyone loves. so don't let a few bad reviews spoil the fun."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Truly a great book!

The dated computer references are minute in comparison to the storyline, however. This author has the most intense character creation and he is a top-notch writer as well. The most incredible character is the villain--a completely deranged psychopath that is part genius and part erotic mess (when you learn of his childhood, you'll understand why). The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the main character's wife needed more development.

Loved it"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear is a truly chilling story. Harper Cole is a futures trader, he is also a key employee in an online erotic website whose primary patrons are wealthy women. Cole is the first to realize that some of his clients are being killed off in in bizzarre, violent ways. The M.O.'s don't match, but one thing does: each of these women has had their pinneal glands removed and Harper Cole is the FBI's number one suspect. Cole has no choice but to be his own advocate and so begins a cat and mouse game between himself disguised as his own sister-in-law and a brilliant serial killer.Author Greg Iles uses the fact that the anonymous nature of the internet breeds both brutal honesty and the ability to be as deceptive as we like. This anonymity is an illusion that is only a click away for a skilled computer hacker and therein lies the really frightening atmosphere that is created. The most chilling parts of the book take place between the disguised Cole and the Killer nicknamed \\"Brahma\\" by the FBI. We learn the secret past of this killer and also the secret darkness that Harper Cole has hidden deeply within. What makes this so chilling is the readers realization of his/her own darkness; the things that we keep tightly within ourselves for fear that the masks that we wear will be torn away revealing a demon beneath.Mortal Fear is a frighteningly pleasureable read that hits at the core of what it means to be three dimensional beings that contain within all the worlds darkness and all the worlds light.A must read for fans of subtle horror."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"One thing I love about Greg Iles is that he isn't a \\"template\\" writer and every one of his books is so different and fascinating in their own way. I thought this was one of his creepiest stories since it involves an internet porn site where the killer selects his victims. The psychological twists and turns that this novel takes will keep you hooked throughout the book.I did think the book was a little too long and could have been pared down without destroying the story. The character development is exceptional and it is very hard to tell who the \\"bad guy\\" really is.....there are several possibilities to keep the reader guessing.One part that was not very believable was when Drewe, Harper's wife, reveals herself to the killer towards the end. Drewe is a physician and a reserved and \\"proper\\" Southern woman. She is disgusted by the porn industry and wants no part of it. Her sudden transformation in the midst of terror-filled moments when she becomes the object of the killer's obssession, was a huge stretch by any means of the imagination. One could possibly assume she was avenging her sister's untimely death, but the whole scene was still a stretch.This is a very creepy psychological thriller and well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I liked this story other than the preachy way the author deals with idfidelity. A common theme in his books. I liked the technical concepts although pretty outdated. I liked the serial killer. Good villain. In the end, the killer always catches himself, which is a little cliche. Good believable characters including the technical genius friend that you can never trust because they are always such unbelievable dumbasses."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles has done it again.

Even being familiar with computers and software .. I found it tough going in parts. Very suspenseful ending; but took a long time to get there."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles was born in Germany, raised in Mississippi, and and spent several years on the road with a band Frankly Scarlet. After marrying, he settled down and started writing and saw his first novel - \\"Spandau Phoenix\\" - published in 1993. \\"Mortal Fear\\" is his third book, and was first published in 1996.Harper Cole, was born, raised and still lives in Rain, Mississippi. A former musician who now makes his living trading futures, Cole is married to Drewe, his childhood sweetheart. Drewe, a doctor, has a sister called Erin and a very well-connected father. She also has hopes of starting a family very soon, something that Harper himself isn't quite so keen on. Harper also works as a sysop for an online computer service called EROS - as the name would imply, it provides an outlet for those who need a certain spark in their lives. The service is very expensive, but makes certain arrangements to protect the users' anonymity. Harper was brought into EROS by Miles Turner, an old friend from childhood and a very highly qualified IT expert.Karin Wheat, a high-profile author, had been a member of EROS. Unfortunately, she has also been recently murdered. The book opens with Cole contacting the police, believing he has some information which may prove crucial to the case. Harper not only suspects that Wheat was the victim of a man called David Strobekker - another EROS client who, Cole believes, is using EROS to target his victims. Having studied his account, Harper believes that Strobekker has possibly killed six other women - however, this would involve Strobekker somehow having gained access to the company's master client list. This list, which contains the contact details for all EROS's users, is not very easy to acquire - only very few people have access to it, Harper and Miles among them. Following a meeting with the police and the FBI, Harper learns that the six missing women he'd identified were, indeed, murdered. Unfortunately, it turns out the 'real' David Strobekker has also been dead for nearly a year - with the killer, presumably, taking over his account at EROS. This means that a new suspect is required - and Harper and Miles appear to be the leading contenders...as a result, Harper finds himself working the case unofficially, in an attempt to prove his innocence and protect his family.This was the first book by Iles I've read and I certainly enjoyed it. Despite its size, I was able to race through it at a fair pace - some sections were a little overlong, but I've read shorter books that were harder work. It's also nice to read a book, once in a while, where the hero has a few skeletons in the closet. (There's one of these skeletons that's putting Harper under a great deal of pressure). The villain, meanwhile - who Harper and Miles refer to as 'Brahma' - is as intelligent as he is dangerous : not only an IT expert, it becomes clear he also has a medical background. Easily good enough for me to keep an eye out for more of Iles' books."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Harper Cole, a man with some pretty dark secrets, is a systems operator for an international on-line programme known as EROS, a service that caters for the erotic sexual appetities - be they light or of a slightly darker taste - of a large number of highly-paying clients.Soon, Harper's life - and the lives of those closest to him - will be thrown into immense danger, because there is a killer at work on EROS, a twisted and terrifying serial murderer using the network to find his way into the lives and fantasies of his female victims. All of a sudden, Harper finds himself a possible suspect in the eyes of the FBI, and in an attempt both to prove his innocence and to stop a vicious killer from continuing his morbid harvest, Harper goes into EROS himself, posing as a woman he once had an affair with, in order to try and trap the killer into revealing himself.However, it quickly becomes apparent that everyone has underestimated this brutally intelligent killer, able to detect their every move and remain constantly one step ahead...Mortal Fear is surely going to be Iles' crowning achievement. Most serial killer novels are pretty standard fare, but this is not only far better than almost any other I have read, it almost transends its genre, such is the writing quality and the relentless intelligence that powers the plot and movement of the prose. The brutality of the killer (and his bizarre, if startlingly original, motives) is balanced with some wonderful philosophical examinations of humans and humanity, which give you the impression that Iles really KNOWS people, rather like Stephen King, and a slightly academic, educated feel to it all makes this so much more than just a pop-thriller, but something far greater.Iles is graced with a gift for creating incredibly strong lead male characters that, while often shaded, have the distinct feel that they could easily have been plucked form any street in any town the world over. Harper Cole is such a creation: real, full, and likeable. His conflicts, secrets, problems, are all fascianting andf the reader grows to care quite deepy about their having a sucessful resolution.The plot is incredibly strong, and Iles really does bring something special to the whole notion of a killer using the internet to find his victims. There are some twists that really do shock, events that are unpredictable and come out of the blue, which is very very rare, some deaths that really do make you gasp, and even perhaps have qualms about whether you actually want to continue. But, of course you continue, because, while you cared about the characters, now you care even more that they catch the killer abd, quite frankly, kill him very painfully yet thoroughly. The killer himself is genuinely scary, which again is very rare. His seeming omniscience and intelligence will maybe even strike hints of fear into you as you read. In all truth, \\"Brahama\\", as he comes to be known, is probably more than a match for Hannibal Lecter, and I have never said that before.This is the best thriller i have read in ages. Its humanity married with cruelty make it horridly compelling, and the shadows of Eastern mythology that brood behind everything give it that extra special edge. Be sure to read this book. It is fantastic. I cannot understand why people did not rave and shout from the rooftops about this book for years after its publication because, by god, it certainly deserves that."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Although this book contains more prurient sex and more gory violence than I prefer in a novel, instead of putting it down in disgust, I couldn't stop reading. This is testament to Greg Iles very strong plotting skills, as the tension in Mortal Fear never abated. It is also testament to his even stronger characterizations.The characters in this book are real and smart and likeable, even if any one of them could be the one who is killing off women from EROS, an online erotic discussion service and taking a surgical momento from each victim. Harper Cole, the Systems Operator who connects the killings and comes forward, is ensconced in the turmoil surrounding his very Southern family. They include his physician wife Drewe, who has a great deal of hostility towards EROS; his ex-cover model sister in law Erin and her surgeon husband Patrick, whose marriage difficulties are spinning out of control; and a father-in-law with friends in high places who makes Jesse Helms look like a liberal crusader for civil rights and racial relations. With his friend and fellow SysOp Myles, whose brilliance is unparrelleled in Harper's experience, there are plenty of suspects for the serial killings. Iles's writing is very intelligent and always at least three steps ahead of the reader.This book sucked away three days of my life, which is my way of saying: read it! Although there is little socially redeeming value in this novel, it's a very smart thriller and intensely escapist."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"The tension was so great while I read this novel, there were times when I didn't think I wanted to finish the book. Greg Iles' serial killer is one of the most frightening characters in modern suspense writing. The killer, who goes by a number of aliases on the internet, is evil incarnate. His chilling biography alone is enough to write a novel about. It is, among many other parts of this book, a stroke of genius.Mr. Iles has done a highly magnificent and intelligent job of creating a plot that holds you and won't let you go. As I said, there were times I didn't think I could read to the end of MORTAL FEAR--not because I didn't like the writing, but because I didn't think my heart could stand the constant tension that just kept mounting through every chapter to the very end. Reading &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; was the last time a book had that much impact. I do a LOT of reading, so my hat is off to Greg Iles for his great writing.Halfway through finishing MORTAL FEAR, I immediately hunted down the rest of Iles' novels which, alas, are too few. I have added him to my very short list of favorite writers, the other two being Nelson DeMille and Elizabeth George. All three writers use character development, detail and excellent plotting to create novels that are intelligent, riveting, and just plain old fashioned good reading."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is my first Greg Isles book but I will be looking for more. I found the caracters and the plot mesmerizing. It caught and kept my attention from the very start. I almost felt like I was right there watching the tale unfold between Harper and the other caracters. It also made me think of the very real dangers that the internet could hold, if the information one doles out so readily on here is'nt watched over very carefully.From a little country farmhouse in Mississippi to a large internet company in New York there's romance, murders, and plenty of action to keep your attention. Just my kind of reading!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is the best suspense novel I have read in ages. If you like psychological suspense and you're familiar with the Internet (of course you are; you're here, aren't you? ) you will eat this novel! Harper Cole runs EROS, an online sex chatroom service, and begins to suspect foul play when women customers begin to disappear from the service but haven't cancelled their expensive subscriptions. He discovers one of the women has been brutally murdered and suspects the killer is also an EROS client. The dialogue is excellent, the storyline makes it almost impossible to put down, and the characters are well defined. And some of his descriptions of emotions and human nature were enough to make me stop and marvel at how good this guy is. And this happened about every 10 pages. Greg Iles has two previous novels, Spandau Phoenix and Black Cross, both with Nazi Germany themes. They are definitely on my list now!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Let me start out by saying that I read this book over a four week period. I picked it up to read while on a cross-country flight. On the morning of May 16, I put it down in order to read the new Michael Connely book. I got around to it again last Friday (June 3) and finished it. This was tough. When I picked it up again, I realized something. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. In fact, the lead, Harper Cole, may have been better off getting blown away on the first page.OK, it wasn't terrible. But the inconsistencies just kept adding together. For example, Miles, the ultimate computer geek, is attempting to fabricate a bogus online personality. He needs to come up with a valid street address that has phone service. For whatever reason, he is unable to hack into the telephone company computer to choose one. So instead he enters Harper Cole's real address. And of course the bad guy immediately tracks down Cole's home. Oh come now. Anyone can go into switchboard.com, enter a city & state, then enter a common last name like Smith or Jones and come up with a long list of addresses.Sorry, gang. I didn't like the book and if I had had another one available, I never would have finished it. All is not lost however. There is a local charity that accepts used books for resale. They will benefit from this one."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Thirty-something Harper Cole makes a comfortable living trading commodities from his isolated Mississippi home, but it is his second, less lucrative job that offers the more interesting perquisites: Harper is a systems operator of an exclusive online sex forum, EROS (Erotic Realtime On-line Stimulation), whose members pay hundreds of dollars a month to engage in anonymous sex chat in a hyper-private environment. As a sysop Harper can cruise the hundreds of discussions within EROS, his presence in allegedly private chat rooms undetected by the participants, and he can take part in discussions himself under assumed identities. It is an avocation his wife Drewe--a beautiful and highly intelligent obstetrician--has become uncomfortable with in recent months.As it happens, there is much to be uncomfortable about. When author Karen Wheat, an EROS client with whom Harper is more than passably familiar, is found beheaded, Harper contacts the authorities: a number of EROS clients have gone missing, and he thinks he knows who's behind their disappearances. But Harper's noble attempt to stop a serial killer's grotesque butcheries lands him and his family in peril.Greg Iles's Mortal Fear is not a perfect book. There are some loose threads left dangling in the narrative (particularly the \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" side story), and Harper is made on p. 439 to consider briefly an action entirely unworthy of his character. Some of the middle chapters, too, are rather slow going. But the book builds to a breakneck pace, so that in its final 200 pages you will forgive the story its flaws, cursing the interruptions of impertinent employers and offspring while you neglect your responsibilities and read Iles's exciting conclusion.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I've read plenty of books, none however that grab me the way Iles books do. I've read each of his books, and none of them have lasted longer than four days in my hands. In Mortal Fear he creates a character, with amazing development, that scared me so badly, I had nightmares about this guy. When and if you read it, you will demand to be left alone for the last hundred pages or so, just struggling to get through it. You will constantly tell yourself to stop reading, but you will be unable to do so. It is incredible.Iles is a terrific author, writing about Nazi Germany, racial tensions in the south, on-line stalkers, and kidnapping. I could argue for hours over which is his best book, Spandau Phoenix, Mortal Fear, or The Quiet Game, without ever coming to a conclusion."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Harper Cole trades commodities over the Internet from his isolated Mississippi farmhouse. He is also an accomplished guitarist, singer-composer, and married to a successful doctor. Nights he spends on his computer, as a systems operator for an internet sex site that guarantees its affluent clients total anonymity. Harper stumbles across some facts that indicate a stranger has infiltrated the security system and is killing off women subscribers to the site. When he reports this to the authorities, Harper and his long-time friend and associate, Miles Turner are the prime suspects.In order to prove their innocence they come up with an ingenious plan to lure the killer out into the open, but not without great personal risk to Harper and his loved ones. He has sexual secrets of his own and this puts Harper in a situation of inner conflict that reels the reader in. All the characters in this story line are great and believable.The novel builds to a fast pace, but will appeal more to a computer literate reader, as the trap to catch the killer is \\"tech\\" oriented. The computer dialogue is intense and the killer absolutely scary in his intelligence, strength and manipulative abilities.It has a little bit of everything - mystery, sex, humor, romance and suspense, but also goriness. The squeamish reader may cringe at the descriptive crime scenes, but it is definitely well written and may very well give a reader second thoughts about entering a chat room. An intense, good book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was a great trashy novel, and it really is trashy. There were many places in the book where I laughed out loud because of the terribly clich&eacute;d dialogue and general stupidity of the characters. For instance, the FBI cannot discover that a quote left by the killer was written by famous author Henry Miller. However, Harper Cole, stockbroker and porn site systems operator, recognizes the quote at a glance. In fact, every law enforcement agency in the country is made out to be a bunch of complete idiots in this book. Harper also feels the need to rehash explicit details of his sexual escapades in the name of therapy...and the reader's voyeurism! A simply summary never suffices in \\"Mortal Fear.\\" We get to hear every steamy detail, even when it's completely unbelievable that Harper would go into so much detail. But that's really what's great about this book. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It's just a fun, mysterious, gory, sexy read that would be wonderful for a long plane trip. The plot is fast paced. The mystery kept me guessing. The characters aren't necessarily likeable, but they're believable in the context of the world the author creates. Just a note though-if you know anything about computers, most of the complexity attributed to them in this book will seem really silly. EROS is made out to be an amazing creation, when it doesn't seem like much more than a chat room and some message boards. This isn't \\"War and Peace,\\" but I couldn't finish \\"War and Peace\\" anyway, because it got too boring in the middle. \\"Mortal Fear\\" is far from boring and I'll happily pick up another book written by Greg Iles."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I started reading this book 3 days ago. I just spent all day today finishing it. It's a great book! I was literally flying through the pages as I got closer to the ending.I agree with one of the reviews that there were a few loose ends that I wondered about. For instance, what happened to Eleanor Rigby? That was the last thought I had as I finally finished the last page! The book was so exciting that the little flaws didn't detract from it in any way.Harper Cole is a great main character. He's married to the almost-perfect Drewe but has a fascination for her beautiful and exciting sister, Erin. He starts working for the EROS network just for fun, he makes plenty of money in the market. Somehow his feelings for his wife and her sister leave him unsatisfied. He can't really connect with his wife. It brings to mind the old saying..\\"You don't know what you've got until it's gone.\\"Through EROS he gets involved with one the the worst villians I've seen in a book lately. They call him Brahma but who knows who he really is? When women start disappearing from the network Harper gets concerned and notifies the police. This starts a roller-coaster ride so that he sometimes wonders if he should have gotten involved. His secrets could be revealed and that would be a disaster!One of the most interesting parts was when Brahma/Maxwell (one of his aliases) was telling his life story. He told enough that Harper, Drew and Miles (Harper's best friend) could start putting the pieces together. The man was brilliant and sadistic. Harper and Miles devise a scheme to catch him....You'll have to read the book to find out if they do or not. It's worth the read!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I give this book a 4 star rating because throughout the bulk of it, the suspense was incredible. I think it is worth reading for this reason. However, the ending disappoints because it is drawn out and kind of lame. I do think it would have been difficult to come up with a conclusion to compete with the rest of the book, but there had to be a better way! So go ahead and read it; just don't expect a spectacular ending!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Pretty fair serial killer story with a modern, tech twist. It keeps you guessing but the chatroom mind game dialogue and the enormously frustrating immorality that occurs made me want to put the book down several times. The end is disapointing, as are most book endings. Typically, the tension builds until the end and then...the big letdown."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear has scenes of incredible suspence (for example when the cops go down in the underground corridor), gore and sex and whatnot - and some non-realistic characters, I mean, c'mon, Iles's FBI is a bit too informative toward their suspects :) -, but lacks the overwhelming grimness of Black Cross - now THAT is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I thought this book ran a little long at times in the middle of the story, but other than that, I really enjoyed reading about these characters. Had a hard time putting this book down towards the end. I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense novels."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear is the first novel I have ever read by Greg Iles and after having read this one, I'll be checking out his other work. Being so heavily involved in the internet, I found this book to be really frightening. It was a total roller coaster ride right from the beginning. I think the ending of the novel was a bit anticlamactic, but not to the extent that it depreciated the novel as a whole. I give it an A+!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"as an ambitious author I read as a method of study as well as entertainment. Mortal fear was an excellent novel. A great story of love, hate, betrayal, loyality, and passion. It was tightly plotted with a plausible ending. Wish I had wrote it"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This story is definitely worth reading, if you are willing to take the chance of disappointment near the end. I have to admit, I loved this book all the way through until the so-called dramatic climax at the finish. There are a number of questions unanswered at the end, which makes the reader feel somewhat ripped off as opposed to the promise of satisfaction. The technology described in the book, although easy for everyday internet users to comprehend, may challenge the interest of those readers who are not &quot;computer literate&quot;. Although, Iles did a fairly decent job of explaining most of his computer terms. Overall, this book deserved at least 4 stars due to the multiple climax moments in the book, and it's ability to capture attention, but due to the lack of a decent ending (which happens to be the most important part of a book), it got my 3 stars. Iles, however, is a magnificent writer."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I have been reading Greg Iles in reverse lately. His latest, The Turning Angel was recommended by a friend and turned out to be one of the best novels I have read in some time. The Quiet Game is a sort of prequel which I then read and also enjoyed. When I find and author this good, I tend to keep reading earlier novels and having now finished Mortal Fear, I think I will take a break before resuming the Greg Iles reads. This last one wore me out (in a good way).Harper Cole has an \\"interesting\\" life. A very successful commodities trader, married to a beautiful and brilliant doctor who was his high school sweetheart and the father of a little girl everyone thinks is his neice. \\"Mommy\\" is his wife's sister a drop dead big city model who has come home to Mississippi and gotten married to settle down. The parentage of the little girl, Holly, has been kept a secret.Cole has a \\"hobby.\\" He is a systems operator for an erotic on line service which is quite expensive and sophisticated and caters only to those who can afford it. It offers total anonymity to those who purchase it's services. It is also being used by a brilliant and devious killer who's victims are being stalked for a diabolical pupose.How these beginning story lines grow and intersect into a very compelling read is what makes this book worth reading. I used to think that I would not want Jeffery Deaver's nightmares after some of the horrific stories he has written. I now add Iles to that list.I will agree with those that feel the story meanders a bit for maybe half of the book, but the buildup to the conclusion is do- not-put-down-unless-you-have-to eat, sleep or go to bed type writing.Just listen to Harper Cole. He has quite a story to tell."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Excellent thriller. Keeps your interest and pulls you further into the book. I love Iles' books."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I'm not particularly crazy about the first person narration but I must say that Iles was able to grab my attention through Harper Cole's percepivenss. This suspense thriller was quite well written and Iles is definitely a gifted writer. Despite this I must say that I had two major dificulties with the novel's plot. Firstly I found that as the novel progressed the killers background, motives and actions just became a little too unreal. Incest, sleeping with the lifeless bodies of his victims, being married to a psychopath; it just seemed like too much craziness wrapped into this one individual.My second problem was with the sub plot featuring Erin, Harper and Drew. I didn't appreciate the way Harper lusted after Erin, his wife's sister,the fact that every man in the book thought Erin was a &quot;goddess&quot; as well as the manner in which the sibling rivalry between Erin and Drew was handled. I guess Iles was trying to explore too many psychological issues in one book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I've been listening to the unabridged audiocassette (15 tapes). The plot, characters and suspense have me working out from my usual 45 minutes a day to an hour and a half from cassettes 10 to 15. For those of you who hate to work out and need to listen to something while you exercise, get this book on tape. My calves have never looked better."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Rarely do you come across a book as good as this one. You just can't help but like Harper Cole. I didn't even bother trying to read anything for a couple of days after reading this one because I knew anything would pale in comparison. I went out and bought Mr. Iles other two books even though the subject matter isn't what I usually read. I hope your next one is a psychological thriller too. CANNOT WAIT!!!!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I listened to this as a book on tape. It was amazing how the plot was laid out quickly yet it kept moving. You really wanted to know what was about to happen in the subplots and Mr. Iles wove in and out of the subplots so quickly and smoothly that you never minded leaving a point as new information was revealed. Hard to explain but the best advice is that you will not want to put this down. I know I ended up having to walk around the house with my walkman (when I could not get a reason to drive around) just to keep listening."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"When all has been said about this book on the cover sleeves, all you have left to do is praise its author. Congratulations to Mr. Iles and thank you for such an absorbing novel."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I was told about Greg Iles from some business associates and I picked up his most recent, Mortal Fear. I love suspense, thrillers, science fiction, war and other types of fiction.

Once again, I can't put it down. You must read this!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was my first time reading a book from Greg Iles. Mortal Fear is a great thriller full of action, I couldn't stop reading it. It didn't take me very long to finish it neither. What a genius to come with a story like this one. Greg Iles definitely caught my attention and curiosity on this one, I will be reading his books in the future for sure."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"At the supermarket, I decided I needed a book for an upcoming trip. It was certainly luck that brought me to choose Mortal Fear. I finished the book in mere hours; I couldn't put it down. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys twists and turns and has a somewhat love/hate relationship with the internet. Fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"that for some reason i think i may have enjoyed even more had i read it (i heard the taped version) . . . very contemporary, in that it is all about the internet and how a killer stalks his victims via an exlclusive sexually-oreinted online service."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was the first Greg Iles novel I've read and I must say that his books will join others in my highest category of excellent reading. This was a &quot;should-be-read-now&quot; book. Greg did an excellent job holding my attention. I became fully engrossed with the characters...I became a part of the story. Loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I'm an avid reader and have high standards (won't even consider a Grisham novel!) but WOW did this book blow me away!! Computers, psychos, medical horrors, sex and human characters with truthfully rendered frailties, all smartly woven together to make a great read. Those that say they couldn't put it down are telling the truth, don't start until you have a chunk of uninterrupted time, you're gonna need it. Better than Dean Koontz' Dark Rivers of the Heart!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book was so full of twists that I could hardly put it down.

The book takes the &quot;online meeting&quot; and takes it to a different level."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is the first novel by Greg Iles I've read; I will now definitely read others. The pace is quick (usually) and most characters contribute something meaningful to the plot. The ending was refreshing and satisfying; it didn't seem &quot;tacked on&quot; to complete the book like so many other novels I've read lately. I highly recommend this book, especially to people who enjoy serial killer mysteries."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"A great combination of Presumed Innocent, Silence of the Lambs, All the King's Men, and Tropic of Cancer! I grew up in the Miss. Delta and enjoyed the Rain, Ms. subplots as much or more than the serial killer parts. I agree this novel should be fast-tracked for the big screen with Matt Damon as Harper."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book is an all-nighter you simply cannot put down. Keeping with the tradition of James Patterson and Jonathon Kellerman, it is a prime example of suspense at its greatest. I will be anxiously waiting for his next release - this one will be difficult to beat!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"GREG ILES is proving to be top-notch, delivering an outstanding thriller--- MORTAL FEAR. As a fan of his 2 earlier books, I found this book to be great and hard to put down. He really is blazing a trail and providing alot of suspense for readers to enjoy. I can't wait for his next novel. Fans and new readers will enjoy this great book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Fun read, entertaining and well crafted story. It is amazing to watch the story tighten and develop in front of your eyes with such precision. However there are some negatives: 1) Overdone and to chatty,2) lousy ending, to confusing and implausible. Still overall it is a strong effort."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Words fail me when describing this book. The plot is extremely entertaining and the twists are often surprising. The climax is unbelievable in it's intensity. Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. I will definitely be reading Black Cross and Spandau Phoenix."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Terrifyingly riveting. I pulled an all-nighter with this great read. The suspense was palpable and the plot was intriguing. This is the first of Iles' books I have read and I will definitely read more! His antagonsit was the serial killer from hell and brilliant to boot! I was stumped all the way to the end! Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"On a recent car trip from New York City to New Orleans I listened to this book on tape. I was so engrossed that I missed my turn at Charlotte, North Carolina and didn't return to my own reality until I hit Augusta, Georgia. I found the book spell binding and extremely erotic in an esoteric way reminiscent of early Anne Rice before she became so intoxicated with her own success that she stopped writing entertaining books. She is even a barely disguised character in this book. My only complaint to Mr. Iles is that his character Mayeaux, the Cajun detective in New Orleans, didn't strike me as much of a Cajun more like just another Southern Redneck. But perhaps I was prejudiced by the actor's accent. (Remember I listened to the book on tape.) When he spoke Mayeux's lines he was NOT speaking in a Cajun accent. The Cajuns, the New Orleanians, and the Mississippi Delta cops all sounded the same but that was the fault of the actor reading the book not Mr. Iles. All in all a very good listen"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat, just like watching a great suspense movie. This is the first time I have read Greg Iles and I can not wait to get another of his works. Harper Cole really draws you into his life and makes you want to know what is going to happen to him next.He is a really likeable character even though he is not perfect. He is human, afterall"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles takes you into the steamy world of online sex and brings to life a brilliant serial killer who embodies your worst fears. His use of both cutting edge technology and medical research combined with realism and personalities made this a book I didn't want to put down"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Completely unlike his former two outings, Greg Iles has hita home run with Mortal Fear. A techno-thriller par excellence, this is one you will not be able to put down. From the cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta Greg Iles weaves a riveting tale about the rancid underbelly of a sexual oriented bulletin board system and those who would use it to further their own strange agendas. A must read!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I read a lot of books in a year. Many are best sellers, written by the authors of multiple best sellers. Most of them are trash. Either the story doesn't make sense, or the dialogue is stilted, or they violate their own logic, or, all to frequently, after investing hours in reading them, the ending is disappointing or just plain stupid. It sometimes makes me wonder why I haven't written a best seller. I can write a bad novel as well as anyone. Then I came across &quot;Mortal Fear&quot; by Greg Iles, and I felt that I had finally read something worth my time.There are a lot of books about serial killers, but few as chilling as this one. The relationship between the murders would have gone unnoticed if part-time systems operator, Harper Cole, hadn't noticed a relationship between the latest victim, and the unnoticed disappearance of several other women from the high priced, adult website and chat room that he helps administer. He contacts the police, and the hunt is on.In the end Hunter must take the lead in tracking the killer down, but at a very high price. Hunter has secrets of his own that he'd rather his wife didn't know about. In the end, he must face his past, the probability of losing the wife he loves, and a deadly killer to save his life and his future. Hunter triumphs in the end but pays a terrible price.Hunter is as real a character as I've encountered of late. Iles doesn't make him into a superman who is able to battle trained killers as easily as he can make breakfast, nor is he an unflawed saint. He is more like all of us, maybe a little brighter, but a &quot;flesh and blood&quot; character who has to choose between burying his head in the sand or doing the right thing no matter what. Fortunately for the readers, he faces his demons and conquers them in a terrific ending that holds the reader's interest right down to the final pages."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles is a good writer of the modern-day thriller genre, which is not really saying too much. His characters are usually thinly drawn and speak in unrealistic stilted dialogue. The heroes of his three books that I have read are pretty much interchangeable, all with predictable traits, including self-doubt and the obligatory \\"past.\\" \\"Mortal Fear\\" is just plain silly. The idea that people would pay large sums to be in a sex chat room is so ridiculous that my ability to suspend disbelief, which is, of course, necessary in all Greg Iles thrillers, immediately stopped.The heroes of Greg Iles books seem to believe that since they are smarter than the FBI, CIA, and other law enforcement officials, they must withhold vital information, but, of course, they always make the right decisions because they're the ones who capture the bad guy in the end. Any story about grappling with an internet killer is going to appear out-dated because of how fast this technology advances, and \\"Mortal Fear\\" is no exception.Note to other reviewers: Do the multiple reviewers of this book really feel that this book merits five stars? Does this mean that all Ile's books are likewise rated, as well as all similar thrillers by comparable authors? If so, what rating should one give to a truly superior book? Just asking."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I am a Greg Iles fan but was sorely disappointed with this one. I could neither like nor identify with the central character and had almost no interest in the plot, which did not keep me on edge like Iles books normally do. Iles did a terrible job of keeping the sub-plots together with the plot on this one - I looked at the date published and thought: this must have been an earlier work, therefore he is forgiven but I consider this one a waste of money!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear grabs you from the getgo and never lets up. I enjoyed this even more than I did Black Cross and the Quiet Game - which are themselves excellent reads.Isles has an amazing capacity to transfer tension and emotion to the reader. I've now read three of his books and the subject matter could not more different in each one; he must do an enormous amount of research before he sits down to write. I had read where someone compared him to Grisham, apparently since both are from Mississippi. That's where the comparison stops. Grisham cannot hold a candle to Greg Isles."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was my introduction to Greg Iles, and I found his story interesting. His style however was very long, wordy and cumbersome. The actual plot and storyline were very good, with great suspense and unexpected turns, but to get there one must endure endless rambling of backstory and insignificant babbling about meaningless, pointless nothingness. This book could have been compressed to about 60% in duration, leaving only that to do with the true story and it would have been 100% better. Mr. Iles is very descriptive in detail, but carrying on and on about the color of the sky and the splashes of raindrops during a edge of the seat moment in the story is not only distracting, but also very frustrating. Also, at times the main characters were very hard to like, and at some points I found myself rooting for the bad guy.In summation let me say, the story was good but in the future Mr. Iles should contract a professional editor to cut out the myriad duldrums of endless rambling. By the time I finally made it to the end of Tape 15, I was exuberent to hear what I thought was the best line in the book: &quot;The End&quot;"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I can't believe the number of four star reviews. Iles is probagbly the most in love with his own words of any author I have ever read. Boring, long winded, over done and loaded with technical errors. I read the first 30% and then the last ten and barely made it through. Maybe if I were into kinky sex"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I found Greg Iles quite by accident several years ago when I was in the slump of what I like to call, 'Not-having-anything-to-read-at-the moment' syndrome. I came across 'Spandau Phoenix' by Mr. Iles, and normally I rarely read the so-called 'blurbs' written on the cover that make the book out to be the best thing since sliced bread, but for some reason, I took them seriously this time. I found myself reading quite possibly the best action/adventure novel about events that happened in WWII that I had ever come across. His follow-up novel, 'Black Cross' was an even more facinating and powerful account of an historical event during the Second World War that didn't happen, but COULD have... well a few years pass and I begin to wonder where Mr. Iles went to, and suddenly I discover 'Mortal Fear'. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting it to be another adventure based on a real event from WWII, and of course it wasn't, so on that level alone I was a tiny bit upset--but I should know that authors shouldn't be held to writing one particular genre for all of eternity (although if Mr. Iles could continue producing novels like his first two, I would have been perfectly happy if he did...).I am a BIG fan of Murder/Mysteries, and this novel took off like it was going to be one of those rare stories that compelled you to read for hours on end without regard to waking up early the next morning...but somewhere along the way it just lost its steam--for ME anyway. Don't get me wrong, it is still a good example of the Murder/Mystery genre, however I had a hard time with the incredibly HUGE departure from his previous works into a sordid tale of sex and murder. It seemed to me such a large gap that it was written by someone else. Now I am not claiming that 'Mortal Fear' was written by another person, not at all--however you would be hard pressed to find any similarities between his first two books and this one. I found myself absorbed by the characters in his first two novels because he made them 'real' and people I could identify with (to a degree, of course) and with 'Mortal Fear' this was a story about a man who operates an erotic internet site and I'm sorry, but I just didn't care about what happened to him mostly because I just couldn't identify on ANY level with him. Based on this alone, this novel disappointed me very much. If you have not read either of Greg Iles first two novels, and you enjoy a good Murder/Mystery, by all means, pick this one up and enjoy--but if you have read them, be prepared for an amazing change of pace and subject matter with 'Mortal Fear'. All in all, a pretty good story, but it just didn't 'do it' for me."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear has an interesting plot, involving a high tech dating service which is used by a serial killer to find his victims. The main characteris very weak and it is hard to feel sorry for him as he entangles both himself and his family into direct contact with the killer. He useshis knowledge of Eros, the dating service, to alert the police and, consequently the FBI, as to a possible connection between the murder of a famous female Eros member and other female chat members who suddenly dropoff line. After performing this good deed and offering some useful inputto the FBI to identify the killer, the book gets pretty farfetched ashe starts using his sister in law and then himself as bait to catch the maniac. This process is very drawn out and he comes off as a low moralindividual who grossly underestimates the intelligence of the killer.Often, it seems like Greg Iles is trying to write a book that willconvert nicely into a movie, with erotic sex scenes and spectacularconflagrations or accidents that will light up the screen, bringing the book to an unrealistic, but memorable ending."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I'm a fan of Greg Iles, who I believe is one of the best thriller writers around. MORTAL FEAR is one of his first novels, and I think it's definitely one his superior efforts. I typically read hundreds of thrillers a year, and this is one of the most exciting novels I've read in quite some time.MORTAL FEAR has a fairly standard serial killer plot, but Iles elevates this book through his rich prose and great characterization. All of the characters, including the supporting ones, are fully fleshed out and have remarkable depth. This book is overlong (over 600 pages!), but Iles is a great plotter, and I finished the novel in just a few sittings. It gets better and more involving as it goes along, which I find a rare achievement among thriller books.The flaws in this book are typical for Iles. The book drenched with a lot of sex and verges on the melodramatic in some scenes. The protagonist of this novel is highly flawed, and makes some serious eye-rolling mistakes. But this is the way Iles writes nearly all of his books, and these flaws didn't really detract from the storyline that much.Overall, MORTAL FEAR is a great thriller. In addition to this novel, I recommend Iles' THE QUIET GAME, 24 HOURS, and DEAD SLEEP."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"About 3 years ago and I could not put it down he had me riveted.I also saw that he used to be in a real band called 'Frankly Scarlet' and I found an old CD here on Amazon by them but he wasn't mentioned in the credits on it when it arrived so I don't know if it was/is the same band.laughingpig1@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"What a villain this book contains. It starts a bit slow, but builds to crescendo. You won't want to put it down until you've finished. Be aware, there's lots of weird sex info in this book, but it's part of the story that makes it all the more obsessive. This is the third book by Greg Iles that I've read and I've really enjoyed every one of them. Like Stephen King, he has a bit of a twisted mind in story telling, which I just love. The villain in this book seems so demonic as to be other-worldly. Pick it up, you'll enjoy the trip!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book had me on tenterhooks for the two days it took me to finish it. I couldn't fall asleep until I had finished it. Greg Iles is a very talented writer with a gift for keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, in the long-run, I felt a bit disappointed in the book. Plus, the hero carries on and on about his illicit love for his sister-in-law. His doctor wife is an amazingly strong heroine with incredible character. The subject matter hits very close to home for people who spend a lot of time on the internet, and can make you feel very vulnerable and frightened. This is a highly readable book, but it is a bit like having a wonderful meal, but being left with a stomach ache."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I'm a huge fan of Greg Iles. I absolutely loved SP and BC, and was disappointed with Mortal Fear. First off, the first-person perspective got extremely annoying as I progressed through the book. First person perspective truly limits the development of other characters, since you are in the head of only one. In a novel of that length, I was sick of his character's whining and pining over his sister-in-law.....please! His &quot;bad guy&quot; was well done as usual, but the story was just another killer-thriller that clogs the fiction shelves of bookstores. I was hoping he could have gone the route of N.

The best Iles I've read so far and one of the best I've read ever."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is an average quality very long thriller, too long for my taste indeed, but written out of an original idea, it encompasses internet technology, deep psychological suspense and a great job of a character of Mr Harper Cole, the internet stock trader who is also the system operator of an internet sex network called Eros.Harper has detected that a man has illegally penetrated Eros, engaged in chat with some women and then killed them. Harper is a good citizen, reports this immediately to the police which involves also the FBI in a nationwide search to identify and put this loony behind barsAt the same time, Harper hides a family secret he cannot reveal to his wife for the sake of his marriage, that bit is very juicy, adds a lot of drama to the tortured mind of Harper and becomes more interesting than the main line of the story. Will he tell this dark secret to his wife, how will she react ?When it comes to the ending there is not a stunning definition in line with such a long story, everything is left to an endless array of useless details replacing the unexpected twists and turns a novel like this one should have. DisappointingAfter reading more than 600 pages, and closing this book I was left with a very bitter taste, too many details does not make a rich plot and in fact there is no convincing endingChoosing Iles work?, better try The Quiet Game"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I found this book less rewarding than his first two efforts if only because the subject material made me feel less comfortable. Perhaps that is the highest recommendation I can give the book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"After reading Black Cross, I simply had to read more from Greg Iles, and was NOT disappointed in this book. The subject isn't similiar to Black Cross, but no matter what the subject, this author can tell a tale. It's obvious, having read some of his work, that he does his homework. The book was technical enough to make you feel like the characters weren't making it up as they went, but not so much that the layman couldn't read and understand. Honestly, and I save this praise for those few reads deserving of it, but this one I absolutely could NOT put down.

That's what Harper Cole, futures trader by day and denizen/operator of an expensive sex-chat service by night, faces. He may even BE the serial killer. He certainly is the chief suspect when beautiful girls in the chat room start turning up dead.In Mortal Fear Greg Iles has created achillingly realistic scenario. He has us actually believing that a chat room member, thinking she is chatting with a faceless friend perhaps a half- continent away, suddenly realizes her &quot;friend&quot; is right outside her window with his laptop and a very large knife. As one real, live chat room participant in an actual chat room with the real live Author Iles commented, &quot;From now on, I don't sit down at my computer without a rear-view mirror.&quot; Now, that's creating realism.One of the sub-plots of Mortal Fear deals with arresting the age process.The young begin to age,the old get young and never get old. Anyone under 40 may look benignly at this. Those over 50 will sigh longingly and wish that, for once, life really would imitate art. The over 60's of us may simply drool over that idea , suspend disbelief, sit back, and sweat out Greg Iles' latest suspense/thriller.\`Puter nuts will revel: voice recognition chips, talking computers, pitch versatility, lexical stress , even voice recognition capability. Kinda scary, right? Our most private e-mail--our most private chat rooms--accessible to total strangers? (Read:FBI or IRS or AOL.)But Mortal Fear is not entirely suspense and serious. Iles brings us a hilarious scene in a cemetery , wherein ....but no, not in this review.

The plot, sys-op Harper Cole tracking down incredibly G-d like serial killer with the help of his friend, computer genius Miles Turner, is a wonderfully exciting, suspenseful thriller.

A serial killer infiltrates Eros. Known by many usernames, he toys with women while trying to achieve a higher purpose. The main character, Harper, is a hero, a villain and a victim, being placed into every possible category during this constant race against time trying to save victim after victim. Harper's personal life, his job and his dalliances on Eros (the sex site he worked for) all come into play during the investigation.This book is very long, but surprisingly faced paced. I was completely sucked in. The computer aspect of the book is interesting. Although clearly advanced for the time period, I felt a spark of nostalgia reading about how computers and the internet operated over a decade ago.This is real crazy, mind-blowing stuff. There were lots of disturbing parts, mostly more psychological than gory, although gore certainly had its place too. Mortal Fear is definitely not for those squeamish about sexual crimes and taboos. Sex and high tech are melded to create an exhilarating and terrifying thriller."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I enjoy good thrillers with some creepiness in them, yet find them very difficult to find.

I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear is a very well crafted thriller novel.

My bet is that with the chills running up your spine you will still be cold!A serial killer, who thinks he is the reincarnation of Promethius, stalks his victims on EROS, a site dedicated to uncensored, explicit sexual fantasies. Once he finds a suitable victim he is relentless in seeking them out and completing his act of murder right in their own home. However, in each case, he takes a trophy - one which it will be hard for you to believe. You will get out of your chair more than once to check your windows and doors.It is written again in the first-person style that works so well for Iles and for the reader. With Harper Cole, his wife Drewe and her sister Erin at the core of the novel, their personal stories intertwine as Harper and his buddy,Miles, who is the creator of E.R.O.S. try to catch the killer and instead become suspects in the murders. They become the hunters and the hunted. Hunted by the FBI, the state police and the ever-present yet elusive Promethius.They are always just one step behind this brillinat, seemingly unstoppable killer, but the ending chapters will have you forgetting to breathe as each horror unfolds.A truly thrilling work,one which I shall read again and again.

I found the premise of this book good, although I felt that it was a bit too long and the characters were a little unbelieveable. The part that disappointed me the most was the fact that the villain was never introduced to us in the book as a real person until they found out who it was. A book is better when the character is someone close to the crime and you never suspect them I hope the author reads this and finds some constructive criticism in my words.

It is full of nonsensical details and really lacking of a crisp story line.

But to tell you the truth, the best part for me when when I closed the back cover and said thank god it's over.I really enjoy Greg Iles, but this one is a real stinker.I have no idea how some people can rate this book a five, they must have either a very sortid taste, or just want to see themselves in writen form."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I find it hard to swallow that anyone would pay $1000 int. fee and a $500 monthly fee for a porn website.

Overall the book is above average, but his other works were better.

I place it among my top 3 favorites (along with Plum Island and The Devil's Teardrop). There is a lot of suspence in this one, and some good action scenes as well. I love the concept for this book, a serial killer that chooses his victims from the Internet. It's a great change of pace from typical serial killer books.Iles created a great character in Harper Cole. He has his flaws, which makes him all the more realistic. All the supporting characters were very well written as well.This was my first Greg Iles book, but it won't be my last. I have already gotten The Quiet Game and 24 Hours. I also can't wait to get Jeffery Deaver's The Blue Nowhere in paperback to see how he handles a similar concept.This one is a must read!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is the second book by Iles I have read, the first being Black Cross. While this effort does not come close to being in the same league as that book, it is quite a good, stimulating read. It is written in the first person, which can take some time to get used to.Iles tries to add flourishing touches of human emotions into the book's sub-story, but the characters are mostly shells. Thomas H Cook is quite good at this, and I wonder if Black Cross was written after Mortal Fear, because Iles' characters in that book were much better.This is a long book, but reads quickly. It is not really a true serial murder mystery because the killer does not fit into that mold, but it does have some interesting plot twists and suspense.While it is no Red Dragon or Silence, it is fun to read."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"this book came to me highly recommended, so it was a little disappointing. after reading it, i can't quite figure out why the author threw in the whole eros component. the service itself doesn't make much sense (there's lots of free internet porn out there, and if you're living with someone who's that possesive they'll probably catch on to you either way). it seems like the only people who would really be interested in it are famous people. and i don't understan why the killer went through such pains to stalk people on eros. surely there's an easier way for a doctor to get organs. for the first few practice surgeries why not just use homeless people? it doesn't matter if they have aids if it's only practice. and he didn't use the service to find the real donors anyway. i also didn't have much sympathy for the main characters. all in all, it wasn't bad, but i didn't think it was very plausible either."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I could not deal with the fuzzy type interspersed throughout this book.

It is a fictional story of a serial killer. It is not for the faint at heart. The killer has invaded an adult Internet forum to search for his victims. He is obsessed and wants to be a God. It becomes a deadly game of wits between the killer, the company's sysops, and the police. Victims are mutilated and it becomes clear that the killer is harvesting a body part.The sysops' personal lives are dragged into the investigation, and their own dark secrets come to the surface as they attempt to trap the killer. In some respects they are not overly bright (looking through a glass window when you expect something inside to explode? Isn't that a little numb-brained?)The novel is a little long because of long conversations between characters. The white hats win, more or less, but there is a lot of collateral damage. It has strong sexual content and violence. I would give it an R rating."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I absolutely love this author! In addition to being so engrossed in this book to the point of distraction in my real life, I was also stimulated in Iles' vast, intelligent writing style.

I reccommend this highly to avid thriller readers."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Harper Cole, a thirty-something commodities trader, lives in a small town in the Mississippi Delta with his wife, Dr. Drewe Cole, an obstetrician. Sweethearts since high school, the couple delayed getting married until Drewe finished her internship and Harper was ready to settle down. At age 33, Drewe wants children, but Harper, who harbors a dark secret, wants to put off the inevitable for as long as possible.Even though the Coles are wealthy, Harper moonlights. A digital wizard, he is a systems operator for an exclusive erotic online service, EROS, (Erotic Realtime On-line Stimulation), which caters to the rich and powerful, who are willing to pay exorbitant monthly fees to maintain their anonymity and privacy. As a sysop Harper can cruise the hundreds of discussion threads within EROS, while his presence goes undetected by the participants, even in private chat rooms. He can also participate in discussions under assumed identities. Drewe, who never minded her husband's job with EROS before, has become uncomfortable with it in recent months. Harper has avoided her sexually, because she wants to get pregnant, and she feels he relieves his frustration online, rather than facing up to their real problems.Karen Wheat, is a famous author and an EROS client with whom Harper is familiar. When she is discovered murdered and horribly mutilated in her home in New Orleans, Harper contacts the authorities. He thinks Karen's death may be connected with a number of other EROS clients who have gone missing - six women in five different states. He contacts the detective in charge of the Wheat case to give the police a heads-up, and to have someone investigate the whereabouts of the women who suddenly dropped out of their prepaid EROS service. Harper gets himself and his loved ones in a world of trouble, and peril, for his noble efforts.The mastermind behind the killing(s) is a dark genius, who does not fit any previously developed profiles for serial killers. He also alters his modus operandi for each murder, which makes him that much more difficult to catch. And he has infiltrated EROS, surfing the privileged Internet service for victims.\\"Mortal Fear\\" is an intriguing suspense thriller. However, it ultimately disappointed me because the narrative meanders so. I like tight writing and taut suspense. Author Greg Iles, a favorite of mine ever since I read \\"Black Cross\\" and \\"Spandau Phoenix,\\" has the necessary elements and talent to create a real winner here, but does not succeed - although this novel does provides much entertainment, if you don't mind the frequently slow pace. The book begins with a bang, that is to say, there are lots of thrills and chills from the start - which is good. However, the pace slows significantly about halfway through. Mr. Iles seems to have forgotten the concept that less is more. He builds suspense to a fever pitch, the tension peaks, begins to fall-off, and we're back to where we started - the psychopathic killer is not captured, the mystery is not solved. The local FBI, their experts at Quantico, and homicide detectives from 5-6 major cities have been made to look totally incompetent, (I have truly never read of such a diverse group of experienced professionals who continually make so many stupid blunders). Meanwhile, the reader has gone through almost 600 pages of the same cyclical storyline - and no one has learned enough to come close to stopping the madman - and his identity is known!!The repetitiveness really does distract from the horror and suspense. Loose threads dangle at the conclusion. Characters, like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" are introduced, built up, and then disappear - the author loses them - they are not murdered. And Harper Cole acts totally out of character at times. There are frequent tangential philosophical and religious conversations, which at first are interesting, then just provide obvious filler. I would give the novel a 3.5 rating, although that's not possible, simply because there are fascinating sections, especially those which deal with the world of online chatrooms/forums. There is suspense also, but as I wrote, it gets watered down at times. If you're an Iles' fan, and/or the plot sounds interesting, give it a try.JANA"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"What a page turner! Soon, I will read everything that Mr. Iles has written. He is excellent."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. While I do agree with some others that it's a little bit wordy, it didn't deter me from it one bit. I read it very quickly, not wanting to put it down for a minute. I happened across this one while wandering through the bookstore. I'm now hooked as a Greg Iles fan."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"MORTAL FEAR is the second Greg Iles book I have read, after DEAD SLEEP, both in unabridged tape editions. Both books are set in the South, one in Mississippi, and one in New Orleans, both feature sisters who have a sexual rivalry with one man. And FBI profiler Dr. Arthur Lenz makes a re-appearance in MORTAL FEAR. Other than that, no links, but I'm glad I read them sequentially.Harper Cole is a 33-year former rock musician, now a well-to-do futures trader with a hoard of gold in the bomb shelter of his childhood home where he lives with his OB-GYN wife, Drew. He is also a SYS OP for an Internet service called EROS. After a brutal murder of a famous New Orleans writer, he correlates an EROS customer activity pattern and informs the FBI that there may be more killings. The FBI discover more dead women who are EROS customers and promptly begin to suspect Harper and his childhood friend EROS architect Miles Turner of involvement in the killings. The portrait of the killer that gradually appears is chilling, ingenious, repulsive and seductive. The killer is incredibly smart and seemingly impossible to catch because he doesn't have a consistent signature. He manages to outsmart and stay many steps ahead of the FBI.I'm not really a fan of terror-driven suspense but what makes this books special is Iles' deeply drawn main and side characters. Harper Cole is more anti-hero than hero in that Iles doesn't try to make him likable or someone to emulate. A reader must accept Harper's dark and light sides. While remotely operating EROS, he has Internet affairs of a somewhat sleazy nature and avoids sex with his wife Drew. He claims to understand women, that women talk to him as they would another women, but it's telling that there is not one woman in his life who is happy. At the core of the plot is a huge secret he keeps from Drew about a former sexual relationship and current attraction. At times I felt major contempt for Harper for not being a stand-up guy emotionally, which is hard to do and continue to read when the narrative is first person. But eventually over the course of the book I just accepted his very human, fallible voice.This is an excellent book, rather long in tape version, but unabridged is still the way to go. At times I felt the pacing was slow, but it's appropriate because I needed time to accustom myself and accept Cole's voice. Stay with it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"MORTAL FEAR was one of the most concisely written, harrowing, non-stop narratives I have ever come across.Its philosophical beginning turns suddenly into a heart-stopping race against time to find a psychopathic killer of great intelligence, one who selects victims through an online service. As Greg Iles spins the tale through Harper Cole's point of view, we get to experience Cole's life, his memories of his wife's haunting sister Erin, his determination to capture the real killer and clear his name--and his fear. For, to lure the killer into showing himself, he must play the killer's game; he must transform himself into a woman online and use his wits and his inner knowledge to enamor the killer...a plan that poses the greatest of dangers: placing everything he has ever loved into the killer's embrace. For the woman he chooses will be one he has crossed paths with before, a woman with whom he once held a passion for, a woman so hauntingly tragic and beautiful that no man has ever denied the right to her body--his wife's sister.MORTAL FEAR is more than just a heart-stopping account of a man trying to save those he cared, more than just Best Book of the Year to me--it was heartrending too, a no-holds-barred narrative of one man's life, his loves, his stakes in a dangerous game of &quot;being bait&quot;....and most of all, his fear, motivating him to match wits with a killer, to protect those he loved. Greg Iles created the ultimate humanifestation ever in Harper Cole.MORTAL FEAR is without doubt THE best in great reading."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Jeepers, this was a hard book to stick with. It is not that there was not plenty of action. Iles never disappoints in that area. It just did not make a lot of sense and the characters were not believable. I have read all of Iles early works, then sort of got away from him. This book did not encourage me to find any others."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"&quot;Mortal Fear&quot; is so beautifully written that I would have enjoyed it without the superbly crafted mystery, but Iles has given us both. Harper Cole, a successful trader and computer aficionado, is the protagonist and narrator of this tale. He is a flawed but nice guy who is trying to hide the mistakes of his past and by so doing is allowing himself and his family to be drawn into the dangerous games of a psychopathic genius. The more he tries to protect himself the deeper the hole he digs. We are allowed to understand Coles motivations and feelings so completely that I did not object, as I usually do, to the poor decisions he made that drove the plot and created the relentless suspense in this novel. I found myself staying up into the wee hours of the night to find out what would become of the characters that I had come to know and like. However, what separates this book from other suspense novels is how beautifully it is written. The conversations between Cole and his physician wife, Drewe, between Cole and his strange friend, Miles, and all his on line conversations are such beautiful prose that they alone are worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear was the first Greg Iles book I read and I was hooked on his writing ever since. Though I have read several other books by Greg Iles and found them all very well written and entertaining, Mortal Fear remains at the top of my list for his all time best work. Don't be surprised if this one gets made into a movie in the near future. Being into computers and internet as I am, the subject matter (which revolves around a sort of killer who finds women using chat rooms, etc) fascinated me. I was hooked from the first few pages and I RARELY read a book without several large breaks in between. This book I read non stop and it was well worth the other things in my life I sacrificed to read it :)"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Harper Cole is a system operator of a erotic on-line network. People log on to air their most secret fantasies and desires. He begins to worry when he notices that some accounts that were heavily used suddenly go dead and asks the police to check on the users. They turn up dead.With the police, psych doctors and friends in tow, Harper is out to catch the killer, using his own family as lures.I didn't really get into this story as other reviewers did, the characters didn't jump out and become real to me. The storyline was interesting though, for those who enjoy a thriller with something a little different."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"this book came to me highly recommended, so it was a little disappointing. after reading it, i can't quite figure out why the author threw in the whole eros component. the service itself doesn't make much sense (there's lots of free internet porn out there, and if you're living with someone who's that possesive they'll probably catch on to you either way). it seems like the only people who would really be interested in it are famous people. and i don't understan why the killer went through such pains to stalk people on eros. surely there's an easier way for a doctor to get organs. for the first few practice surgeries why not just use homeless people? it doesn't matter if they have aids if it's only practice. and he didn't use the service to find the real donors anyway. i also didn't have much sympathy for the main characters. all in all, it wasn't bad, but i didn't think it was very plausible either."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book is a must read for all suspense/thriller readers. Far superior to Patricia Cornwell and Robin Cook. This 622 page book had me reading until the wee hours of the morning many, many nights (and I'm usually a 11 p.m. sleeper). I would really recommend"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is my first Greg Iles' book, as I have not been a favorite of espionage or spy thrillers. However, this book is one heck of a read! Over 600 pages long, it still maintains interest throughout and is definitely one of the best serial killer books I've read.With that said, I won't go into the details of the book, as it has been expertly done by other reviewers. What makes this such a stunning novel is the rich characterizations Iles has given to his characters;not just the leads, but even some of the supporting characters, as well.Of course, the book would have no foundation if not for the main character, Harper Cole. This is not your typical hero, in fact, he's quite an antihero at times. Selfish, childish, sexually confused at times, and a keeper of dark secrets. However, Harper is so well fleshed out, I felt like I was right with him during the entire narrative. His relationship with Drewe, his wife, goes from intermittently shallow, to an incredible depth of emotion. He is intelligent and savvy in his dealings with the on-line killer, but still sweats out any confrontations with him, either on line or off. His response to what happens with his sister-in-law, Erin, is heart-wrenching, and I found a little moisture in my eyes during much of this and his confrontation with Drewe about his secret.Drewe, likewise, is no usual heroine. Not only is she brilliant, but she is deep in her love for Harper, and proves to be a formidable adversary to the killer in the flinchingly suspenseful climax.Miles Turner, Harper's friend, also turns out to be quite the antithesis of a true hero. His involvement in the killings is quite surprising, and establishes the many levels this gentleman goes through in the book.The policemen and FBI characters are quite good, too. Although many books try to portray cops and FBI agents as pretty ineffectual, Iles gives them the depth of human nature we all possess. One of them, Billy, is the freshest depiction of a \\"Down home\\" cop on paper. Billy is not quite the typical redneck you expect, although he's not the brightest guy, either. But he possesses a strong sense of justice and takes his job seriously.Bob Anderson, Drewe and Erin's father, at first appears to be one of those stuffy influentials that everyone in political circles is afraid of. Nonetheless, by the end of the book, we again see a well-developed, complex man, driven by the love for his daughters.Of course, what would this kind of book be without a superior villain? And we have one of unbelievable cunning; heartless, brilliant, and in a rare accomplishment, Iles actually makes you feel just a pinch--pinch, mind you--of sympathy. The on-line conversations he has with Dr. Lenz, Drewe and Harper are brilliantly written.The only character we never really fully understand is Erin's husband, Patrick, but I think Iles wanted us to feel isolation from him, as his role is one of mystery as well.All in all, this book ranks up there with the best, and Iles has won me over!HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I read only one other Greg Isles mystery, 24 Hours, and it was fabulous--I was listening to it and nearly missed my exit. But this one? What a waste of pen and ink (and the narrator's breath, as I had selected the audio version). The characters weren't interesting, the story line was ridiculous, and....well, it just a not good book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"That's probably the best recommendation I can give any book. The first time I was absolutely blown away by Mortal Fear. I could not stop reading and I still thought about it months afterward. There's only one other thriller I've ever read that did that to me (Downtick), so I can only thank Greg Iles for writing such an incredible book.The characters are extremely well portrayed and have few &quot;design&quot; flaws. The bad guy is the most flawed, I must say, but that doesn't trip the story up much. Harper Cole's wife, Drewe, is worth reading the book all by herself. I can think of any number of other authors who would have had her split and run, but not Greg Iles.I will certainly be reading more of his books and I suggest you try them too."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was the first book that I read by author Greg Iles and all I can say is that I will be reading more!In this excellent piece of fiction, readers are kept guessing who is who, who is doing what, and why who is doing what. There is never a dull moment in this book, so it's extremely hard to put down. To provide any more details here would be to ruin it for you, so I'll just leave it at this: read it because, if you enjoy a suspense thriller, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mortal Fear is on a totally different level than Spandau Phoenix (or Black Cross) - it has nothing to do with World War II - but it is just as satisfying suspense. Set in the modern day, the book centers around a programmer for a computer service who suspects that random murder victims are being selected through his service. In the course of investigating his hunch, he gets on the trail of a highly elusive and frightening serial killer whose motivations will bring the two characters ever closer together. The suspense of who the perpetrator is, how the murders are being committed, and how law enforcement's chase is resolved is outstanding; that suspense and Iles' ability to write so effectively on so many different levels demonstrates his considerable talent."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is only my 2nd Iles book, having only read 24 HOURS before, and I am hooked on this author. Like many others, I couldn't put the book down. I'm going to purchase the rest of Greg Iles' books - I love his writing and I loved this book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book does start out a bit slow, but TRUST ME, when you get to the middle, it is IMPOSSIBLE to put down! The twists and turns are at times startling, and provide a fun, suspensful and at times shocking read. Great fun for web surfers, as well as suspense buffs. Roles of two male characters is played perfectly, and is entertaining throughout! A great book for a summer at the beach!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This book was riveting. It is, by now, a given that Iles is a phenomenal writer. His ability to effortlessly glide a reader through his complex plots, while providing plausible dialog for his protagonists, is unmatched. What is disheartening, though, is that he isn't being rewarded for producing these kinds of SUBSTANTIAL and thoughful works, in comparison to the vapid Grisham's and Koontz's of the world. Or should we hope that Iles doesn't become wildly successful, so as to have him retain his standard of work?"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This is a story which captures the reader's interest right from the start. Ile's characters are well developed and interesting. The pace of the story makes the reader want to turn the pages faster and faster. Suspense continues to build until a thrilling (but somewhat confusing) climax is reached. Do read it!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"IF you find yourself bored and need something mindless to kill time with, this is one of many fine choices. It's won't linger long, it's nothing too inventive and, like Spandau Phoenix, it falls apart rapidly at the end. On the upside it flows well and has some interesting, though contrived dialog.Since it is now the beginning of the 1998 summer season there are hundreds of better choices for pure entertainment reading."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles weaves a tale of suspense and intrigue using tools ranging from the hightech tools of the future on the internet to a backwoods Mississipp police force. Anyone who has ever &quot;met&quot; someone on line in a chat room will be looking over their shoulder as this well contstructed tale unfolds. Iles avoids the cliches and knee-jerk scare tactics, instead opting to challenge the readers mind with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that are definitely based on a touch of reality. Just like in cyberland one can't tell if anyone is who they seem to be. This was a real page turner up until the very dramatic climax which explodes in the final pages. Pass this along to all your on line buddys."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Just about a perfect book. The pace is fast and thrilling, the charecters strong and well developed. The only flaw (and it's a relatively small one given the overall greatness of this book) preventing me from giving this book a 10 and calling it a perfect book had to do with one scene near the end that I found a bit too unbelievable. If Iles had rewritten that or handled it differently then this would have been a supremely great book. Read it."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I enjoyed Spandau Phoenix and Black Cross, but Mortal Fear blew me away. My husband was glad when I finished it. I read in bed and every time I got scared (which was frequently in the last 100 pages) I would grab his arm and start reading out loud! Not many books elicit that sort of response from me these days. Kudos to Iles."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Though I can point out some internet flaws, this was a very well written thriller. As an aspiring writer, I read for content as well as entertainment. Greg Iles does a great job with his plot."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was one of the most suspenseful and unique thrillers I've ever read. The characters were very real. The computer angle makes you want to change your Email address."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I find the more fascinating books operate on multiple levels of interest. Usually, only a couple of these levels grab my attention. However, Greg Iles has managed to be the exception. I am interested in the internet and have a 40-year background in computing, so I am hard to fool when it comes to geek-speak. Greg has done his homework here. I am interested in those who live with a secret, as in Paul Theroux' My Other Life. Greg gives his character this attribute, making him guilt-ridden and partially crippled emotionally. I am interested in sociopaths, and the villain is one of the more interesting of these, although somewhat unbelievable in his ability to survive various assaults by the main character. Good job, Greg!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"It was a long book as mysteries go, but it had enough of a plot and subplot to keep me interested."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"It starts with a call to the New Orleans police that Harper has information about a recent murder that may be connected to six other women in five states spread across the country. When these women are all found to be murder victims, seemingly not-connected to one another, then the FBI and various police departments all are in a frenzy to talk to Harper, who becomes the number one suspect.I plowed through to page 93 and wondered if I should stop as this book had far too many words, paragraphs and yes even pages for me. I decided to stop for the night and maybe start again the next day. The next day I started again and by speed reading large chunks I finally got so enthralled that I could not stop reading until I turned page 564 at the end. An abridged version would have been a much better read, but even with this fault I give this book five stars which is a level that only twenty five percent of my reviews get.Ikes tells the story by interweaving surprise after surprise but yet manages to hide important revelations until the very end. If you only read one of his books I defiantly recommend this book.Author of al-Qaeda Strikes Again"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I'm a big fan of Greg Iles. The way he covers different subject matter makes his books very interesting, because you never really know what to expect. Although I would have liked to find out what happened to Eleanor Rigby - she just disappears.If you like Greg Iles, you'll like this one."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Harper Cole is a man that leads two lives. By day he trades commodities over the Internet out of his isolated Mississippi farmhouse. By night, he is the systems operator of EROS. EROS is an exclusive , sexually explicit on-line service. It guarantees complete privacy and confidentiality to its rich and famous clients. Unfortunately, someone has made it past EROS's top of the line security, and has used the sight to pick and kill six women celebrities. Each time the weapon, and city are different, but the trophy the same. Suddenly Harper is looked at as the prime suspect, and there is only one way to bring the killer out into the open. But Harper has sexual secrets of his own. His plan could not only expose them all, but put everyone he loves in the path of the killer.This book was responsible for introducing me to Greg Iles, and making me a lifetime fan of his. He is one of the most talented writers that I have ever come across. \\"Mortal Fear\\" offers unbelieveable suspense, outstanding characters, and a brilliant and complex story that will shock and disturb you. I have never read a story that looks into such taboo subjects reguarding sex. There are also so many twists, turns, and close calls that it will drive you crazy. Greg Iles' knowledge of computers and technology in general will really amaze you. It makes the computer related events in the book seem very realistic and believeable. The story also reads at a very fast pace and the 622 pages fly by!! I read Mortal Fear in one day, and I was literally up around the clock until I finished it.The characters are extremely well developed. Harper Cole has to risk everything to put a stop to the killer and it weighs heavilly on him! The inner conflict that he faces weighs on you as a reader because he must expose certain aspects of his past in order to stop the killer. Harper's best friend Miles is outstanding. As the book goes on, he will look more and more guilty, but he always has a way to make you question whether or not he is the killer. This adds a great element of mystery to the story. The fact that it hits so close to home for Harper is what makes the character of Miles so intriguing. Miles is a character that's intelligent, and funny which provides for some good laughs. It is hard to doubt a character that is so likeable. The story's villan is my favorite character. Now practically every work of fiction has a villan. However, in my opinion, \\"Mortal Fear\\" offers the best villan that I have ever come across in a book. He is an equal match for Harper in everyway, and almost better. Not knowing if Harper will succeed is what adds such suspense. He will shock you , disturb you, and amaze you with his strength, intelligence, and overall savage behavior. Greg Iles' character development is amazing overall. The dialogue he provides for them is realistic and you feel like you get to know each character personally.I guarantee that this book will become a favorite of yours. Greg Iles combines non-stop suspense, with wonderful characters, an even better villan, and a realistic, no-holds barred look into sex and the world of computers. I have read many novels in my time, but \\"Mortal Fear\\" found its way onto the top 10 list of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"It has been a while since I have read a book that kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down. It is the first book I have read by Greg Iles and it was very enjoyable. A+ in my book =0)"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"I could not put this book down. It was very good from the start and excelerated to a break neck pace halfway through. Likeable characters flaws and all.I definately recommend this book for those of you that like a chilling murder mystery.I am ready to buy another Greg Iles book and if it anything like this, I may have a new favorite author.2 thumbs way up!"},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Greg Iles is an original effective writer that not only grabs your attention on the first page but keeps you enthralled through the entire reading. His charactors have distinct complex lives that revolve around a plot that becomes more complex as each chapter evolves. Until the last few chapters, you are still guessing as to whom the criminal is. Few authors have this ability to twist plots and create believable charactors as Greg Iles does. I consider &quot;Mortal Fear&quot; his best but each of his books are distinctive and enjoyable. I highly suggest reading &quot;The Quiet Game&quot; next. Friends &amp; Family that I have recommended this book to, have been addicted as well and we all look forward to his next."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"This was my first Iles title and I was impressed. Couldn't put it down, then promptly ordered all other available books by him. Mortal Fear has an incredible 'end game' and kept me guessing until the last chapters. Great writing on a fascinating subject (serial killers). After reading several of his other titles, this remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Great plot, suspense and tension are well used, and the medical and technological aspects are well researched. Overall, an exciting page turner. An observation: the women in this novel are unusually, shall we say, &quot;unselfish&quot; sexually, happily bringing the men satisfaction, asking nothing in return - and getting nothing in return! The women give, the men take. Too graphically sexual and violent for me to completely enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Mortal Fear (Mississippi)","review":"Mr. Iles has outdone himself with this novel. The intellect involved along with the computer theory and a short course on surgery added to the complete chilling story that kept your mind working and the pages turning. Don't miss this one. Will look forward for more of the same."},{"Title":"Ed Ruscha","review":"My friend is named Dan and he really likes this book. He first showed it to me outside during recess. We are both only 13 . If I had to chose over either this Ed Ruscha book or a Sega dream cast, playstation 2, alot of chocolate, a gun that looked real but wasn't, but felt real cause it was so heavy, I would choose the gun, probably because I couldn't get a gun now( I am not 21) and because none of my friends have ever seen a gun, it would be cool. But I still would like to flip through this book, but I don't know if I'd buy it, especially with my own money."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"&quot;Psmith Journalist&quot; is the third Psmith novel and finds the hero cavorting in the New York City of 1914, as he unilaterally takes over a weekly newpaper, runs afoul of politicians and gangsters, and consorts with other gangsters to arrange for his protection. This sounds rather grim but actually Psmith continues to delight us with his humorous language and indomitable aplomb. As with the other early novels the final plot resolution is rather weak but not without being preceded by a hundred-odd pages of hilarious dialog and action. Moreover, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the New York of a distant year, with which the author was intimately familiar."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"I love Psmith, in all his forms - there are four novels with Psmith and this is one of the best - but they are all great. He is one of the best characters created by Wodehouse.Now, I wanted to recommend two books here for you, one more Psmith book that is great:Leave It To Psmith: A British Humor ClassicAnd this one - a book by Wodehouse about Wodehouse - and its interesting because he was a journalist and knows about newspapers, its very funny and entertaining too.Not George Washington: A British Humor ClassicEnjoy!"},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"Readers of Psmith's previous adventures (Mike and Psmith, Psmith in the City) will appreciate Psmith's adventures in darkest New York. Wodehouse limbers up his dese, dems, and doses as he introduces us to \\"Bat\\" Jarvis and his gang of lowlifes, with whom Psmith interacts in an amusing manner-- even, at times, becoming strenuous in his defense of justice and his own corpus! Psmith bonking miscreants over the head with a stick? Yes! Psmith disarming pistol-wielding evil-doers? Yes! And along the way, much of the artful and absurdly witty banter that Psmith and Wodehouse specialize in is served up in heaping dollops. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"This isn't Wodehouse's funniest novel, but it is definitely the most exciting, with a more dramatic plot than usual. Psmith takes on a crooked slum landlord, hounding him through the pages of 'Cosy moments' a bland family paper that he has transformed with the help of assistant editor Billy Windsor. Psmith is a wonderful character, languid, frivolous and comic on the surface, tough man of action underneath, a modern Pimpernell. there are some wonderful comic characters, especially Bat Jarvis, the tough gangland boss with a passion for cats. I wish Wodehouse had written more about Psmith, he could have been the hero of a whole series of thrillers, with Mike Jackson as his stalwart sidekick. Instead Wodehouse married him off in the next Psmith novel (Leave It To Psmith) and we hear no more of him, what a pity!"},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"This was the first Psimth book which I read, and though there was a bit of the real world, and sentimental stuff too (unlike the Jeeves' series), I thouroughly enjoyed it. A must read for Wodehouse fans."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"This book is an absolute laugh. Psmith is always unique but I really loved this one. My favourite is Mike and Psmith. I'm a wannabe journalist so I really sympathized with Psmith's need to get himself a good story. Buy the omnibus comrade, you'll never regret it."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"Very funny. I love how Wodehouse uses language. If you like that sort of thing and you haven't read Wodehouse before, shame on you. If you do and you've read other Wodehouse books, well, it's like that."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"This sharp and witty book is a must for any intellectual humanoid! The language is simply divine! It is a younger Frasier Crane working a Ph.D in linquistics of English, full of energetic laughter and irony."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"Not as good as the Jeeves and Wooster series but definitely enjoyable. But then, the only Wodehouse books I didn't care for is the series on Cricket, almost as boring as the game itself."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"Maybe I've had an overdose of Wodehouse lately, having read Piccadilly Jim, Biffen's Millions, Plum Pie, and this book practically in a row, but I was simply not entertained by Psmith Journalist at all.Perhaps it was Jonathan Cecil's reading (and I know that had a lot to do with it). His characterizations are indistinguishable and his attempt at an American accent is laughable (if you have heard any Monty Python, you'll recognize it).But I think that could have been overlooked (or overlistened?) if the story had grabbed me. It seemed to be about Psmith taking over a New York rag and making it into a scandal sheet, involving a boxer somewhere along the way, but I can't be sure. I just didn't care, and I found nothing funny at all.There is nothing to offer the casual Wodehouse fan in this novel. However, I will read his work again, as he has so much to offer in other books.But I really think it's mainly Jonathan Cecil's fault."},{"Title":"PSmith Journalist","review":"I must confess I have not bought or read this book but I was astonished when browsing through Amazon.com I came across it. The publishers have chosen for its cover a portrait of Spanish novelist Benito P&eacute;rez Gald&oacute;s, as painted by the great Joaqu&iacute;n Sorolla! I do not know about people outside the Spanish cultural mainstream, but I believe that a book about the laughable adventures of a semi auto-biographical journalist would be better introduced by a picture of Wodehouse himself, and not by the image of one of Spain's most thoughful and profound writers of all time. A shame."},{"Title":"Crazy Quilt Patchwork: A Modern Approach with 19 Projects","review":"This is not a good book. The projects are ugly, and nothing one would want to waste time on.

In short story format, he helps the reader understand the difference between a person who is called by God and one who is a self-appointed minister. In this day and age there are precious few who have listened to the call of the Master. Also, there are \\"ravenous wolves\\" in sheep's clothing attempting to take charge of \\"the flock\\" (as Jesus called them), he helps the reader understand the scriptural differences so that the false teachers and prophets are exposed and can be avoided using scriptural evidence. This book is a must read for those struggling with trying to understand which Church or pastor/teacher that they should listen to."},{"Title":"Thomas the Tank Engine and the Scrambled Eggs","review":"This little pop-up book assumes that the reader knows who the characters are in the \\"Thomas the Tank Engine\\" series. The pops ups are minimal. The story, however, does not teach a good lesson: laughing at others is all right. Although I'm sure that the story never really is resolved due to the short length of the book, one would think that this popular series would give a more concerted effort towards editing."},{"Title":"Hand Applique with Alex Anderson","review":"I was disappointed in the minimal amount of content for a beginner in applique.

Wilson's guide contains fairly detailed verbal descriptions of numerous trails and a few black-and-white photographs, but there are no maps (the Sunflower guides show all trails in small full-colour reproductions of sections of a large-scale topographical map of the island, as well as an overall map of the island on which is indicated all the trails or tours covered in the guide). While Wilson's guide might, I suppose, be preferred by those with lots of serious hiking and mountaineering experience using compass and binoculars, people like me who want a map of where they're going will be disappointed with this book.The route descriptions are fairly detailed, but (unlike the Sunflower series) neglect to mention some things important to more mortal hikers and walkers, like where on which hikes those prone to vertigo will need some help."},{"Title":"Crete the White Mountains (Cicerone International Walking)","review":"I have attempted many walks in this guide and have become lost on numerous occasions. There is not enough detail and a lot of the walks are difficult to find on the ground. Ms Wilson would have been better submitting fewer walks and providing more detail for the remainder. In England this would have been less of a problem duw to the fine detail of OS maps. Alas, there are still yet no really decent maps of Crete. Conditions can change literally overnight with shepherd bulldozing their own tracks to mountain pastures and obliterating many old trails. I would not recommend this book to the inexperienced."},{"Title":"Student Resource Manual to Accompany Calculus: A New Horizon","review":"Calculus: A New Horizon is probably the best Calculus book in print, and it is one of the most popular. The Student Resource Manual is equally as good, with just several short-comings. First, a few of the answers in the book are just plain incorrect. Secondly, the book would be much better if it also gave answers for the even numbered problems (even if it was just a simple answer with no work). However, the book does give much more detailed answers (works the questions out, step-by-step) to the odd questions than can be found in the back of the textbook. Additioanly, the practice tests are great to review with. I spend at least an hour with it each night working out as many problems as possible and cross-referencing them with the worked out answers. Truly a great supplement to the text book."},{"Title":"Student Resource Manual to Accompany Calculus: A New Horizon","review":"Too many misprints, and solutions to even numbered problems would make it far more useful.

She bore twelve children, separated from her profligate husband at thirty-eight, and supported herself and her children by writing. Her bestselling first novel EMMELINE (1788) is an emotionally charged mix of romance and revolutionary ideas - a Cinderella story with strong feminist overtones.The novel features a beautiful heroine with lofty morals. Orphaned and illegitimate, Emmeline Mobray has been left to the care of an old housekeeper and steward in a decaying castle. She educates herself by reading Shakespeare, Pope, and Milton from the moldering library. When Emmeline is sixteen, her uncle Lord Montreville and his son Delamere unexpectedly come to the castle for hunting season. Delamere falls madly in love with Emmeline - and she becomes the hunted.Emmeline will inspire passion in a number of men - but none so difficult as Delamere. He's been raised with no restraint on his desires, and he badgers Emmeline relentlessly to marry him - upsetting both her and his snobbish family. Delamere's hotheadedness also makes him prone to duels, which will lead to more than one traumatic scene in the novel. Despite the thoroughly eighteenth-century flavor of Smith's novel, Delamere is not much different from certain men in our own day who are violent and emotionally abusive to women.I've hinted at the plot here, but trust me, it's only a hint. This novel is rich in colorful characters and subplots that rival the interest and complexity of the main plot. Emmeline's suitors alone - ranging from comic to threatening to noble - provide plenty of action. Emmeline's rigid principles and minute scruples may be something of a torment to modern readers, but her compassion for those in distress engages all our sympathy.In the scholarly introduction, the editor discusses how the philosophy and politics of the times influenced Smith - and points out the innovative aspects of her writing. I was charmed to learn that Jane Austin as a teenager loved EMMELINE and praised Smith's books as \\"universally read and admired.\\"The editor also reveals the autobiographical elements in Emmeline's good friend Mrs. Stafford. Like Charlotte Smith, Mrs. Stafford has numerous children and is burdened with a faithless husband who goes to debtor's prison. Contemporary readers relished this autobiographical content. As a courageous single mother beset with troubles, Smith was a heroine to her reading public.I loved EMMELINE. But to appreciate it fully, it helps to adopt an eighteen-century mindset. If you can't put your twenty-first-century views on hold, it may bother you that servants are subservient, women faint easily, and courtship can be a long drawn-out affair. Go with it, and you're in for a great reading experience.I highly recommend the Broadview edition for its readable format and instructive introduction and appendices."},{"Title":"What I Have Learned: A Collection of 20 Autobiographical Essays by Great Contemporaries From the Saturday Review","review":"This compilation by Norman Cousins is revealing on several levels, not the least of which is the Salvador de Madariaga connection. Norman Cousins evidently lived \\"several lives,\\" and ended them, unfortunately, as an apparent New Agers' New Ager. He was deeply involved with Donald Keys and wrote the preface to EARTH AT OMEGA: PASSAGE TO PLANETIZATION, saying that he and Donald Keys had worked together for several decades to sound the alarm. Salvador de Madariaga was an early endorser of their Planetary Citizens project, per letterhead from the era. I had wondered if there were connections between Norman Cousins and deMadariaga. This book gave evidence that there were. The connections could as well have been from the literary world as deMadariaga was a brilliant writer for his era which encompassed much of the era of Norman Cousins. As I continue to investigate which came first, the chicken or the egg(?), I find this book a valuable edition to a researcher's library which may lead in its turn to further discoveries. I am grateful to Amazon.com research resource and that I was able to locate this book on a search from that source."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"While this was a good and interesting read with fun information on the middle ages, to call it life in a Medieval castle is very misleading. It was not really just about the middle ages in general and few chapters were just about castles. Only about 5 out of 12 chapters actually talk specifically about castles and not even all of those 5 chapters just focus on castles. A lot of stuff the book talks about can also apply to Manors or wherever the Lord could be living. It is not a bad book though, its a very easy read with fun facts and nice pictures. The chapter about 'the castle as a home' was particularly interesting. I just wish the authors had paid more attention to the castle itself.If you want a good book on sieges this is not the book for you. It has one general chapter but not much else about the military importance.But what this book does have is a good narrative and a nice list of castles in different countries in the glossary.Overall not bad, but be ready to leave the topic of castles if you read it."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"They say that when a new book appears, you should re-read an old one. So, when Ian Mortimer's \`Time-Traveller's Guide to the Middle Ages' came out not long ago, I re-read \`Life in a Medieval Castle', which was first published in the 1970s; and in fact the title does promise less than it delivers, since it is not just about castles and castle-building. It is also about knighthood and feudalism; the daily round of medieval life; diet and dress; hunting, especially falconry; and there is even a fascinating passage about sex, with extracts from a treatise where a knight and a lady debate the teenage boy's absurd question: if you could divide a woman into two at the waist, and only enjoy the pleasures (or, in medieval parlance, the \`solaces') of the upper or the lower half, which would you choose? Quite an eye-opener if you start with the assumption that life in the Middle Ages was nasty, brutish and short.The book is a wide-ranging survey of medieval life, but it benefits from focussing most intensely on one century - the thirteenth - and one place - Chepstow Castle in England. This technique resembles that adopted by Barbara Tuchman in her book about the fourteenth century, \`A Distant Mirror', which was also published in the 1970s and had at its heart a life of one individual, Enguerrand de Coucy. It works by focussing on the particular, while at the same time discussing the general. There are many revealing quotations here, particularly from the work of Matthew Paris, who wrote during the long reign of Henry III.The book is well written and scholarly at the same as being entertaining; but one should be aware that it is a relatively benign portrait of the Middle Ages, certainly in contrast to that painted by Tuchman (which is positively depressing, if taken seriously). This is, perhaps, because so much of the discussion relates to the period before 1348, when the Black Death swept away a very high percentage of the European population - perhaps between 25 and 33%. The thirteenth century was the age of high farming, when the population was expanding and Western Europeans were still extending the areas of settlement. There was war, of course, but nothing on the scale of the Hundred Years War, or of the devastation and social change brought about by the plague, which not only arrived in 1348 but became endemic thereafter It was no longer glad, confident morning again; but, while it lasted, life in the medieval castle was quite a party, if this book is to be believed."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"An enjoyable read, where the author strives to let us see inside a castle's walls, much like myu hisotry professors did when I was at university."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Everyone else seems to be astounded and amazed by this book, butit was just okay. The information in this book was very good, but it was presented in a very boring fashion.

So, it would be of great use to someone doing a research report for some odd reason on the subject.

It's nicely illustrated with photographs of extant castles and period illustrations. I would definitely recommend this as either a book for the casual reader who might have an interest in medieval social life or a beginning for a more serious study.The authors try to do a fair assesment of such issues as medieval hygeine (where it is all too easy to overwhelm the readers with descriptions of how dirty and disgusting the medieval life would be to modern sensibilities, thus overlooking that there was concern about unpleasant smells from the privy chamber, and how to fix it). The discussion on the duties associated with the feudal relationship is also very clear and readable. I particularly was interested in the mention at several points that physical blows were used as mnemonic aids. The buffet given a squire upon being knight was no mere tap, but many times a hearty blow meant to make him remember his oath of knightood. Also, beating the bounds was used to teach youngsters where the important landmarks were often by giving them a blow at the site of the landmark, or even bumping them against it. Fascinating look at the medieval ideas about learning-- which does have some effectiveness, epecially in a largely illiterate society, although it would probably be cause for arrest in any state in the US if it was used today.Libraries have been written on any one of the sujects that was mentioned in this book so don't expect it to hold the one answer to any question about medieval life in a castle, but it can't be beat for a clearly written overview."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Extensively researched, yet fascinating, this volume is a standard source for all Medieval writers. Delightful quotes from servants' instruction manuals and journals of the time give a lively immediacy to the text. Black and white photos and illustrations. Ages high school through adult."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"This was the first and thus far the only book I have read by these authors (though I own three others I have yet to find the time to read) - it is a fascinating exploration of socio-political history the authors help to put flesh on the \`bare bones' of the crumbling stone ruins and empty shells which are all that sadly remains of castles today. They go beyond examining only the political or military function of castles (though this is covered) to explore castles in their roles as homes, and the \`headquarters' of estates with the central focus on Chepstow on the Welsh borders, but also other castles.In chapters under titles such as \`The Lord of the Castle' \`The Lady' and the \`The Household' the inhabitants of castles are vividly bought to life, from the highest to the lowest, and the society in which castles played such an important role is examined. Along the way there are many gems of information, useful, enlightening and entertaining. One of my personal favourites was the section on table manners and dining etiquette which belies the popular misconception that medieval people were uncouth, uncivilised and vulgar- and reveals striking parallels between the etiquette of the middle ages and today. The sections on hunting, which reveal its roles as a social activity, \`The Making of a Knight' and \`The Castle as a House' are also fascinating.My only complaint was that some of the information the first chapter did seem a little over simplified in some parts, and the claim that the Normans beat the English and Hastings because they were \`better' than them seemed represent a rather outdated interpretation- although this may be a reflection of the fact that the book was written in the 70s. As a result of the nationality of the authors there are some Americanisms (such as Richard the Lionhearted) which may prove a slight annoyance to British readers, and some might find the numerous photographs peppered throughout a history book distracting or irksome. Personally I had to problem with these, and felt they illustrated some of the themes and points made rather well.The writing style of the authors makes the book accessible and not too high-brow or scholarly but not at the expense of primary source material which is used and included throughout the book. This said, those looking for a more detailed and in-depth examination of some of the subject matter with and academic slant which analysis and some of the sources won't find much of it here. Although written by Medievalist Historians, \`Life in a Medieval Castle' is very much popular history- and very good popular history too"},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Although I'm not a huge fan of the often simplistic and dated introductions to medieval life published by Frances and Joseph Gies, \\"Life in a Medieval Castle\\" is definitely one of the better ones.As others have mentioned, the book is somewhat misleadingly titled, since much material covers life outside the castle, from the surrounding countryside to the local political scene to the royal council and the king. The opening sections start out promisingly enough: a prologue focusing on Chepstow Castle as an example of the heyday of fortresses, followed by a survey of the first castles built around the time of the Norman Invasion. The following chapters alternate between life in the castle and other topics: the social hierarchy from king to villein (serf), the authority of the lord and the duties of the lady, the politics and obligations of knighthood, the officers and staff of the castle, and life in the village outside the castle. (The authors revised several of these passages and reused them in their later books, it should be noted.) There are also fascinating chapters on hunting and falconers and on sieges and warfare. The focus is largely on Britain, and the authors include lengthy excerpts from original sources. And they conclude with a brief chapter describing the decline of the castle, which became the victim of \\"not gunpowder but central government.\\"I suspect this book is largely used for the classroom, but the clarity and variety of the information will surely satisfy most general readers and even tourists. (There's a handy list of major castles and ruins in the back.) The pedestrian prose that haunts the authors' later books is mostly absent here. A serious detriment to the book is the grainy quality of the photographs throughout, and the reader should resort to the Internet for the many spectacular images available online. The publisher might be well advised to breathe new life into this book by reissuing it with color photographs."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"I liked \\"Life in a Medieval Castle\\" very much. Not only does it give a detailed insight into everyday life and \\"management\\" of a castle, it also describes the politics in and around it. I very much appreciated the description of how the connections between various lords and the king play a big role in how the castles are built and run. Rather than being self-centered single units, there are intricate political networks between the lords and the manifestation of their power, their castles."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Let me start of by saying: I love my Kindle and I really like the book \\"Life in a Medieval Castle\\". That being said these two are not made for each other.In the book there are photographs and drawings interspersed with text. This is easy to follow in hard copy. On the Kindle, the text is interrupted by sometimes one or more illustrations with captions. As a result this reader lost the train of thought from the written text.The book itself is easy to read and understand, even if you are not a Medieval scholar. You can appreciate the engineering genius that helped the castle evolve. Many people may not realize that William the Conqueror had a relatively easy time consolidating his hold over England, The Saxon Lords only had 5 castles before 1066. There were hundreds by the 1100s.What I liked most about the narrative is that this was not a romanticized or patronizing account of Medieval times. The descriptions were easy and interesting enough for the lay reader. I found myself always wanting to read a little further. If the next chapter was about, say ,the castle gardener, I still wanted to go on based on the interest that was built before it.It definitely is not a novel. It could, though, provide source material for an aspiring Historical or Fantasy novelist,To sum up buy the hard copy book and not the digital edition. The book is only .20 cents more. Sorry Kindle not this time."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"The Gies put together these concise overviews of medieval life. Also see Life in a Medieval Village by them. Their books are not researched extensively, but they are pretty good for starters as others have mentioned. They provide with some decent background information for specific things...such as life in a meideval castle.My only issue with the text is that it takes an Annalist perspective by over generalizing the topic. Sure, there was a general way people survived in Castles, but a closer look one will find castle life different in different areas. However, they provide for very interesting reads, and the Gies always include some interesting citations."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Like the Gies' other works, this book gives a view of the day-to-day life of people in the middle ages for the non-technical reader. In this case, the book's about what it was like to live in a medieval castle. As with their other books, some serious historians will find the book to vague, while many casual readers may find the book to provide too much seemingly trivial detail. For me, it was a great light read, full of fun information. It's also a pretty honest little book. No high prose or deep philosophy here --just the facts. So you want to know what it was like to live in a castle, here are the down and dirty facts. Think of it as Castles 101.

The passages are divided into chapters on all facets of castle life, and are written in a clear, almost &quot;novel&quot; like way.Some of the facts presented are well-known, but there were enough fresh tidbits and interesting anecdotes that I never found myself bored.In addition, at the end of the book, is a list of historically important castles, ranging in construction from the 9th century to the 15th century, that can be useful if the reader is planning a trip to England, France, Spain or elsewhere in Europe.All in all, an entertaining and well written book."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"As a 17 year old freshman, I expected to have to force my way through the assigned chapters of what I expected to be a mega-boring dose of medieval torture.

It doesn't glorify, get bogged down in details, pity or condescend to its subject. There's dirt, disease and war along with everyday chores, pastimes, dining and amusement. It's a must read for anyone interested in an accurate and unembellished picture of the gamut of medieval society.

Perhaps what I appreciated most about this book was that it covered a little bit of everything - from history to architecture to military engagements to domestic uses to the people who actually lived in castles. Castles really come to life in this book - as well as the people housed within. There's enough detail in here to satisfy the researcher - but the prose moves along at a trim pace so you won't get bogged down. If you're interested in a specific facet of castles or castle life, you may have to supplement your knowledge elsewhere, but this is a fine overview of castles and their history."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"Life in a Medieval Castle is absolutely masterful! Extremely well researched, each chapter is a goldmine of information. The work not only offers a wonderful summary of the history of the development of the castle but also gives the reader a real feel for castle life. The text is engaging and very well written. Jargon specific to discussions of feudalism and castles is defined in concise tables at the back of the book. Liberally sprinkled with excellent photographs, the book provides extras, such as a schematic drawing of a castle and words and music to medieval songs (although I did find myself wishing that at least some of the plates could have been in color). The geographical guide to castles is comprehensive and examples are chosen with care. Bibliography is provided for each chapter for those readers who wish to study certain topics in-depth. Bibliographic selections are authoritative, current and comprehensive. The index is also well done and easy to use.

For those seeking an introduction to the military, economic, and cultural signifigance of the castle in Medieval Europe, this is your best choice. Inside you will find a description of a castle's typical staff & personnel, the living conditions of those residing there (better than most would assume), the daily and yearly routine of business in the castle and its lands (mainly agricultural), and the most vital role as a military post for regional defense. The training of the Knight is covered well (Read \\"The Knight in History\\" by the same authors). In general, the focus is on castles in Britain, probably the most heavily fortified nation in Europe, after Germany, or maybe France, in terms of quantity of castles.

For someone more interested in the military and siege aspects of castles this book may not contain as much info as you'd like. I'm keeping this one for my personal collection."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"If you are someone (such as myself) who has never really grown up, one of the tremendous advantages of being a parent is that you get to buy your child lavish toys without the world suspecting that you take at least as much pleasure in them as the fortunate offspring. Hence, my son as a child was the proud owner of four Lego castles. When I was growing up, Lego had just been introduced, but had not specialised to the point of producing something like the Royal Knight's Castle or the Night Lord's Castle. I've always loved castles and the concept of the siege. Joseph and Frances Gies' book has now increased my knowledge and appreciation of them ten-fold.This book is mainly about castles in Great Britain, and gives special attention to Chepstow Castle, on the border of England and Wales. Prior to the Norman invasion, England had few castles. This is one reason that William the Conqueror had an astonishingly easy time consolidating his power after his initial victory. He then went on a castle building binge. By the year 1100, the number of castles in England had grown from less than a dozen to over 500. Castles were evolving at this time from crude, wooden motte and bailey fortresses to substantial stone edifices, capable of withstanding assaults by forces 10 times those inside. The architecture of the stone castle benefited greatly from knowledge brought back to Europe by Crusaders. Borrowing ideas and styles from their enemies and inventing their own improvements, the crusading Orders (the Templars and Hopitallers) had need to build powerful castles in order to hold out in hostile lands after the majority of their allies returned home.As residences, castles provided their inhabitants with luxurious living when compared with the hovels the majority lived in. Even so, many of us would blanch at the prospect of living in one. \\"Floors were strewn with rushes and in the later Middle Ages sometimes with herbs... The rushes were replaced at intervals and the floor swept, but Erasmus, noting a condition that must have been true in earlier times, observed that under them lay 'an ancient collection of beer, grease, fragments, bones, spittle, excrement of dogs and cats, and everything that is nasty.' \\"These were dark and violent times, peopled by hard, ruthless, and ambitious men and women. For the sovereign, a disadvantage of the building of formidable castles was that they could serve as rallying points and strongholds for knights plotting against the crown. John Marshall, described by a contemporary as \\"a limb of hell and the root of evil\\", chose the losing side in a war of succession between Stephen of Blois (nephew of Henry I) and Matilda of Anjou (Henry I's daughter). Having been prevailed upon to hand over his son (William) as hostage to prevent further treachery against Stephen, Marshall went ahead and reinforced a castle that Stephen was besieging. Stephen threatened to hang William unless Marshall surrendered, to which Marshall replied that he didn't care what happened to his son since he had \\"the anvils and hammer to forge still better sons.\\" Although some of his entourage would have hanged the lad, while others advocated catapulting him over the castle walls, Stephen was moved by William's \\"cheerful innocence\\" and took him on as a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. William Marshall grew up to be a loyal servant of the crown, and one of the most celebrated knights of the Middle Ages.Justice in these times was rough and typically swift. \\"Thieves were hanged, traitors blinded, other offenders mutilated. Sometimes a criminal was drawn and quartered. Prisoners might be confined in a castle tower or basement to await ransom or sentencing, but rarely as punishment, prison as punishment being little known in the middle ages.\\" By 1219 the custom of trial by ordeal \\"in which a defendant strove to prove his veracity by grasping a red-hot iron without seriously burning his hand, or by sinking when thrown into water\\" was outlawed in England. \\"Judicial combat, by which the defendant or his champion fought the accuser, survived longer.\\" It seems to me that this custom still survives in the form of lawyers duking it out verbally within the adversarial legal system. If you can afford a powerful champion, you might get off whether you are guilty or not.While males faced the hazards of brutal warfare, females did not necessarily enjoy an extended garden party -\\"Girlhood was brief. Women were marriageable at twelve and usually married by fourteen. Heiresses might be married in form as young as five and betrothed even younger, though such unions could be annulled before consummation. By twenty a woman had a number of children, and by thirty if she survived the hazards of childbirth, she might be widowed and remarried, or a grandmother.\\" Some women put on armour and went to war, Empress Matilda, Dame Nicolaa de la Haye, and Eleanor of Aquitaine being fine examples.The medieval castle and its environs celebrated many holidays, most of pagan/agricultural significance given Christian names to make them acceptable to the church. Some have survived to this day (Christmas, Easter, Halloween), but most have vanished and sound exotic and strange today: Michaelmas (September 29 -the start of winter), Kammas (August 1 -the start of autumn, harvest season, Pentecost or Whitsunday (the seventh Sunday after Easter), Candlemas (February 2, when tillage was resumed), Hocktide (the end of Easter week and the start of summer), Midsummer or St John's Day (June 24). Some of the customs practised on these holidays sound as if they were made up by Monty Python alumni -when ploughing resumed after the Christmas break, a 'foolplough' was hauled through the village by a group of young ploughmen who asked for pennies from door to door. If anyone refused, they ploughed up the ground before his door. Their leader was dressed as an old woman called Bessy, with a bullock's tail under her gown; sometimes they were accompanied by a man wearing a fox's skin as a hood and by a fool with a stick and bladder. The Rogation Days (the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before Ascension) were celebrated in the countryside under the name of gangdays. The people of the villages went \\"aganging\\" in a procession led by the priest and carrying the cross, banners, bells, and lights around the boundaries of the village, \\"beating its bounds\\" with willow wands. Small boys were ducked in brooks and ponds and their buttocks were bumped against trees and rocks to help them memorise the village bounds.I had always assumed that the eating and drinking in castles would be pretty good. Not so. \\"Wine in thirteenth century England, mostly imported from English-ruled Bordeaux, was drunk young in the absence of an effective technique for stoppering containers. Wine kept for a year became undrinkable. No attention was paid to vintage, and often what was served even at rich tables was of poor quality.\\" Peter of Blois described in a letter wine served at Henry II's court: \\"The wine is turned sour or mouldy -thick, greasy, stale, flat and smacking of pitch. I have sometimes seen even great lords served with wine so muddy that a man must needs close his eyes and clench his teeth, wry-mouthed and shuddering, and filtering the stuff rather than drinking.\\" What a lovely phrase -\\"wry- mouthed and shuddering.' Apparently the ale wasn't much better."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"I know that some people like to say that the works of the Gies are dry. Try reading 500 pages of Peter Brown. Now THAT'S dry. It's hard to make history terribly informative and yet accurrate and interesting. The Gies are very clear and personally I found it extremely interesting. It was the only book (out of 7) that I was required to ready for my class on Medieval Europe that I found interesting (and actually read all of!). It is not a novel, so be forwarned. If that's what you want, you WILL be dissappointed, but it is an excellent HISTORY book."},{"Title":"LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE","review":"This book is absolutely the best place to start if you want to learn about medieval castles. It explains in very accessable prose how medieval castles came to be, how they evolved, the roles they served in medieval society, what they were like at their zenith, how military strategy through the middle ages centered around the castle, and how their relevance declined with the changes in technology and the political scene that came with the late medieval period. The Gieses give the reader a very clear picture of what life was like for the people whose lives centered in or around the castle, from the nobility at the top down through the staff needed to keep the castle running to the villagers at the bottom. In particular, it shows the various functions that the castle staff needed to serve in order to keep things running smoothly, and the duties of those responsible for those functions, from chamberlains, chaplains, seneschals and stewards down to pantlers, haywards and reeves. In many cases, the best things are the historical anecdotes used to show a particular aspect of castle life, from the manner in which meals were served to the ways provisions were acquired in an era where money was by no means a common exchange, and how matters of jurisdiction often overlapped in problematic ways (a lord might have jurisdiction over a castle but not over the forest surrounding it which belonged to the king). This is not what I would call the definitive text on all aspects of castle lore, but it is probably the single best place to start to get a clear and detailed education on, as the title indicates, \\"life in a medieval castle.\\""},{"Title":"Changing Vocational Education and Training: An International Comparative Perspective","review":"Interesting overview of contempory practice of policy analysis and development of vocational education and training in Europe, Africa, America and Asia. The international community of vocational educators should welcome this new work since it will inform debate of current issues and future trends. The Scottish editorial team of Finlay, from the Scottish School of Further Education at the University of Strathclyde, Niven, President Emeritus of the International Vocational Education and Training Association and Young, Director of Lifelong Learning at the Glasgow Development Agency are well apprised of international developments. Niven is well known for his contributions to IVETA's international conferences and publications. The illuminative research of Niven and Finlay funded by the Advisory Scottish Council for Education and Training Targets, which underpinned much of the work and is referred to in the work, presents new insights into the achievement of consensus in different international contexts. The research was grounded in an expert seminar attended by prominent researchers from different countries e.g. Dar-chin Rau from Taiwan, Betsy Brand from the USA, Olli Rati from Finland, Jim Gleason from Ireland, Iain Bellis from South Africa, Johnny Sung from Singapore and Willi Brandt from Germany. The experts report on how consensus is reached within their countries, and the closing chapter identifies key principles which could have wide application. The book gives a highly readable global perspective on the challenges faced by vocational education and training in recent years. It is a welcome addition to the literature of international education and training and is a must for post-graduate students of comparative education."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar In A Sieve is about a family that lives in India and their struggles through life.

This book was on the 10th grade reading list and I can honestly say that I thoroughly disliked it from start to finish. It gets two stars for the language, metaphors, and descriptions within it, but nothing more.This book is based entirely on trying to get an emotion out of the reader, which in this case is sympathy. I find sentimental writing to be very poor and I just can't get into it, but to each his own. I wouldn't object to anyone wanting to read this book as their personal tastes might allow them to squeeze some enjoyment from it but I would never go so far as to reccomend it to anybody.Don't get me wrong. The language used throughout the novel as well as the change in perspective is a breath of fresh air compared to the meat of story itself. My belief is that the only reason this book ended is because the author could not think of any other tragic events that could occur.--tim"},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"The one great thing about this book is I'm not apathetic about the character.

I had to read this for school and I am a sci-fi/fantasy fan, so maybe that is why I didn't like it so much.I found the storyline to be minimal, and I would leave the book feeling depressed and sad. That's not the way I want to feel when I am reading a book.Seriously, the book droned on about the hardships they faced, and I could barely find a spot that was remotely happy.

I recommend it if you like to learn about the old culture in India"},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Written in 1954, set against the backdrop of a remote village in post-independence India. Narrated through the eyes of Rukmani - she married \\"below\\" her at the age of 12 and moved to a tawdry mud hut with her farmer husband Nathan, who rented his rice paddies from the local landowners, as was/is tradition in most villages. Rukmani's simple acceptance of, and outlook on, life and death and all things in between - from the starvation of her sons, to her daughter prostituting to feed her infant brother - makes the book touching and oh-so very deeply profound. Dialogues between the British doctor Kenny and Rukmani provide a keen juxtaposition of attitudes between believers of fate/destiny and those that don't.A beautifully written novel that shows tremendous insight into the lives of the have-nots in rural India."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"As Rukmani starts her life she lives in a village chieftan's house and dreams of having a gigantic wedding. When she reaches age twelve her parents have married off all of her sisters and cant afford a big wedding for her and cant find her a rich husband so she is married to a poor farmer that has no land of his own. She learns that he is a loving husband and will do almost anything for her. She makes three friends on her first trip to wash cloths and herself and they become her friends for a long time. When she gives birth to a daughter that everyone who comes to see agrees she is beautiful she worries about if she will have a son. Six years into her daughters life she still had no sons so she went to see a doctor for help. A small while later she has her first baby boy and she finds that one problem is solved just to get more problems to come. As she has more and more sons she finds it hard to feed them all and when the crops start producing less and less so the families life becomes harder. As she marries her daughter away her sons lives become harder as the famine starts and it becomes difficult to live.This book gives a good idea of how life is like when famine strikes and gives a realistic picture of how troublesome life can be. This book has a few exciting moments but the beginning is boring and could be more exiting. Overall, I wouldn't recommend reading this book because it does not capture the readers attention and it is not a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve is a tale of the courage of the human heart and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. It is a testimony of finding hope in hopelessness and the attempt to savor life's nectar and sweetness before it all inevitably slips away. Set in rural southern India, we meet Rukmani, a simple peasant woman who confronts life's misfortunes and challenges: poverty, disaster and death, with remarkable fortitude and courage. This is not a tale of oppression, machismo, addiction or religion. The Hindu concept of karma teaches us a greater lesson about our protagonist Rukmani. Karma is not about religion but rather is a spiritual or metaphysical philosophy that allows the reader to perhaps reconcile (Rukmani's) life's tragedies and tribulations. Rukmani's path to Nirvana is through severe hardship, and we discover that the meteoric rise of one's character and spirit is indeed through suffering."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Powerful and depressing.

There is so much packed into this little novel that if you blink you miss something. In some ways it is a very hard read in the fact that it is so realistic. After I read the book, I was shocked to find it out that it was written over 45 years ago. It is so modern and forward thinking that I assumed it had been written in the past year or two. At its core is Rukmani, a peasant Indian girl who marries her husband at age 12. This might shock some but it was a very common practice. This story is a tale of her life, struggles and joys. It is impossible to read this book and forget it."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This small but unforgettable paperback written in 1955 offers a compelling tale of Rukmani, a twelve-year-old peasant girl embarking on a marriage to a man she's never met, which was typical for India at that time. She is gratified to find in Nathan a thoughtful and generous husband and they begin their odyssey of married life--complete with hard work and losses, anxieties and simple delights, and joys and sorrows that all readers can appreciate. Piercing want is everywhere, as crops fail, city life tramples human dignity, and the inborn humility of the masses is resigned to injustice and tragedy. This doesn't keep Rukmani from giving herself in love amidst bewildering circumstances, and setting her hopes firmly against the fatalism of her culture. This story would be well-suited for teenagers as well as adults, giving a realistic view of rural India, the basics of Hindu culture, and the stark realities of dire poverty."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Well, in looking at some of the reviews, (I only skimmed the bad ones), I know this is one of the best books I have read. It took me to another time, another place on this earth that is so far different than mine. I could not imagine the poverty, starvation, and the inablility to ask for help, through pride and not wanting to beg, or knowing that death by starvation was accepted! There was clearly a lack of survival skills that I found frustrating. I could not watch my son die without doing some things extraordinary to save him. The daughter, who prostituted herself, had the right idea, because the only other option was death for her and her loved ones. The mother could have gone to her doctor friend, but did not. And the good doctor expressed his dismay at the people, who seemed to be so mired in poverty they could not think clearly of how to get out of it. The book reminded me of A Fine Balance, which I read a couple of years ago, but this one was more intimate. Another thing I found intriguing was that this was written in the 50's, a time when so many authors were writing wonderful things, but I had never before heard of this book! I wish I had read it long ago. I found it not one bit boring, but enriching and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I read this for an Intro in Indian Civilization class. It is a very good narrative, and I could not put it down. It describes bascially the life of an Indian woman from the time she gets married, and then it goes a full circle until the woman finds herself, essentially alone with no husband, at the same place she first lived after getting married.One of the themes of the book is modernity and its affects on an Indian village and Indian family.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Rukhmani's story is a sad one that continues to be true in India today. Infant mortality is very high due to poor healthcare and starvation. Women in India have a shorter lifespan then men, Ruku's story shows why all these sad statistics are true.A note about the caste system. It is an inseparable part of India and Hinduism (not a proud part either). One is born into a caste and cannot change it by switching occupations as a previous reviewer has mentioned. The caste system is much more complicated than you're a priest, warrior, merchant or farmer. Being born into a \\"low\\" caste does not mean one is automatically consigned to drudgery and poverty and being a \\"high\\" caste does not guarantee wealth. In this book, Ruku is married to a poor man but he is of the same caste as her (intercaste marriage at the time would have guaranteed social ostracization)."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This is the story of Rukmani, an Indian woman who endures hardship and misfortune, yet is blessed with a loving husband and family. They struggle as tenant farmers, beholden to the demands of the landlord, the vagaries of the weather and the greed of the moneylender. Hardworking and optimistic despite their circumstances they cling to the land and rejoice in the growth of their crops and garden. In the beginning, times were good and there was hope of saving money, eventually buying a plot of land, as well as marrying their daughter to a good family. However the arrival of the tannery changes the landscape, corrupts their children, inflates the prices of goods, and ultimately the land is sold from under them. Famine causes their daughter to prostitute herself to feed their youngest son who ends up dying. Rukmani and Nathan end up destitute in a big city, working in a stone quarry and getting fed at the temple, trying to save money to return to the land that is no longer tenantable by them. However the land is their home, their hopes. And even though the story is extremely sad, Rukmani, the orphan Puli, and daughter Ira and son Selvam are reunited, with some hope for the future. The white man Kenny who has helped Rukmani's family throughout her life has trained Selvam to be a medical assistant and he has a job at the hospital that was built by charitable donations Kenny has rounded up. Even though Rukmani does not understand what would motivate people in other countries who have never seen them to give money so that widows do not die on the street (as happened to Rukmani's only friend), she is grateful that her family has a future, and that she could keep her promises to Puli who is healed from his leprosy.In some sense, even though the ending of the story is sad in the physical sense, in constrast to the Good Earth, it ends with optimism and hope and with the remnants of the family who stick together and support each other."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I read this as a view as to what living in India was like under British rule and during their transitional period. It was great as an inside look to the average life of a peasent farmer."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"&iexcl;Living in poverty does not mean one&iexcl;s life is miserable&iexcl; is how I conclude the novel Nectar in a Sieve. Rukmani, an Indian woman, lives with her peasant husband Nathan in a simple village in India. Although India is a male dominant society, Nathan does not treat Rukmani in a cruel way, instead he loves her a lot, therefore, Rukmani&iexcl;s life is better than most of the women who are being abused by their male relatives. I can feel the respect that Nathan shows to Rukmani for her intelligence and knowledge. Throughout the novel, it is easy to see how Nathan shows his love and care to his family, especially to his wife. It is decent to see how the husband works together with his wife and family in a patriarchal society. Nathan&iexcl;s actions remind us that &iexcl;absolute male power&iexcl; can be dissolved if one is willing to do so. Nathan is living in India, it is natural for him to adopt the traditional &iexcl;men rule&iexcl; notion and apply to his family, but he never does that to his wife and family. This makes me think about how people make excuses and claims that it is hard to change the traditional rules in the patriarchy society. I think it partly depends on if one is willing to make change, or in fact taking advantages of the rules.The loving couple has to deal with poverty as the rest of the villagers do. Due to the lack of money and food, one of their infant children dies from starvation. A son dies trying to get money for food, and eventually the couple has to accept the fact that their daughter becomes a prostitute to help the family survive. There are not so many choices left for Rukmani and Nathan, all they can do, they believe is to accept their fate. Those incidents reflect how insufficient the system and law in a country can be to protect its people, protecting anyone with wealth and power instead. Also, people from the city are protected by law whereas the villagers are deprived by the same law. We may pay our sympathy to the villagers, but look at our countries where the same thing happens too! We too take (or have to take) things as they are without questioning, like Rukmani and Nathan. The novel suggests that it is time for us to think again, find out the problems in the society and deal with them. Our actions will not only be beneficial to ourselves, but also to our next generations and thus, a lot of tragedies can be prevented. If the law was good enough to protect everyone, then Rukmani&iexcl;s daughter&iexcl;s life might be totally different and the story could be rewritten."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve by Kamala Markandaya tells the story of peasant woman, Rukmani, as she ages in post-colonial India. From the time Rukmani marries as a twelve-year-old bride, raises a family, and looks on as her children make lives of their own, she is faced with unthinkable challenges. She is repeatedly moved from home to home by the government, she suffers from hunger and oppression, and she is forced to watch the village community she has lived in for so long crumble under the great changes caused by the \\"westernization\\" of her homeland. She lives a life of \\"Hope and fear. Twin forces that tugged at us first in one direction and then in another.\\" Yet she endures through all of the pain with extraordinary fortitude and solemn grace.Nectar in a Sieve portrays Rukmani's story in a very different style of writing than what I usually encounter. Rather than explicitly describe the struggles that Rukmani is faced with, she explains the situation in a very simple way and allows the reader to put their own emotion into Rukmani's place. Because of this, I found myself to be incredibly wrapped up in the story and almost crying because of the sense of optimism and love in Rukmani's character and the depression that she faces. Although the book may at times appear slow-paced, I loved it and still think it is very accessible to anyone."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I would not so much say that this book is powerful more so than incredibly in depth. The author depicts her story in a very realistic manner, there is no idealism of how absolutely perfect India was before the Tannery had disrupted their life, nor did she over dramatize their affects to the viliage. It seemed to be a very down to earth book about what life in India was like. The struggles,the pain, and never really asking for better, or regreting what they did not have. These people lived day by day and survived. When one would die, the family would not fall apart in greif the though realize that they must go on in order to survive. Rukmani almost seemed to leave her fate in the hands of another, an unknown character, though at the same time she seemed so strong, and wise. Almost as if she knew what would happen in life would happen and to live one day at a time was the only thing that she could do about it until the day she too died."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"There are many different outlooks, or philosophies of life. Some are easy to understand and adopted by many, while others are unique and take a lot of inquisitive thinking. In the novel Nectar in a Sieve, Rukmani's philosophy of life begins to bloom in the reader's mind while she is speaking to her husband, Nathan. Nathan is telling Rukmani that she must accept the new tannery that is being built, including all the various people that will come with it. Rukmani angrily responds, \\"They may live in our midst but I can never accept them. . . .\\" Rukmani feels that she does not have to accept the things that life throws at her, she just has to deal with them. This is rightfully so, and the manner and grace in which Rukmani copes with certain situations through out the novel epitomizes her philosophy of life. Many situations that arose were centered within the family's rented farm. It started when the rains refused to fall, creating barren farmland. Aside from the fact that the ground was parched and cracked, Rukmani kept working her precious garden, and traveled a good distance every dusty day to a water source where she was allotted a small amount of the limited liquid. With the unavailing farmland, crops were non-existent, and there was no income for Nathan and Rukmani to pay rent on the land. However, the rent had to be paid, and Rukmani readily gathered pots, shirts, and even her wedding sari to sell at the market. She was successful in bringing home some money, but the family still ended up surrendering the farm. This was the farm that Nathan was completely devoted to, and where Rukmani had established her very own family! Yet, even with this disparaging reality, Rukmani packed what was left of her possessions and readied herself for the grueling journey ahead. Rukmani's heart and will to survive allowed her to not accept the misfortunes that besieged her, but instead gave her the strength to cope with them."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This book showed the courage of a woman who had dreams of one day marrying into a family of somewhat wealth.

Before I continue, let me inform you the definitions of nectar and sieve. Nectar is a sweet liquid secreted by flowers and are consumed by pollinators such as hummingbirds and insects. A sieve is a utensil for separating the finer and coarser parts of a pulverized substance. The first interpretation is that the main character in the story, Rukmani, used a sieve to try to capture all the sweetness out of her hard, miserable life and she somehow succeeded. The title shows how this brave Indian woman tries to get the best out of every challenge and never surrender to fate. The second interpretation, the one that I believe to be true, is that in Rukmani&iexcl;s depressing life she tried to capture the sweet nectar by using a sieve and the results were fruitless. All her hard work and her hope, represented by the nectar, slipped away bit by bit through the sieve. There are many evidences in the book that supports and chains my idea.Rukmani is the &iexcl;daughter of the village headman&iexcl; but due to the reason of the dowries of her four previous sisters and the Collector in the village who seized control, Rukmani&iexcl;s family &iexcl;could not find her a rich husband, so they married her to a tenant farmer who was poor in everything.&iexcl; Rukmani&iexcl;s social status drop suddenly from a daughter of a headman to a wife of a farmer and the marriage was considered as&iexcl; a poor match.&iexcl; Later, to her disappointment, she gave birth to a girl named Irawaddy, &iexcl;after one of the great rivers of Asia, who would take with her a dowry and leave nothing but a memory behind.&iexcl; Five years after the marriage of Irawaddy, she was returned to her parents for she is a &iexcl;barren women&iexcl;,&iexcl;a failure.&quot; As the story moves on, more unexpected events came and shatter Rukmani&iexcl;s life. She gave birth to more children and &iexcl;the resources have to be shared out in smaller and smaller portions. Finally, &iexcl;they no longer had milk in the house and curds and butter were beyond their means except on rare occasions.&iexcl; After their lives improve,&iexcl;the rains failed&iexcl; and &iexcl;the earth was parched to dust.&iexcl;Still,&iexcl;day after day the pitiless sun blazed down, scorching whatever still struggled to grow and baking the earth hard until at last it split and great irregular fissures paged in the land.&iexcl;To Rukmani&iexcl;s surprise, her beloved daughter, Irawaddy, tried to help the family financially by becoming a prostitute. As a result, she gave birth to an albino child as &iexcl;fair as a blossom&iexcl; and whose hair was the &iexcl;color of moonlight.&iexcl; It was a great humiliation to the family and the source of gossip around the neighborhood. Due to the problem with the lack of rain, another merciless impact hit Rumani, her &iexcl;last child, conceived in happiness at a time when the river ran gently, had been taken&iexcl; by death.These are just a few examples of obstacles such as poverty or disasters Rukmani encountered throughout her life. Many more heartrending events happened afterwards. To me, Rukmuni courageously used a sieve to try to capture the nectar, or precious objects in life but no matter how hard she tries, the sweetness seeps out and all that is left is bitterness and despair."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"The book started of incredibly boring.

The novel depicts Rukmani's ability to survive despite harsh effect of modernization. Firsty, I will start with the good points. Living in a modernized country that has a myriad of luxuries, and the book reveals that in other parts of the world life is not as luxurious. In fact, Rukmani suffers everything from the famines that devastate the family to the loss of her husband.This book had the potential of being one of the greats, but its weak plot line left much to be desired. The plot moved along slowly as expected events such as famine, a stretch of penury, and the death of the husband occured. Most of these were anticipated leaving little excitement or tension in the plot.Over all, this book almost perfectly demonstrates the effects of village life on the characters and gives me a reason to be grateful.

Excellent, sad book."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful novel that I've now read eight times, and I love it more with each reading. Markandaya really has a way with words, painting a vivid picture of what life is like in rural India, how wealth is decided by the season and weather, and how everything can be lost in an instant.In this circular novel, Rukmani tells her life story, beginning with a dream, then delving deep into the past, tracing her life from childhood to present, causing the reader to rejoice and cry alongside her as she reveals all in this heartbreaking yet triumphant novel. Having married young and leaving her family behind, Rukmani learns what it means to be the woman of the house, working the soil alongside her husband, praying for sons, and caring for those around her. Coming from wealth, her life is not what she expected, but her easy demeanor and good nature cause her never a grumble, making her a lovable character that the reader easily connects with, though we may never experience all the triumphs or tribulations that Ruku does.The fact that the story is so poignant and easy to follow, let alone interesting and intriguing, makes for a fast read, and though Rukmani's life is so vastly different from my own, I can't help but look up to her. She experiences vast heartache, but always comes back strong, making her twice the woman I am... The truths Markandaya presents in this novel are absolutely amazing and learning about Ruku's culture, her way of life, her happiness, and her sadness really presses upon me the importance of living each day to the fullest and focusing on the good in life, as Ruku does. I find that this is a very powerful novel and I strongly believe that all should read it."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"the book is in a good condition, no ripped pages except for a little tear in the bottom bind but its okit looks newthanks!"},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This is a powerful book.

(: Thank you for my book, especially since i need this for my honors class summer reading!"},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Set in some village in India, Kamala Markandaya's Nectar in a Sieve is a gripping story of one indefatigable woman's survival of a checkered life, one that had no margin for misfortune. Neither does the book have surprises nor twist, but readers will find a determined, unrelinquished fighter in a woman who bears an unfailing faith and rams through impregnable clamor that invades her life.Rukmani married Nathan, a tenant farmer whom she had never met, as a child bride. Even though Rukmani was ignorant of the simplest of tasks, Nathan never uttered a single cross word and gave an impatient look. He looked at her as if nobody had discovered her beauty. He never asserted his rights to forbid her reading and writing, a talent that placed Rukmani above her illiterate husband.Misfortune seemed to have a tight foothold in Rukmani and Nathan. The monsoon inundated the rice paddies where Rukmani worked side by side with Nathan to wrest a living for a household of eight. No sooner had the monsoon tapered off than a drought ravaged the harvest. Hope and fear acted like twin forces that tugged at them in one direction and another.Poverty-stricken Rukmani saw her daughter Ira become a prostitute, her 4-year-old son Kuti died from hunger, her teenage son Raja caught stealing and beaten to death, her oldest sons Thambi and Arjun set off to Ceylon to work in a tea plantation. The opening of a tannery, of which Rukmani was only skeptical, had spread like weeds and strangled whatever life grew in its way, changed the village beyond recognition.And yet, Rukmani survived. The interminable poverty and impregnable fate of Rukmani and Nathan must evoke in readers' pity and sympathy. But at the same time, Rukmani, whom Nathan always appeased, might seem somewhat self-piteous, cynical, and complaisant (like Dr. Kennington said, she needed to cry out for help). Ira, who exchanged her body for Kuti's milk and food, had lost her reason and given up her sanity rather than faced the truth.A recurring theme of the book is the significance of land that fostered life, spirits, happiness and family. Rukmani often found solace in the land on which her husband built a home for her with his own hands in the time he was waiting for her. She often reminisced the very home to which Nathan had brought her with pride. The land became her life:&quot;I looked about me at the land and it was life to my starving spirit. I felt the earth beneath my feet and wept for happiness.&quot; (188)So much was the book about Rukmani. The one character that stood out to me was Selvam, one of her younger son who flinched and quailed at the firecracker and used the money intended for firecracker to buy a confection cane. As wealth lured all his elder brothers away, he stayed behind and took care of his family, shouldered the household responsibilities while assisting in the village hospital.Nectar in a Sieve is a book that will make you lump in the throat. The writing is painfully eloquent, taut, and cut-to-the-root. The living conditions, life struggles, poverty, fragility and abasement of life depicted are beyond imaginations to those who live in the first world and have never stretch a single meal portion to three meals. Everyday was a life-and-death situation. 4.2 stars."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Read Nectar in a Sieve and understand what life is like at the bottom of the heap, with the \\"have nots\\" struggling for a handful of rice to get through another day. Struggling to raise children and grow crops on land they don't own, in a community whose traditions and character are on the brink of extermination by big-business. Read this book and take up the fight for social justice, job creation, and land reform. If anything, read to understand and feel how lesser fortunate people in this world of ours have lived, and continue to live.Though Necatar in a Sieve takes place in India and is about a rural family there, its themes are universally applicable, especially in these modern days of globalization and gentrification. Kamala Markandaya died in May of 2004 and it seems that the American press mostly ignored her passing, which is a shame because she is definitely a pioneer of a burgeoning Indo-European line of authors. Nectar in a Sieve has been on the reading list of many a high-school & college for decades now, and thus highly influential for thousands of American & European students past and present. And that's how I first came upon this little gem, in a college course on Eastern Religions, just before I visited India for myself. Though written/published in the early 1950's, I thought this book well crafted and insightful. I was better prepared for my own experiences of Southern India, feeling just a little wiser about life and the people I met there. Markandaya tells this story of the peasants Rukmani and her husband Nathan in a heart-felt, straight-forward manner with many picturesque passages creating an aura of beauty amidst hardship. Her love of the land is reflected in Rukmani & Nathan's joys growing rice and vegetables, raising children, and in their interactions with colorful characters from nearby villages. There are also vivid depictions of hunger, misfortune, anger, loss and sadness, which underly the harsh realities of this \\"fictional\\" novel.Although Kamala Markandaya was from India's Brahmin/upper-class and became an ex-pat in London, she certainly spent time around India's agrarian peoples and was obviously affected by their plight (she has written nine other novels dealing with similar subjects). As a novel, Nectar in a Sieve has a lyrical, romantic quality to it, which may account for its initial popularity here in the States, however, reading it in the 1990's and again more recently, I find it poignant and interesting. If there's any passage which sums up this novel, it may be the following:\\". . . We have no money. My husband can till and sow and reap with skill, but here there is no land. I can weave and spin, or plait matting, but there is no money for spindle, cotton or fibre. For where shall a man turn who has no money? Where can he go? Wide, wide world, but as narrow as the coins in your hand. Like a tethered goat, so far and not farther. Only money can make the rope stretch, only money.\\" - Ch. XXVIIAnd anyone who chastizes the author for emphasizing \\"money\\" here, probably has their head in the clouds (not to mention, a full stomach, and some property to boot) and is missing the point. This novel is about hope, and the hope that is necessary for people to strive for a better, more secure life, ONLY achieved through gainful employment and a stable income in a capitalist world. Where these opportunities don't exist, or barely exist, you will have thousands of Rukmanis, Nathans, Selvams, Pulis, etc. begging in your towns and cities. And thankfully, there will be other \\"Kamala Markandayas\\" to document their stories for those who are willing to open their eyes to the world around them."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This is the first novel of Ms. Markandaya, an Indian author living in England (she has written at least nine other novels). This novel, written in the first person, presents the life of a peasant woman living in a remote Hindu village in India. Since the village is never named nor is a year ever mentioned in the book, a number of commenters have suggested that the book represents the story of India herself, arising out of feudalism and through industrialization. One of the characters is an English physician, Kennington (called Kenny by the narrator), who often appears to exhibit compassion for the people yet continues to fail to understand them or their culture (nor does he ever appear to make a serious effort to learn). This is a criticism many have given toward the British rule of India. The book begins with the narrator, Rukmani, at an old age and near death. She begins her story with her wedding. She was the third daughter of a village head and, at the age of twelve, is married off to a tenant rice farmer named Nathan. Through births, deaths, prosperous times, and devastating times (such as times of famine and when they lose their farm and are forced to travel to the city with nothing to call their own), she and Nathan remain close and truly bonded together. Even at the time of her own death approaching, she still sees him (her husband had passed away earlier); he has never left her. The book also illustrates the importance of family and the support one should always get from family. It is an uplifting history of a poor, but intelligent, honest, and noble Indian woman."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"After reading this book, I felt like I knew Rukimani personally. Her grace, her inner beauty, her happiness and sorrows were a part of my life forever.It was sad to realize that her grace was often a product of having no choices. When she accepts her husband's shocking revelations (don't want to spoil it for you) it's not because she's the most level-headed, forgiving woman on earth - I mean - where is she going to go exactly? She has no choices and in her soul she knows it.Yet she still can find her life a better fate than that of others. There is a scene in which Ruki sells some of her vegetables to a wealthy muslim woman in a burka who has all the material things that Ruki lacks (I do not have the book in front of me I can remember her description of the woman's rings \\"any one of which would have fed us for a year\\"). But Ruki is not jealous - she feels sorry for the woman's cloistered existence and the fact that she is not free, cannot walk outside and feel the sun against her skin and work side-by-side with men. It was very interesting.I can envision Ruki buying the dum-dum cart for her grandson. I can picture her grandson in the shade, eyes watering, waiting for a chance to play with the others. I have seen many times the rupee that fell from Irawaddy's sari into the river. I have felt the hopeless struggle that cost her son his tannery job.This book is beautiful, sad, interesting, and moving. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"\`Nectar In A Sieve' joins the ranks of \`An Equal Music' and \`God of Small Things' as yet another treat by an Indian writer. For the beauty that it possesses, it is a remarkably simple narrative, tracing the life of an Indian woman Rukmani through changing times and fortunes.The novel beautifully portrays the life of people living by the land, of those whose fortunes are bound by it. This lot, unintelligent, earthbound and convention-ridden, living on the level of the basics, but even here, finding redemption, even here, despite resignation, suffering, death, loss, tragedy and disillusion, rejoicing in the compensations that land brings, living sometimes by them and sometimes for them. It follows the unsteady, unpredictable and uncontrollable rhythm of their lives. These people, with the land their only benefactor being lost to the wave of industrialization, live a life punctuated by poverty, illiteracy and stringent rituals and tempered only mildly by the blessings that the land ladles out from time to time. Their sorrows are great, their sufferings many , with little and rare joys between, but their hopes are high and their hearts large.Rukmani, like her lot, loses much to poverty but through the vicissitudes, stays positive and hopeful, never hardening to stoicism and never sinking into dull indifference. Generous in good times and foresighted and alert in leaner ones, she's modest in her rejoicings and uncomplaining in her suffering, bravely bracing tragedy and humbly welcoming joy, she acquires that peculiar Eastern grace that is compounded of resignation, composure and passivity.The woman's perspective becomes the narrative well as it required that extra degree of sensitivity and emotional intelligence that only a woman possesses. The story is told with beauty and restraint, narrated with as much fineness as the events unfold with crudeness. With a woman's sensitivity, she perceives the unseen and gleans the unsaid. Like a woman, with the fidelity that only an Eastern woman can know, she lives by the pledge of loyalty to her husband, home and family, always planning ahead, ensuring their comfort, sacrificing her joys for their needs. The books is a homage to her loyalty as it is a homage to a marriage that endures the worst, to the love that binds two hearts together.The narrative is sparse and pared, like the life of the people that it talks about. It's a monument to simplicity, with a distinct beauty that wrings poetry out of the prosaic and the sublime out of the mundane. Moving through joy and sorrow, bubbling over comedy and weeping over tragedy, it's a timeless tale of survival, hope and optimism. It has something of the quality of a fable, something of its timelessness; it's a story standing out of context, out of history and geography, a monument, an eternal reminder of a universal truth, of life __ \` an elemental book', of all that's quintessential and irreducible.In the final analysis, the novel is waif-like, like a poem said upon the breath, creating beauty, harmony, music and hope despite odds, finding it where none exists and always, hopeful and marching on."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This was a very good book for its time...a sort of &quot;The Good Earth&quot; with the setting in India instead of China. It seems a bit dated now, but still, the situations are entirely credible. I especially liked the character of Kenny, the English doctor who was alternately angered by the peasants' unquestioning acceptance of their fate and sympathetic to the point of sacrificing his own life to helping them. The main character came across as someone whose values were utterly admirable. She valued family, education, hard work and the beauty of the natural world.I was appalled at some of the insensitive reader reviews I read. Who are these people? Have they no understanding of the world? Do they not know that the vast majority of the world's population still suffers under many of the same conditions of poverty and enslavement to the caprices of nature and disease? I guess they have easy access to McDonald's for food and TV for entertainment.The writing was simple yet moving and the overall feeling was one of hope for the human condition."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Kamala Markandaya's novel of life in rural India is beautiful, as it is haunting.

Kamala's book is not about the tragedy of India; rather it is about the human spirit and how it survives against all odds. If you get a chance to read this book then do, it will probably change your life..."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar In A Sieve Written by: Kamala Markandaya Reviewed by: Suzannah GerberWritten in the early fifties, Nectar in a Sieve reflects a time of immense difficulty and change in India. The push for Indian independence from Britain was booming, and India suffered some of the worst, cultural, economic, climatic and social set backs they have ever known. This book is comprehensive to most novel-aged reading levels, and with good reason. The message of successful struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds is an age-old tale that diligently seeks out a wide range for its audience. Although graphic details are used, they enact a dramatic affect that is delightful and not gory or excessive. Immediately setting up the reader for a poignant tale of strife, Markandaya chooses the title and inscription for the book from the same Coleridge quote which reads &quot;Work without hope draws nectar in a sieve, and hope without an object can not live.&quot; That quote could theoretically be a credo for Rukmani, the protagonist of this story, who is an Indian girl is set up in an arranged marriage at 14, and begins a life of her own with her husband Nathan, on his rented plot of land. We see Rukmani's life unfold through the tumults of India's changes, among which high birth rate, industrialization, high poverty, and white occupancy play no small part. Early on, a tanning factory is built in their primitive village asserting the white presence as an immediate a relevant issue central to the novel. The affect of the newcomers sends the limbo-like message of an India dealing with white industry and Muslim labor migration. Quickly, the factory sets the former bartering village into unrest, as we see it directly responsible for the death of Rukmani's third son, Raja; the relative exile-of-necessity of her two eldest sons, Arjun and Thambi, and for cost inflation of the village produce and goods, such as rice, which were depended upon for survival. Although politics and international affairs aren't dealt with outright in the novel, social practices of a traditional India are discussed at great length. India is known to have a class system known as a caste, in which members of society are expected to fulfill certain roles and responsibilities in the society. To go against the caste meant risking shame and exclusion not only for yourself but for your entire family. Rukmani, whose father was a member of a once, but no longer, important local authority for a higher caste, must marry beneath her into the farming caste, resulting in only mild shame but the increased hardship of a life to which she is unprepared. Caste again becomes an issue when Rukmani's sons wish to enter into industry, which belongs to another section of the caste, to which Rukmani is skeptical for many reasons. The topic of bearing male children versus females is also one key to Indian life in this novel. Daughters need dowries, which often means a life of scrimping and saving for the family until it is time for her to marry, but also male children are needed to raise and manage the land so that subsistence can be maintained. Traditions concerning wedding ceremony, how to keep and cleanse the dead, family/gender roles and respect among the villagers are thematic concerns constant throughout the book shown top us in the inner dialogue and actions of Rukmani. The key conflict for Rukmani's family is money, especially the money to afford food. The extreme and relentless poverty that repeatedly sweeps the country throughout the course of this book is an issue of befuddlement for the central white character, a doctor named Kenny, who often expresses contempt for the Indian way of life. A certain Western arrogance is communicated from Kenny who disapproves of what he terms the &quot;Indian philosophy&quot; of suffering hardships in silence. However, suffering in silence is exactly what Rukmani perfects. While monsoons ravage, crops fail, a landlord exacts payment, and rain doesn't fall, Rukmani, the married mother of six maintains her faith in life and humanity. She sees her sons leave after a failed union organization attempt and in desperate need of assuaging hunger. She suffers the rejection of her daughter from her son-in-law after child bearing fails, then watches her later become a prostitute in an attempt to save the baby of the family, Kuti, ultimately failing, instead producing an illegitimate albino child with little chance for survival. Rukmani suffers the knowledge of her husband's philandery and ... child with her village rival Kunthi, and still finds the love within her to struggle on to happier days. Along the way, Kenny and Rukmani establish an interesting rapport (rumored to be an affair) that shows an interesting atmosphere concurrent to the Indian fifties. The introspective juxtaposition of a reluctant philanthropist and an innocent village woman tenses as they teach each other to respect the life of one another, both being lives of loss and maintenance for different reasons. Both Rukmani and Kenny are highly adaptive and private people, bent on expediently exacting their moral sense of duty. Through interactions with each other, however, they grow as people, becoming happier and more accepting of the unpreventable changes occurring all around them. Although rampant with melodrama, and a bevy of startling plot twists, Nectar In A Sieve tells a story that needs to be told about the brutal life conditions of India. Although the characters are made into heroes, and their dead into martyrs, this is a tragic life story with a hope that trickles through it, as the title foreshadows it would. Life is rampant throughout the book, even in its darkest moments, and hope corresponds; the hope that India will one day overcome the poverty, disease and famine still crippling its people. Nectar In A Sieve is written in quickly read British style English, acceptable for most ages, and comes with a glossary of Indian terms providing the story little snippets of Indian culture in its native language for colouring."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"The next time I think: &quot;I wish I could afford to get my second car fixed,&quot; I hope I'll think of how Rukmani and frail Nathan had to spend weeks working in a quarry to earn enough money just to be able to afford to pay someone to drive them on a cart so they could return to their home.The next time I hear a whining: &quot;Dad, how come I can't have $10 to buy another pack of Pokemon cards?&quot;, then I hope I think of starving Kuti, and how his sister had to turn to prostitution just to earn enough to put a little milk in his mouth.The next time I think: &quot;Why didn't I get a Christmas bonus this year?&quot;, I hope I'll think of Rukmani and her anguish over how to make a few handfuls of rice feed a family for a month.The next time I make a meal for my children, and after they've eaten, they all say: &quot;I'm full.&quot;, I hope I remember Rukmani, and how she and her brothers and sisters of India and the other lands where people are starving by the millions, would laugh and sing if they could have a tiny fraction of what most Americans take for granted.Markandaya's book was published in the 1950s.

The story follows Rukmani from her traditional marriage through the birth of her children and grandchildren.

Because of the obvious pattern it followed, he book became extremely predictable and thus even more boring, which I didn't think was possible.In conclusion, some may contend that Nectar in a Sieve is a 'beautiful masterpiece illustrating the hardships of life in third world countries', but I think it would be better characterized as 'a huge waste of paper.

Rukmani and her husband are poor tenant farmers. Through the years of their life they suffer many hardships: a greedy land lord, a sly money lender, hurricanes, droughts, and loss. Rukmani and Nathan start out with high hopes of one day owning their own land and having a family. Their hope started to wane with the first blow to their lives. A hurricane hit their small village and destroyed everything in sight. From then on, Rukmani struggled to feed her family. Then one day, something happened that would change their lives forever. A tannery was built. Over the years it claimed sons and the land they loved. Their family lived in extreme poverty. It eventually led their daughter into prostitution to feed her sickly brother. Nathan and Rukmani move to a big city desperate and starving. They work hard at a stone quarry during the day, and at night they go to the temple to eat. They wanted to earn enough money to go home and get back the land, because it was to the earth they truly belonged. One they way, they met an orphan child, Puli, who suffered from Leprosy. Even with steadfast optimism, it wasn't enough to get a happy ending. However, Rukmani does eventually reunite with her daughter and son back in their old village.Nectar in a Sieve has its ups and downs. I thought it started out boring and tedious. It wasn't until the very end that it got interesting. Rukmani, the main character is a simple, homely person. She is unable comprehend some concepts, which is understandable; she is an uneducated person from a third world country. She is optimistic and at the same time the most aggravating character I have ever read about. She was proud and didn't want to beg, so she sat by and watched her son die. Nothing interesting happens throughout the book until the end, when Rukmani and her husband get a reality check. Kenny, a white doctor from a different country, was the only one who seemed to have any sense in the book. I got just as aggravated as he did when he watched the people starve because they refuse to do anything about it. He tries to show Rukmani there is more to a simple life and that she has to do more than just sit around and just watch what happens.The story is completely redundant. The whole story is how many ways they can starve themselves. I might have liked the story better if Rukmani would have stood up for her family or herself, but instead she came off as arrogant and ingnorant. Its not that I'm insensitive to the hardships of other cultures, because it did enlighten to me how outside money can lead to inflation and ultimately the wipeout of rural villages. However, change happens, and Rukmani and her family did nothing to try to make the situation better. Instead, they starved, and it's with that I do not agree with. If it were my family, I would go to drastic measures to save them. The whole story is depressing and I had enormous pity for the family. Nothing ever seemed to go right for them.I'll give credit to the author though; the end of the book was moving and heartwarming. I'll even admit it brought tears to my eyes. I was only really disappointed in how long it took to get to the good part. I'll even give credit to the character Rukmani, despite her pride, she remained optimistic.

If you're around my age, you won't really enjoy this book. Trust me, I like reading, and this book doesn't come close to being one of my most favorite, or even one I would reccomend. It's basically too dull, and there really isn't anything in this book that's gripping.... (meaning, it doesn't hold your attention.) In other words, it's too boring. You can explain this book in less than 5 sentences. It starts out with a girl who has an arranged marriage with a guy name Nathan. They have many kids, and live off of everything they grow at the house. When time gets rough, the family hardly can survive, and sometimes have to live days without food. Many of the family members die, or move off somewhere else for better oppurtunities.This book isn't the type that wants you to keep reading. It's that type where you just want it to end.

This is however, not the case. Nectar in a Sieve is a classic tale of the epic tragedies and triumphs that we all share through life. The way Kamala Markandaya unfolds the story of a simple Indiana women as she travels through life has a magical pull to it that sucks you in and leaves you asking what is going to happen nextRukmanni is a young girl forced to marry at 12 to a farmer named Nathan. Together they moved to a new village and start their new life. Having a boy to carry the family name is one of the most important things in Indian culture, and At first Nathan and Rukmanni fail to conceive a boy and have a girl named Ira. Undaunted they try again and with some help they have 5 boys. As each new baby is born they plunge themselves in to debt. With no food or money, everything seems to turn against them.With out warning the giant iron beast of industry invaded the small sleepy village that Rukmanni and Nathan lived in and changed their lives forever. First, tons upon tons of workers came in to town and caused a lot of racket. Since those men came in to town, it caused all the prices to go up which meant that they couldn't afford to buy anything. Finally, two of her sons go to work at the massive tannery instead of helping their father on the fields. This causes Nathan much hardship. Then a few years later they get a visit from already-married off Ira to find out that she can't bear children. Worst of all there is a drought that kills the crops, and then if that wasn't bad enough, after that a mammoth flood utterly destroys their crops and most of the village. Through it all they get back up and get ready for the most terrible thing to happen to them."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve, a heart-warming story, written by Kamala Markandaya tells of the life and hardships faced by a family in India. Rukmani, a peasant and the main character in the story, was married at the age of twelve to a man whom she had never met or seen before in her life. Her husband, Nathan, was a humble tenant farmer who built a small mud hut or them to live in. Nathan was the son of a landless man therefore he did not inherit but had to rent a piece of land for them to live on . Rukmani was not used to this type of lifestyle because her father owned a piece of land and was also the head of the village. Unfortunately, Rukmani's three eldest sisters were married before her leaving her without a dowry. Rukmani considered that this was the best thing that ever happened to her as she said, \\" My husband was poor in everything but in love and care for me.\\"As the years passed Rukmani bore her first child and was saddened by the fact that it had been a little girl. Nathan had expected the child to be a boy who would help him tend the land \\"not a girl who would take a dowry with her and only leave memories behind.\\" Rukmani named her child Ira short for Irawaddy. After Irawaddy was born, it became difficult for Rukmani to become pregnant again so she sought the help of a foreigner named Kennington, Kenny for short. Kenny gave Rukmani treatment and later bore several sons. As Rukmain's children grew the whole family faced many hardships such as drought, starvation, death, and Ire turned to prostitution for a living. Rukmani thought that all of this was caused by a tannery that had been built in the village. This tannery also took their home away causing them to move out of the village leaving Irawaddy and one of their sons behind.I thought that this was a good book but not the best that I have read."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This book was phenomenol.

This book is captivating and naturally beautiful. It doesn't matter who you are or what books you like to read: \\"Nectar In A Sieve\\" is exceptional.

Rukmani and her husband, Nathan, suffer through hard times trying to find a time of peace in their life. Rukmani's family lives in a rented rice farm in a poor little village in India. The family lives in a mud house covered by palm leaves. The village is surrounded by a forest and the only road is a lonely reddish dirt road. The village is soon overrun by workers coming to construct a tannery. The small village quickly becomes a town after the tannery is constructed.Life in the town is hard for Rukmani's family. After the tannery arrives, prices for food rise and sales to locals go down. It is difficult for her family to have enough money to support their five children: Irawaddy, Thambi, Murugan, Raja, and Selvam. Also when drought strikes the area all of the crops are lost so the family begins to starve. After the drought, Thambi and Murugan leave to work in the city. Ira is wed to a wealthy man not long afterwards, but she cannot bear children. So, she returns. Raja died during the drought from malnutrition. Selvam started work in the town helping a well known foreigner trying to build a hospital. Rukmani and Nathan were getting kicked out of their house by the landlord because he was selling the land to the tannery. They went to look for Murugan but could not find him. In the end, Rukmani had to return home."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I read this book because my son had to read it for school (history) and found it to be moving and informative.

The first time I read it I was very moved by the hardships and trials faced by this woman of India. And I was impresed by her strong spirit and love for her family and country. The second time I read this book, I noticed more details, the undertones of depression and extreme starvation were apparent. I felt very guilty to have so much, while these beautiful characters, come to life through this book, were writhing in pain from hunger. I recently reread the book a third time and looked more closely at the plot. While some have suggested that it is drags on and on and appears meaningless, I suggest that this is exactly what the author is trying to portray. To Rukmani and her family, life does drag on and on. Life can seem meaningless and hopeless. But Markandaya offers a glimpse of sunlight through this dark theme - even though the flesh may die, the spirit lives on. Please take the time to reread this book and then share it with someone you know."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This book is the mark of the plight of women of earlier times- India's struggle with modernity and the unbelievable acts of woman for her family. The words were like liquid poetry, the words penetrated my conscience and my heart. I can no longer eat a full meal without thinking about Rukmani, the main character, and her struggles to survive over a few American dollars. It was sad and slapped me in the face that this book may explain the many starving lives in other countries. What touched me the most was the fact that this family DIDN'T DESERVE WHAT THEY GOT, yet they did not rebell nor did they stir. This novel also taught me many lessons about life- how it is so easy for us to survive in America and not see the conditions in other countries. I feel for this book and I love it. I don't understand why these other people gave this book such a low rating. They should give a reason instead saying that it was plain garbage. And I DO give a reason to my likings. Take my word for it...it is a wonderful book and every person, particularly mothers, should read it."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve, written in 1954, is surprisingly not the least bit dated. There are a number of core themes. Its primary resonance for me lay in the bond between this husband and wife, which ultimately left me feeling that despite their extraordinary trials, these people were at least as lucky as they were not. It is historically and more fundamentally a story set in a time when life in India was rapidly changing, modernizing. This couple's difficulties largely resulted from the introduction of industry to their town which made survival via the tradition of farming ultimately impossible. The hardships along the way are agonizing but the couple's devotion somehow makes the story more about hope than despair. Because I'd read this shortly after Kite Runner, I could not help comparing the two. This book did not leave me feeling emotionally played and abused as did the cheesy, keep laying it on ending in Kite Runner. This book is about desperation, let there be no misunderstanding, but it is a class act."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"In my point of view I enjoyed reading a novel that I could actually relate to. It made me think of the life style of people in india compared to my life style here in America. With my ethnicity being Indian I understood the Indian culture and how it works, but I didnt know that the culture effects the lifestyle of people. Being married so young forces a person to mature earlier than the expected age. Rukmani, the main character, experiences more in her life after marriage than before. To young people in America, we just want to have all the fun before we get married and not think about how we are going to get married. But for Rukmani, her parents were too poor to find a good husband for her, and as a [...] all she wanted was a good husband. Nathan, Rukmani's husband, certanily a good husband. He stayed and cared for her even when she thought she wasnt able to concive a child. Unlike Ira's husband who abandoned her because she was childless, Nathan repected Rukmani as his wife and loved her even more. So reading this novel has shown me many sides of poeple in the across the world and how a person's culture can effect a good life.Kamala Markandaya's style of writing is so unique from all the other authors I have read. She trys really hard to make the readers relate and actually feel the suffer for themselves. Kamala uses alot of descriptions but yet again she makes it simple and easy to understand. She gets deep into the writing without making it abstruse. Also Kamala has her own style of writing when it comes to punctuation and spelling. She spells many words as a typical Indian in India would use. Theres one thibg that I didnt quiet understand about the title, i didnt understand why she chose the title. I understand that Nectar has to go through a seive to become pure and clean. So I guess that relates to Rukmani's life, because she had to go through so much suffer in life to find happiness and become pure.Anyways my overall opinion for Nectar in a Seive is that it was great novel that I could relate to so much but yet again I learned so much from it. I really enjoyed reading this novel and i would recommend it to any type of reader.~Khusbu DesaiDorman High School (South Carolina)"},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"More Americans should be exposed to stories like this one, to get some sense of what LIFE means to the majority of people on earth. For me personally, it is very difficult to imagine having to struggle so intensely for a handful of rice to survive.

This is an emotional slide down the stairs-- you drop, level out a bit, drop again, level out again, etc. The whole book is one long whining, ... complaint about Rukmani's hardships. ...

The story became grueling, however, as nothing important happened. There is no resolution and no conflict worth caring about. It has gotten great reviews but as a line from the Fountainhead states: \\"What achievement is there for a critic in praising a good play? Non whatever...But if a critic is able to put over a perfectly worthless play-ah you do perceive the difference (470).\\" Here is a case where a lot of fuss has been made over a book that never should have made it to the schools nevermind a best seller's list. I am a very avid reader and I have read some amazing books. This was not one of them. There was little character development, so by the end you cared as much for Ruku as you did in the begining. It is about people just trying to survive. I know, that is all we can try to do right? Even if that is the case, it is nice to read about someone who does more than live, someone that you can look up to. If you loved Grapes of Wrath, read this book. If you couldn't finish Steinbeck, don't pick this up. Instead try a book that contains a real hero, not an anti-hero. If you don't know what an anti-hero is, read Death of a Salesman: Willy Loman is the epitome of anti-heroes.

There was no time for regret or compunction because survival took precedence over everything.

Furthermore, it is beyond our comprehension that people can and do survive in such instances. To me, this book has served as a tool to open the eyes of my sheltered students who prosper in a world where want and need are not a true part of their lives.

Beautiful and a must read."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Wow. Traveling along the main roads in India, I passed through several remote farming villages. I watched pregnant women in saris working in the giant daunting fields with many children at their feet, the small mud-straw huts in the background. For a brief moment, a woman here or there would glance up with large, dark, unblinking eyes and look into mine. Although fiction, Nectar in a Sieve is an amazing work that gave me a tiny glimpse into the stories behind those unflinching eyes."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Set in a small village locate somewhere in India, Kamala Markandaya's Nectar in a Sieve is a gripping novel that tells a story of a woman's struggle to find happiness and her own inner strength in a changing India. At the age of twelve, Rukmani was married off to a tenant farmer named Nathan, whom she had never met. Frightened at first, Rukmani soon adjusted to her new life as a farmer's wife. Over the years, Nathan and Rukmani's marriage becomes filled with love, compassion, and many children. It was not long until she found her self mingling with many of the women in her neighboring village. There she met Kali, a kind and cheerful woman who was kind enough to teach her how to perform her household duties. She also meets Kunthi, the village beauty and her friend Janaki. Unable to bear a son for quite some time, Rukmani became very depressed. Misfortune seemed to have found a great home in the lives of Rukmani and Nathan, causing as much problems as it could. A tannery built near their village would forever alter Rukmani's life, being that the change from an agricultural community to an industrial community frightens her. Unhappy and struck by poverty, Rukmani watched her first born child, Ira, go into prostitution, her son Kuti die of starvation, her teenage son Raja beat to death for stealing, and her two oldest sons, Thambi and Arjun set off to Ceylon to work in a tea plantation. Under such harsh conditions, Rukmani survived. Nectar in a Sieve is an influential, depressing, yet optimistic novel of a life lived out by one particular woman who will do just about anything and everything for her family."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"The novel Nectar in a Sieve by Kamala Markandaya follows the long and tragic life of a young woman, Rukmanni, who is thrown into this type of life at the early age of12. The book follows her from her wedding day until the end of the troubles she endures in her life.It is hard not to enjoy the strong and caring character of Rukmanni, who despite the troubles thrown to her, maintains a optimistic and controlled manner even in the worst circumstances. She is a wonderful wife and mother to her family ; she puts the well being of her children and husband before herself and would do anything to ensure there success. She also holds her friends and neighbors high, and help them when it is possible. When Rukmanni leaves to live with her husband Nathan in a small village, she meets the neighboring women, Kali, Janaki, and Kali. Their relationship, though it takes a turn later on, is kind and warm, since they are like a new family to here because she has moved far from her original home. In this new village she works on the rice fields with her husband. Though the land is not theirs, they live in a house near by.She enjoys her peaceful life until things start to change.First, a giant tannery is built in the middle of town, bringing in more people and noise to the once peaceful village. Rukmanni absolutely despises the tannery. Then two of her sons leave to work there. A few years later, they get a surprise visit from their already-married-off daughter, Ira. She has been unable to bear children for her husband, so he has decided to leave her. She is forced then to live with her mother and father, along with her younger brothers. Later, worst of all, their is a great flooding of the village. Their rice is destroyed and they go into poverty. The lack of food and money leads to the death's of their last two sons and her daughter prostituting to earn money to live. When there are first signs of fate turning good, even more troubles come their way. Despite all this, Rukmanni keeps her head and remains a strong and unbreakable spirit.All in all, this was a wonderful read. The book was very detailed and made you feel like you actually knew Rukmanni. Also, coming from a completely different lifestyle, I enjoyed learning about this cultures way of life and cultural values. It is not a very long book page wise, but it is a long story with many interesting events. Like all books, it is not a book for everyone, but if you enjoy historical fiction novels and tales of people who overcome their hardships to have a better life, you will absolutely love this book."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve, by Kamala Markandaya is the struggle between life and death in a poor society. The main character, Rukami, married Nathan, a tenant farmer. In her culture, to have a boy is the most important thing to any women and family. Rukami's first born was a girl named Ira. After many attempts to conceive a boy, Rukami needed someone to turn to for help. She turns to Kenny, a white doctor who assists and helps the people of her village. He helps her overcome her infertility and they become friends. Rukami and Nathan eventually conceived a son and named him Arjun. After him, Rukami has 5 more boys. With each birth, food becomes scarcer."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I first read this book as a 9th grader in 1971...The book had a powerful hold on my life. I list it as one of the books that have been forever etched in my memory. The struggles of this Indian woman prove the indefatigable spirit that is in each of us no matter our geopgraphy or our cirscumstances. The writing is powerful. The book unforgettable."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve, though written almost 50 years ago, remains a classic. The writing is beautiful and lyrical, and the story of Rukmani's hardships is painful and moving. Many readers complained that this book was &quot;too depressing&quot; or &quot;boring.&quot; Clearly, they missed out on the essence of the book. Yes, the book is not overburdened in plot, but it is the feelings of Indian life in a rural village, the feelings of a woman facing problems we can't even begin to concieve, the feelings of longing for a better world that make this book so touching. This book should give you an idea of India in the fifties, and the book's slow-moving style reflects that way of life. Don't be put off by others' reviews, my entire class loved this book when reading it for our history course. The book is in parts depressing, but life in India was very depressing, and Nectar doesn't wallow in the depression of the times like it could have, but has an undercurrent of hope for the future, picking up the pieces and moves on. Truly this book is amazing, and gives you the feel of India."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This book is amazing. I read it to qualify for a scholarship and ended up loving it. the author really helps you relate to the characters and especially Rukmai. This is a book that mothers, wives, and everyone in between should read. The insight on life, this book gives, allows the reader to look at his or her own lives and perhaps change for the better. The main character is a young women who has been married off to a middle age man she has never meet. She finds that despite difficulties her family has, her husband loves her unconditionally and will do whatever he can to please her. The book takes place in India, where droughts are very common. This is a problem for the family because they make a living from farming. Through out their marriage they have one daughter and many sons, who keep them on their toes. When it is time for their oldest sons to get a job they receive one at the tannery. This brings in good money but is kind of a disgrace because the sons do not follow in their fathers shoes. The tannery is also looked at as a sort of a disgrace, because it has made the village a noisy and has brought unwanted people. Soon the good times end and money is no longer abundant. This brings difficulties for the family, and challenges Rukmai's relationship with her husband and kids. This is an excellent book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"My teacher made me read this book because I am from India myself. It shows the hardships that Rukmani has to go through in order to survive. She has to deal with the death of her sons and the discrimination of her grandchild and has to see her own daughter becoming a prostitute to feed her own child. Even though I am 12, I would say children above 13 or 14 only should read this because 1) it might be too boring for younger children 2) This is more of an adult book in terms if it's situations. Nevertheless. it's a good book for cultural value. Read this if you can."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in the Sieve is an enchanting novel that tells the endearing story of one woman's perseverance in a changing India. I was surprised to see that it kept my interest from beginning to end. The storyline is a classic tale of how the protagonist is against overwhelming odds and has to survive through it all to find peace and happiness. Rukmani portrays our admirable heroine who endures many predicaments yet always keeps her optimism for the future.The story begins when an elderly and matured Rukmani begins to recall her past memories. Her world takes a sharp turn when she finds herself in an arranged marriage to the poor tenant farmer, Nathan. She takes on the responsibility of bringing up and caring for six children while working by her husband's side to salvage whatever the land has to offer. Times are rough especially when famine arises and dividing meager food rations into small portions is all the family can afford. Rukmani has a great deal of compassion but often does not get the chance to act upon it. She never really succeeds in overcoming her troubles but endures them as best as she can. In the Indian culture, people are taught that suffering through their problems by themselves cleanses the soul. This is the belief that strikes a cultural conflict between Rukmani and the British doctor, Kennington, who is bewildered at the fact that these villagers do not do something to solve their troubles and thinks that the villagers should ask for help when needed instead of wallowing around in despair. In naming the title \\"Nectar In Sieve\\", that choice of words foreshadows the plot: a life story following a string of melancholy events with hope straining to get through. Except the hope cannot present itself if no struggle for it is accomplished. From natural disasters, poverty, cultural barriers, death, and famine, life has dealt Rukmani some pretty hard times but she always makes an effort to make it through them because she has hope to keep her going on.Markandaya's writing was very descriptive and refreshingly dramatic without being excessive in its tragedies. She writes situations that are realistic and able to believe, which sets the realistic tone of the novel. The language used is simple and poetic at the same time. It is very well written in a way that the story is understandable to anybody who reads it. Nectar In the Sieve is filled with many triumphs and tragedies that are meant to touch the heart. It is far from boring and is probably capable of captivating anybody's attention. I could hardly put this book down and I'm sure you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This book tells the story (the melodramatic story) of a peasant, tenant farming family in rural India at the turn of the century. Rukmani, the main character, is a youngest daughter married off to a man she has never met. The marriage turns out to be a good one and the couple have many children. The family experiences unspeakable tragedy as a late monsoon and one son's involvement in labor organizing catapults them even deeper into poverty. It catalogues the absolute vulnerability of the poor in traditional society transitioning towards industrialization, and the anguish of losing everything for people who have almost nothing. The book was very melodramatic and depressing."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar in a Sieve is a tale of the courage of the human heart and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. It is a testimony of finding hope in hopelessness and the attempt to savor life's nectar and sweetness before it all inevitably slips away. Set in rural southern India, we meet Rukmani, a simple peasant woman who confronts life's misfortunes and challenges: poverty, disaster and death, with remarkable fortitude and courage. This is not a tale of oppression, machismo, addiction or religion. The Hindu concept of karma teaches us a greater lesson about our protagonist Rukmani. Karma is not about religion but rather is a spiritual or metaphysical philosophy that allows the reader to perhaps reconcile (Rukmani's) life's tragedies and tribulations. Rukmani's path to Nirvana is through severe hardship, and we discover that the meteoric rise of one's character and spirit is indeed through suffering."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"Nectar In A Sieve is easy reading, but a very hard story to grasp. It's sad to see how people in third world countries could suffer so much where they have to eat grass in order to survive. I admire Rukmani because throughout all her suffering and deaths in her family, she still maintains to have hope. I can't imagine how many people would have lived as far as she did without giving up or even dying? This book is very depressing, but a great story because it is a reality that many people are not aware of. I'm glad that there are authors like Kamala Markandaya to provide these stories for readers who ignore the miserable lifestyles of these families out there."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"I am 70 years old, and first read this book when I was a young woman. The story of Rukmani's incredible, and indomitable courage thoughout a life I can bearly imagine has stayed with me all these years. I was fortunate to find a copy being sold by the local library and have started to read it again. It is pitiful to read some of the shallow reviews here. I can only suppose the writer's to be very young and very immature. A gloomy story perhaps, but life affirming in every way. Love does survive... and sweetens even the most bitter of life's circumstances. Nectar in a Sieve is a true classic in my opinion and deserving of thoughtful reading."},{"Title":"Nectar in a Sieve","review":"This is a book that is worth some thought and reflection. Why? Well, at least for those of us living in a high-tech society (with time to write review for the internet), the first reaction to this book can be pretty horrifying. The poverty, the death, the lack of hope, the dung....I am so grateful to my book group for forcing a second look at the book. As we tried to shed our personal responses we found some interesting things. For example, though it is an arranged marriage, it's a much stronger and happier marriage than most portrayed in contemporary Western literature. Indeed, the family is rarely unhappy -- only when on the edge of starvation or other drastic items. Their lack of possessions doesn't seem to really bother them. Perhaps a good lesson in Simple Abundance for us all."},{"Title":"Twin Wishes (Fairweather, Book 2) (Love Inspired #96)","review":"Julianne lived a lonely life. There was just her and her goldfish, whom she didn't expect to live very long. Julianne came from a large family, which may explain why she had such a problem accepting the news that she would probably never be able to have her own child. After her boyfriend dumped her (because he couldn't handle being infertle), she was ready to accept that she would never marry...Along came Luke. The first time Luke's four year old motherless twins laid eyes on Julianne, they were all three in love with each other. It didn't take Luke long to see that his twins needed Julianne, and Julianne needed them. Now if only he could convince Julianne of that - and convince his heart, as well as Julianne, that he didn't need love...EVER!This was a sweet story. I especially enjoyed the ending.

But the story's charm is still undeniable, and there's something inherently pleasant about following the early life of a character who flouts conventions and lives entirely by his wits. &quot;Lazarillo&quot; is a forgotten gem, and one of the most influencial pieces of the Spanish Golden Age."},{"Title":"Snickerdoodle!

The next 20% is of males, and the final 20% are couples (gay, lesbian, and straight).The vast majority of the photographs are black & white and consist of young and beautiful models. There is such a variety of different images, and the same model is rarely used twice. Sexual overtones are definitely apparent throughout the book, along with a few closeups of genetalia.It is a short book (in terms of height) but it is also quite thick. The photographs take up each entire page and the only text is the artist name at the beginning of each new group of photographs."},{"Title":"Nudes: Indexxi (Photography)","review":"I came across this little book during one of my frequent trips to the photo section of my local Borders and had to pick it up. Mainly due to is very small size.I was soon trapped flipping through the hundreds and hundreds of pages of beautiful nude photographs, unable to put the book down.The only text in this book is a bit at the beginning and end and then the name of each photographer before you see their work. Thats it. No rambling text, just great nude photos.This collection feature many of the worlds best nude photographers and is broken down into three sections. Female nudes, Male nudes, and couple nudes. It really cant get much more simple that that.The book is printed on good gloss heavyweight paper, as you would expect to find in photo monographs and has a sturdy hardback.Although a great collection of photos and printed well, I am a bit disappointed in the book size. It only measures about 3inches by 3inches, and because of the large number of photos inside, the weight of the book tends to deteriorate the binding fast if viewed a lot. Also, I have found it hard to find a good place for this tiny book on my shelf. It just doesnt fit in very well. But becuase the book is so good and the downfalls are few, I only took one star.I still feel that all nude photography fans should purchase this book for their collection at its very cheap price."},{"Title":"Nudes: Indexxi (Photography)","review":"For such a small book -- it measures just over 5&quot;X5&quot; -- this holds a whole lot of great pictures. From the ordinary to the sensual, this book is worth looking at. It really made me want fruit (see pages 28 and 29)!However, for being a book based solely on perusing, the small size is rather off-putting. It's not the detail that gets lost in translation, but the impact. However, the perfect price for this lets me wholeheartedly recommend this title for those that are interested in photos of nudes."},{"Title":"Nudes: Indexxi (Photography)","review":"The book is small 5 x 5 and all the pictures are b&w.

This book portrays the nude body in its array of various shapes, sizes, color and texture which is represented by a variety of photographers. Some of my favorite photographs were by Ricardo Miras, Enric Aromi, Christian Maury, Gunter Knop, Yuri Dojc, Robert Chouraki, Pascal Baetens, Kingdom19, Carlos Quiroz, Pedro Avellaned, JAM Montoya and Stanley Stellar. The majority of the prints are black & white or sepia tones and the full size of the page. This book is under 1000 pages and printed on quality paper, it's a nice addition to my growing collection.The book is divided into three unequal sections: women, men and couples. There is a wide range of artistic interpretation ranging from abstract, portrait, sensual and erotic among the various mediums depicted. There weren't many artists that stood apart from the other photographs in the book with the exception of the artists mentioned above. I noticed a repetition of various themes, the only difference was a different model giving a feel of sameness to most of the book.One of the things that makes this book stand out from other nude photography books is photography director, Lidia Carbonell desire to establish a visual dialogue between the artist and the observer as mentioned at the beginning of the book. The contact information for each of the photographers is provided at the end of the book which is a nice touch, but considering the book was published in 2003 most of the contact numbers may be out of date."},{"Title":"Nudes: Indexxi (Photography)","review":"I loved this book!

In the last one she wrote a business novel about King Arthur mentoring someone across time on virtual teams. A quick and entertaining read, it delivered a good message, but lacked the practical application I look for.In her new book, Bionic eTeamwork, she has abandoned the business novel and gone to telling stories of successful eteams that have really achieved extraordinary results. Her theme is similar (the importance of the human element), but she seems a lot more inclusive of the technology. As she states at the beginning &quot;we have the technology&quot; ala Steve Austin and she goes on to tell us we need to humanize the way we use it.I'm more of a left brained person so let me tell you what I really like about this book. Whenever I go through a business book I like to highlight it and then I pull all the highlights out and type them out for later review (sort of my own cliffnotes). Almost every page has a a sentence or two of an important statement on the margin in a grey box. Basically she has done it for me. Just by reading this you get the jist of what the message is and after you've read the book, you've got a quick review.The message is still keep the humanity going, but she has added some features I really found useful. Almost every chapter has one or more summaries entitled &quot;Things you can do today to...&quot; or &quot;eteamwork Checklist.&quot; From these we get such suggestions as &quot;Designate a technology champion&quot; to &quot;stop trying to collaborate by e-mail with attachments. Those methods are in the Dark Ages. Get up to speed with Adobe Acrobat Exchange.&quot; In summary, you have a quick easy read with a lot of practical advice."},{"Title":"BIONIC eTeamwork","review":"Bionic eTeamwork carves new ground for me. Dr. Kostner has proven herself knowledgeable and well connected, given the array of businesses who have shared their stories with her. Her access to how teams in the virtual age have succeeded is very useful.Her main point is: technology without the human element can never reach its potential. But if we merge human priorities with technology, you can achieve the &quot;super&quot; leverage of the bionic. Not all of us will be Steve Austins, obviously, but we can certainly use this book to make our team collaborations much more effective -- faster.Another significant point is the challenge of speed - how can distance teams work as fast as teams sitting within the same conference room? Dr. Kostner shows how distance teams can achieve at least the same speed of decision making and collaboration as on site groups - and may even work with greater productivity.Dr. Kostner's style is well paced - she gives down to earth, doable guidance. This is a must read for leaders and team contributors who are looking to up their own ante in terms of their collaboration and team effectiveness."},{"Title":"Determinants and Their Applications in Mathematical Physics","review":"This book, as usual by the excellent Springer publishers, continues the trend launched by the Clifford algebra people (Lounesto, Chisholm, Baylis, Pezzaglia, Okubo, Benn, etc. - see reviews of some of them), namely, to SIMPLIFY the mathematics of physics by using appropriate ALGEBRAIC techniques rather than geometry or calculus or other techniques. Both this book by Vein and Dale and the Clifford algebra books and papers use algebra in physics largely to replace hard to manipulate geometry and unwieldly matrices. A matrix is an algebraic quantity, but it is very hard to handle: it is essentially a table of numbers, for example a table of people's heights, or people's heights by weights. You add tables by adding corresponding positions in each table, and likewise for subtracting, while multiplication is much more complicated. However, as Vein and Dale show, you can replace many results in physics which involve matrices by DETERMINANTS. A determinant is a single number, typically, which is gotten by combining the numbers of the matrix table in a certain way given by a formula. Thus, replacing a matrix by a determinant means replacing a table by a single number. It turns out that the Einstein Equation(s) of general relativity can be solved in this way (for the axially symmetric field), and likewise for equations involving solitary waves (Kadomtsev-Petashvili equation), waves in a rotating fluid (Benjamin-Ono equation), etc. An important tool in this process is Backlund transformations, which are described in the appendix but are more thoroughly described in the 1989 book of Bluman and Kumei which (together with their journal publications) initiated much of the simplification of differential equations of the modern era. That book, as you may guess, was also published by Springer/Springer-Verlag."},{"Title":"President Roosevelt and the coming of the war, 1941;: A study in appearances and realities","review":"Every society needs a Charles A. Beard. He is one of those critical thinkers who knows better than what his government is telling him. In this book, we learn what we all suspected: The attacks on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese was not only not a surprise, but they were in fact, provoked. Beard turns up governmental documented evidence that FDR had a cabinet meeting in the last week of November, 1941 and said the following: We are at war. Expect the Japanese to attack as early as December 1 (they attacked on the 7th). But we must maneuver them into firing the first shot. The rest is...history. Albeit re-written history. It is essential that the American people understand the implications here. The American Corporate State has the power to commit any crime of any magnitude and get by with it because they control, through their affiliated elitist groups, the mainstream media. All the proles know is what they are told. Big Brother tells you to ignore the evidence of your eyes and ears. Hopefully, now that you know the truth behind Pearl Harbor, you will be better able to separate fact from myth when it comes to all the other major events in our US history. They're pretty much all frauds."},{"Title":"Shoot for the Star","review":"Fans of the Dallas Cowboys will love this down-to-earth story of one of their greatest heroes, Bill Bates, but anyone who follows pro football can enjoy this inspirational story. Bates begins by describing how he had always wanted to be a Cowboy and goes into detail about how he never allowed anyone to derail him from his dream of wearing the star on his helmet, even when he is bypassed in the NFL draft. His hard work and determination enabled him to carve out a long career as a special teams standout and starting safety despite being labelled &quot;too slow&quot; to play professionally and having to prove himself all over again with each new coach.The book is exceptionally readable, and Bates is candid with both his emotions and opinions. Even if you're not a Dallas fan, and I'm not, you can't help but cheer for Bill Bates at each twist and turn his career takes. The story at times seems more than a little corny, but it is a nice antidote for the image of spoiled pro athletes that is so prevalent these days."},{"Title":"Shoot for the Star","review":"The story of Bill Bates is a story of overcoming the odds. What I found to separate this tale from other sports stories is that Bates provides great insight into his thought-process during the events of his life. He was the thinking man's football player. He changed with the team and with the game, constantly staying one step ahead and anticipating and filling the need on the Cowboys.He doesn't just tell us that he overcame a serious leg injury. He tells us how he overcame it, what goals he had and what his thought process was. It was fascinating to read how he viewed things.Often times the best sports stories are told by players who weren't huge stars. Bates was on a team of huge stars, but he certainly had his moments to shine and he candidly shares these moments with us.This is an interesting book, covering and balancing his personallife with his professional life."},{"Title":"Shoot for the Star","review":"This is a great book if you are a fan of Bill Bates or the Dallas Cowboys.

In The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present, Martin V. Melosi studies water supply, wastewater, and solid-waste-disposal systems in U.S. cities from the colonial era to the present day. Along the way, Melosi discusses not only changing technologies and the expanding population but also growing public health awareness and ecological theories. He shows how the social beliefs and scientific understandings that emerged over time influenced how Americans have viewed waste and sanitation in urban life and how they came to accept workable solutions to the problems of sanitation, water delivery, and waste removal.Ambitious and comprehensive, The Sanitary City incorporates an exhaustive supply of sources, from popular accounts and journalism to scholarly histories in the fields of technology and urban growth to congressional reports and legislative studies. It will appeal to scholars, students, and professionals in environmental history, urban studies, the history of science and technology, public health, and American government.Reviews\\"Martin Melosi's The Sanitary City is a substantial work of scholarship that provides a highly useful history of the development and consequences of urban water, sewer, and solid waste infrastructure in the United States.

The author, now deceased, had a degree in theology, a doctorate in psychology and taught at Union College, Schenectady, N. Y.The book began as a doctoral thesis. Subsequently, he was encouraged to expand upon its theme and it's expansion, he once told me, extended over a fourteen year period. Basically, it is a psychological, not a theological, interpretation of those teachings commonly known as the Beatitudes.It is Dr. Ligon's thesis that, if one truly lives a life psychologically grounded on these teachings, that person will enjoy good mentalhealth regardless of his or her external circumstances. He very accurately defines, or so it seems to me, the true, psychologicalmeaning of meekness, of mourning, of being merciful and pure in heart. As he states, &quot;Happy (instead of Blessed) are the peacemakers...&quot;; happy are those that are persecuted.... Strange happiness indeed, but his interpretation is very convincing.Some will find the book not to their liking because Dr. Ligon does not spare those who promote psychologically false doctrines even those that are of a seemingly religious nature. As far as I am concerned this is a masterpiece and will, as long as I am among the quick and not the dead, be in my library. You too should be so fortunate."},{"Title":"Science Shams & Bible Bloopers","review":"This book is a brilliant and masterfully-written work. For this 36-year-old mother of three, this book was a priceless investment in my children&#65533;s education and future. I mainly purchased the book for its critical (and delightfully hilarious) analysis of fundamentalist religion and right-wing extremism, but I was pleasantly surprised to discover a rich treasury of material on public education, homeschooling, child-rearing, psychology, and even an eye-opening chapter on the dubious claims of chiropractors. The book is almost 400 pages, and I learned something intriguing and useful on literally every page. It was a delight to read! The author, David Mills, displays an Asimov-like comprehension of the wide diversity of sciences with which we must deal in the 21st century. He debunks all the popular pseudosciences and the conservative hypocrites who espouse and promote them. If you are an open-minded person, you will not be disappointed with this book. My only complaint is that the promotional material for this book does not give justice to the wealth of information and entertainment the book provides for the reader. Tami Noble &#65533; Houston, Texas"},{"Title":"Science Shams & Bible Bloopers","review":"In his book, *Science Shams &amp; Bible Bloopers*, David Mills covers a wide variety of topics in common sense, easy-to-read fashion. This is a must read for those weary of dry theological discourse or wordy scientific jargon which only those &quot;in the know&quot; can understand. Mills addresses everything from the geologic column to homeschooling; from chiropractic to the existence of hell, all in a simple yet fulfilling manner.Mills discusses many of the arguments posited as proof of God and shows that they prove no such thing. And rather than just rejecting arguments for theism, Mills offers explanations for the universe's existence and &quot;beauty of nature&quot; that are at least as plausible as those of creationists, in fact perhaps more so.My lone complaint is that some may perceive Mills as a man with an axe to grind with religion; perhaps a more conciliatory tone toward Christians would be more effective when discussing some topics. Overall, however, the book is excellent and a must for all those who want common sense advice on many important topics."},{"Title":"Science Shams & Bible Bloopers","review":"I've noticed that this book seems to touch a conservative nerve.

Every page was clearly articulated.My favorite two sections dealt with police misuse of forensic evidence -- which is definitely a growing problem -- and the section rebutting fundamentalist Creation Science.

I would recommend it to anyone interested in rational thinking and in arming yourself against the charlatans of pseudoscience.Chapter 2 of this book, \\"Overcoming Self-Esteem,\\" has become a popular patient handout for clients of Albert Ellis' Rational-Emotive-Behavior-Therapy.

No longer are we forced to live in the dark with ideals being passed from &quot;above&quot;.

His views, while seemingly unique, fall in line with what he seems to like to avoid, conformity. Only his conformity is not to a fundamentalist regime, but to an untra beyond liberal regime instead. I am highly dissappointed that a father could relay such pessimism and unrealism to the world (or at least the small one that reads this book) and lead a child into beliefs that will lead her hopeless. While many atheists have non-religious morality, Mr. Mills apparently needs to grow in this area. His proud writing leaves much to be desired.

Although some of Spinrad's short stories should have won the Nebula, this book was not Nebula material. There are a number of flaws in the book and it is extremely dated if read today, and several of the main characters seem to speak in the same way and in the same cadence.Even so, Spinrad is a remarable writer and almost anything he has written is worth reading. Barron was one of the new wave novels of the late sixties, early seventies and has a place in sf history. Spinrad's shorter works were the best in the field but his novels, I thought, never reached the high quality of his short stories, but they are still worth reading."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"...this work was dated, it is dated in its language, it is dated in the world view that it presented, but it is perhaps most dated in presenting a \\"media\\" figure who has retained some morality and who refuses to completely sell out to the powers to be.In a nut shell, a once powerful leader of a left leaning political group has sold out his ideals, to become the host of the best rating current affairs show in America.

Given that dual citizenship, and the fact that not only my close friends but any number of passing acquaintances -- not to mention more than a few absolute strangers! -- have been either lent or given books from my collection, I occasionally find myself being asked about other genre writers, and where a novice would best begin exploring their works. (Yes, sometimes this is in the hope of sidelining my enthusiasm by making copious notes and then escaping on pretext of finding a bookstore, in lieu of buying me a drink. I'd like to believe that it is also, at least on select occasions, borne out of genuine interest.)Norman Spinrad is an author whose stories I've been asked about on numerous instances, by readers and aspiring young authors alike, and my advice has never wavered: Begin with BUG JACK BARON, and follow up with THE LAST HURRAH OF THE GOLDEN HORDE.

There's a single plot line and that's it. Over time readers have demanded more and more intricate and complex plots and subplots, and books that don't rise to that challenge seem dull in comparison. I think that's why it took so long for me to read Bug Jack Barron. You have Howards the rich evil guy trying to pull one over on America, and you have Barron the media celebrity with a direct line to the public standing in his way; and that's the whole of conflict in the entire story.So while an interesting read as far as seeing the ideas Spinrad had and the world he's created, unless you're going to pick this up just to check another off your 'classics' list, go with something fresher."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Not what I consider science fiction.

But just like any cultural craze, a few specimens have long-term staying power, as long as future readers can get past the crusty slang and political references. This 1969 offering from Norman Spinrad, his fourth novel and the one that really made his name, sometimes threatens to collapse under creaky hipster dialogue and the social paranoia of its times. But underneath is a brilliantly constructed political thriller in a (then-) near future.The promise of immortality leads to a massive power struggle between a corrupt plutocrat and the title character, a self-righteous media manipulator whose attack-dog style is a downright eerie premonition of the O'Reillys that the real world has since delivered. (But at least Barron eventually develops a bit of a conscience.) Spinrad concocted an equally impressive exploration of the bleak future possibilities of around-the-clock media saturation and image-obsessed politics, and also delivered winning messages on the true natures of power and inequality. In 1969, such messages were in Spinrad's near future and are now in our near past. While some aspects of this book are definitely showing their age, the underlying messages of techno-political corruption and social paranoia are timeless, not to mention expertly constructed in this relentlessly brutal story.

Spinrad understands the direction our purient privacy denying society twenty years before we arrived in our current sorry state.If anything, reading this book you often forget when he was writing because the society he describes is seemingly so famil"},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"This is a great pre-cyberpunk novel. The main character, Jack Barron, is a TV journalist. His nemesis and arch-villain is one rich and ruthless industrial. He enjoys picking on that guy, and playing the part of the chivalrous, 1st amendment fanatic journalist. No problem...Then, one day, he for a change decides to run with a different story: someone has apparently been ... hmm ... buying young children from poor, very poor families... Over the course of a few weeks, Jack Barron will discover how those events are connected, who is behind all that (you have one guess...) and what is the goal behind them (do you like the idea of dying? Just asking...)Then, he will be face with the ultimate challenge... What exactly is the price of his silence?A very good book, much better written than many other Spinrad books (he's a little bit too weird for my taste, at times...) A great read."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"What a fun book. Norman Spinrad certainly has a vibrant mind. I don't much like subversives in real life but the main character in this book is a hoot! Now I have to figure out what else Spinrad has written so I can see if there's something even better. Get it, read it, enjoy."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Spinrad kicks the media, politicians and corporations where it hurts, and leaves the reader laughing until it hurts. Apparently denounced as depraved on the floor of parliament, beneath the toungue in cheek it's a disturbing discourse on the corrupting nature of money and power, in a world where your bank balance decides whether you will be granted life eternal. Comment on the power of media is prescient, with the title character's eponymous TV talk show's grip on the masses the only thing in the way of the nefarious plans of a mad, necrophobic billionare who throws gobs of money at private research into cryogenics and immortality, and is willing to go to any lengths to get his sinister 'freezer bill' through congress, and avert 'a million years of worm eaten nothingness'. The title character is so laid back he's teetering, aided by Spinrad's ear for slick dialogue. His wonderful pre-emptive speech in the presence of political heavies about cutting to the chase through the standard smoke-filled room rhetoric and double talk schtick is side splitting. The 'near-future' setting is somewhat dated but this matters little against the searing satire and shamelessly wicked characters. The ending was a little abrubt and unsatisfying, but this is a minor quibble against an SF classic."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"This is not a book to read as if it is still new. This is a book to understand as an alternate history that begins at a point in what is now our past.It is, simply, amazing, and has held up incredibly well. In today's age of Enron and Halliburton, Bug Jack Barron should be in everyone's collection, and more importantly, in the backs of our minds....WWJD, baby? What would Jack Do?"},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"A book written to impress adolescents of the 60s? I think not. This is one of the most prophetic novels I've read. Originally published New World's magazine, I've noticed a huge trend in the writers for that publication predicting Reagan's presidency. How did they know? One thing I've noticed about all futuristic novels, is they never factor in different storage media, be it tape or floppy. Now that cloning is a reality, the screenplay for this would have to be severely adapted to make the SF horror a reality. Mostly, I enjoyed the portrayal of the media, government, greed, bloodlust for immortality, image vs leadership, and the influence of money on each. Read this, and ask yourself if you would have done the same thing in Jack Barron's shoes."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"In a near future setting, a controversial media commentator is ourprotagonist.

He realisesthat longevity treatments are possible, but only by illegalorganlegging of children.Jack must make the difficult choice of whether to throw in with them, or expose them."},{"Title":"Bug Jack Barron","review":"Spinrad's first major novel was deeply controversial for its time (1969), and has some eerily prophetic shadows of our present culture. The hero, star of a TV show that's a cross between Nightline and Jerry Springer, uses his position in a high-stakes poker game of power, politics, and medical immortality. As can be expected, the references are outdated and Spinrad's vision of the near future from 1969 is hardly 20/20; the plot itself is somewhat linear and predictable. Nevertheless, Spinrad's extraordinarily vivid writing style, unique to this novel and almost Pynchon-esque in its imagery, make this novel one to reread over the years in order to resample the savor of the work. A must-read for television fans and critics alike"},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","review":"Maya simply extols the WOMAN. She is effortlessly eloquent and each word is perfectly selected to fit.

Written by world-renowned author, Maya Angelou, this short rhyme gets to the heart of any woman's individuality and celebrates the phenomenal differences in all of us. Phenomenal Woman is an anthem of women's strength in their own womanhood. The message resonates with women everywhere. \\"Look at me!\\" it says quite plainly. \\"I am beautiful in my strength, in whatever shape that is mine.\\" Black, White, Asian, Hispanic... the message is applicable to all of us who are phenomenal woman.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.Buy a copy for all the phenomenal women in your life! Personalize a message in the inside cover. They'll cherish it for years to come."},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","review":"Angelou writes with defiance and directness. Her lines have a simplicity and strength. She is writing of her own personal experience as a black woman but also most clearly she is writing of the history, the struggles and sufferings of her people. This is most apparent here in the Grandmother poem in which no matter how difficult the experiences the archetyapal black grandmother endures she stands on her own and refuses to be moved. In another of the poems the defiance is as an expression of her feminine sexuality, of her being phenomenally a woman. In another a working woman attests to the integrity of her own life against the vast show of fraud and wasteful wealth around her.Angelou writes inspirational poetry in which the power of the feeling and the strength of the conviction capture the reader."},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","review":"I have been a fan of Maya Angelou for years; she is truly a phenomenal woman! I could never convince my mother to read her work, so I got her this for Christmas. She is now a fan! Not only of the poem, but the art work as well. This is a wonderful gift for any woman you admire!"},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","review":"This volume of poetry contains four inspirational and empowering poems for women of all races, religions, backgrounds, and education levels. Maya Angelou is such a wonderful role for all people; men, women, and children. She is not only a best-selling poet and novelist, but she is an educator, actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian. This volume speaks to her extraordinary gift for writing from the heart and lifting the spirit with every graceful word. Each poem in this series is one of inspiration and conviction. They all foster a feeling of pride, confidence, and spirituality.My personal favorite in this collection is \\"Still I Rise.\\" I heard this poem for the first time when film and Broadway actress Cicely Tyson visited my college in Murfreesboro, TN back in 2003 and recited it to an auditorium full of hopeful students preparing to tackle the world. That was where my love of Maya Angelou's work began. \\"Still I Rise\\" spoke to me as a woman, as a student, and as an American. \\"Still I Rise\\" promotes perseverance against life's obstacles, being confident in your own skin and embracing your differences, taking pride in your ancestry, and striving for spiritual richness. She writes in the last two powerful stanzas, \\"Out of the huts of history's shame/ I rise/ Up from a past that's rooted in pain/ I rise/ I'm a black ocean, leaping in wide/ Welling and swelling I bear in the tide...Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave/ I am the dream and the hope of the slave/ I rise/ I rise/ I rise.\\" This poem is so incredibly inspirational regardless of race, sex, and religion because it is about persevering through obstacles and keeping hope, holding true to yourself and your faith.The other poems in this collection, \\"Phenomenal Woman,\\" \\"Weekend Glory,\\" and \\"Our Grandmothers\\" are all rooted with Angelou's wisdom and remarkable gift to inspire. \\"Phenomenal Woman\\" is also such a treasure. This poem teaches women to embrace their inner beauty and to have confidence no matter the color of their skin or the shape and size of their bodies. This empowering poem teaches that your most attractive quality others see in you is your confidence. \\"Men themselves have wondered what they see in me/ They try so much/ But they can't touch/ My inner mystery.\\"This is a small book, but packs a lot of soul and spirit that transcends beyond race or sex. I highly recommend this amazingly uplifting volume of poetry by Maya Angelou, a truly \\"phenomenal\\" woman."},{"Title":"PHENOMENAL WOMAN.","review":"Maya Angelou's book \\"Phenomenal Woman\\" is a celebration of women regardless of race, creed, or color. The poems contained between the covers of this small but powerful book articulate the strength and beauty of womanhood. I display the book on my coffee table along with other books.

The piece pays tribute to the indomitable spirit of the brave women ... particularly women of color who have been marginalized because of their looks. However, this book is enhanced by art that displays the diversity of these amazing women... and as such, I think it makes a unique gift.

I have really enjoyed listening to this product, and was happy that they came in 2 CDs, one for pregnancy and one just for the birth. I used the 1st CD throughout my 2nd and 3rd trimesters, and just started the 2nd CD. I really like the guided imagery and background music. I listen to it daily and have to admit I have fallen asleep to the sound of her voice sometimes. I definitely feel these CDs help with all that chatter in my mind and allow me to relax and let go of my worries for a while; great CD!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I purchased this CD because it received so many great reviews from mothers on different websites.

As soon as I get pregnant, I'll be listening to this CD in preparation for childbirth."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I had heard this CD in my lamaze class and loved it. I found it on Amazon and it helped me tremendously. I had a beautiful natural childbirth. It was my first baby and my mom who has had six of us said it was the most peaceful amazing birth she's ever seen. She said I did better than she did on ANY of her deliveries. The Lamaze class and breathing techniques also helped during the contractions but the CD really helped me especially with sleeping between contractions. I used it to fall asleep to for a couple weeks before the baby was born so when I used it during delivery it made me go right back to that state of mind."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"Being on bed rest, I've been needing all the help I can get keeping my mind clear of stress and in a good place.

It's the only thing I have calming enough to listen to to put me to sleep--my doula (birth coach) said that's a great thing, actually, b/c that means it will relax me druing labor. When I'm not super tired the words for the childbirth part are very inspiring. That's really the only CD of the 2 disc set I listened to since I'm due any day now. I listen to it just about every day. But author/narrator says even if the first time you listen to it is during labor that would be helpful, and I agree!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I was not sure what to expect with this set. I wanted something that would help me relax during delivery and I figured the best time to start was before the baby was born. I got the set yesterday and have listened to the pregnancy CD only. I am sure the childbirth cd will be just as helpful. Today I feel very relaxed and calm. Because of this cd set I plan to purchase other Health Journey CD's. The music in the background on this cd is very nice. I bought another meditation cd on iTunes that was highly recommended and the music was so annoying I could not relax. This one is nice and as others have said Belleruth's voice is also very pleasant and calming. I would recommend this cd to any pregnant woman. I wish I had had it when I was in my first trimester and dealing with the early stressors of pregnancy. I am also into yoga and truly believe that you can do a lot with your breathing. That is kind of key to these cd's so if you are not into that and do not have an open mind about it these may not be for you.

Her guided imagery and affirmations had immensely helped me cope w/ the mental (eg: anxiety, excitement, fears, etc...) and physical (eg: aches, cramps, etc...) aspects of pregnancy.

I only listened to these for labor prep, and did not listen during labor itself, but that was perfect for me because I went into labor without fear or preconceptions, and was able to come through it med-free and without any interventions.Also, to the reviewer who said this contains a \\"be your own God/god\\" kind of message - I have NO idea where she got that from. Each time I listened to these tracks I tried to understand where she could get that from, but never figured it out. Please don't be deterred because of that review. I'm confident these CDs will be an asset to your birth experience."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"These CD's are great supporting material for mothers to be.Wonderful guided imagery associated with calming and relaxing music."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I bought a few different relaxation CDs to compliment my hypnobirthing class but I found this one to be the most new age type quackery.

But as I'm not familiar with American voices it was not relaxing for me."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"Belleruth's series is a wonderful set of tools that I highly recommend. I remember how much I appreciated it when my therapist gave me a set of these tapes because I was having so much trouble relaxing and learning to meditate. I used to spend my time worrying about how I wasen't relaxed enough! I found this particular series to be very accessible and pleasant. Belleruth's voice has a kind and maternal tone that lulls you easily into a meditative state. As a psychologist, I believe that relaxation and mediation can have strong impact on our health, but I am often turned off by whats out there for people to use. I like this series because the imagery is not too directive (for example, she dosen't direct the listener towards specific tasks like trying to smell the ocean or laying on a cloud etc.). The pregnancy imagery is so nice, and really helpful when youre feeling tired, stressed, and uncomfortable, which is a lot of the time when youre pregnant. I think this series is great for professional mental health therapists and would make a nice gift for preganant moms and partners."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I cannot say enough positive things about Belleruth Naparstek's guided imagery and affirmations. In fact, I used her Help for Infertility when my husband and I were sent to a specialist and were told that we couldn't get pregnant on our own. Surprise! We did - without any help from our new doctor! I gave birth to a healthy, alert, baby girl -- no drugs, no epidural, and no episiotomy - just Belleruth Naparstek's soothing voice guiding me. My doctor even patted my shoulder afterward and said, \\"I have to tell you, I'm impressed...and I don't impress easily.\\" Our little girl, whose name means Miracle, was 8lbs, 4ozs. at birth. I had the most unforgettable childbirth experience thanks to this wonderful set! Hospital staff were amazed, my mother and husband in awe! They were truly a Godsend!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I used the tapes with my first pregnancy and LOVED both the imagery and affirmations. I used the birthing affirmations during delivery and had a wonderful experience. I was thrilled to find that it was now available on CD... the imagery and the affirmations for the pregnancy CD are the same as the tape, but the birthing CD contains 45min of music instead of the affirmations! It still has the birthing guided imagery, but the affirmations are much more helpful during actual labor since they just play in the background and do not require your full concentration."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I loved these tapes! I was familiar with Belleruth &amp; had used some of her other tapes &amp; thought I'd try these when I was pregnant. I used these for two pregnancies. They really helped ease my discomfort &amp; helped me get to sleep at night. I had my first daughter completely natural, all the while listening to Belleruth's soothing voice. I know that this guided imagery made all the difference in my childbirth experience. I've actually bought these for a gift for a pregnant friend! She also loved them!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I bought this CD too late to use the pregnancy CD effectively, so I just used the Labor and Delivery CD for the last three weeks of my pregnancy. It became my twice a day ritual that I truly looked forward to and even my husband loved falling asleep to it at night. Bellruth has a really relaxing voice and the messages of the CD are affirming and non judgmental. When it came time for my labor, I used this CD at home when my contractions started getting more serious. We brought this CD and a few other musical CDs to the hospital and initially I listened to the music, then when I started going into transition, all I wanted to hear in the background was Bellruth's CD. It must have played over and over at least 10 times. This was really important in helping me to relax my muscles and keep breathing during contractions, my nurses, midwives and doula were all very impressed. I had the delivery that I had really hoped for, all natural with lots of help and support. This CD was a big part of that. I can't recommend it strongly enough."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I loved the pregnancy cd and I did not care for the childbirth cd. She has a very soothing voice, the background music is perfect and her guidance is excellent for the pregnancy meditations. I thought her childbirth cd lacked a lot of guidance and didn't provide the support I needed to get through the really intense contractions. I think if your looking for cd to help you get through labor and delivery this isn't it. However this is a must for all pregnant women, its a wonderful break from everyday stress and introduces many positive thoughts."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I bought this CD set and listened to it throughout the last half or so of my pregnancy. I had so much trouble sleeping and was still working- I was willing to try anything to get more rest. I listened to them every night. They did the trick every time!I wanted a natural childbirth, but I ended up with pre-eclamsia. Although I had to be induced, I honestly think I owe thees CD's in large part for my avoidance of a c-section- they helped me stay as relaxed as possible under the scary circumstances.I highly recommend them- I listened to them the whole time I was in labor and nurses were always commenting on how relaxed I would get.Good luck ladies!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"I started to listen to this CD in the last month of my pregnancy. (every night) I alternated between this CD and Blissful Birth by Glenn Harrold. During labor I was just relaxing. Yes, that is correct...relaxing...my epidural was going strong and I was leveled at 5 cm. with no progress for 4 hours. I decided to pop in this CD. Within 5 minutes, my contractions were going wild, the nurse came flying in to check my charts. I asked her if I should stop listening, and she said, \\"No. Keep listening!\\" Within 15 minutes I progressed to 10 cm. and within 15 more minutes, my baby was born. I really think this CD caused my mind to kick start everything! It is AMAZING what the mind can do!"},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"Not only did I enjoy this tape, It made my home birth go wonderfully! I listened to it daily for a large part of my pregnancy. Found that on days that I didn't listen I was more emotional and hormonal. As long as I took 30 min. to listen either morning or night, I was a very calm pregnant lady with a wonderfully positive home birth as a result. Her voice is lovely."},{"Title":"Meditations To Support A Healthy Pregnancy & Successful Childbirth (A Two Tape Set)","review":"Though i have wonderful midwives / doctors and nurses supporting me in my pregnancy at the hospital- I bought many of the pregnancy meditation and hypnobirthing cds out there because i was also interested in some non-medical/ spiritual support for my childbirth experience. I wanted to make sure in the hustle and bustle of it all- i remembered that its pretty amazing creating a new life and all that. This CD was by far the best one that i found- it builds your confidence- connects you with your unborn child and reminds you about the miracle of childbirth. I think every pregnant woman would love this CD. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Mash Goes to San Francisco","review":"After &quot;MASH&quot; &amp; &quot;MASH Goes to Maine,&quot; Richard Hooker &quot;took on a collaborator&quot;, William E. Butterworth, for a series of &quot;MASH Goes to...&quot; books.The first two MASH books are basically collections of short stories with a very loose structure. The Butterworth books are sitcom novels... and not very good ones.After the Butterworth series was played out, Hooker released &quot;MASH Mania,&quot; which was a loosely structured series of short stories about the Swampmen in middle-age -- a rock-ribbed Republican middle-age, in fact, amazing though that may be to fans of the TV series, which Hooker hated. Although this book has politics opposite to my own, it's still funny and more importantly, Hooker WROTE IT.From the completely different writing styles involved, I'd say that if Hooker ever even SAW what Butterworth wrote, it was to say, &quot;Yeah, ok. I'll approve that.&quot;I like Hooker's writing; so I felt rather manipulated by the Butterworth MASH books, which to my mind are Hooker's in name only."},{"Title":"Mash Goes to San Francisco","review":"The 10th book in the MASH Goes To Series. SF is a madcap adventure to the Bay City."},{"Title":"Exploring Christian Thought: Nelson's Christian Cornerstone Series","review":"This is a wonderful survey of Christian Theological Thought from ancient times to the present. Tony Lane writes in an engaging style and hits all of the high points. The various (100 or so) Theologians discussed have their ideas exemplified by short pertinent quotations. Although each discussion is, by necessity, short, I found this volume to be an invaluable reference in my own Theological studies as a way of putting into perspective various periods, issues, etc. that I was only peripherally studying.Well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Exploring Christian Thought: Nelson's Christian Cornerstone Series","review":"I'm almost finished with this book, but I've already been recommending this book to people. Although this book has a good deal of church history, it is not a church history book so it may be helpful to supplement your reading with another good church history book. (My favorite is \\"Church History In Plain Language\\" by Bruce Shelleyhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0849938619/103-1572103-3320655or if that's too long for you, a nice supplemental reference is Zondervan's \\"Chronological and Background Charts of Church History\\" by Robert Waltonhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0310362814/ref=sib_rdr_dp/103-1572103-3320655although that one is not a good stand alone church history reference.)Any ways, Tony Lane is great at encapsulating key people and events in church history and explaining how they significantly contributed to the different aspects of Christian beliefs as well as their contribution at different points in history. You'll read about the discussions through the ages from issues regarding the trinity and the reliability of scripture to others like the role of communion and baptism. The events and people are grouped in logical sections, although you won't always find them in chronological order, which is fine if you pay attention to the dates.Tony also does a good job of presenting the different sides of various debates as fairly as possible. However, he's also not afraid to interject his own judgement calls when absolutely necessary. I especially appreciated this aspect of this book because it can be difficult to know which side of which debate to believe without a third party's opinion. This is a tough balance to hold, but I think Tony does a great job because even during those rare instances when he interjects his judgement call, he gives clear reasons why based on insights from other Christians in church history. Even then, you as the reader are equipped to make your own decisions based on the material.Another great aspect of the book is that almost every chapter has excerpts from the actual writings of either the person or from the event discussed. The only thing that I can think of that would make this book better is if it had an index to reference different topics, places, and people."},{"Title":"Exploring Christian Thought: Nelson's Christian Cornerstone Series","review":"This book came really fast after the order was placed.

With the possible acception of the chapter on the CMC, Shambaugh provides little in the way of original insight and the rest of the book simply rehashes material that could be found in tons of better books like You Ji's the Armed Forces of China, or RAND's The PLA as Organization, which frankly are very good investments.Furthermore, Shambaugh's book is full of mistakes, including on p.1 where he states that the US use of B-1 bombers was critical to the destruction of Iraq during Desert Storm, which would be news to the US as the B-1 wasn't introduced in combat until Afghanistan. There are also examples of ships being misidentified in pictures. Not a good example of serious scholarly work.The one good thing that I can say about this book is that the footnotes are incredible.For a scholar as respected as Shambaugh who spent a decade or two on this, Modernizing China's Military was a really disappointing book,"},{"Title":"Modernizing China's Military: Progress, Problems, and Prospects (A Philip E.

There's a certain delicacy, about death, and strife, and the drinking of wine. Durrell is well spoken and well informed: you might think, like I did, that the story of Cyprus isn't politically relevant. But I only thought that because I'm an ignorant American, and because I had yet to read this lovely book."},{"Title":"Bitter Lemons of Cyprus (Csa Travelling Companion S.)","review":"Lawrence (Larry) Durrell was Public Relations Officer for the British Government on the island colony of Cyprus. As a reporter I knew him well. In Bitter Lemons Larry narrates his personal observations of a way of life rapidly disappearing, the Colonial Empire. Colorful cottages, crusader castles, Byzantine abbeys, picnics with ouzo and commanderia under the olive trees, and the characters -- British, Greek and Turkish Cypriots with their sometimes lovable, sometimes negative peculiarities, but very human idiosyncracies.

In short, this is not a book one would want to read to obtain an idea of the geopolitical dimensions or counter-insurgency or even the domestic politics of Cyprus during this time. The strength of the book is the author's writing style and the \\"impressionistic\\" emotions surrounding his fictional trip to Cyprus. Most of the emotions stem not from major geopolitical events but in day to day encounters he has with the population and his various interactions with them. Nearly all of this are very basic but convey, like Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, the \\"feel\\" and emotions surrounding these interactions and the author's observations.

The characters (other than the two sleuths) were uniformly unlikeable, even repulsive. And those were the characters we were supposed to like! The pace was glacial, the dialog uninspired. Even the usually amusing Ariadne Oliver was more idiotic than entertaining here. I skimmed and skipped to get to the end.

This is not a factor in the plot and does not distract from it, but it may disconcert some viewers.A woman arrives in Poirot's office saying she wants to be \\"saved\\" and \\"may\\" have killed someone. She leaves in a huff declaring that Poirot is too old to help her. Both statements and her behavior are strange; they intrigue Poirot, and he decides to uncover what is bothering her.He discovers that his friend, a female crime novelist, calls her the third girl because she is the third female to join two others in renting an apartment. He also learns that an elderly woman was found dead in the apartment building. The police think that she committed suicide, but Poirot is convinced that she was murdered. The woman died of a knife wound. The third girl had found her mother when she was a child who had committed suicide on the girl's birthday. Her mother also died of a knife wound, and she inherited a large fortune. Her father, who had abandoned her and her mother, reappeared from Australia about two years ago. He insists that she is mentally disturbed. One of her roommates agrees.Viewers will want to discover the identity of the dead elderly woman. Who was she? Why was she killed or committed suicide? Did the third girl kill her as she believes? Is the death related in any way to her money? Is she really insane?

Most are good, but have slow beginnings."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"This book, first published in 1966, gives us a very different look at London than the wonderful novels Christie wrote in the 40's did. Poirot amongst the swinging Bohemians? Well, it happens. Christie and Poirot both changed with the times and the result is interesting, although probably not her best work.The term &quot;third girl&quot; refers to a way of leasing flats, very similar to the term &quot;roommates&quot; in the US. One girl rents a flat, then advertises for a second and third girl to share accommodations and expenses.Ariadne Oliver once more assists Poirot in this tale of impersonation, drugs, smuggling, forgery, blackmail, and a young girl who can't remember committing a murder.This is a great commentary on English life in the sixties and, as always, excellent plotting and character development in the Christie tradition."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Another classic by Agatha Christie. The settingis very much 60's-ish, but I've never minded thatAgatha's books are set solidly in the era they arewritten in.Only bad part, it can be a bit hard to keep all the characters straight. But without many characters, it wouldn't be much of a mystery would it? Agatha does a good job of reviewing the clues in the book through, preventing you from having to keep track of them in a notebook."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Third Girl is a late Agatha Christie murder mystery novel being published in 1966. It would make a fine introduction to Christie and Poirot for someone who has never perused one of Dame Agatha's many novels.The Plot: A young plain girl named Norma Restarick knocks on the door of Hercule Poirot's quarters one fine morning when the Belgian detective is enjoying a superb breakfast. Norma tells Poirot she believes she has murdered someone but cannot remember the heinous act. Norma lives with two other young women in a London flat.These women are named: Claudia Reece Hollland and Frances Carey. Claudia is a well organized person who works for Norma's father who is a wealthy businessman; Frances is a socialite who works at an art gallery and pals around with beatniks. Her boyfried is David Baker whose nickname is the \\"Peacock.\\" He has a record of petty crime and dresses like a Regency buck. Norma's stepmother Mary was almost poisoned to death with weed killer. A middle-aged woman in the apartment flat where the three girls live jumps out of a window. Who pushed her out of the window?A young Doctor named Stillingfleet falls in love with Norma. He seeks to prove her innocent of murder. Poirot is ably assisted in this case by Ariadne Oliver a detective novelist who closely resembles Agatha Christie. The plot deals with drugs, forgery, false identity and murder. It is an intriguing case showing Agatha Christie could produce a top notch murder mystery into the 1960s.I picked up this novel feeling blue one Saturday morning and read it in one day. It cheered me up as I marveled at the ability of Christie to tell a great story featuring two of my favorite of her characters: Poirot and Olvier. Marvelous fun!"},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Most readers agree that \\"Third Girl\\" is not one of Agatha Christie's best. Nevertheless, it is well worth reading.The plot is clever (but with significant flaws); the characters good; the writing starts out excellent -- sharp and with Miss Christie's light-hearted, often self-depreciating humor -- but about a quarter of the way through the book it gets wordy and what humor remains seems strained.In other Hercule Poirot books, we do not get a glimpse of his thought processes until he explains everything in the last chapter. Here we get the opportunity to see him struggling, almost dispirited, as he tries to make sense of all the information he has received. I admire Miss Christie for her willingness to experiment, but I think the result was unfortunate.Don't concern yourself that \\"Third Girl\\" is not among the most memorable of the Hercule Poirot books. Just read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"By the time Third Girl came out, in 1966, even the author recognized that her books were not as good as they used to be. Christie's alter ego, the scatty mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, plays a large role in Third Girl, and in one scene Mrs. Oliver addresses an imaginary publisher about her latest manuscript: \\"There you are, and I hope you like it! *I* don't. I think it's *lousy*!\\" One can imagine that Christie is addressing her reading public through Mrs. Oliver.Nevertheless, even with Christie's powers on the wane, Third Girl is an agreeable read, a comfortable book for an afternoon spent on the couch by the fire. It begins with an idea that is most intriguing: a young woman comes to Poirot and is not sure if she has committed a murder or not. Of course, we all have to wonder, how is it possible that she does not know? There are a few twists and turns and there is also Christie's take on life in the early sixties, which is interesting in itself.Unfortunately, Third Girl lacks the crisp writing that can be found in many of Christie's earlier books. The dialogue rambles, and both Poirot and Oliver and even some of the other characters sound like garrulous, disapproving old ladies. There may even be some holes in the plot: How did Poirot get Restarick's stationery? And why had Norma never seen the earlier portrait? Still, Third Girl is a pleasant way to spend the afternoon, especially if you're already familiar with many of her other novels. But I recommend that you don't begin with this book."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"THIRD GIRL has an ending that always surprises me, andI must have read the book ten times or more, the plot if so complex I can only barely remember how it comes out. I feel the book is a greta evocation of Swinging London of the 1960s and that it should have been filmed back then, maybe with the following cast, Rita Tushingham as poor Norma Restarick; Tom Courtenay as Dr. Stillingfleet, her psychiatrist who falls in love with her; Vanessa Redgrave could have played Frances Cary; Terence Stamp could have been David Baker, the \\"Peacock.\\"I wonder if Christie ws thinking back to her own early vocal training when she gave NORMA and LOUISE their names, because of course they were famous French operas at the time Christie was studying in Paris. \\"Louise\\" was written by Charpentier, and that becomes her last name, a coincidence no one remarks about in the novel itself.It is a book in which Christie seems to be reviewing her own astonishing career. Mrs. Oliver suggests that she might write a book in which a child commits a murder: \\"Not meaning to, but just by her father telling her to give her mother a drink made of pounded up box hedge,\\" thus neatly conflating the plots of two much earlier novels from the 1950s, CROOKED HOUSE and A POCKETFUL OF RYE. I thought also the glamorous fresco painted on the living room wall of the flat where the three girls live, a harlequin leaping into space, harked back to one of Christie's famous characters, Harley Quin from THE MYSTERIOUS MR. QUIN and may have provoked Christie to think further about Quin, because as we know she was soon to return to him after not having written about him for 30 years, in THE HARLEQUIN TEA SET."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"This novel, written in the 60s, is not, in my opinion, one of her best. The three stars, however, is a Christie rating. It is still better than a lot of modern mysteries out there. My main problem was the vagueness at the beginning of the book, which led to temporary confusion as to who the third girl actually was. The writer Ariadne Oliver is also a vague character (and annoying). Christie does a valiant job trying to reflect the Beatnik era and obviously did her homework on the drugs du jour. Still, the overall work lacks coherence. Like Poirot, I was well and truly stumped (much time is given to the detective's mental processes). When the ins and outs of the mystery were finally revealed, much of it seemed far-fetched. I much preferredSleeping Murder, a Miss Marple mystery, andThey Came to Baghdad."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"A young woman rudely barges into Hercule Poirot's residence claiming that she may have murdered someone. Before the Belgian sleuth can gather further information, the young lady leaves opining that Poirot is too old to be of any assistance. Disturbed and unsatisfied, Poirot tracks down the young lady and finds out, first things first, what mystery needs solving and then solves it.In many ways this book is very typical of Agatha Christie. The book relies not on action, but on gradually presenting the reader with information, including a number of blind alleys and red herrings, and then providing a rational resolution of the many facts. The setting and peopling of the book is, however, quite different from many of Christie's works. Much like Poirot in the book, it appears that Ms. Christie is trying to show her readers that older does not mean incapable of accurately observing the world. Ms. Christie drops us in 1960's London, peeking into the world of modern apartment living, avant garde art and young folks in general. Indeed, I don't recall meeting a single parson in this book. Third Girl is a fine Agatha Christie deductive mystery with a refreshing change of scenery."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"I had forgotten that Hercule Poirot was solving crimes way past the between-the-wars golden age of detective fiction. Third Girl is set in swinging London of the mid-sixties - think Twiggy, Carnaby Street, etc.. The detective and the author are equally bemused by the changes in society. Hercule Poirot was eccentric back in the day, but in the 60s, with his giant waxed moustache, he's outlandish. When the Third Girl of the title looks up M. Poirot, she blurts out \\"You're too old!\\" and takes off.Poirot, of course, prevails with the help of his friend the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, and an extensive Rolodex including people who have more of a grip on modern problems. Still, the problems of murder are timeless and I certainly never guessed \\"who done it\\" although I at least picked up some of the clues.If you love a classic murder mystery and want to sample a 60's period piece, you will enjoy Third Girl."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Some have considered this the worst Agatha Christie mystery. I would not go anywhere near that far. I did enjoy this story. It has its moments, such as Poirot wanting there to have been a murder. The ending completely caught me by surprise, but as usual with Christie, I felt there were enough clues given so the reader felt he could have figured it out.I will admit -- I did find the Mrs. Oliver character a bit annoying. I also feel the romance at the end was a bit contrived. Thus, I can see why some people aren't thrilled with this book. So I would read some other reviews to help determine if this is the Christie book you need to read next."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Back in the day, many years ago, reading an Agatha Christie was must reading. After reading John Curran'a book Agatha Christie's secret notebooks, I decided to re-visit Hercule Poirot. So far I have read 30 and the third girl ranks amoung the top 25. Red herrings, mystery,a story line that keeps you guessing and of course Hercule with his friend Mrs Oliver, (she is Agatha Christie's ulta ego). A missing girl, who claims she shot someone, or so she thinks, and her friends think nothing about not seeing her for days, including her family. When Agatha wrote this book it was in the '30's, and still today it is timeless. Did she kill someone, is she really missing, and why did she think Hercule was to old to help her?"},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"I've been a Christie fan since 8th grade and have read them all so many times that I always remember whodunit. Nevertheless, I find them a relaxing and enjoyable read when I'm taking a break from more weighty fiction.This book features two of my favorites- Hercules Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. When a young girl comes to see Poirot and confesses she might have committed a murder before running out claiming he was too old to help her, Poirot is on the case. As he tracks down the identity of the girl and searches for a death that might fit the bill, Mrs. Oliver add bits and pieces of important information that help him solve the case. The final solution is one I never saw coming (the first time I read the book at least)- a very satisfying mystery indeed!"},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"It is one of the best mysteries she's written. Even HP won't reveal what he's done to us until the very end."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Agatha Christie offers her readers a strange little mystery. A young woman shows up at Hercule Poirot's door and insists that she thinks that she has committed murder. True to most Christie mystery books, the author brings in a half dozen or so of interesting suspects all with their own possible motives and quirks. In this particular plot, however, Christie spends some time showing Poirot's own particular way of laying out all the facts in front of him like an imaginary puzzle. He is vexed to no end in his pursuit of the missing pattern...missing papers, paintings, a Peacock, a travel-happy father, a alcoholic woman who throws herself (or is pushed?) from a balcony, etc. The ever-confident Ariadne Oliver shows up to help out our hero in uncovering the specifics. Georges, Poirots' manservant, and Miss Lemon, his secretary, also show up in this volume of the Poirot series. This mystery is a bit slower than some of the greater and more classic Christie mysteries, but having the opportunity to scrutinize the fastidiousness of the Belgian detective's mind will satisfy most serious Poirot fans."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. The plot was pretty complex and hard to figure out, and I was surprised by the ending, all of which I love. I enjoy most Christie novels because they are \\"cozy\\" mysteries. However, this one was not so cozy. Usually the people in her books act very differently from people today. They act like ladies and gentlemen, with old fashioned manners and style of dress, and are concerned about things like honor and reputation. This novel dealt with young people doing drugs, having affairs, and dressing in the grunge style, and there was a bit of espionage. So while it was entertaining, it was not much of an escape for me."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"I'm currently a bit hooked on classic mysteries (blame it on PBS's 'Mystery' series), and looking through my horde of books, I found Agatha Christie's \\"Third Girl\\", a 1966 work featuring Christie's famed Hercule Poirot. What is immediately striking is the setting of the novel; mod 1966 England, an odd place for Poirot who is, at least on TV, ususally associated with the 1930s and '40s. Also unexpected is Christie's kind narrative which is an impressive unbiased view of the era's youth drug culture; she speaks of junkiedom as if it were a passing teen fad, as serious or frivolous as any other era'a hang-ups. In \\"Third Girl\\", a young girl arrives in Poirot's office and announces she may have committed a murder. She disappears before Poirot can find out anything else regarding her bizarre statement and he spends the bulk of the novel searching for her and deciphering what she meant. Although there are a series of mini-who done its throughout the book, the question really is, \\"Say what?\\" I suspect hard core fans of the genre will confidentally figure this mystery out before it's conclusion, but I was over taxed with clues, and the resolution and the path leading up to it are a bit hokey, and reliant on extremely unlikely coincidences, facts and answers seem to fall at our detective's feet, and even though the final answer is like a product in an exquisite math equation, it is still a trick question. That's ok though, it's not so much the mystery which attracts me to the genre, particularly Christie's work; it's her heroes, their mannerisms and idiosyncracies, their minds, their friends, their homes and homes away from home, like Miss Marple reading Dashiel Hammett over a cup of tea when a gunshot is heard, or Hercule Poirot delving into a chocolate layered desert while paging through an art book on French paintings, when suddenly it occurs to him who the killer must be, and he calls everybody into the room to name the murderer. I like answers in a real world of little resolve."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Hercule Poirot has just completed his analysis of great writers of detective fiction when he is interrupted by Miss Restarick, an unimpressive lass of twenty or so with long straggly hair. The young girl starts by explaining that she might have killed someone, but before Poirot can ask more information, she says she's changed her mind and must leave. Before she closes the door, she adds \\"You are too old. Nobody told me you were so old... I'm really very sorry.\\" Poirot is intrigued by the girl, and enlists Mrs. Oliver's help in investigating Miss Restarick. The detective duo soon discovers that not only is the girl nowhere to be found, but that no one seems to care that she is missing.In his thirtieth appearance in a novel, Hercule Poirot is claimed to be too old. But that is surely not what the reader will think of the author's wit and cleverness. At the age of seventy-five Agatha Christie still succeeds in composing a quite entertaining mystery. Admittedly The Third Girl is not one of her masterpieces, but it still has the basic ingredients of a good detective story. The things that have changed more dramatically, in comparison to the novels she wrote in the 30's, are the flamboyant characters that make up the story. It is clear that Agatha Christie does not totally agree with the way teenagers are beginning to behave in the sixties. All they seem interested in is \\"sniffing snow\\", \\"swallowing LSD\\" and \\"using hemp\\". Surely, this is an exaggeration in which Agatha Christie reveals slowly losing touch with modern age.Nevertheless Poirot is as absurd and as able as ever, which pulls this story out of the pool of mediocrity. And be warned: the book starts of with a vital clue, so try to avoid reading the denouement while blaming yourself: \\"I should have known it!\\""},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Third Girl is one of Agatha Christie's slower paced books. It rambles on and on about the same things over and over again. If some of the middle had been cut out, the book might have been a lot better.In the middle, I got so bored that I started counting the pages until the end. Usually with Agatha Christie, you just can't put the book down. With this one, I just wanted to finish it to find out who the murderer is.If you've read many of Agatha Christie's books, you might want to read this, but you shouldn't read this one first. I suggest The Secret Adversary for a more fast paced and exciting read."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Agatha Christie attempts to depict the swinging sixties, and falls on her face. The mystery is interesting enough, and, as usual, the solution to is discovered not through forensics but through analyzing the pyschological undercurrents of the situation. (The &quot;third girl&quot; idea is used very cleverly, I thought.) On the other hand, Christie writes about swinging London from an outsider's perspective, and she clearly doesn't know what she's talking about when it comes to drugs, so some parts of the book are laughable. Still, unlike many novelists who jumped on the hippie bandwagon, she's compassionate and doesn't go for the cheap shots -- the villain isn't a drug-crazed hippie but a person with more traditional (and despicable) motives. Worth reading in spite of its flaws."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Winter had come for Agatha Christie's writing career, and although she was still penning diverting little mysteries in the 1960s, it was clear that her best work was behind her. Indeed, in this particular novel she has Ariadne Oliver, a character based heavily on Christie herself, hand in a novel to her publishers which she describes as \\"lousy\\" and \\"frightful,\\" which may well have been Christie's own feelings toward many of her later books.Still, \\"Third Girl\\" starts off with an interesting premise. Christie's famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is relaxing at home when he's interrupted by the arrival of a young woman who wants to consult him about a murder that she *might* have committed. Intrigued, Poirot agrees to meet with Norma Restarick, a girl he describes as \\"an Ophelia devoid of physical attraction\\". However, Norma soon departs without divulging any information, dismissing Poirot as \\"too old.\\"Soon enough his friend the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver explains the visitation: she met Norma at a party recently, and hearing of her strange predicament she encouraged her to go to Poirot for answers. Now that both are hooked on the mystery that surrounds \`the third girl' (named so because of her living conditions with two other girls in a London flat), each collaborate on discovering just what she meant when she said that she *might* have committed a murder.What follows is the accumulation of disparate clues that refuse to form any sort of coherent pattern, much to Poirot's frustration. Eccentric family members, vain potential boyfriends, close-lipped flat mates and old school mistresses make up some of the suspects that surround the case - though as Poirot often points out, there is no actual murder to investigate. Random events and chance meetings gradually begin to link together as the novel progresses, and a pattern emerges from a wig, a suspected poisoning, a suicide, an old man's memoirs, a portrait, and of course, the third girl...Perhaps the main weakness of the story is simply that for a long time, we're not quite sure what the two detectives are trying to solve. An odd comment made by a confused young woman? It's not quite as pressing as the discovery of a dead body.Ariadne and Poirot utilize some old tricks in their separate investigations, which may bring a smile to the reader's face, and Christie seems to enjoy channeling most of her career frustrations through the character of Ariadne Oliver. The two characters bounce off each other nicely and are still in good form despite their age.However, the plot relies on several coincidences, such as Ariadne entering a caf&eacute; where Norma just happens to be dining, and some inconsistencies - at first Norma says that she and her father had quality time together before he married his second wife, later she says that her father brought her back from South America with him. There are also a couple of plot holes and a minor subplot involving Norma's great uncle and a secretary who may or may not be a spy that seems rather superfluous. For the titular character, Norma is rather devoid of any interesting characteristics. I was never particularly invested in her as a person and we never really get to know her beyond the fact that she hates her father, hates her stepmother, and hates the world in general. Remind me why I should care?It becomes increasingly apparent as the narrative goes on that Christie herself is at a loss to understand the sixties culture that surrounded her - she only knows that she doesn't like it. Poirot and Ariadne express befuddlement and disapproval at every opportunity as to the fashion, culture, ideals and activities of young people - perhaps this disconnect leads to the ineffectiveness of Norma as a sympathetic heroine considering the entire plot seems to run on a disparaging \\"kids these days!\\" premise.It's entertaining enough, but compared to the rest of Christie's literary canon, it's certainly mediocre."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Third Girl: A Hercule Poirot Mystery is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's classic mystery novels. Three single girls are roommates in London; one is a secretary, one is an artist, and the third - who seeks help from Poirot - disappears, convinced that she is a murderer. Poirot finds and ocean of malign rumors, but uncovering hard evidence to determine whether the third girl is truthful, false, or deluded will take all his skill and determination. A gripping story of intrigue all the way through, skillfully narrated by Hugh Fraser (who played Captain Hastings, Poirot's assistant in the television adaptation of Poirot's mysteries broadcasted by A&E and PBS), Third Girl is an absolute must-have for Agatha Christie's many devotees. 6 CDs, 7 hours."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"To say that this is not Dame Agatha's best is an understatement. If you are a Christie fan (particularly of Ariadne Oliver) you'll probably want to read this one, otherwise look elsewhere.The story opens as Poirot has just sent his book to the publishers a young woman arrives seeking his detective services but decides that he is &quot;too old&quot;. Poirot manages to overcome his shock and elicits a few details from her before she leaves. Then Poirot goes to visit his friend author Ariadne Oliver for sympathy and information. The two sleuths then collaborate to solve the crime.In typical Christie fashion there are long hidden secrets that finally revealed, all are not as they seem, all clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow and of course there is a surprise at the end. On the plus side of this otherwise mediocre novel Ariadne Oliver is delightful."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Third Girl is an experimental effort by Agatha Christie. Of course, it's still very much a whodunnit, but the style of writing is more youthful than most of her other works. I guess it's Christie's way of portraying the hippie era. Despite the more \\"bouncy\\" approach, at times this book is difficult to read because the paragraphs seem to ramble on. Some paragraphs even spanned a page, which is quite frustrating. Still, it's a nice little mystery that should provide an interesting challenge for her fans, even though I guessed the outcome halfway through it - the clues are just too obvious. Overall, not the best of Christie's work. I'll recommend it for the completist, as in, fans who want to read every one of Hercule Poirot's adventures."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"This book is actually quite different from most of Ms. Christie's books. We still get the same great characters and plot, and we see Hercule Poirot at the height of his powers, but it has a totally surprising ending. It is also a really good snapshot of what the establishment thought of young people during the height of the hippie era. The book starts with a young woman coming to Poirot's house and interrupting his breakfast. She tells him that she thinks she may have committed a murder, and then leaves suddenly without saying anymore. Poirot enlists the help of his friend Ariadne Oliver to try to track down who the girl was, and when they find out, they find a real \\"mare's nest\\" of a family. Ms. Christie is such a wonderful author, and this book is certainly interesting, if different than most of hers. She is still tops in this field, and each of her books is entertaining as well as written to get the reader to actually think."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"What was the vain Hercule Poirot to do when a girl insisted on seeing him outside his official hours, and upon one look at him, blurted out that he was too old and left without accounting for herself? Especially after she mentioned she might have murdered someone?Weaving together several subplots from her previous works, Agatha Christie tried to create a new setting for her recurrent characters: Hercule Poirot and Oliver Ariadne.The Third Girl referred to a term used to advertise for a third female tenant to share the rent of a London apartment. She was also the \\"Orhelia devoid of physical attraction\\" who insulted Hercule Poirot. It was later realised from his indignant outpouring to Oliver Ariadne that she was probably the one who recommended Poirot to this girl.Thus began the mystery that might not have been a mystery. Poirot's connections to the police did not reveal any possible candidate for the murder mentioned by Norma Restarick, youthful daughter to one Andrew Restarick. Andrew Restarick had abandoned his wife and daughter fifteen years before and left for Africa with another woman. The deaths of his wife, then his brother, brought him back to England, with a new wife, and took over the family business.Between their visits to Norma's flat and Restarick office in London, and the visit to their home in Crosshedges, Long Basing, Poirot and Ariadne composed a picture of a family challenged by the \\"revolution\\" of the 60s. Yet there was something beyond the normal angst, and as Poirot and Ariadne continued in their pursuit, they realised there was a very real danger. There were gossips of guns, knives and bloody stains, but no murder victim to account for; which begged the question whether Norma was guilty, innocent or insane.But the questions like what was the danger, who was in danger and from whom, remained frustratingly vague, resisting most attempts of illumination. This is a departure from most detective genres and fans seeking a good old crime would be exasperated at the development of the story.Nonetheless, fans of Agatha Christie would be able to garner clues if they had learned how the Queen of Mystery usually placed them subtly.There were two perspectives to the deception; as a male, I uncovered the male perspective of the deception so easily that I did not realise there was a female perspective deception in place. Certainly it was nothing to complain about for as a reader, I received my entertainment of being mystified and surprised."},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"there is absolutely no possibility that this is her worst book. (I dont think she really has one...theyve all been good)but, this is certainly not one of her best. The plot tends to ramble, its very slow, and at times it can be a bit dull. (probably owing to the fact that there really doesnt seem to be mch crime involved at all, let alone a death, until almost right at the end.)But it is still a worthy effort...its an original premise, its intriguing, and the solution is clever and unexpected, as we have been led to expect from AC. If you can wade through much of the slightly dull middle section, then you will probably be quite glad you read it. Its not her best, but its not her worst, and there are certainly some enjoyable moments (in particular, Mrs Olivers following of a suspect...Mrs Oliver is my favourite of all Christie's creations.)"},{"Title":"THIRD GIRL","review":"Agatha Christie has always done well in depicting characters and their traits.

However they started off on the wrong foot with the misleading image that shows a cover for Oracle Application express but then the book arrives with the old cover Easy Oracle HTML DB. OK I forgive them the marketing fluff but my suspicions are raised.As I use this book I discover the scripts have syntax errors(i.e. wrong table names, etc) and in many cases the book refers to the wrong objects in step by step exercises. Or they miss a step or ask you to do something you haven't been shown yet. Then there are times when they tell you to do things that are just plain confusing/illogical, ie. page 98 they tell me to use a date mask on the unit price (which, by the way, they sent me to the wrong table to locate on p96). I tried following their instructions to the letter, tried applying some intelligence by using a date column instead. Bottom line I could not get what they were trying to teach me to work. They failed again 2 pages later on the use of shortcuts. It did not work... (at least in my humble experience). These flaws mean I lose the point of what they are trying to teach me because I am struggling to discern their intent.I read other reviews that stated the book was an easy read. While the language is friendly and down to earth, this is not a book that you just curl up with. I tried, even took it with me on jury duty! I tried to curl up on the couch with it but found I needed to be at a machine trying the things it was listing.

It tells the reader lots of useful stuff and omits the more esoteric and advanced functionality.The authors approach is to tell the reader what they are going to show, why they are going to show it and how it may be useful in the wider context, then they go ahead and demonstrate it.Thus the relevance of the text is pretty good.I feel that the books is best read cover-to-cover (not necessarily working through the examples on the first pass) so that the reader can get a good feel for the product and to give a good insight on how application express can and should be used (at least by the beginning user) The book is easy to read and flows well.Throughout there are useful snippets, such as how to set the max length for a tabular form column; they are often presented almost as throw-away lines so are at times, in my opinion, a bit too easy to miss. In addition, you can find references to checkboxes and radio buttons in the index.I could not give the book 5 stars because I am uneasy about technical books which do not explicitly give readers the means to contact the authors or publishers with feedback. No wonder the errata for this book is empty. There are at least a dozen errors, mainly issues with spelling, grammar, layout and misleading explanations.

Note that although the book's title indicates HTML-DB, it is based on the latest Oracle Application Express 2.0. The authors have done an exceptional job in providing great technical content along with useful examples.The major topics on APEX are covered in an organized fashion with well thought-out and accurate examples that the reader can immediately start applying to their environment. Within no time at all, readers can have a fully functionally APEX environment setup and configured to start building applications!When learning any new production, it is imperative to have a guide that can walk you through the basics of installation, setup and configuration. The book accomplishes this goal by providing in-depth steps that assume the reader has never seen APEX to having a secure and stable environment ready for creating their first web application in one easy to read chapter.Before creating that first application, however, the authors provide the basics an administrator would need to know like creating and configuring workspaces and users. Although a short chapter, it contains invaluable information to better understanding how to work in the APEX environment. Finally, the reader is shown the power of the wizards in APEX and will have the opportunity to create their first fully functional web application.By now, the reader should be comfortable working in the APEX framework. The remainder of the book continues by thoroughly explaining the Application Builder (where a developer will spend most of their time) along with creating forms and reports.Note that this book is not a guide on simply how to use the wizards. Much of the book is dedicated to understanding the APEX framework and how to build high-quality custom web applications. Much attention is given to shared components, navigation, templates and application deployment along with useful troubleshooting tips. I would, however, have liked to seen much more on security (authorization and authentication).

In the first part Benardete shares memories of his youth and family, education and professional preparation, friends and colleagues. This section is gossipy in the best of ways concerning the climate and personalities that made the University of Chicago and Harvard such dynamic places of learning during the last four decades or so. Bloom, Strauss, Grene, Rorty, Bellow, Dardan, Steiner, Rosen are some of the names named at the U of C alone. I loved reading that student members of the Committee for Social Thought pursued grand projects and perused authors in the voluminous reading time they were granted, allowing many to develop profoundly thick or curiosly sharp lenses with which to scrutinze the world. Benardete peppers most accounts with humour and sharp descriptions. I enjoyed to the Rolls Royce Road Trip.The second part of the book presents formulation of the ideas and opinions that Benardete developed during his productive career as a scholar and teacher. The most frequently engaged authors are Plato and Homer, but the author smears the canon of classical works with his thoughts. I cannot say I am convinced by or necessarily in agreement with many of Bernardete's idiosyncratic readings, but I remain dazzled by the cleverness and intensity of the author's talent as a reader and interpreter of ancient writings.The second part of the book is surely richer and more likely to engender rereading. The first part makes for excellent mind candy. On the whole the volume nicely circuits the career of Benardete, who seems to have been an admired teacher and thoughtful scholar. Funny and light, heavy and thoughtful, this book resembles its author."},{"Title":"Encounters and Reflections: Conversations with Seth Benardete","review":"I'm not going to review this book. (Well, not much, anyhow. Anyone who has come this far, and is looking at these reviews, is already going to be either sufficiently curious about Benardete -- meaning my review won't make a difference -- or already knowledgeable about his writings.) This generally excellent book deals with both Benardete's life and writings. Therein lies my complaint. I like the book and the format -- basically, two interviewers ask SB questions -- but I feel that the book could've provided more, and, moreover, that I deserved more (30$ being a hefty price tag for a book as slim as this one). Frankly, it was a tremendously enjoyable read, but I really do feel that the latter parts of the book (where SB touches on many interesting philosophical issues, and on topics he treats in his books) could have been fifty to one hundred pages longer. I would have been happier if the biographical section had been shorter, IF that had made room for a correspondingly larger 'intellectual' section: that is, more SB on philosophy. Benardete had an enviable ability to convey a lot in short pithy sentences, and greedily I simply wanted his thoughts and opinions on a myriad of topics."},{"Title":"Encounters and Reflections: Conversations with Seth Benardete","review":"A nice, chatty book.

The book has two main parts. The first and better contains reminiscences of teachers and colleagues at Chicago, the American School at Athens, the American Academy in Rome, Harvard, Brandeis, NYU, and the New School. The second preserves his idiosyncratic often obscurantist views largely of Homer, Herodotus, Sophocles, Plato, Xenophon, Virgil, and Apuleius. There are several well chosen photographs. There is not even a brief vita nor what we most need a bibliography of his publications with reviews of his books. There is no effort to control the accuracy of the sexagenarian's recollections. Take, for example, his remarks (pp. 23-5) on Benedict Einarson (1906-78). His dates are omitted, and the editors do not know the necrology at Gnomon 51 (1979) 207-8. We are repeatedly told how often he laughed, and that \`he went bonkers and ended up in a loony bin in Western Massachusetts'. No evidence is provided for this libel. Benardete alleges (p. 79) that one Simon Caplan, his colleague at St John's, \`wrote a commentary on Polybius, in three volumes'. It does not exist. We learn that Giorgio Pasquali (p. 55) \`went crazy, and they put him in a loony bin. He was there from the end of the war until the summer of 53 [he died 9 July 1952!]. The day he walked out of the loony bin, he was run over by a Vespa.' This is not true. Contorted reasons (p. 97) explain why Momigliano always felt an alien. Omitted are the real reasons that he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic society and lived knowing that he had been an engaged Fascist.The incompetence of the notes delights. I shall mercifully be selective. Burger muddles (p. 31n. 29) the excavator of Olympia, Ernst Curtius, whose dates are rightly given as \`1814-96' with his grandson, Ernst Robert Curtius (1886-1956). Benardete never met the widow of Ernst Curtius in Geneva. She would have been 150. At p. 31 n. 31 Burger tells us that David Daube died in 1990 but nonetheless \`he taught in the School of Law [at Berkeley] until 1993'. We learn (p. 58 n. 3) that C. M. Bowra became Warden of Wadham at age 24, holding the post \`from 1922 to 1971'. That would have been an Oxbridge record. He in fact was Warden 1938-70. She thinks Jaeger's Paideia (p. 61 n. 6) was one volume. Arthur Darby Nock becomes (p. 85 n.1) \`professor in classics at Harvard from 1929 to 1963'. He was in fact Frothingham Professor of the History of Religions (1930-63). Sterling Dow (p. 90 n. 6) is dated 1891-1972; rather: 1903-95. Eric Havelock (p. 102n. 2) professed at Yale 1963-71 not 1963-76. Tales of Leo Strauss (pp. 34-48), if nothing else, preserve what students told one another. We have the first discussion in print of the parentage of Jenny Strauss Clay (p. 38). A future biographer of Benardete will read the book. I see no reason for anyone else to.\\"University of Illinois, WILLIAM M.

If you're serious about learning the fundamental purpose of genuine abstraction, this is the place to start.The symbolism employed by the great abstract pioneers such as Kandinsky, Mondrian and Malevich is far from being a merely personal thing, but rather springs from the collective unconscious and is in truth the foundation of all things Universal. As established by Frazer (The Golden Bough), Campbell (Hero With a Thousand Faces) and David Fideler (Jesus Christ, Sun of God), we have common instincts, desires, motivations and beliefs that can and are expressed through symbols or metaphors.How these universal ideas and feelings came to be expressed succinctly through the evolution of painting and abstraction is masterfully documented by Lipsey and establishes the initial impetus for modern art. This is essential knowledge for artists interested in learning the traditions from which abstraction transformed representational images and gave birth to an art of our own, as opposed to forms dictated by church, state or the marketplace."},{"Title":"The Spiritual in Twentieth-Century Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","review":"I read the previous edition (which I understand is the same.)

He combines an introduction/review of primary theories behind modern art, such as Kandinsky's, with intelligent perspectives on subjects such as who are contemporary trail-blazers in art that reaches a deeper/higher ground. Note the art-work is all black-and-white instead of color, but the reproductions are of good quality.

The amount of detail about military infrared target acquisition, surveillance, and countermeasure systems is incredible and the authors are respected authorities in the military research and development community."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"This book is one of the most powerful, yet easy to read books on the market and it's principles are timeless! It's truly a \\"SIB KIS\\" work of art. I have had the pleasure of hearing the author speak and most recently a 90 minute private tour of his business where he personally directed me to classics by Oswald Chambers, Spurgeon and could quote passages and find their location from memory. This visit was unannounced and Charlie had just returned from a chemo treatment! Charlie is living proof of his claims and if any one doubts the connection he makes with our creator to these principles needs to spend just five minutes with him to understand their validity. Charlie is \\"suffering\\" with terminal prostate cancer. Yet to see him, be hugged by him and hear the energy in his soul would put most young people to shame. Charlie has no fear of his future and actually is looking forward to this next phase of his \\"journey\\". I have read many books that \\"tell\\" people how to live. Charlie actually lives his philosophy and tells them to stop trying to be perfect and enjoy the one who is! If you read this book years ago and found it helpful, read it again as odds are you situation in life has changed, but fortunately these principles have not. Even better purchase several books and share them with your friends, family and business associates, it's a great way to pass on the powerful message that can benefit anyone who dares to take them to heart."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"This book told us the true purpose of life, principles for good leadership, the attitudes of successful person and ways to develop positive attitude. The authors believe that every one can be happy, relaxed, healthy and secure in today's high-pressure society through development of certain personalities and attitudes. In fact, attitude is very important; it affects our thinking and ways of doing things. If we have positive and enthusiastic attitude, every problem can be solved and everything can be done. We need to get involved in our occupation and give heart to do it, then we will be success. The authors also quoted many daily examples that make us more easily to understand the principles and make the book more lively and interesting.After reading this book, it really changed my attitude. I'm now always thinking positively and to be more get involved and enthusiastic when doing something. This book taught us to see things from different angles, and we will find that actually everything has a positive side. Moreover, we need to seek some benefits from the problem, in fact, having a problem is not a bad thing since we will get something valuable inside the problem. The authors also mentioned that self confidence is very important, if we believe that we can do it, then we really can do it. This is the most impressive part to me because I think we can't do things well without confidence.This book consists of many useful principles that guiding me in the rest of my life. Therefore, I strongly recommend this book to all people. I believe that everyone can benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"I loved this book.

He appeared along with Dr. Peale.What impresses me about Jones is that he is funny, charismatic but has a powerful message too.Life is Tremendous is another one of those small books that sometimes gets overlooked because of it's small size. This book is only 105 pages and can easily be read in one evening or even in less than an hour. But it should be read over and over. It is outstanding. Charlie will get you laughing and provide a very powerful message.To really appreciate Charlie Jones, listen to one of his cd's or audio cassette tapes. He will get you rolling and you will come away with ideas you never thought of before. One of my favorite quotes from Charlie is:\\"It's not how hard you fall, but how high you can bounce backfrom adversity that counts.\\"AND...\\"All leaders are readers.\\"Want to be good leader? Then become a good reader."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"I've read just about every self-improvement book I can get my hands on. This is one of my faves. I have tried in vain to get my 15 year old son to read it. Anyone, young or old must read this book. I loved it."},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"&iexcl;Life is Tremendous&iexcl; is like a guide for everyone&iexcl;s life. It guides readers to find out the meaning of life, and how to become good leaders and successors. The author focuses on leading readers to be optimistic and enthusiastic to their lives by building up a positive attitude and a fine personality, since he believes enthusiasm makes the difference. It gave us a clear picture of how to build up an active attitude, which helps us to be a positive person. Besides, this book also told us how to face eleven common problems in our daily life, such as nervous, difficulties, fear, etc. And readers will discover that, the author always told us to rely on God, and leave our problems and difficulties to God.Many people may not agree that life is tremendous. But I am sure that, after reading this book, you will change your mind. As it gave me lots of constructive opinion for my life. The most impressed idea from the author is that if I believe, then I can do it. After reading this book, when I handle a task that I think I may not able to complete, I told myself I believe that I can do it, then I did it with a good result. What I think is that, it is confidence. No matter what happens, if you have confident, then you can do it.Besides, he told us we have to get excited about our work. I think it is true that living is not doing what we like to do; it is doing what we have to do. For myself, I will feel boredom for the studies, but when I think of the reasons of studying, which is aimed at helping me to gain more knowledge and broaden the experience of my life, then I will become energetic and excited about my studies again. On the other hand, the author reminded me &iexcl;production to perfect&iexcl; is very important. Although I have many planning in my mind, however, if I do not start to do, I will never succeed. Apart from having a flexible planning for myself, implementing what I have planned is critical to perfect.There are some areas related to religion in this book. As a Christian, this book reminds me to rely on our God. Very often, when I was busying with my work, I will forget my beloved God, I will just rely on myself and forget my power is from our God. But this book reminds me that I can hand-over all my problems to our God, and I will become peaceful.This book will lead you to think more deeply about your lives, and you will find out many useful perspectives and suggestions to improve your life quality. If you want to have a happy, healthy and productive life, this is a book which highly recommend to you.Written By Ng Shuk Yee Shirley (City University of Hong Kong - Marketing Department)"},{"Title":"Life is Tremendous: Enthusiasm Makes the Difference","review":"I have been reading &amp; re-reading this book for YEARS, ever since it first came out.

Although supposedly written by an \\"Evangelical\\" it is not only shallow, but mostly very \\"perverse\\" in its overall view of the history of the Church.The Roman Catholic Church, although a dominant political force and obvious representative of Christianity for over one thousand years, should never be equated with \\"The Church\\" as this author does. The RCC is simply the oldest and largest quasi-christian cult in the world. Any Evangelical Christian, who is Born-Again and rejects the cultic dogmas of the RCC should know this and boldly declare it. This author, is a liberal scholar with a misguided view of the RCC and it's place in the history of the true church.During the section on the Medieval Period, instead of elaborating on the heroics of the the Waldenses, Albigensians, Moravians, Anabaptists, and others,Vos whitewashes the role of the evil Popes and Inquisitors. This is all too typical of so many so-called Evangelicals in our time in the 21st century.The \\"Reformation\\" of the RCC was attempted by Catholic monks like Luther, Calvin, and others but it totally failed to reform the RCC at all. In fact, Luther and Calvin remained believers in \\"sacramental salvation,\\" never preaching more that a theological assent to elements of true evangelical Christianity, while holding to many false doctrines that kept their follows from hearing the true gospel.Authors like Vos ignore the fact that the true church was never \\"reformed\\", it did not have to be, but always was alive among the groups mentioned above. In fact, Those of the true church were persecuted,oppressed and even killed by neo-catholics like Luther and Calvin, who sometimes sounded evangelical but continued to act like unsaved Catholics.A true view of church history requires the student be informed about the genuine Christians of the Medieval and Reformation Periods, those identified as members of the \\"Radical Reformation\\" (although they never attempted to \\"reform\\" the RCC, rather just to stay far from it, as true believers do to this day).I would suggest that readers check out the following books found here at Amazon and similar works:The Radical Reformation (3rd ed,2000) by George Huntston Williams, Ecclesiastical History Professor at HarvardRoman Catholic Controversy, The [Paperback]James R.

Get the point?"},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"Although he also wrote several novels featuring the world's greatest fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, it was especially in his short stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle perfected the Holmes formula. \\"His Last Bow\\" (published in 1917) is the fourth of the five collections of Holmes short stories. The other collections all featured a dozen stories, but only eight stories make up \\"His Last Bow\\". The title is based on the final story of the same name, which portrays the retired Holmes active in bee-keeping, and emerging from retirement only to protect English secrets during the First World War. Doyle was arguably past his prime in producing Sherlock Holmes stories, but this is still a very good collection of stories, and although there are only eight stories, unlike some of the other collections there is no obviously inferior story among them. The Bruce-Partington Plans, The Dying Detective and The Devil's Foot are especially outstanding, but all the other stories in this collection are very good as well. It may not match the brilliance and popularity of the first three collections (\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" and \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\"), but it's not far behind, and Holmes fans will find every one of the eight stories of \\"His Last Bow\\" most enjoyable.Here's a list of the stories in this collection (with the better stories marked with stars):Wisteria Lodge, 1908 - This two-part story recounts the strange experiences of Mr. John Scott Eccles, whose Spanish host Garcia and his two servants mysteriously vanish overnight. How is the exiled tyrant Don Murillo, the Tiger of San Pedro, behind these events?The Cardboard Box, 1893 - Susan Cushing opens a parcel in a box, horrified to find two severed human ears - but whose are they and why are they sent to her?The Red Circle, 1911 - Mrs. Warren has a mysterious lodger who never emerges from his room, and how is this connected to a secret society called \\"the Red Circle\\"?*The Bruce-Partington Plans, 1908 - Some top-secret plans for a Bruce-Partington submarine are found in the pockets of a dead man who falls off a train, but where are the rest of the plans, and how and why did they get stolen?*The Dying Detective, 1913 - Holmes is delirious and dying of a tropical Chinese disease. His only hope for survival appears to be Mr. Culverton Smith, a specialist in such diseases, but unfortunately also a criminal who would be glad to see Holmes die.Lady Frances Carfax, 1911 - When Lady Frances Carfax goes missing, her life is unwittingly threatened by Holy Peters, an unscrupulous criminal from Australia who is now posing as someone else.*The Devil's Foot, 1910 - A thrilling and convincing story, as Mortimer Tregennis reports the bizarre death of his sister and sudden madness of his two brothers. The story complicates with the death of Mortimer himself, and the involvement of the African explorer Dr. Leon Sterndale. Holmes discounts supernatural involvement, and looks for some natural explanation.His Last Bow, 1917 - Holmes emerges from his retirement (spent beekeeping and completing his magnus opus \\"Practical Handbook of Bee Culture\\") to thwart the German spy Baron Von Bork from disclosing secret English documents on the eve of World War I.- GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"The thing I like about a good Sherlock Holmes short story is its brevity and muscular leanness, so when I see backstory, even for a few pages, I roll my eyes - I want Holmes, detection, maybe a bit of action, not some tale of jealousy or treachery from the tropics or wherever. The first three stories in this collection evaporate in a daze of backstory - they the had potential to be good but they blew it. As for the other stories, the Dying Detective is an interesting addition to the canon but nothing special. The Devil's Foot, whilst certainly above average, falls a bit flat in the end with Holmes doing his detection largely off stage. The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax is okay. His Last Bow feels like the last chapter of some John Buchan adventure novel and is hugely disappointing, just like that other endstop, the overrated Final Problem. \\"There's an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet.\\" And there was me thinking the Rathbone film had invented that naffness from scratch. The obvious winner is the Bruce-Partington Plans. It's got detection, action, and Mycroft. Worth admission price alone."},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"This is a collection of eight short stories, first published in October 1917, narrating some of the adventures of detective Sherlock Holmes, the last one entitled \\"His Last Bow.\\" Sherlock Holmes is amongst the most famous characters ever created in literature, his popularity overshadowing his creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, to the point that some people are under the impression that Sherlock Holmes in fact existed. The inspiration came from Dr. Joseph Bell, a friend and tutor to Conan Doyle and who shared many personality features with the famous detective.The author had Sherlock Holmes killed but public demand was so high for further adventures that we find him back in action. Determined to have a permanent retirement, Sherlock Holmes moves into a small farm and dedicates himself to other matters, refusing to offer his intellectual ability to the government. With World War I approaching he backs up on this determination and his return into action is narrated in \\"His Last Bow.\\" The cases range from theft, burglary, kidnapping, to murder, and in all of the them Sherlock Holmes is a master in the science of deduction and analysis.By those considered expert \\"Sherlockians,\\" this is not Holmes at his best and certainly not as good as his masterpiece \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles.\\""},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"Now most Sherlockians would say this is not Holmes at his best, and at times I would agree (hence only 4 stars) but some of my personal faves are in here. In order, the stories are: 1)&quot;Wisteria Lodge&quot; 2) &quot;Cardboard Box&quot; 3) &quot;Red Circle&quot; 4) &quot;Bruce-Partington Plans&quot; 5) &quot;Dying Detective&quot; 6) &quot;Lady Frances Carfax&quot; 7) &quot;Devil's Foot&quot; 8) &quot;His Last Bow&quot; In particular, I like &quot;B-P Plans,&quot; &quot;Dying Detective,&quot; and &quot;Devil's Foot.&quot; These are some of the more obscure cases. Definately try this book, especially if you're read &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; already."},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"Although a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, I was not a big fan of the book, THE VALLEY OF FEAR, which preceded this collection of stories. Fortunately, HIS LAST BOW found Sir Arthur Conan Doyle back in form. The eight stories in this volume, for the most part, hold up well when compared to those in earlier works. Sure, at times it feels a bit old hack, but that is only because this volume, book eight out of nine, comes so late in the Sherlock Holmes' canon. If this book had come earlier, with some other collection of stories coming later, the relative feeling of freshness would be reversed.Of the eight stories, five are routine detective stories, of which The Devil's Foot, in this reviewer's humble opinion, stands out. Of the remaining three stories, The Adventure of the Dying Detective is rather interesting, as Holmes makes use of one of his noteworthy skills other than detection and logic. As Watson said in an earlier work, when Sherlock Holmes decided upon a career as a private detective, it meant that several other arenas, such as science or the stage, lost an exceptionally promising practitioner. True, true.The other two stories, The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans and the title story His Last Bow, show Holmes to be the admirable patriot, using his skills for the benefit of Britain. Mycroft, Sherlock's smarter but lazier brother, appears in one and we learn some interesting tidbit about him.If you have made it this far into the Holmes' canon, there would be no reason to stop now. Surely nothing in HIS LAST BOW would make one want to anyway."},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"The last of Conan Doyle's Holmes stories go out on a whimper I'm afraid to say with very little atmosphere, defining moments or spellbinding mystery. It's safe to say that Sir Arthur was bored of the character by this point and grudged bringing him back from the dead after his tussle with Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls.I know I am repeating myself, I mentioned this in a review for a previous book but it's clear Conan Doyle was running out of ideas. With only eight stories making up this book (a couple of them less than 20 pages) he still ends up being quite repetitive and pretty much condenses his Holmes novelThe Valley of Fear (Classic Crime)into a short story called 'The Red Circle'.The final story has a bittersweet, if unremarkable, ending and has very little story or point to it. Many writers have kept Holmes alive over the years with various books, radio plays and films and have done so with more affection than Conan Doyle. He created one of the most popular characters in history but thought so little of him."},{"Title":"His Last Bow","review":"After being killed in an adventure, Holmes suddenly reappears. Of course, the first thing he does is to tell how he came back alive. And then new, last stories, come up. The edition I read includes &quot;The valley of terror&quot;, a convoluted and terrifying story in which Holmes participates indirectly. One can not go wrong with Holmes. Inevitably, the quality of the stories is varied, but they are always fun to read. Doyle is indeed a great writer, who must be counted among the best writers, right there with the big language-innovators and &quot;serious&quot; literates."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, having enjoyed James Brochu's memoir (he was another of Lucy's backgammon pals) instead I was shocked to find this an obnoxious, self-serving tale of a fan who sees himself as a \\"relative\\" (\\"Gary Morton's sister Helen's husband, Bob, was my father's first cousin\\" he writes) and a \\"friend\\". Actually he seems closer to a hanger-on (there is a less gentle term for that these days), albeit he and his boyfriend have well-paying jobs unlike a lot of gay boys who latch on to elderly actresses. We certainly don't learn much about Lucy here, and apparently neither did Mr. Tannen. Unlike Brochu's book, quoting Lucy in detail about her career and associates, Tannen does not appear very interested or even knowledgable about her contemporaries or even Lucy's pre-I LOVE LUCY career. All that time together appears to be spent doing little more than playing backgammon. Several times he tastelessly comments about personal incidents reminding him of MOMMIE DEAREST and SUNSET BLVD. Frankly, I was reminded of ALL ABOUT EVE ie: a little schemer pushing their way into the life of a great star. There certainly is a bit of latent hostility under his fawning. He doesn't fail to get us the full details about times when Lucy behaved badly toward him (ie: telling him the correct way to toast an English muffin) but seems rather vague about a fit he threw in a car that resulted in Lucy breaking ties for two years. He seems jealous of anyone else in Lucy's life including her husband. His nasty remarks at Gary's expense seem quite ungrateful considering Gary was his source for entering into Lucy's life. He doesn't attack Lucy's children, of course (he barely mentions either of them though at one point dares to suggest he himself was something of a son to Lucy). He is complimentary to Lucie in the few brief comments directed at her, apparently to keep in her good graces and in touch. Lucie praises his book lavishly on the dust jacket, probably because he states Desi Arnaz was the love of Lucy's life and never got over him. This, of course, is what Little Lucie, always closer to her father, wants to hear. The cover pose with Lucy, in which Tannen has arm over her shoulder and the other hand by her neck (there's even another photo inside with a similiar pose as well as this shot reproduced inside) certainly suggests he was possessive. He was not in show business (unless you call making commercials show business) but does not hesitate to attack every major career Lucy made during the 1980's as a mistake, apparently because she dared to without getting his advice. Some of the ideas he puts forth are truly terrible (ie: Lucy starring past age 70 on Broadway for the first time in over 20 years which might have been a real disaster and not just from the critic reception. Lucy's health was not good her last decade, is he really so insensitive not to realize what working eight shows a week at that point could have done to her?). He certainly seems not to have considered the fact that Lucy was only seeking a little companionship from him as a backgammon partner and was not interested in either getting professional advice from him or being his mentor for a major show business career. He does seem to have genuine affection for Lucy (although she certainly is not the only star he might have been so \\"close\\" to given to chance as fawns over Don Johnson, Tommy Tune, or Patricia Neal when he meets them via Lucy; the Tune interaction is particularly interesting because Lucy's comments to him suggest she thought he might take his star watching to another level). Had he been nicer to Gary (whom Lucy was clearly devoted to all accounts) or more of a real friend (ie: helping her interact with her children more) I would have like Tannen and his book a lot more. He does love Lucy, but as a person or a star? That answer seems unclear."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"The book I read was I loved Lucy by Lee Tannen. This book is about Lucille Ball and his relationship with Lucy. Ever since the day Lee met Lucy they were inseparable. Minus the fights they had with each other, and the times they were not together. But, when they weren't together they would talk on the phone to check up on each other. Lucy was married two times, one to Dezi Arnaz who she made the hit show \\"I love Lucy\\" with and her second marriage was with Gary Morton. Gary Morton was her producer and she fell in love with him. Gary was Lee's dad's cousin. If Lucy would have never fell in love with Gary Lee would have never been able to meet her. Lee and Lucy experienced many things together. Lucy loved Lee and he loved her. Lucy was very successful through out her life and did many television series, and movies. As I read this book I learned to love Lucy also. She was a very humble person, and I liked how she wanted to be normal, and didn't show who she was. I enjoyed reading this book, and I'm glad that I got to learn more about her."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"&quot;I Loved Lucy&quot; is the story of the friendship between Lucille Ball and Lee Tannen, a distant relative of Lucy's second husband. The book is packed with charming stories that will make you both laugh and cry. Lee was priveleged to be with Lucy at some of her highest moments, like receiving the Kennedy Center Honors, as well as some of her lowest, such as the debacle of &quot;Life With Lucy&quot;, her failed last sitcom. Lee's love for Lucy, both the person and the image, are obvious in every page, but he does not gloss over Lucy's sometimes strong temperment. Also, interesting is Lee Tannen's depiction of his own relative, Gary Morton, Lucy's husband; Lucy's admiration and respect for the late Vivian Vance; her statements about Desi Arnaz and her children; and Lucy's obsession with backgammon. This is a wonderful book about a wonderful lady...any Lucy fan should read it!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"She didn't like change, and until she died, had the only rotary telephones in Beverly Hills! A wonderful insight into the real-life personna of Lucy. Being a Lucille Ball fan, I have to congratulate Mr. Tannen for his honesty concerning Lucy's need to control, her thrifty ways with money among other things: it's a realistically refreshing book about America's favourite redhead. Lucy was indeed a complex and sometimes perplexing person who, paradoxically - in real life - seemed to be everything that Lucy Ricardo wasn't; then again......I have to admire Lucy for being such a strong, real person who didn't cry the blues or gossip about people like so many stars did. I agree that it seems hard to believe that this serious \\"realist\\" type woman could also be the immortal Lucy Ricardo! It goes to prove that Lucille Ball was indeed a sensational actress who found her niche after nearly twenty years in the movies. A bravura account of our beloved Lucy!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This is a good book- showing Lucy- its a little sad at times- but it very nice to be at home with Lucy!Check it out and see how you like it!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I was extremely overjoyed with this read. It's hilarious! I was hysterical! After reading the story of Lucy's life from Lucy herself, (in Love, Lucy)it was interesting to here the story of the tragic and rocky, yet peaceful end of her life from someone else. It was saddening to read about the depression she suffered from towards the very end of her life, but it was good she had a friend that cared about her as much as this man did. One note, her love for Desi must have been pretty evident because he noticed right away that she still yearned for him. The author is starstruck...but who wouldn't be. He is also constantly comparing to \\"I Love Lucy\\", but I didn't mind since I am a diehard Lucy Fan. But despite a few minor setbacks, it's great! And in the words of Lucie Arnaz in the foreward.. \\"People should read this.\\""},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Oh, I LOVED this book! It gives you a picture of the Lucille Ball you never knew.Lee Tannen first started being friends with Lucy around 1980. This book gives you sixteen memoirs in Lee's own words from the year Lucy married Gary, to when Lee met Lucy, to when the friendship began--and ending with Lucille Ball's death. I almost cried at the end, and that's something I rarely do when reading a book."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Never in my life have I ever read a book so moving. I never wanted to put this book down I Love it that much! I went skiing and brought the book along with me--After about 2o minutes I was ready to stop skiing and start reading again. This is a truley amazing book, I have never been so moved and touched by a novel. Lee did a spectaculor job in allowing us to see the real Lucy, I even cried in the last two &quot;episodes&quot; or chapters. Bravo Lee---Write more on Lucy, I Love Your Work!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I'm sure Lee Tannen's intentions were good. I, however, cannot endorse this book.First of all, Tannen's obsession with Lucy goes beyond normalcy. This is truly evident, not only in the way he has compared almost every situation he describes with Lucy to a particular \\"I Love Lucy\\" episode but the fact that he makes no secret of his dislike for Gary Morton is beyond reproach and disturbingly creepy. It is almost as if he's jealous of Gary and wants Lucy all to himself which is what happens most of the time in his anecdotes, which become repetetive and trite after a few chapters.I Love Lucy as much as anyone but to idolize someone to the point of obsession the way Tannen does with Lucy is too \\"far out\\" for my taste.I agree with the reviewer who wrote that Lucie Arnaz only endorsed this book because Tannen wrote what she wanted to hear....that Desi Arnaz was the love of Lucy's life (no big secret)and that he never got the credit he deserved for making Lucy the television institution she became (again, no big secret).The book itself in context, grammar, etc. is very poorly written. With all the money Tannen claims to have he could have had this book at least edited properly.When Lucy wrote him off for a year after he threw a temper tantrum (which he later regretted) Lucy should have kept her distance completely. This book, alas, adds nothing new to the Lucy Legend. As a matter of fact, it detracts greatly from it."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"... and I've read most of them!I sort of expected this book to be some tabloidish tale, an exploitive expose' about The Queen Of Television Comedy. I was completely wrong and am not ashamed to admit that.It was one of the only books about Lucille Ball that I had not purchased. I ran across it one day at the library so I checked it out. I ended up purchasing the book for my collection before I even finished it. The glowing letter of endorsement from Lucy's daughter Lucie Arnaz that graces the back cover should have been enough for me to make the purchase upon its release!Tannen dishes a lot of dirt here, but it's nothing that Lucy would necessarily be mad at him for revealing. His words give Lucy fans a complete idea of what Lucy's last years were like. Stories about how Lucy desperately wanted to make the movie &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (Lee says she would have been all wrong for it, and he's right); her disastrous last two projects (the TV movie &quot;The Stone Pillow&quot;, and the failed ABC sitcom &quot;Life With Lucy&quot;); her obsession with backgammon and game shows (she loved Vanna White of &quot;Wheel Of Fortune&quot;), plus a lot of other stories let us in on a Lucy we never really knew.As the star of one of the world's most popular TV shows, most people would think that Lucy lived a grand life of luxury. She did, but she seemed mostly unaware that it was so grand- and that it could have been even grander. She did not enjoy change. Her homes are described in detail, down to what the furniture looked like. It's all extremely riveting, especially for anyone that is a fan of Lucille Ball.The thing that makes this book so wonderful is that you truly get a sense that Lee Tannen REALLY did love Lucy. He didn't write this book to cash in on anything. He just wanted to share a side of Lucy with her fans that they didn't know about before. She does't come out smelling so perfect at all times, but this book certainly will not tarnish anyone's image of her.If you have any interest in Lucille Ball at all, this is a book that you will not want to miss out on. It was extremely hard to put down."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lee Tannen was a good friend and frequent backgammon partner of Lucy during the last ten years of her life. He presents us with a lightweight yet winning book, although at times I felt I had strayed into the script of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; as he details Lucy's isolation, her days spent playing backgammon inside her shuttered Beverly Hills home, with her outdated 50's decor and kitchen appliances.He doesn't make the Lucy he knew into a saintly figure; instead he lets us in on her &quot;star-ego&quot; moments and her lapses into pettiness. He describes in detail how each of her homes and her ski condo at Snowmass, Colorado are decorated, and tells us of her wardrobe with her extensive collection of fur coats.Although his book is entertaining, with some degree of unavoidable name-dropping, I think most people prefer to remember Lucy as she was in the 50s when her antics made a whole nation laugh with delight."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This is a book about a distant relative of Gary Morton's relationship with Lucille Ball during the last ten years of her life. He spent a good amount of time with Lucy, and he shares with us their dinner dates, skiing in Colorado, going to the theatre and, of course, backgammon! I couldn't put the book down. The private life of Lucy after &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; is fascinating, no matter what she said or did - I wanna hear it all. The author tells the story always with love for Lucy and with a good sense of humor of his own. Lucy fans should treasure this."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I confess to not reading the entire book.I really didn't want to.The tone was rather gushy and breathless. The photos of author and actress seemed to usually show him smirking into the camera, draped around her, as if broadcasting &quot;here *I* am with a STAR!&quot;One didn't get the impression of the author as a friend, but as someone more needy. His likening Ms. Ball and himself to the main characters in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; was therefore strange. He seemed to never forget--or let the reader forget either--that Lucy had been the Queen of TV Comedy, An Icon. And to then cast Lucy into the Norma Desmond role of someone who was forgotten, in need of the constant company of an adoring young man, AND crazy, is egregious. Not only contraditory, but also egotistical.Glad I avoided the bits where he fantasizes that he's actually reliving episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;; to paraphrase Groucho Marx, sometimes a TV show is just a TV show."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lee Tannen has given the millions of Lucy fans all over the world an especially welcome early-holiday gift--his touching memoir, I LOVE LUCY: MY FRIENDSHIP WITH LUCILLE BALL. While it can be argued that Lee is by no means the &quot;typical&quot; everyday Lucy fan (he has a jet-set career and many friends in high places), he brings tremendous compassion and intelligence to the often heartbreaking story of Lucy's final years. Exploring the often sad, mundane realities of her existence in the twilight of her life, he gives us Lucy--the real, honest, frank, demanding, and yes, heartbroken woman behind the laughs. An intelligent and open-minded memoir of a unique and complex friendship, one which had a profound effect on both the author and his once-in-a-lifetime subject, America's greatest comedienne."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"When I first heard about Lee Tannen's book, two questions came to me: Do I really care about Lucy? and How much more do I want to know about her? I decided to pick up the book for no other reason than for some light reading, and now I'm here to tell you - I am so VERY pleased that I did!This is a GREAT book!Tannen is both a fan and a family insider who got to spend the better part of an important decade with America's favorite female clown and I, for one, appreciate his honesty in his portrait of Lucy (and those around her)and for giving us details of his dealings with her. Yes, everthing and everyone is not presented as so \\"rosy\\" but that's because Lee is truthful and has no axes to grind. (If you think Gary Morton gets the shaft here - maybe it's because he deserves it! Lee knew him well, did you?). And while some may accuse Tannen of being a fanatical fan, or object to his style of referring him real-life dealings with Lucy to specific episodes of I Love Lucy, I found this to be one of the charms of the book. (What do critics of Tannen's writing style want - a boring narrative that starts and ends with \\"today we did this. . .\\" or some made-up juicy dirt? Get real!Lee shows us that he knew Lucy, he knew the shows, he knew her background, he knew her friends, and most of all, he knew Lucy and cared for her - not as a delirious fan or follower, but as a true friend and admirer.I found this to be such a good read, I couldn't put it down and I never wanted it to end. The humanity Tannen brings out - in both the main character and those around her - helps the reader to understand the souls within. And without these stories we'd never really know Lucy, the woman, and her times. I stopped after many a paragraph to admire the deeds of Lucy, while before this book, all I had to admire about her was the acting I saw on screen. Likewise, when I was made at Lucy's actions, knowing them still helped me to know her better than if I was simply an admirer of the silver screen. Tannen deserves credit for giving us this side of Lucy so effortlessly.When the book concludes any reader with even a modicum of heart will have a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye. The pain in Tannen's voice is so evident, so real! It became my own pain and reminded me of all my own personal losses. So what's wrong with that?I guarantee you'll love the book and find yourself telling Lucy tales to many a friend - for a long time!To critics who take Tannen to task for his inside knowledge, or his style, all I can say is get over your case of jealousy. Here's a GREAT book by a guy who was fortunate enough to \\"be there,\\" and we're fortunate that he's shared it all with us. I know I'm better off for the read. You will be too!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"As the niece of Gary Morton, my mother's brother, and a long-time resident of Los Angeles, I spent a significant amount of time with Lucy and Gary in their homes from 1962 on. I was, therefore, amazed at how inaccurate many of the so-called &quot;facts&quot; in this book are. To start with, my uncle was several years older than Tannen portrays him and was never a member of the Hillcrest Country Club. Thus, he never wore a terry robe with a Hillcrest Country Club logo on it, as Tannen claims.I was also surprised at how someone who claims to have loved Lucy so much would show such disrespect for her and her family throughout the book by making unsubstantiated negative statements about them and discussing so many private things. In mentioning Lucy's relationship with her children, Tannen guesses about their feelings for each other and the reasons for them, and then presents these guesses as facts. He also infers - without any substantiation - that my uncle, who was Lucy's husband for nearly 30 years, was interested in how much money Lucy made for his own selfish reasons. Since my uncle acted as Lucy's agent at her request, it is more likely that he was concerned about how much money she was being paid on a project because he wanted to ensure she was treated with the respect she deserved. From my perspective, Gary always looked out for Lucy's best interests. Tannen also makes a statement about an opinion of my uncle supposedly held by Lucy's television show writers. I truly doubt these writers ever discussed their opinions about anything with Tannen, if in fact they spoke to him at all.Knowing Lucy as well as I did and how much she valued her privacy, I believe that had Tannen written this book while she was still alive, she would cut him out of her life altogether, as she had done once before. Perhaps Tannen's real motive in writing this book was more self-serving, i.e., to make up for his inability to get Lucy to participate in one of his projects - such as the Broadway play he pushed for her to do.In short, many of the purported &quot;facts&quot; in this book are nothing more than Tannen's personal beliefs and opinions. If you're interested in fantasies about Lucy and her life, read this book. If you're interested in facts, I would suggest you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lee Tannen has successfully and engagingly portrayed his relationship with the star Lucille Ball. From the very beginning of the book it is apparent that Lucy let Lee Tannen into her life at a time when she was becoming reclusive and spending time with only the closest of friends. Lee Tannen describes with wit and clarity the ordinary comings and goings of a friendship. It is a very moving journey of friendship and companionship between a very intelligent, energetic, and funny young man, with a star......it is clear that Lee Tannen loved Lucy, and importantly, equally clear that Lucy loved him. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Just when you thought you new EVERYTHING about Lucy... SURPRISE! This book takes us on an amazing journey through the last decade of her life.If you ever wished you could have gotten a chance to meet and spend time with Lucy..when reading this book it's like YOU ARE FINALLY THERE! And some of the adventures he takes you on with her...they are hysterical - in a Manhattan movie house watching &quot;Terms of Endearment;&quot; on the slopes of Snowmass, Colorado and mostly around her favorite backgammon table in Beverly HIlls! What a trip she was! And after reading this book I love her even more!I couldn't put the book down....started before lunch, broke for dinner.. and finished around 2am...IT'S JUST THE KIND OF LAUGHTER I NEEED AFTER THE HELLISH MONTH WE HAVE ALL JUST GONE THROUGH IN AMERICA!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I was in a bookstore picking up a new release of another book I had on my to read list when I turned my head and saw this book promiently displayed (with only 2 copies left!). I opened the book and skimmed a couple of pages here and there and KNEW I HAD to buy this book! I put this book before my &quot;new released&quot; book and what a ride Lee gives the reader in the final decade of Lucy's life! I was up to 2AM finishing the book up, I could not put it down!This book was poignant, written with true friendship, love for Lucy, honesty and personality. From page one upon meeting Lee, the read is made to feel that he/she is an ant sitting on Lee's shoulder experiencing all the times and visits he had with Lucy.I appreciated the fact that in telling his experiences, Lee did not glaze over any touchy moments when Lucy may not have been happy about something as well as didn't overload sugar in her good times. I found the written account to be what the experience was. What made Lucy tick? What made Lucy happy? What made Lucy laugh? What made Lucy angry? We was Lucy thinking?We got to meet people in Lucy's later life that we may not have ever met. In simplicity, Lucy the star, the icon and Queen of Comedy was in many ways an everyday person like so many of us are. The reader felt like they were having lunch with Lucy with her specialty of grilled cheese sandwiches or beans and franks. We had dinners that included her beloved Waldorf Salad.I laughed, I cried with the book. I got into an insight of her last years being married to Gary Morton that I really never contexted in the way it was. It was kind of sad as how it was, isn't what I had in mind. I think in several ways, Lucy never got over Desi.The only thing that made this reader wonder about is that we got to meet Lucie and her family and on occasion see them get together with Lucy. Desi Jr. is touched upon in several places but we never got to experience him visiting Lucy. From reading the book, I don't think it was just excluded by the author but the reader does wonder why Desi Jr. isn't around.I wholeheartedly suggest that any Lucy fan buy this book, read it, and add it to your Lucy library. This would make a WONDERFUL Christmas/Hannukah gift for the holiday season for the Lucy fan on your gift list!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Anyone who even LIKED Lucy needs to read this book. Expecting coffee table fare, I found this book to be the most touching, funny, behind-the-scenes book I have ever read!Great and surprising stories - very cool and personal photos. In a small way, I felt as if I had actually spent some time with Lucy, playing Backgammon and hearing her unique \\"Lucy view\\" of the world.Read this book and you will love Lucy even more!If anyone doesn't see how special this book is - I hope they die screaming!...Is that so wong???"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"This is not supposed to be a movie star biography. It is supposed to be one man's recollection - a love letter - of a ten year friendship with the most famous redhead of all time.Lee Tannen's loving, insightful memoir is littered with genuinely delightful moments: a true New Yorker, I loved his references to the theatergoers from New Jersey as the \\"bridge and tunnel crowd.\\"Then there's Lucy.If a mad old lady invited you to California, underfed you, gave you only iced water to drink, then kept you hostage in the pool house so she could play backgammon with you all night, what would you do?Tannen stayed.The mad old lady is Lucy. She is his obsession and besides, he enjoys backgammon - her obsession.Their verbal exchanges are hilarious. When Lee finally does win parole and insists on leaving the house to go out for breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel because he wants to see the Polo Lounge, she tells him it's crummy and he should go to the Fountain Room instead. (Lee says she was right. The food is great). A friend of Lucy's is waiting for him; she's another of Lucy's backgammon buddy (one who gets snarky when she's losing).Tannen was distantly related to Lucy but closer than some of her own family. His uncle Gary Morton (Lucy's husband) doesn't come off well but isn't exactly assaulted either.As fascinating as all this is, you know as a reader that Tannen only stayed friends because she's Lucille Ball. Some of her temper tantrums and stubbornness would send most normal people screaming out of the house straight for the airport.But through it all you see why he did and still does love Lucy. And why you now love her even more."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"From January 9, 2004 - This is such a wonderful, heartfelt, extraordinary book. I picked it up at 9:00 in the evening yesterday, expecting to read just a chapter or two. I couldn't set it down until I finished it at three in the morning, crying, of course, at the luminous quality of the work that I had just experienced. - - - January 26, 2006 - It is now over two years later and I must say that not a week goes by that I don't think about this book. The very end is heart wrenching and cathartic. It is not possible to recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Although I found the author to be somewhat creepy (what normal young man would spend so much time with a reclusive old lady?) I found the well-written depiction of Lucy's last decade to be mostly fascinating. The author is indeed a very talented writer, and it's a difficult book to put down. He does a really good job of describing life in Beverly Hills and for an aging superstar. Recommended."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I couldn't give this book low stars because I read it very quick. Meaning that there was something very fascinating about this read.However I found this book extremely disturbing on many levels. First of all this author never ever found out what Lucy was really like or even who she really was. All he does is play games with her (at her request) and idolize her.He compares everything that happens to her in real life to an &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episode. Which was not only boring to read but very very disturbing.He gets momentos from her (framed pictures) and sits around watching old &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; reruns while looking at the scripts while Lucy looks on. This is beyond creepy.The whole thing reminded me of MISERY - except Lucy was the one in control. Sort of MISERY in reverse.We never really get to know about Lee or his boyfriend. (Except they are rich) We only hear tabloid style mean jabs at Lucy's husband - very unfair because that is the ONLY way he got to know Lucy at all.It's sad when the only thing good about this book is the letter written by Lucie Arnaz to the author. It is such a sincere and nice letter. Much better than this fawning strange book.It was nice to see that Lucy had a soft sentimental as well as tough side. As Lucie Anaz put it she was &quot;only human&quot;.Fascinating but gross!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"I just ordered a bunch of Lucy books and this one arrived first. I was eager to read it and learn more about what Lucy was really like in real life. Yes, I too read the book in one sitting. Yes, I too loved Lucy and wanted to know everything that was in the book asap.Overall, I was pleased to be able to peer a little into her life offscreen. But, and this is big, big but, I cringed way too often. I totally agree with the others here who say Lee was \\"creepy\\", or \\"starstuck\\" or \\"disrespectful\\", or that the book was \\"disturbing\\". It is!First of all, it takes a good dose of chutzpa for him to say he's \\"distantly related\\" to Lucy. He is, but only by marriage and only then due to some sort of Yiddish technicality practiced in his family.Although he says he spent all this time with Lucy, it's pretty clear to me that he totally squandered it. The constant references he makes to Lucy about specific episodes made me feel bad, and sad, for Lucy. Lee Tannen, better than most, should have been able to figure out that Lucy didn't need that sort of information flung at her, especially not during this last lap of life. It was so painfully evident that he was constantly campaigning for \\"World's Best Fan\\", or \\"Best (non)Supporting Actress\\"[sic]. He has the nerve to compare his staying at Lucy's home to being locked in prison. Cringe again. The cringe moments are numerous, unfortunately. And they also apply to his \\"style\\". He jumps all over the time line, often within the same paragraph. I found myself several times having to go back and reread passages just to remember where in time we really were.As they say, it takes two to tango. So Lucy was obviously getting some benefit out of the situation. At least until she called it quits after Lee had a tantrum in a limo. It's clear that Lee never seems to get beyond the fact that he's hanging out with Lucy the Legend. So the book is actually an interesting read from that standpoint: What compelled Lucy the Legend to hang out with Lee the Leech? If you loved Lucy (and who didn't?), I say read this book. Just ignore all the creepy comments the author makes.That said, I can't wait for all the other books to get here!"},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lee's book was an illuminating look into Lucy's personality.I wasn't too surprised to learn of her &quot;control issues,&quot; and yetit was disheartening to read about Lucy's great sadness in thelast years of her life. From Lee's description, it seemed he spent more quality time with her than did her own children or husband Gary Morton.I felt Lee may have been star struck at times, but for the most part, had a genuine care and concern for Lucy. I have been a Lucy fan for many years and this is the perfect book for any Lucy fan.Lee either has a wonderful memory for detail, or kept a journal as conversations are remembered clearly as well as facts/dates, etc.Lucy wasn't always the nicest person in real life, but she will always reign as the Queen of Comedy."},{"Title":"I Loved Lucy: My Friendship With Lucille Ball","review":"Lucille Ball played Mame Dennis onscreen and was savaged by the critics! As author Lee Tannen makes very clear in this book - Lucille Ball was Auntie Mame.We learn firsthand how Lucy drove, cooked, swore, and lived. Tannen's word pictures place us front and center during the last decade of Lucy's life. We find out finally why she did her ill-fated series 'Life With Lucy.'
