Crazy ingredient ideas & great discussion/explanations on how they affect your brews. I keep re-reading sections all the time. I like how Mosher gives a recipe, but doesn't lecture you on nailing a certain stlye and gives suggestions how to tweak it to your own desires. Screw styles, brew what tastes good to you. This book helps you do that.This book saved me a lot of time and money by not brewing several batches I probably would not have liked by telling me what ingredients impart to beer. A must read for intermediate homebrewers."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Randy has certainly done a great job of pulling together info and techniques for a wide variety of brewing ingredients. If find myself looking through this book quite often when looking for a certain flavor or wanting to experiment with a different ingredient in my next brew. I wish there was more info on sources for some of the stuff (I'm about out of a few things I got from Randy couple years ago!)but most stuff is readily available."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"The strange title fits. It is written with wit, humor, passion and loads of knowledge. I've got a couple dozen brewing books, but I keep coming back to this one.Like others, it covers the basics of techniques. Each chapter examines a different genera of beer, origins of similar beers, how they were brewed, how they evolved, how to brew similar beers (both all-grain and extract) and how you might personalize them. While Ray Daniels does a great job of nailing a style, Randy Mosher pushes well beyond the boundaries of defined styles and inspires you to be creative.Do you want to know how to use an unusual adjunct? How about the qualities of various spices? Fruits? Stranger ingredients? Randy provides example of historical brews using stuff I never would have dreamed of putting into my beer, and leaves you eager to try something new."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This book is awesome. If you are like me, and you don't listen to what the other brewing authors say about perfecting a few beers that you like, read this one. I hardly ever brew the same beer twice, and I like experimentation. This book will pave way for many new ideas and tasty new brews. There are a few inaccuracies and typos in the book. For example, altitude does change the boiling point of water. However, the few mistakes are far shadowed by the excellent writing and research that went into this book. If you brew with a lot of odd ingredients like I do, you will have to pick this one up."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I've been rebuilding my brewing library on my Kindle since the fall. I find it convenient on brew days to have what amounts to a reference library in my pocket.Unfortunately, Radical Brewing for Kindle is a complete disappointment: it is both poorly edited and poorly formatted. Spelling mistakes abound. Some of the lambic section is entirely, if humorously, unreadable, \\"entire rather than using a bf Immediately 20 percent of the mash years ago.\\" Location 7085. Other formatting problems can only be fixed by setting my Kindle to the smallest font.To add insult to injury, the index, an essential part of any reference book, does not include links or even location numbers. It is, simply, a list of words.Do not buy the Kindle version. It's a shame since the dead tree version has become a staple of many brewers' shelves.Edit: the Kindle version was taken down several weeks ago pending revision."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This is a great book, and I agree with the majority of other reviewers in that Papazian or Palmer are the books to learn from. However, I would like to point out that there are many numerical inaccuracies - for example, pg 105 in the recipe for Polka Dot Pilsener: \\"1.25 quarts of water per pound or .53 liters per kilogram\\". This gives a mash ratio of 2.08:1 in US measurements but 0.53:1 in metric. People reading this book are most likely experienced enough to recognise the problem, but it's frustrating nonetheless and would seriously mess with a beginner."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"There's a reason this book gets 22 five-star and 3 four-star reviews here. When your worst review is four stars, you're doing something very right!And Mosher does everything right here. I've been brewing my own beer for a few years now, and if I had to keep one book on homebrewing, this would be it. Yes, Palmer's book is thorough and a great intro, as is Papazian's, but Mosher goes so much deeper into the history of brewing and how it relates to the many wonderfully varied recipes here that this is easily the brewbook I open time and again, while the others merely rest on the shelf.Plus, Randy is just a flat-out great writer. He makes you laugh on most every page while informing at a remarkable rate. The pictures are constantly entertaining and enlightening as to the history of our fine art, and the layout is top-notch. There is in fact not one single thing I can say against this fine tome...except that I would like another dozen just like it!Well done, Mr. Mosher. You have created a true classic."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I just started home brewing, and I want more--Randy Mosher's book gives me that. This book gives a full spectrum on brewing, from the history to the chemistry to tons of recipes for creating many different types of beer. This guy has a great sense of humor, and the book is also very visually engaging. This book answered many of my questions about how beer brewing works and what to do and what not to do. Most of the recipes he gives have instructions for beginners and advanced brewers, so this book can definitely \\"grow\\" with you. I would suggest brewing a few batches first, before trying the more advanced techniques, and/or purchasing the other books described in these reviews as companions. I was really happy to see that there are so many possibilities for home brew, and the author's enthusiasm motivates me to try them. A great book!"},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I read through other reviews before purchasing this book. This is for sure the book for my dad. He has had a home brew kit for probably 10 or more years.

I appreciate his factual information as well as offering his personal experiences and opinions. Eye-opening information on different brews, including different grains, fruits, sugars that really expand your brewers palate. Some Authentic (complex and time consuming) brewing process as well as practical ones. Lots of on-the-edge recipes are given in this book. My third batch was a recipe I developed with guidance from this book. There is also a section on equipment that was very useful.What I would have liked: Formulas for calculating Grain Bill based on target OG."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I think the great thing about this book is that it focuses on using more malts than I normally use to devlop rich and complex beers. It discusses some techniques about how to get richer beers. One particular technique was using the wort from half a batch of a big brew (using 20+ lb of grain) as the mash in water for the second half of grain. This is praticularly helpful for people using 5-gallon Gatorade coolers as mash tuns to make really big beers.I found it funny how the writer doesn't really care for American hops, or appears not to discuss American-style IPAs and the hop bombs that they have become. I wasn't looking for any guidance on that style, but just wanted to let those of you who were hoping for something new on that style out of this book: it ain't there.Great historical stuff as well. I recommend this after reading How to Brew, and Brewing Classic Styles."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I haven't finished reading this book I have been reading various sections I had curiosity in. Then realized this is actually a pretty good read, it goes through various sections explaining how certain typs of beer were brewed in the past (hundreds of years ago we're talking here) as well as the recipes for these beers. He also covers in detail typs of hops and what they do to your beer and your hops and barley as well as how to roast/smoke them yourself.Anyways to shorten this I think its a great addition to your homebrew library and essential addition to How to Brew: Everything You Need To Know To Brew Beer Right The First Time which is a perfect reference manual."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"I have been brewing for about 20 years. I took the typical route from kit through extract to all grain. I thought I knew enough to make good beer, even formulating my own recipes and cloning beer from information gleaned on the web of commercial beers I liked.Mosher's book showed me that there is always more to learn. His writing style is witty, but the information on the nuances, the composing of brews, arranging and layering the ingredients like a well written symphony, is what I took away.Who knew that Fenugeek could be used in beer. I rushed to my spice cabinet and sure enough, the maple aroma and subtle flavor would add a lot to the right beer. Who knew? Mosher knew. Now I know. There are a lot of gems in the book. Suggestions, hints, inside tips. Well worth the money. Papizans book was my starting point, but in truth, I have not opened the book in over ten years or more. The basics are the basics. Just like any art, you have to have a good grasp of the basics in order to reach the next level.This book assumes that the reader already has that basic knowledge, and I believe even makes that statement early on, but even a novice can benefit from his treatments of the basics like water chemistry, mashing, color, hops and yeast. While other books for beginner simplify things, they may do a disservice in glossing over things in the interest of simplicity and there by lead the novice brewer into the mindfield of failure. The novice then fails to produce beer up to his expectations, and does not know why when it might be as simple as the water he takes from his tap, or the bottles he chooses to use.I remember my early brewing days. I made a maerzen from extract, lagered it bottled it and then in my stupidity left it out on my deck to bake in the Houston sun for a day. It was the only skunky beer I ever made and was still palatable to some of my less discerning friends. I learned two things, one about myself: don't cut corners, and don't get lazy. The second I learned about my beer drinking friends: Don't cast pearls before swine. Henceforth, I kept the good stuff for myself and served them the rest. Anyone who could drink the skunky mess I made by my own stupidity, could not really appreciate a good home craft made beer.Those novice brewers who use plastic coke bottles or green glass bottles need to know that some of thier bad beer may not be due to their brewing, but rather listening to other so called brew gurus' who advocate using those types of bottles for home brewing. If you take the time to brew it, invest the money in doing it right.This book teaches those lessons."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"Great read with a well designed layout. Randy Mosher takes you on an interesting journey with a topic many have done blandly.

Mosher, in fun, exciting prose, lays out a large swath of brewing techniques, providing lots of information and handy references. AfterThe Complete Joy of Homebrewing Third Edition (Harperresource Book), this is the best book you can buy on the subject. Far more than simply a beer recipe book, Radical Brewing explains different brewing processes in depth, with recipes to highlight these lessons.

I love the endless amount of facts on unique brews and beer culture. Being a history geek and a brewer this book hit the bullseye on both accounts.

Print them out and place in your book."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This book is full of useful information. Its a great read if you are interested in the complete history of beer.Written in a relaxed easy reading style, I love this book."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"This probably isn't a good introductory homebrewing book unless you learned a decent amount about the topic from another source first. Mosher includes a walkthrough on your first brew, but it feels rushed (I do like his first beer recipe). Radical Brewing is more suitable for experienced brewers looking for recipes or, even better, desiring to create their own. I'm actually a conservative brewer, mostly preferring to stick with malt, hops, yeast and water, but I still find this book helpful and fun.Mosher has his own preferences which I don't always agree with. He's down on dry yeast and high AA hops (even for bittering), and mistrustful of blow-off tubes. He has a serious sweet tooth: check out the levels of crystals and the high FGs, which you can calculate given the OGs and ABVs. More troublesome are the errors. Be sure to check the corrections online."},{"Title":"Radical Brewing: Recipes, Tales and World-Altering Meditations in a Glass","review":"If you brew beer or are planning to, this book is full of useful info for recipes and ingredients.

However , I found the book to be stuck in exactly that era...It seemed kind of dated and predictable. The items used to construct the molds (which is what most people want to know) was state of the art...(in 1945) when they were building Jeep Willys. However, I really have no interest in doing things the &quot;hard&quot; way. Since I have no access to a vacuum formed mold I have to build one myself. The book has a guy using plaster of paris to make his mold (full scale!!) and another picture using clay. This would probably cost about 2000 dollars just to make the mold of clay, but the plaster of paris is a designers nightmare to work with. It absorbs water, is messy and really is to tedius to deal with on a full scale. I wanted to know how to use TODAYS materials not Ronald Reagan's when he was 17. Overall the book (wasn't that helpful). I would love to find a real book that designers use or private kit car builders use...any ideas? guess I'll just have to be an apprentice in a auto shop to learn the real deal. This will be quite a neat trick to do since I am a full time professional during the week."},{"Title":"Glass fiber auto body construction simplified","review":"OK, first off, let me say that this is a photocopy of an original book. The photograph reproduction does leave a bit to be desired. But pretty pictures is not why you're going to buy this book. You will buy this book because it is full of *useful* information.The techniques illustrated in this book go back to the birth of the fiberglass auto body industry in the 1950's, and to be quite honest, things haven't changed all that much since then. Sure, the resins have gotten better, they're stronger, and they won't destroy your central nervous system with a single whiff. The techniques shown also won't need the Bank of Monte Carlo to finance your dream project. You could use CNC milled patterns for your carbody and spend upwards of $10,000 US to get them, or you could follow the plaster over plywood method outlined in this book and put the other $9,500 in your piggy bank.Buy the book, it's money well spent if you'd like to get into this interesting and enjoyable field."},{"Title":"Glass fiber auto body construction simplified","review":"Its a good book, and have some good tecnichs in it.I personally good a couple of ideas to make some changes on my project because of this book.I really recommend it!"},{"Title":"JAMES MARSHALL'S MOTHER GOOSE","review":"I picked up this book at a used library book sale and have just been thrilled with it. The choice of rhymes includes both the old favorites and some unfamiliar ones. The illustrations are hysterical and add such a flavor to the lines. We started reading this to our 1 year old daughter when she was a newborn and now just quoting the rhymes is enough to calm her in the midst of any distress. My husband and I are constantly finding different nuances in the illustrations that make it a pleasure for us to read to our daughter again and again and again. Finally, I applaud Mr. Marshall's choice of the upbeat, nonviolent nursery rhymes which lend themselves to years of retelling without having to explain some of the darkness of other Mother Goose rhymes.

That was six years ago, and I still refer back to Dr. Stevens' book when I translate. His textbook is not overly-simplified, nor does it innundate the student with grammatical jargon. Aiming for the first year student, Dr. Stevens has hit his target audience with precision. Some of the most useful tools in the whole of the book are found in the lists and paradigms found in the appendecies. A brilliant accomplishment by Dr. Stevens."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek","review":"Steven's approach to teaching Greek grammar is concise and practical. His didactic methodology provides a map for the lost Greek student. Charts and summaries aid in clarity. At times some of the technical discussion can be overwhelming for the beginner. However, the text remains a reference work for Greek students long after they are through with their course work. Best of all, Stevens explains Greek grammar with a sense of humor. At times this is all that keeps a student going.

Like the authors of that classic self-help manual for the man-crazy, rosemary sullivan understands the ways in which love drives women mad. by looking at literature &amp; movies, sullivan identifies the love stories that make women a bit stupid, the stories that help us to confuse fantasy with reality. but sullivan offers neither advice for navigating through these narratives to marriage -- a la The Rules -- nor does she teach us how to steer clear of the doomed romance altogether. rather, she analyzes the tragic love story as the female version of the hero's quest, &amp; celebrates it as a revelatory life experience. Labyrinth of Desire is erudite, insightful, deliciously compassionate, &amp; ultimately empowering."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Desire: Women, Passion, and Romantic Obsession","review":"A romantic at heart, this book provided a new insight into love and it's many forms - and an explanation for why some girls (and guys) fall in love so quickly, passionately, and often. Her description of the two main types of romantic love (mainly focusing on obsessive romantic love a.k.a. short-term, lustful love) via storytelling is both entricate and easy to understand. Anyone who has ever been in love can relate to this, and it certainly provides a medium for exploring not only the loves we have had and may have, but also views of love and ourselves. A must read for all lovers the world over."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Desire: Women, Passion, and Romantic Obsession","review":"\\"My sense of romantic love inevitably involves obsession. It occurs when we meet the person we feel is essential for our life. Without that person, we will die. It happens when life stops us suddenly in our tracks and we love in a way we didn't know was possible.\\" ~ pg. 4Rosemary Sullivan explores more than obsessive love in her unique personal story which becomes as much an unveiling of her own world as an understanding of the search for ourselves by becoming obsessed with another. Throughout \\"Labyrinth of Desire,\\" she paints erotic portraits of feminine longing and uses the colors of a short story to paint larger pictures within a world of spontaneous choices and unrestrained desire.I started to read this book in bed one night while my husband was looking up something on a map and I was amusing myself by reading him sentences so he could look up various locations in the initial story. A woman becomes obsessed with a man while she is on an adventure in Mexico. This leads to a discussion of what actually occurred within the relationship and why it eventually ended in disaster. Or did it end badly? Rosemary Sullivan has a few intriguing ideas about why we fall madly in love and how it can birth the self.Within the \\"almost confessional\\" personal revelations, excerpts from her diary, pop culture references, quotes from famous artists, passages from novels, witty conversations in movies, secrets between friends and intriguing memories from her world travels, Rosemary Sullivan reveals that she at times misses the \\"waking up of the world.\\"For anyone who has experienced obsessive love or even just falling in love without complete obsession, this will present intrigue. Although, I must admit that an especially artistic movie can produce a similar \\"awakening\\" to the world. Colors become more vibrant, you notice the steam on a cup of coffee, the sun feels warmer on your skin, you long to sit in the sun as if it was some invisible connection between you and your lover.The most revealing aspect of this book may be the information on how she despises one type of romantic love and embraces a wilder more provocative expression. Needless to say, there is something warm and beautiful in this book, although it can at times read like a conversation between friends discussing their favorite lovers, movies and world travels.This book will be quite enjoyable to anyone who has ever wished to be an artist's muse. I think at the heart, this entire concept of obsessive love is birthed from our desire to be needed and validated. Why else would be long to be needed when so deeply obsessed with the object of our affection? Or does a sense of security make us feel that this magical space in our own little world will continue indefinitely?While falling madly in love has its seductive beauty, resisting when inappropriate reveals entirely new facets of your soul's strength. Obsessive love is a little dangerous and it could destroy your life and that may also be its appeal.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Desire: Women, Passion, and Romantic Obsession","review":"Wonderful, thoughtful book that I wish someone had given me long ago.

Intoxicating."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Desire: Women, Passion, and Romantic Obsession","review":"&quot;Labyrinth of Desire&quot; by Rosemary Sullivan offers an insightful look into women in obessive relationships, exploring the during and aftermath, picking apart what really happens and why. An interesting and novel look at something we all wonder about. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Labyrinth of Desire: Women, Passion, and Romantic Obsession","review":"Sullivan packs a lot of insight and breadth of knowledge into this little book, which is such a refreshing antedote to such pop-psych fluff of the \\"Women Who Love Too Much\\", \\"Venus/Mars\\" ilk. She looks at obsessive love with a critical and erudite, yet sympathetic eye, never simply pathologizing, but properly deconstructing it in cultural and psychological contexts.

Not only is Sullivan unaware of these studies, but she also seems to either dismiss, or lack knowledge of, the folk wisdom of centuries. She writes well of what she calls the \\"obsessive\\" romantic love that women seek, and of their anguish, grief and loss when this love ends. She writes of gifted, strong women who subjugate their own talents and careers to those of men.She does not factor into her analysis the fact that women, as mammalian creatures, are hardwired physiologically and hormonally for connectedness. Yes, we are more than mere animals, but a good starting point in searching for reasons for women's behavior is to look at our physical makeup. Without women's need to be connected to a man, to bear and to nurture children, to cherish family and community ties, our species would soon become extinct.At the emotional core of a woman is not just \\"obsessive\\" love for a man, not just romantic passion for physical lovemaking, but also the fierce, unending, protecting and nurturing love of a mother for her children.Women soon learn that they need the structures of society, especially those pertaining to marriage and the family, to sustain their search for personal fulfillment. Wise women (including those who have had to learn the hard way) know that they trespass outside these structures at their own peril.Yes, romantic love is wonderful, and falling in love is an unforgettable, defining experience; but especially for women, that experience is only the prelude to a rich and satisfying life."},{"Title":"The Twelfth Garfield Fat Cat 3-Pack (Garfield Fat Cat Three Pack)","review":"I am too old for comic books but I simply love Garfield.

Eventually the suicide-prone, self-loathing cat which we as a society find quite the jester winds his way through the high road to alienation, much like a Puccini character. The subtle irony of Garfield's monumental epiphany finally places Garfield at the pinnacle of the newly formed triumvirate, and finally, societal acceptance. In this way, Garfield becomes so cynical that he adopts an anti-cynical work ethic in order to preach his intellectual treatise to the masses, thus eventually compromising his own moral barometer in the worst way. Like Icarus, Garfield flies too close to the brilliant heat of personal ulra-rationalism, and winds up destroying himself via his self-enforced taboo of social acceptance. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Instant Business Japanese: Real Life Skills for Real Life Situations","review":"As a beginning learner, I expected this book to be a bit more structured vs diving right into complex sentences and phrases.For me personally, this book would have been more helpful to focus on everyday usage in the office place, as opposed to focusing on a specfic business situation (financial turnaround).For intermediate speakers already accustomed to the language, you may find this book useful.

However, as soon as I started reading this book it was obvious that the author Singular delves to far into self indulgence time and time again.At times it seems he is simply writing just for the sake of writing, often times describing the weather and a truly ridiculous paragraph about a certain crop that was imported into the Wichita area. And there is also a strong christian viewpoint the author is writing from, which grows rather tiresome.For anyone that is interested in true crime books, pass on this one, or at least wait until it comes out in paperback (I wasted over $20.00 dollars on this book)."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"This book rehashes a lot of what was in the press, and offers very little insight into this notorious case. The author seems to have had access only to a kooky local psychologist and to Rader's pastor, so don't look for detail about the police or their investigation. The emphasis on the minister is so extensive that the story almost becomes his - a struggle by the educated, liberal Christian to comprehend evil.There's some sensitive writing on this topic, and about the time and place that produced Dennis Rader, but I doubt many true crime readers will find this satisfying. This odd emphasis, along with some clunky writing and weird vocabulary (\\"fiercesome\\"?) keep this from being a necessary read.I'm hoping for something better on this case."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"I was hoping for something that would delve into the mind of a serial killer.

This book is a total disappointment.The author does not do much research on the subject, does not tell much about the monster's family history, no info about his daily life style, no testimonies from his neighbours, colleges or relatives.The book has 304 pages, with this much pages I expect much more info about dennis' life, in fact the author put pastor Clark as the centre of the story, not dennis rader as the monster.The fotographs in the book are very minimal and boring as they are widely available on the net, anyone can have access to more pictures on the net.The author seemed to have a quick interview with pastor Clark (dennis' pastor), but the info that he got from the pastor is totally not relevan with the crimes dennis commited.I think the author should've put the title as \\"Pastor Clark\\", not the \\"BTK\\".I am angry as hell and wish to have my money back, it is very very disappointing!

Next, he adds input from a local psychologist who has been suspected in the past of being BTK himself and NOT because his profiles have been accurate, they've been wrong, but because his profiles reflect his own suppressed feelings of self.Admittedly, the book is well written, but other than the fact it is about a real criminal whose real crimes are all of public record, it should not be labeled as true crime, but more along the lines of fiction. He has never interviewed the subject of his book who he in his own words admits is a man who lived inside his own world and never talked with anyone about his real self.If you're interested in a good read, but don't care about facts, this book is okay. As for myself, I would recommend waiting for a more accurate depiction of the story to come out."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"This version is very disappointing. It seems to focus more on the people within Rader's Luthern Church than on his evil pathology.

Both books are excellent reading if you like true crime."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"Stephen Singular has not had one single interview with Dennis Rader. Someone who HAS interviewed Dennis Rader several times a week for over a year now will be writing a book and it will be out next year. In fact, there are two authors, including this one, that will have true, accurate and detailed facts out towards the first part of 2007.Stephen Singular medeled his way into a community not used to this kind of high profile association and manipulated everyone he could to get information in order to write about anything he could to make a profit. Singular took a few public facts, an interview with Pastor Clark who was NOT trusted by Dennis Rader and had only been head of Christ Lutheran's congregation for three years at the time of the arrest - comingled these and made up the rest.It's no wonder the \\"task force\\" member he mentions wishes to remain anonymous because information was passed to Singualr from this person that was proprietary to someone else and this information was misused and reported inaccurately. If this task force member was made known, he'd be subject to immense litigation (and should be held accountable).Overall, save your money and wait to read a book from someone who really knows the facts. Dennis Rader was a person who lived in his own world his entire life. He has only revealed both sides of himself to one person - and that person is NOT Stephen Singular."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"What's with this Singular guy? He's not only wireless but clueless. I'm barely past the first few chapters and already I'm sick of his Christian-bashing and Red State belittling. I doubt very seriously that the \\"repressed\\" and \\"Conservative\\" mileau that Mr. Radner lived in was responsible for his \\"alternative life-style choices\\". Sheesh! Just stick to the facts of the case, Bud!"},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"Well the book was alright but I just don't find Dennis Radar, the BTK, interesting. He is just a fat, bald, ugly, boring guy who killed a few woman and masterbates alot. Aside from the killing part, that probably describes most of the people reading this book, including me."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"Stephen Singular has had no personal contact with the subject person of his book. He has admitted this when confronted at book signings. He speaks with no authority whatsoever and merely repeats whatever tidbits of gossip he can pick up.Here's another fact: Stehen Singular completely blames Pastor Clark for his belief in demon possession. However, Singular is the one who approached Pastor Clark with the idea in the first place and purported to be an expert on demon possession. Also, the first letter that Singular wrote to Dennis Rader purports the same thing - and he used his so-called \\"experience\\" in demon possession to get interviews. Rader isn't the smartest crayon in the box, but at least he was smart enough not to fall for Singular's line.Singular writes well, but he has no integrity. Save your money and wait for the real truth to come out."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"Since the BTK perpetrator's ex-wife and adult children are not willing to talk about life with their father, who killed 10 people over 17 years and then went another 14 before being caught, author Singular chose to emphasize the effects of Dennis Rader's confession on his pastor and friends from Christ Lutheran Church in Park City, Ks. Yet there is plenty in here about his victims, and their survivor's pain. While it would be helpful to know more about Rader's childhood, or his life behind the closed doors of his home during his killing years, all a writer can do is work with the materials he has available. In this case, the betrayed friends, along with Rader's extensive confessions, souvenir collection, dairies of his crimes, notes and drawings and photos are what Mr. Singular had to work with. Given those limits, he does a nice job of explaining BTK's saga. Dennis Rader was incredibly lucky in his career as a serial killer. He was no master criminal, and most of his murders featured mistakes and misfortune for his plans. He seems to have escaped detection only because he was so \\"normal\\" and \\"boring\\" and \\"unimportant\\" in his family and professional life. His undoing was his ego and impatience and his impulsive, compulsive need to explain how brilliant he thought himself to be. At the time of his capture, he was a city employee, supervising compliance with ordinances that required citations but not arrests---a non-professional enforcer of the most minor of laws, so to speak. He was also newly-elected president of the board of his church, to which he was devoted for decades. He led the Cub scouts, was a veteran, and voted Republican. He was exactly the kind of person one would never suspect of being compelled to kill a family of four, and then six adult women over a span of many years. How and why he did what he did, and how and why he was caught, and how and why he decided to confess, are covered here. It is not a pleasant read, but I did find it a compelling one."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"Even people who don't read true crime novels may be drawn to this book because BTK was such a mystery.Why wasn't he caught for three decades? Profilers depend upon studies showing what other, previous serial killers were like. So the police were looking for a loner, someone in and out of work, someone with a history of violence, perhaps someone who had grown up abused.But BTK was a happily married man with children, and did meticulous work as a compliance officer. Furthermore, he was heavily involved in the local Lutheran church. Unknown to all his friends and relatives this seemingly bland man also liked to hunt, torture, and kill people.Where did this murderous side of him come from? He wasn't abused as a child. He himself claimed, variously, that 1) he had fallen on his head when young and it may have disturbed neurological pathways, or, 2) there was a darker side within him, almost another person, who wanted to do these things.Whatever the cause, the shrinks certainly proved themselves useless at explaining or helping BTK. Dr Brodsky can only say, \\"'A more liberal theology...baser instincts need a way to surface...a man with a very limited sexual history...There was no other outlet for him because of his religious background'\\" (p 223-4). Dr Brodsky's remarks were idiotic. BTK was torturing and murdering animals in his childhood. And it was murder and torture he wanted later on, too, not the extramarital affairs that the dimwitted Dr. Brodsky thought might have helped him.The wreckage that BTK left in his path is staggering. The relatives and friends of his victims will never for forget, nor will BTK's own wife and children. The only hero in the story is the Lutheran pastor, who overcame his own rage and dismay at the crimes, and went on to practice his Christian beliefs by visiting BTK frequently.Still, the mystery is left unaswered. BTK murdered people. Why? There is no answer, other than that he chose to."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"\\"Unholy Messenger\\" provides much more than a true crime re-telling of one of the most frightening serial killer attacks in American history.Stephen Singular takes the hard road of reporting and gives us a thorough portrait of Dennis Rader from all perspectives--his upbringing, psychological makeup and religious beliefs. \\"Unholy Messenger\\" is not just crime and cops, it's a thorough look at the layers of American life and how they may have come to bear on one extremely warped individual.Singular's approach is exhaustive and, in the end, you are left with an eerie glimpse inside Rader's evil mind. It's not a fun place to hang out. \\"Unholy Messenger\\" offers a vivid portrait of an individual who went to great lengths to repress his homosexuality and even greater lengths to express his \\"barbarically anti-female\\" view of the world.Contrast is what makes the \\"BTK\\" case so incomprehensible--a family man and prominent church leader who managed for three decades to keep hidden a sporadic series of horrific murders in and around Wichita, Kansas.There's plenty of material in the murders and the years and years of fruitless investigations as \\"BTK\\" surfaced off and on for decades. Singular doesn't skip any of this, including a gripping account of the psychological cat-and-mouse game that police played with Rader prior to his arrest in 2005.With his razor-sharp writing style, Singular does two things in \\"Unholy Messenger\\" that elevate this above the average true-crime rehash.First, he details the strict and pervasive religious environment of Wichita and the religious teachings of Rader's church. Religion isn't just a backdrop--something mentioned in a few paragraphs in the scene-setting stuff and then forgotten, it's interwoven into the entire tapestry of the book. Singular includes a compelling portrait of Pastor Michael Clark, who probably knew Rader better than anyone outside his home (or maybe better than anyone at all, given what little we know about Rader's wife, Paula). Two days after Rader's arrest (on a Friday), Clark had the unenviable task of delivering a sermon for his congregation to help them comprehend (perhaps to help himself comprehend) how one of their own church \\"leaders\\" could also have committed such heinous acts--and kept them hidden for so long. When Singular includes the text of the sermon word-for-word, non-judgmentally, it's compelling stuff. (Not surprisingly, the arrest of Rader is seen by Pastor Clark as an opportunity for renewal and healing: \\"Let us become the strong in faith, in love, and in hope.\\")Second, Singular includes compelling commentary from experts to help us understand Rader's exceedingly complex mental makeup--one part fastidiously organized and based in doing the right things, the other uncontrollable, unacceptable and wicked beyond belief. Singular checks in with a variety of psychology experts and scientists for the current scientific thinking that would explain one man's ability to manage such disparate, sharply contrasting lives.\\"Normally, I'm a pretty nice guy,\\" he told the investigators. \\"I'm sorry, but I am. I've raised kids. I had a wife, president of the church, been in Scouts. It goes on and on and on, but I have a mean streak and it occasionally flares up.\\"I wasn't sure I wanted to understand Rader before starting \\"Unholy Messenger.\\" Shortly after finishing, I read a newspaper story about a brutal sexual assault and having read \\"Unholy Messenger,\\" wondered if we are doing enough to understand intense antisocial behavior.\\"Unholy Messenger\\" takes a close look at one of the most depraved series of crimes in modern times. The book makes us wonder if our institutions--state, church, science, health, education, and the media--are doing everything they can to prevent a reoccurrence."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"The critical reviews are nonsense; this is a well-written and compelling story.

A totally shameless attempt to capitalize on the terrible decades of fear lived by the citizens of Wichita, Kansas.The book is a rehash of material that has been spun ad-nauseum through a number of similar accounts. The problem here, however, is that much of the information which the author seems to take as given is simply not based on fact. He seems to surround much of his story with surmise.The Booklist reviews it as \\"riveting....macabre.....scary\\". This reviewer would have to say, \\"not reviting .... not all that macabre .... and definitely not scary\\", rather \\"same-same-same, wrong-wrong and mostly boring-boring-boring\\".A total hack attempt at documentary journalism.

Rader had planned to write his own book on the topic (placed on a CD and released on his death), and the article told of a lawyer doing so.Two months later Dennis Rader sent a letter to the paper, which passed it on to the Wichita P.D. (WPD). Inside was a copy of a driver's license and photos of a 15-year-old murder. The WPD reopened the case, and employed the latest DNA technology on material in the letter and at the crime scene, and swabbed about 1,600 potential suspects in Wichita - the wrong city (Rader lived in nearby Park City). More fruitfully, the WPD began trying to open dialogue with BTK. Meanwhile, profiles argued and disagreed.Rader's early years included killing small animals and fascination with crime scenes showing bound females. He later served in the A.F., married, and joined Christ Lutheran Church - hoping they would rid him of his other self. Unfortunately, the other personality prevailed, and a family of four (the wife had been a former co-worker) became his first murder victims. The total eventually rose to ten before mysteriously ending in '91.The \\"good news\\" is that Rader's ego got the best of him, he continued the dialogue, and eventually decided to send in a computer disk as part of his WPD taunting. Naively he had asked the WPD if using an \\"erased\\" disk would reveal anything about him - they said \\"No,\\" and he later felt betrayed to find out that the disk pointed them to Christ Luthern Church (he was president of its council) and someone named \\"Dennis.\\"Rader confessed, avoided the death penalty (not in effect at the time of the crimes), and was sentenced to life. Everyone who knew him was shocked - he had also been a low-level public official, and a Scout leader. (One of his murders was committed while on a Scout outing.) Thirteen months after reading the 2004 article, BTK was no longer a threat to the Wichita community."},{"Title":"Unholy Messenger: The Life and Crimes of the BTK Serial Killer","review":"To me the interviews with Clark and the investigators were the only interesting parts of this book.

I ordered this book, and the cover is very bland, just blue with the title and author. I have no idea why they show a photograph of this beautiful cover art on this page. Also, despite the book being described as \\"Like New\\" and covered in shrink wrap, my copy arrived with greasy smudges all over the cover."},{"Title":"Canary in a Cat House","review":"A brief collection of some of Vonnegut's earliest (and finest) short fiction. Of course all this and much more is available in the mass-market paperback \\"Welcome to the Monkey House\\" which includes a great deal of additional material (not all of it good) so this volume is exclusively for book-collectors rather than readers. The only story in this collection not available in \\"Monkey House\\" is the forgettable \\"Hal Irwin's Magic Lamp\\", which even Vonnegut scholars will be hard-pressed to take any interest in. All that aside, there are some terrific stories here.Vonnegut can be sentimental as in \\"D. P.\\" about a Displaced Person and \\"The Manned Missiles\\" which imagines an early space flight, but the pathos of these stories seems more awkward than artistic - some readers may not appreciate having their emotions manipulated quite so blatantly. More successful are his forays into science-fiction-based morality tales, such as \\"Report on the Barnhouse Effect\\" (military application of telekinesis) \\"Unready to Wear\\" (transcending the flesh) \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow\\" (challenges of overpopulation) and \\"The Euphio Question\\" (happiness by the kilowatt). These stories show Vonnegut at his best: funny, inventive, philosophical, often even hopeful - a far cry from that universe-crushes-damaged-puppets trip that mars so many of his novels - so science fiction fans not familiar with the Master's work would do well to start here."},{"Title":"Canary in a Cat House","review":"I was disappointed when I read this book, because almost all of the stories were in Welcome to the Monkey House.

I was really hoping for a brief synopsis of each episode. That would make for a much bigger book, granted, but also a more useful one. We are talking about nearly 300 episodes here - some of us (and even historians) might need a little help.This might be excusable if the episode writeups were lighter on opinion and heavier on relevant information. \\"The Guarnerius Caper,\\" for example, is the story of a Soviet violinist whose instrument is stolen, causing considerable diplomatic discomfort. Hawaii Five-O often did episodes about political relations with make-believe nations; this is one of the few episodes that acknowledges real-life politics: the Cold War. Is any of this mentioned in Rhodes's discussion of the episode? Sadly, no.Thus, as a \\"critical history,\\" it is even more disappointing than the episode guide. It's a sketchy history at best, and reads more like a fan's personal memoir. Criticism is far more credible when the author tries to be objective; at times it seems Rhodes is writing a love poem to Steve McGarrett (and/or Jack Lord). She makes a catty remark about someone who quit the show to pursue other interests (Zulu wanted to do comedy), and editorializes on the worthlessness of basketball (the show was sometimes pre-empted by basketball during its original run).She also makes nonsensical observations. For example, she says it was a sad social comment that \\"The Child Stealers\\" passed up a healthy Asian boy in favor of a white one. Since neither of the kidnappers were Asian and they were trying to pass off the kidnapped children as their own, it wasn't sad - it was necessary.)Nevertheless, I do feel the book's a keeper. No one else has taken the time to compile a book like this, and it was sorely needed. While it comes up short both as an episode guide and as a critical history, it's still a good read. There are fewer photos than some of us would like (I'll look again, but I don't recall seeing any photos of Duke or Ben), but many of the photos are rarities, and that was a treat. Rhodes's enthusiasm leaves objectivity by the wayside, but it also gives the book a lively voice that makes you want to bask in the genius of one episode after another. The book was written with care and love, and it shows."},{"Title":"Booking Hawaii Five-O : An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968-1980 Television Detective Series","review":"I have been a longtime Hawaii Five - O fan and was delighted to hear that someone had finally done an episode guide and critical review of the long running series. But, I'm sorry to say, this ain't it, folks. The author has already explained why she could not meet with the stars and crew for research on this book, making one wonder, frankly, why the publisher bought it. As an episode guide it is only so-so; most of the symposis are sketchy at best, assuming one already has a knowledge of all 12 years worth of episodes. The 'critical review' part of the book is primarily recitations of likes and dislikes by the author and her friends. Some are perfectly valid and some are unbelievably trivial. Note the thrashing the final episode Woe To Wo Fat receives. Although not a strong episode to begin with, the author totally misses the point to the ending - it's tongue in cheek! After 12 years, I think 5-0 was entitled to a laugh, especially when Wo pulls out the proverbial file while in jail. There is nothing in the book that cannot be gleaned by public resources, i.e. old magazine articles, Honolulu newspapers, etc. Perhaps the author had more sources than this - maybe these were the items 'deleted' by the publisher, but the end result is a rather bland, overpriced episode guide.

This book lists each episode title with credits. Then it makes commentary on each episode and only in a rare few cases does it describe the episode. It assumes that you already know each episode. Descriptions of most of the episodes just don't exist in this book. What an expensive disappointment!

I liked the summary of each episode and little insights into each story and some of the actors. It is surprising that more hasn't been written about Hawaii Five-O since it was the longest running police show in TV history (12 years). Periodic reunions of the cast of Hawaii Five-O are held. The last one that I know of was in 1996 held both in Los Angeles and Honolulu. James MacArthur was in attendance at both locations as was Herman Weidemeyer and others. The reunion was open to the general public for a nominal fee. I would like to know when the next reunion is going to be. MacArthur is 58 years old and lives in Palm Desert, CA near Palm Springs.

Karen Rhodes has written a well-researched history of the show and its episodes. My copy will no doubt be well-thumbed in no time.The introductory chapters are insightful, placing &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in the context of its times and analyzing its place in the police drama genre. Introductions to each season's episodes give the reader a behind-the-scenes look. I especially enjoyed the insights into the makeup of the cast and the demographics that made the show the longest running police drama in television history. I also enjoyed the book's short essays on topics ranging from McGarrett's car to the role of food on the series. The book's usefulness as a reference guide to the show is highlighted by an extensive index.A comprehensive episode guide provides critical analysis, rather than just opinion, for each episode. Both the episode guide and the book as a whole are invaluable for the Five-O fan.&quot;Booking Hawaii Five-O&quot; is not (I hope) the last word on the series, as &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; still awaits a splashy pictorial treatment by the commercial press.

It's fun watching the episodes to look for the things Ms. Rhodes mentions-the \\"looks\\", exchanges, dialogue, relationships, the music. It's also interesting to consider, as Ms Rhodes does, the issues that were raised by the series and how characters were treated, given the era and the nature of the show. There are summaries about the trials and tribulations of the series production and scheduling for each season, as well as for some significant episodes.I remember some of the episodes from my childhood but have not seen the show in decades. I'm looking forward to reading up on the episodes, then watching them as more seasons are released in the future. I enjoyed reading Ms. Rhodes opinions and commentaries and am looking forward to comparing her throughts to mine.As an episode guide the material is kind of sketchy; there is a very general description of each episode, and sometimes there are spoilers. A careful reader can intuit most of the episode plots, and there is more detailed plot information available elsewhere on-line.I wish there were more photographs, especially candid ones and better quality reproduction. I would also love more anecdotes from the set (the cast and crew \\"talk story\\") and about life in the islands during production. But then maybe someone should write a history of production and pictorial guide; this is not that book. It is an episode-by-episode critical commentary (most a page or less in length), with an introduction to each season, and information about the cast of each episode and the crew for each season."},{"Title":"Booking Hawaii Five-O : An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968-1980 Television Detective Series","review":"This book is useful primarily for rabid Hawaii Five-0 addicts -- I am one. But for someone not familiar with the entire 12-year run of the show, it will have limited usefulness.I purchased the book several years again, when it was primarily offered through Karen Rhodes' website and by the hardcover publisher, at a rather steep price. I know the series so well it's spooky; I honestly have no idea how many times I've viewed all the episodes. I know what episodes are in Season 1, and Season 2, ad infinitum, virtually by heart, and I know what I think about each episode and each character. So Rhodes' book has been valuable for me as a collector ofFive-0 trivia.If you know the series well, and want more information about who was on what episode in what year and in what role, then I'd suggest you assess the book critically before you decide to buy it.If you're new to the show, Rhodes' book will be of limited use until you've started hearing the show's theme song in your sleep.It is extremely important to remember that this book reflects only Karen Rhodes' opinions and assessments. It's a personal reflection of what SHE thinks about each episode, and the book cannot be taken as an impartial analysis of the show. Five-0 devotees such as myself often have very different opinions from those of Rhodes, and we're pretty vocal about it. There are many things in the book that I disagree with resoundingly, there are things with which I agree almost as resoundingly, and there are other things that I find helpful simply because I'm a McGarrett nut. Sometimes Rhodes and I agree with each other. But different people have different assessments of the show, and anyone who purchases Rhodes' book needs to keep that in mind. There are errors and omissions, and there are many times when her remarks simply do not reflect the views of other Five-0 fans.If I sat down and wrote a similar reference work of the show, it would be a very different book. Karen and I do not always agree with each other, but we also respect each other's views. And this is what needs to be done by anyone else who reads her book.If you don't know the series, buy the DVDs first and decide what you think about the show. If you're unreservedly enthusiastic ]after you've viewed several seasons [seasons, not episodes], then it's time to think about purchasing Rhodes' book. I would also highly suggest that you search out her website and get a feel for what she writes and how she writes.The book is essential for me; I've been \\"booked\\" on the show since the pilot TV movie aired. Forty years later [which is truly frightening!], I'm still hooked on the show.But others aren't. Or they've only heard about the show and are seeing it now for the first time on DVD. So take things one step at a time, and if you end up like me, then DO buy the book; you'll need it when you're sparring with other McGarrett addicts."},{"Title":"Booking Hawaii Five-O : An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968-1980 Television Detective Series","review":"Hawaii Five-0 was my favorite show of all times.

Some episodes I haven't seen at all and what a pleasure! What a treat! and seeing the others again after so long is like spending time down memory lane! I have started viewing the dvds from the beginning and use this as a guide. It gives in depth information to the making and background of each of the episodes, the actors and their performances, the shortfalls and a critique on the acting, the issues of the day which I find very interesting. I love the commentaries about WHAT McGarrett could possbily be thinking and feeling privately and the comments made by McGarrett which are really Jack Lord's own private thoughts woven into the show. I love that Karen Rhodes has been so thorough and exact in her work. \\"Good work!!!\\" (This sounds like something McGarrett would say!)The forward by Rose Freeman is invaluable and her tribute to Jack is much appreciated as he carried the show after Leonard Freeman's passing and he pumped blood, sweat and soul into the show. I would have liked more background, and more information about the wives of the creator and the \\"stars\\" and their roles in the success of the show as they would have been instrumental in the success of the show and of course, more on Jack Lord....but having said that, I am insatiable when it comes to the show and want to know everything about it and its actors.

The book's main strengths include the listing of episodes in their production order, original airdates, guest stars and the characters they played, writer, director, and composer credits--I'm particularly grateful for the emphasis on the composers, often an overlooked aspect of any TV show. There are also tales of behind-the-scenes shenanigans--the difficulty in dealing with certain bureacratic elements in Hawaii, the frequent cast and producer changes, as well as how Hawaii Five-O fared throughout the years, which is nicely summarized at the beginning of each season's chapter.Yes, \\"Booking Hawaii Five-O\\" has information readily available on the internet, but having Ms. Rhodes' wonderful book on hand is infinitely superior to being hunched over the sinister glow of one's computer screen.I recommend \\"Booking Hawaii Five-O\\" without hesitation."},{"Title":"Booking Hawaii Five-O : An Episode Guide and Critical History of the 1968-1980 Television Detective Series","review":"Karen Rhodes gives the fans more than just an episode guide.

This book, and Dupuis' LES ORIGINE DES TOUT LES CULTES (The Origin of All Cults) are two of the most cited books by the rogue scholar Martin Bernal (author of the contraversial BLACK ATHENA: THE AFROASIATIC ROOTS OF CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION) that his detractors, such as Mary Lefkowtiz (NOT OUT OF AFRICA; BLACK ATHENA REVISITED) puposely never mention in their diatribes against him.Lockyer, the 19th century English mathematician and astronomer (not historian or literary scholar-- the source of most of the school of Classicism), did in his time the unthinkable for a scholar in a field that gradually depended upon scholarship devolved into non-scientific dogma: he came up with a theory about the intellectual, scientific and spiritual life of a pre-Hellenic culture in north Africa that went completely against the accepted truisms of common Egyptological opinion... and then proved it to be right. Under no uncertain terms, J. Norman Lockyer--even within the context of the prejudices of his time--completely revolutionized how a north African civilization, whose way of life predates the scientific, mathematical and cultural re-discoveries of the Greeks by thousands of years could be perceived. He did it so well that people are still ignoring it.Ancient Egypt is shown in THE DAWN OF ASTRONOMY to be a civilization based on a philosophical foundation that made cutting edge science, advanced mathematics and esoteric religion one. Pythagorean and Euclidean geometry; the Fibonacci series; the golden section; Pi; the astronomical phenomenon known as the Precession of the Equinoxes (named by the ancient Greeks the \\"Socratic Year\\" some millenia later); the exact length of the solar year, within less than fifteen minutes; the foundational concepts and mathematical formulae of geodesy.... It is all not just written within ancient Egyptian writings, but exemplified in the architecture of every sacred temple built in Egypt from before the Pharonic period (3100 B.C.) on through the Pyramid Age and onward past the Valley of the Kings--millenia before the birth of Pythagoras, Euclid or the entirety of Greece as a culture. Their entire culture, from language to architecture, danced to the rhythm of the stars.Lockyer shows this with an unprecedented detail that to my knowledge has yet to be surpassed. His work demands such a rethinking of our understanding of the roots of Western culture that ignoring his work has left the Freudian denial phase in American intellectual culture and become part of the secular religion of our academic times. (One other rule of the cult, of course, is fairly obvious: declare all provable theories whose nature demand a paradigm shift in our cultural self-perception a modern socio-political metaphor; i.e. nothing more than the amniotic fluid of multiculturalism. This way, regardless of their validity, they can be easily dissected and discredited in that context for the good of the Church of Classicism. Read Giorgio deSantillana's THE CRIME OF GALILEO, to learn how culturally deep the prejudices and egos of obsessive Greek-based scholarly thinking can impact the world; it becomes a religion more than a science in the blink of an eye.)If so much of what we have seen and heard of this ancient North African culture could actually be reduced to the stuff of modern poetry and superstition (with the mystery of the Pyramids being a beautiful anomaly) as it has been consistently done since Lockyer's time by many (both in and out of the Afrocentric and Classicist/Egyptological schools), it would still be considered an extraordinarily impressive culture. But Lockyer, with painstaking research and enough evidence to fill a city's worth of museums and universities, shows how the rhythm of both the known astronomical universe and the corresponding cycles of nature lay at the center of Egyptian religion and daily life; high science meets high spirit. As much as many Classicists would swear we are still living in Plato or Caesar's world intellectually or culturally speaking, the staggering influence on Rome that Egypt was alone, as shown by Lockyer's explanation of the astronomical basis for their religious architecture and that fact's cultural implications (and how both of those influenced the scientists and architects of Greece and Rome from that point on), shows us how much of an *Egyptian world* we still are living in.Anyone with a passing interest in Egyptology or Astronomy will absolutely love this book. Anyone fascinated by comparitive religions or the origins of astrolgy will be enthralled even moreso. And to anyone prepared to sheepishly quote neo-conservative dogma masquerading as Classicism and simply look for new evidence to boost a socio-political perspective designed to invalidate paradigm-shifting discoveries, I suggest the following: read this in tandem with THE SECRET ARCHITECTURE OF OUR NATION'S CAPITAL: THE MASONS AND THE BUILDING OF WASHINGTON, D.C., by David Ovason.And then beware Dorothy: once you read this you won't be in Kansas anymore.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dawn of Astronomy","review":"Anyone interested in the Ancient Egyptians, astronomy, astrology and mythology will love this book.

He begins with a bang. The brothers are asked to investigate strange happenings at an Experimental Farm in Bayport. The majority of this book takes place at night and in part in underground tunnels. Unknown figures roaming about the farm hidden beneath black cloaks add an element of suspense. This book has a spooky feel and one that draws the reader from page to page. This book ranks among the series elite. RATED AREVISION: The 1971 totally altered revision of this book with a completely new story was excellent, packed with pure suspense and a tough case to crack about two murders. Even the revision of this book ranks among my favorites and one of the best revisions in the series."},{"Title":"The Flickering Torch Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 22)","review":"This is one of the greatest Hardy boy bnooks.

The mystery also involves a radioactive substance, which foreshadows some of the concerns we have several decades later.Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, has run into difficulties in trying to solve the crashes of two light planes into the cliffs adjacent to Marlin Crag Airport near Beemerville. Both pilots were landing from the sea in bad weather using instruments. However, both pilots were experienced. Fenton asks the boys to look around Marlin Crag airport to see if they can learn anything. In the meantime, Fenton will be investigating a ring of freight thieves who have been stealing from airports. As you might guess, there is a connection between the cases.Frank, Joe and their friend Chet Morton soon find their lives in danger when they ask questions that concern certain individuals they encounter. Things become more interesting when the boys get jobs playing in the band at a local night spot. It quickly becomes evident that someone wants the Hardys and Chet out of the way, permanently!During the investigation the boys discover a radioactive plane engine. Chet Morton purchases a plane fuselage, only to have it stolen. Why does the night club use only its own amplifiers, and what is the interest certain individuals have in the amplifiers? What is the relationship between smuggled diamonds and the radioactive isotopes? The most quickly solved mystery is what the \\"flickering torch\\" is.I enjoyed this mystery. While I am unsure of some of the science, it was sufficiently plausible that I was able to overlook any weakness in the science to focus on the mystery. I was also sufficiently puzzled by the purposes of the criminals that I found myself reading this book from cover to cover quickly. This story is one of the better stories in the Hardy Boys series.Though the Hardy Boys series was written in a relatively archaic fashion, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are excellent. The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The Flickering Torch Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 22)","review":"I loved this one. Don't judge it by it's cover. It sounds not very interesting, but it is one of the few volumes that has sort of a murder mystery at the heart of it's plot.

Mr. Hardy is busy on a case of government supplies being stolen from road construction sites, so Frank and Joe tackle the case for the scientist. Of course, the Experimental Farm where Frank and Joe had summer jobs is near the scientists home, and, oddly enough, a road construction site is also nearby. The book was a little slow going to start and I imagine many readers, after reading the first couple of chapters, would feel like giving up on the book, but it ended well. There is a moderate amount of action and the writing is good. One thing I didn't like about this book was that, aside from Aunt Gertrude and Mr. Hardy, none of the other main characters of the series played a prominent role in this book. This isn't the most thrilling book, but most readers would probably not feel like they wasted their time reading it."},{"Title":"The Flickering Torch Mystery (Hardy Boys, Book 22)","review":"This review concerns the revised 1971 edition.

Instead, he offers himself up to marry and before she can think twice, she is Stephen's wife ... and also very ill from the hard and rainy trip. Stephen is very caring of her during her fever.Stephen proves to be very kind to Mary but dictatorial. He loves to provoke her by saying he will tame her.

She marries the brother Stephen after he impulsively proposes, and seems to just get swept along by events. She is supposed to be a fiesty Scottish girl, but she doesn't show enough back-bone through most of the book. The couple consummates their marriage and have a good sexual relationship, but don't connect on an emotional level most of the time. Two things annoyed me. One was that Mary kept thinking that Stephen was a smuggler at best, and a murderer at worst, but still had strong feelings for him. She didn't trust him and it was hard to see why she was attracted to him, besides sex. The other things was the rather hackneyed plot of the murdered first fiance, the dead dog, and other assorted dead bodies that were eventually explained, but not to my satisfaction. I felt that that Stephen was supposed to be upset about the death of his former fiance, but he didn't seem to be very adept at trying to find out who slit her throat. He was a Naval officer in the past, a hardened veteran, but he was pretty clueless most of the time at handling what was going on around him. I'm not a fan of gothic romances, particularly ones where ambitious and crazed people are killing off characters (and poor animals) right and left. I don't mind some mystery and danger in my romance novels, but I like a lot of romance, and a cozy feeling and this just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"My Lady Mischief (Candlelight Regency, No. 105)","review":"I seldom give two-stars, especially when I managed to finish reading the book. It did have an interesting and spirited beginning (which plot has already been described by two other reviewers), but half way through the book the author started to show some fatigues--the plot started to loose its focus mainly because many mischievous happenings to many second and third characters which stirred up some confusions ( I personally thought it was a method of diversions); by the last 1/3 of the book the heroine became so cynical and ridiculous (so she appeared to me)that she kept questioning her love for Stephen, he for her, was he a smuggler, a murderer...etc. was so maddening. Yet the whole time I have already suspected the master mind.Beside the unexplained happenings, that reviewer \\"Cilla\\" did a good job on pointing them out, I also found the language in this book too simplified: it gave me an impression of a \\"young adult\\" level of read. Ms. Roberts also liked to use \\"Irish temper\\" \\"Irish red hair\\" a lot; unfortunately the heroine did not capitalize on her Irish intelligence much. All these contributed to my deductions of ratings. One other complaint: the book cover was so 20th-century-like, there was no Regency atmosphere at all, which was a surprise for Dell's \\"Candlelight Regency Romance\\". The publisher usually was pretty good about this."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"Timothy Mo's first novel is a blisteringly funny account of the misadventures of Wallace Nolasco, a Macau native who marries into a wickedly dysfunctional Cantonese merchant's family. Set in an evocatively depicted 1950s Hong Kong, this book is a devastatingly funny account of Chinese culture and family life. In many ways it remains acccurate even today.The Monkey King contains many many wonderful insights into colonialism, Confucianism and family politics. This is a humane, arch and beautifully-written piece of social and human analysis blended with touches of whimsy and magical realism.Like Sun Wu Kong the famous Monkey King of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Wallace uses his brains, sleight of hand and force of imagination to eventually pull success from the jaws of failure. However, the disturbing ending of the book points to deeper and darker forces at work within this sunny and good-humored tale.Some people may have a problem with the &quot;dialect&quot; that Mo has his Cantonese-speaking characters use when they are speaking &quot;Chinglish&quot;, personally I think it's a marvellous use of an artistic convention to confront speakers of standard English with the fact that local dialect adaptations of English (not elite-sanctioned text-book varieties) are the standard method of communication in many different places.Despite the official pronouncements, this book is actually alive and well and available through the UK Amazon site. It is published by Mo's own Paddleless Press which he set up in 1995 after he sacked Random House as his publisher."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"This story of a Cantonese family in Hong Kong is filled with warmth and humor. It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"I first read this novel, set in 1950's Hong Kong, while living in Hong Kong in the nineteen nineties - a cracking good read.An eccentric Chinese family living in a crumbling, atmospheric town house (of the kind that has, alas, been utterly swept away by remorseless development) is slowly revealed to the reader in absorbing, fascinating detail. I was amazed, as a Hong Kong resident, at how many of the actions and attitudes of Mr Mo's fictional family were still to be encountered in nineteen nineties Hong Kong (and no doubt today). I felt I met these people, or observed them, many times while living there.A sad, funny, ironic book that gains in strength by not becoming sentimental about Hong Kong, nor pulling any punches. Like other accurate reads about Hong Kong (such as Paul Theroux's Kowloon Tong - read it if you like this one), Monkey King tended to put a bee in the bonnet of some readers, chiefly those types so well-described by Mr Mo herein, and may be a painful read for some. But the detached reader has in store for him an excellent story, great characters and (an added plus) a book that is very informative about the Hong Kong of reality."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"Several times i laughed out loud. It wasn't a comfortable laughter, though, because all people in this Hongkong-Chinese family novel (with a mild outsider as main actor) are unsympathetic - just everyone. Mo also makes them talk a Pidgin English that feels degenerate in written form. Anyway it is nice to observe family life. In the books first half nothing much goes on; if a household member dies, the problem is calmly approached with some cerenomy and less emotion.There are interesting, mildly bizarre intercultural encounters, seen with Chinese eyes. Side figures bear cute names such as Mabel Yip or Pippy da Souza - you gotta love it. The novel is clearly split in several parts: town - village - back to town. The second half has a few weird ongoings which probably only Chinese or old Hongkong hands will fully treasure.Mo English sounds energetic, erudite and non-judgementally sarcastic, I found his tone rather gripping. To me as a non-native English reader, he is certainly more difficult than say Naipaul or Theroux; but he's never dull.The Hongkong novels I liked most so far are Suzie Wong and Kowloon Tong - both written from a westerners point of view. Not bad I thought was A Many Splendoured Thing, with a more Chinese angle."},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"I am not going to relate what is in the book - there are enough descripitons of it's contents - and I am not going to analyse it. I only wanted to write, that I could not put the book down. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"Monkey King","review":"Timothy Mo, the twice Booker Prize nominated writer of part Chinese descent, writes with confidence and authority about the marriage of an outsider (Wallace) into a Cantonese family and his eventual acceptance by the patriach who breaks with tradition and hands the reins over to him when he dies. The first third of the novel is undeniably captivating and often hilarious in its authentic account of Chinese customs and beliefs and in its characterisation of the various members of the Poon family, from the loutish Ah Lung to the two unmarried sisters, the elder of whom makes a thunderous noise when she washes in the morning. Mabel is another unforgettable character. But as soon as Wallace and May Ling are packed off to Mainland China, the pace starts to slacken and I found myself quickly losing interest. Things didn't improve much even when the scene shifted back to Hong Kong for the final third of the novel. I found myself skimming the pages and looking forward to its end. It was a major source of irritation for me that Mo makes all his characters speak in the weirdest past tense, an attempt no doubt to capture in dialogue the ungrammatical English used by Hongkongers, but it only comes across as cute and condescending. &quot;The Monkey King&quot; reads like the real thing for the most part but is ultimately disappointing."},{"Title":"Internet Marketing (NetEffect Series)","review":"I believe this book is far too optimistic when it comes down to Internet marketing.

(*responsible, respectful, and resourceful)","review":"For some strange reasons, I am always attracted by books with the magical number \`7' (seven) in the titles or sub-titles. Remarkably, they often turn out to be great stuff. Some of these books have already been reviewed here & there are more to come. Partly, my obsession with the number has probably to do with my impressionable exposure since I was a kid.When I was twelve in the early 60's, my first \`blood-thirsty' movie was the Japanese cult classic, The Seven Samurais, which reportedly inspired the Hollywood epic, The Magnificent Seven. Both movies became my perennial favourites & I have seen them countless times. In both movies, a ragtag group of fearless fighters helped a poor village to deal with & outsmart a gang of marauding rogues.In this book, the magical \`7' (seven) takes on a more serious & sober stance. It refers to the critical attributes that are embodied in the seven resources & skills necessary for your kids/teens to become capable - responsible, respectful, & resourceful - in dealing with today's complex world.Firstly, let me reveal the author's Significant Seven resources & skills of capable students:- strong perceptions of personal capabilities;- strong perceptions of personal significance;- strong perceptions of personal influence;- strong interpersonal skills;- strong intrapersonal skills;- strong systemic skills;- strong judgment skills;I have always hold the view that understanding perception is the key to peak performance.Maxwell Maltz started the ball rolling by coining the term as \`psycho-cybernetics', even though ancient masters in the East have known about it for a very long time. Edward de Bono, the guru of lateral thinking, calls it 'First Order Thinking'. Steven Covey relates some insightful anecdotes about perception in his \`7 Habits for Highly Effective People.' Joel Arthur Barker, a process futurist/consultant, considers perceptual understanding as one of five strategic tools necessary for navigating your future. Other consultants, like Mark Brown, Philip Kirby, to name a few, have talked at length about the intricacies of perception & their impact on personal as well as business (or organizational) performance. In the field of stress management, the research people at Institute of HeartMath, creator of the cutting-edge Freeze-Framer Technology, have linked \`stress' to \`perception'. Even in the world of esoteric practices, Harry Palmer, creator of the expensive Avatar training program, thinks along the same lines, as far as reality creation is concerned.Henceforth, it is exciting for me to note that these two authors have drawn an excellent & compelling parallel in the academic arena.I fully concur with the authors that, in the case of our children, strong perceptions of one's personal capabilities, personal significance & personal influence are the precursors to building one's strong assets in dealing with a world that is hurtling at us with breakneck speed, & compounded by hurricane-force changes.Surprisingly, the book, written by two educators by profession, is presented in very clear, easy-to-understand language.I highly recommend this book to all parents & teachers. This book can help you develop the resources & skills for your children/students to become capable adults.I would go further to recommend parents & teachers to take a look at the following books, as supplementary reading:1. What Kids Need to Succeed: Proven, Practical Ways to Raise Good Kids, by Peter Benson;2. What Young Children Need to Succeed: Working Together to Build Assets from Birth to Age 11, by Jolene Roehlkapartain;3.

(*responsible, respectful, and resourceful)","review":"What a fabulous book. It has helped me in so many ways with my three children. Very easy and entertaining reading. I've recommended this book to all my friends and even to the teachers and administrators at my children's school."},{"Title":"7 Strategies for developing Capable* Students. (*responsible, respectful, and resourceful)","review":"I can not believe that nearly ten years has gone by since this book was first published. I thought that everyone had read this book, and more importantly was \\"using\\" this book. It took a room full of educators and parents indicating that no one knew of this book for me to write this review. It is less a review than a sales pitch, but it is a pitch that needs to be made.From personal experience as both parent and teacher, this book changed my outlook on both. I have experienced considerable success at both, and it has to do with a fundamental switch in thinking. In fact, once you read this book, and get the point, you will see how simple it really is to help students become capable. But, everyone has to have their oars in the water and be working in the same direction.Just yesterday, I heard from one my students that he and his partner won Bronze at the Canada Wide Science Fair. This is the third time we won Bronze, and incidentally we scored Silver a few years ago. This book helped me \\"coach\\" kids. I had little to do with the science, but I believe that I was influential in the primary aspect of this book - pointed out the paradigm of their only capabilities - their success.I have an email from one of them, and it has squarely hit this point.Earlier last week, at a wonderful seminar on Assessment by Damian Cooper, I was struck by the way that he also used questioning techniques of the participants, but as well the students in his videos. He uses the materials in this book to a tremendous advantage. I see strong similarities, and attribute his success for working along these paradigms.Seven Strategies for Developing Capable Students is MOST DEFINITELY A MUST READ by any parent and/or teacher. It is a wealth of information, tips, and tricks, but more importantly allows any parent or teacher to focus on the student - making them capable, and feeling this as well.Let me quote a passage which I see as prophetic as it is more of a problem today, than it was ten years ago.\\"Parents often FEEL they must run to school to CONFRONT the teacher or principal with the responsibility of solving children's problems. This may be called for at times, but such occasions SHOULD BE RARE, and should only take place after we have done all we can to EMPOWER OUR CHILDREN TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.\\"The capital letters are my own, and should point to the emphasis for which I see as integral to proper parenting. SADLY, there has been an apparent increase in this type of CONFRONTATION. It is wrongheaded, and is actually bad for the student. While it might make the parent feel good, and this is also problematic, makes the child see a FICTION for which they must bring to the REALITY of life. It arms them with the inappropriate tools of success. When the school unions need to add language to their collective agreements that protect them from this type of confrontation, it is clearly a sign that there is a problem - a problem to the process of parenting.\\"We do a DISSERVICE to children when WE communicate a perception that everything is SOMEONE else's problem rather than theirs. 'You are doing poorly in school because the teacher doesn't like you'. 'You didn't make the team because the coach is prejudiced.'\\" p. 53While it could be rumour or gossip, I have heard that this is said quite often, and am shocked. There are a considerable number of parents who blame a teacher for many different reasons. As a teacher, there is no defense to this type of claim. The logical fallacies riddle the event, but it is nonetheless pointless to argue - a parent's mind is made up at this point.BUT, I have spent 25 years at teaching, and NOT ONCE HAVE I EVER HEARD ANY TEACHER say anything close to this. I can't imagine any teacher being so very shallow that they would willingly and knowingly do this to a child. In STARK CONTRAST, to help a student who might even be trouble in a classroom, to experience success would be something that would help the student not be a trouble maker. It is in the teacher's BEST INTERESTS not to be like this, and for this reason, I believe that blaming someone is a parental fiction.I believe that the problem with many students now-a-days is that they come to teachers with the meta-understandings or the paradigms of \\"shields up\\", if I can use an old Star Trek phrase, where there is absolutely nothing wrong with them, and they simply need to sort out who to blame.This book will help anyone see the problem with this thinking, and get them to think towards helping the student develop a capable nature.\\"The perceptions of being capable, significant, and able to influence one's own life are powerful confidence builders that instill the courage to take healthy risks, improvise, and transcend failure. PARENTS WHO INVEST TIME HELPING CHILDREN INTERNALIZE THESE PERCEPTIONS ARE GOING A LONG WAY TOWARD ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILDREN WILL SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND ENJOY LEARNING\\".This book is WELL WORTH the read, and I hope that every parent read this. Form discussion groups, and share your observations and creatively work toward making this happen. It was relevant 10 years ago, and is more relevant today."},{"Title":"7 Strategies for developing Capable* Students.

The insights of Stephen and Michael are written in a format that is down to earth and easy to impliment in everyday situations and hardships that occur in a parent's life. And speaking from experience their ideas work! It's easy to reference specific challenges as they occur, read the ideas, try them , and move on. This book has been inspirational and has served as my parenting survival kit. I only wish it was available when I was not yet a mother and teaching, so that I would have been enlightened to parenting issues. New teachers, please read this book for the sake of all us parents! Parents, please read this book for the sake of your children and their teachers!"},{"Title":"My Puppy: A Baby Soft Book (Baby Soft Books)","review":"I gave this book to my baby when he was about a month old. Although his vision wasn't very developed, he liked to rub the soft puppy on the front of the book. I read him each page (there's only one to three words per page) and pointed out what the puppy was doing. The wording is very simple, and there are only six pages in the book, but that works for young infants with tiny attention spans.Now that my son is 11 months old, he likes to play with this book on his own. He turns each page and looks at the pictures, and then he goes through it all over again. The nice thing is, I can put it at the foot of his crib when he goes to sleep at night, and when he wakes up in the morning, he has something soft and safe to play with. This occupies him for a few minutes so that I can sleep in just a little bit longer. When he's finished looking at his book each morning, he starts calling for me and I know it's time to get up and go greet him. I just think that \\"reading\\" a book is a great way for a baby to start off his day."},{"Title":"My Puppy: A Baby Soft Book (Baby Soft Books)","review":"My baby loves this book.

Predictable ending, but overall a fine story.I'm hoping Ben Affleck will be tapped to play the lead in any up-coming movie version."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Many slow cooker books strongly feature American dishes like chili, short ribs and stew. Nothing wrong with that, we all love those comforting favorites. However, it's easy to get bored with your slow cooker and then consign it to the back of that kitchen cupboard next to the fondue pot and the raclette set. Judith Finlayson's book could have you dragging the old Crok-King out of the cabinet again to try Pumpkin Soup with Shrimp and Lime, Bobotie (South African meat curry pie) and Thai-Style Coconut Flan. There are also recipes for seasoned mixed nuts and hot spinach cheese dip and even, dare I say it, fondue. Sounds like a party in the makings!If you don't want to dine nightly on exotic fare, however, there are good versions of old standbys like Shepherd's Pie with Corn (ground beef, corn and mashed potato topping.) This is certainly one recipe that we love to come home to find steaming away in the slow cooker. There are also desserts, soups, appetizers and casseroles and roasts, even a vegetarian chili. The desserts are puddings or fruit based cakes and cobblers.Some of the recipes are designed for certain types of slow cookers; small size crock pots are specified for the appetizers, oval shaped for roasts. So if you only have one type of cooker, you may not be able to make some recipes come out without figuring out how to adjust them. On the other hand, a small crock pot is a handy item for entertaining and you might find one at a yard sale. This book could also help you decide which pot to buy, based on the type of recipe you are likely to make the most.The photographs are clear and colorful, the recipes are varied enough to suit most tastes. If you would like to dust off your slow cooker and take it on a world tour, this book will serve as a great travel guide, but there are plenty of home-style recipes for when you just want something familiar."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"If you're a purist about using *just* the slow cooker, even though the browning step produces more intense and balanced flavours and only one extra item to clean, this book isn't for you.If you aren't interested in a mixture of English/North American standards along with a number of spicy recipes (Korean, Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Hungarian, etc.), or if you will have a difficult time finding the ingredients because your supermarkets has a limited selection, this book may not be for you.But if you love a variety of national cuisines and can get the ingredients, you'll love this book. The Easy Chicken Paprikash (using canned soups and sweet paprika, easy to find anywhere) was amazing. The New Potato Curry (using curry powder available in any supermarket, although I made up my own mixture) was wonderful, even though I left out the fresh cilantro as I didn't have any on hand. Time required to clean the cast iron skillet for each recipe: 30 seconds.There are a lot of slow cooker recipe books out there with great recipes for beans, stews, and soups. Get one of those if all you want to make are those great standards. Keep in mind, though, that you will find similar recipes in this book, such as Bakers' Potatoes with Onions, Creamed Onions, Shredded Chicken for tacos and sandwiches (no pre-browning!), Cheesy Chicken Noodle Casserole, Homestyle Chicken with Gingersnap Gravy, Pork Ribs and Beans, Pork Chops with Onions in Mustard Sauce, Pot Roast with Tomato or Gingersnap Gravy, Beef Noodle Casserole with Cheddar-Crumb Topping, Meat Loaf, Southwestern Brisket, Shepherd's Pie, Swiss Steak, Smothered Steak, Chicken Fried Steak, Mushroom Barley Soup, Black Bean Soup, and Seafood Gumbo.But you'll also get Indonesian and Spicy Chinese Chicken, Chicken and turkey curries (spicy and mellow), Caribbean Pork Roast with Rum, Portuguese Pork with Clams, Pork Vindaloo, Morroccan Lamb, Lamb Keema and Korma, Greek Beef Stew with Onions and Feta Cheese, Korean Style Short Ribs, Osso Bucco, Potato and Cauliflower Dahl, and Caribbean Pepper Pot Soup.If you're counting, that's nowhere near 150 recipes yet. And did I mention the desserts? Flans, crips, cobblers, custards, pudding, cake and, yes, cheesecake.This is a great book. If you want to move beyond the standards, here's your chance!"},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I LOVE to cook, I HATED ancient crockpot recipes. They are so bland. I bought this for myself back when I didn't have a lot of time to cook when I got home from work. There are recipes in here that have become a staple of my weekly cooking. The Mellow Chicken Curry is absolutley wonderful - sometimes I use low-fat coconut milk in place of the yogurt. The Tarragon Cream Roasted Chicken is delicious. Carribean Pork Rum Roast - Oh my gosh! Beef Burgenion (sp?), Vegetarian Chili - has a lot of ingrediants but is so worth it.Anyway - You'd be crazy not to try it. I bought one for everyone in my family for Christmas who owned a crockpot.Even when I'm not using the crockpot, I reference this book for recipe ideas. They are just so flavorful."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I cooked several recipes from this book and loved every one of them. The dishes are simply delicious. I cooked the Beef Bourguinon for my family and our visiting friends and it was a big hit. A little bit leftover got consumed over buns the next day!But, I have to admit to two personal biases: I love food with lots of flavors, and I always brown the meat before putting it into soups or stews--and this book suits me in both fronts. (I believe the author does state that one does not need to brown the meat, but that the meat tastes better if it is browned.) With the slow cooker relieving me from keeping constant watch over the food, I find the recipes in the book easy and the payback (of a great meal) more than worth the effort.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"&quot;Send your crock pot on a world tour,&quot; one reviewer wrote. Well, if your crock pot can't behave any better than this, you ought to lock it in the cabinet and never let it out.I borrowed this book from the library and purchased ingredients for 3 recipes. The Savory Cheddar Cheese Soup was a C-. If it hadn't been for all the salt and msg in the beef consomme, I'm not sure it would have had any flavor at all. Next, I tried Shepherd's Pie with Creamy Corn Filling. It was Ok, as in &quot;strictly OK.&quot; It looked nothing like the lovely picture of a potato-topped casserole. Instead, it was a sloppy stew-like mixture. As for the third recipe. . . well, I'm not going to try it at all.As others have noted, the majority of the preparation is outside of the crockpot. Basically, the crockpot is your cooking device - just like you might prepare everything on the stovetop and then put it in the oven. For example, for the Sheperd's Pie, I (1) browned the meat, (2) separately sauted the onions, garlic, and spices, (3) added beef broth and thicken it with flour, (4) made and seasoned mashed potatoes. Then, I layer it in the crockpot and cooked. Definintely not the &quot;dump and go&quot; system that many crockpot users desire.I wish I could recommend a better crockpot cookbook. All I can recommend is &quot;this ain't it, honey!&quot;"},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I actually returned a newer text because I saw this one a day later and preferred it. This book has the right mix between newer and more &quot;progressive&quot; recipes and the good old mainstream dishes you'll want to make every week. The pictures are a real help--they make you want to try certain recipes. So far I have slightly tweaked every recipe I've made from this book (as any good home cook will do)--and everything has come out perfectly. I am still looking for some really baisc items like how to cook dried beans. The book has bean recipes, but I want the &quot;skeleton&quot; recipe I can plug my own ingredients into. I guess that will come with experience. I disagree with another reviewer about the necessity for multiple crock pots...it might help to have multiple units, but you'll do fine with any pot 5qt and larger."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"The approach to the slow cooker in this book is a little different than that which most would expect. Some baked beans, some chili, maybe a stew or pot roast -- it's just a matter of choosing a decent combination of raw stuff to dump into the crock, and coming home to mushy vegetables and tender, though flavorless, meat, right?Wrong. If you are looking for zero prep and mediocre dishes, find another book. Judith Finlayson attacks the slow cooker not as an alternative to other cooking methods, but as an additional tool for those of us who enjoy the occasional meal with a longer cooking time, but don't want to leave the stove or oven on all day just to use a Dutch oven. She starts by discussing things that must be considered when converting recipes for crock-pot cooking. As she mentions, browning foods in a skillet can enhance the flavor of the final results. Without proper browning, foods prepared in a crock pot can be less flavorful than the original recipes. She discusses differences which allow the enterprising cook to adjust their own recipes for crock-pot cooking, and even mentions some ingredients which do not respond as well to slow cooking methods and gives tips for dealing with them. A book of recipes is good, but the introduction should be considered a manual for crock-pot cooking.Speaking of recipes, every recipe I've tried from this book has been a smashing success. I've made her French onion soup several times. Her Shepherd's Pie recipe was flavorful and easy, her pulled pork was a delight. I used her shredded chicken as a base for her chicken enchiladas, which far exceeded my expectations regarding what was possible from a slow cooker. The best recipe I've tried so far was the Texas-style chili con carne, which was smoky and hearty, with tender meat and wonderful flavor.This book tries to balance recipe complexity, preparation time, and quality of results. As mentioned in the introduction, several recipes suggest browning meats or softening vegetables in a skillet to enhance the flavor or texture of the final product. However, there are also suggestions that help to manage the difficulty of preparing these recipes entirely in the morning. Most recipes, especially those with long cooking times, include a clear \\"Make ahead\\" sidebar which explains which preparation can be done ahead of time and placed in the crock pot in the morning.In summary: The introduction is wonderful in itself, serving as an introduction both to the book and to the method of crock-pot cooking. The recipes are diverse, covering a range of cultural dishes, soups, dips, main dishes, and desserts, and serving as an inspiration for those who wish to try coming up with a slow-cooker version of their own low-heat favorites.One reviewer gave a negative comment about measurements, and cited page 73. Curious, I pulled out my copy and checked -- I cannot find a single mention of barley, which the reviewer claimed that the instructions said to add. As the reviewer stated, water was not mentioned in the ingredients list, but the text does say to \\"[a]dd beans, bacon and water, barely to cover.\\" This indicates that enough water should be added to barely cover the ingredients in the cooker, and the author can hardly be faulted for not knowing the exact capacity of every slow cooker on the market. I believe that this reviewer's misunderstanding does not justify such a poor rating of a useful book.The only thing I might suggest for a later edition is a clear indication of estimated preparation time and cooking time at the top of each recipe. The book already gives cooking times (for both high and low settings, if the recipe permits such choice) in the instructions. However, it would be helpful when looking for a recipe in a given situation to be able to more quickly determine cooking and preparation time; adding a note above each recipe would provide such additional assistance."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"So far I have made the carolina pulled pork, the chicken enchiladas and shaved chicken, and the savory cheese soup. All have turned out WONDERFULLY--no adjustments necessary--and her instructions work down to the letter.

I'm very pleased with my purchase and you will be too!"},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This is by far the best slow cooker recipe book I've tried. Many others on the market will have you toss in a hunk of meat and some creamed soup and call it dinner. This book guides you through preparation of tastier and healthier meals for the family of the go. I have yet to try one that my fussy family didn't like.One reviewer gave this book fewer stars because of the prep work involved, namely starting your meal in a skillet rather than popping ingredients into the pot and turning on the heat. There isn't much extra work, and what additional time it takes is worth the better tasting meal at the end of the day. I am fortunatate to own (after much reserach and help from Amazon reviewers)the WestBend Versatility slow cooker which makes any browning/skillet preparation process a breeze. It is a teflon coated cooker that allows you to skillet prepare any part of your meal directly in the pot and then transfer the entire pot to the slow cooker base. It makes a world of difference in the flavor of the meat/fish/veggies and cleans up in a flash. It is well worth the investment."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This lavishly illustrated, obviously well-researched cookbook suffers from a mistake so fundamental that it veers into self-parody: at least 95% of the recipes (I'm not exaggerating - I checked) start with or contain the phrase &quot;In a skillet...&quot;What is the point of using a slow cooker if I have to haul out a skillet first?I mean, if I'm going to have to tangle with the skillet, I might as well skip the slow cooker and use the Le Creuset dutch oven. Since I can brown and simmer in one pot, I save on clean-up.This author clearly cares deeply about her cooking. But she's insane. The slow cooker is helpful because you can dump everything in at once, turn it on - and forget about it. Once you turn the stove on, you're not in slow-cooker country anymore.I'm sure many of her recipes produce lovely results. But that's not the point: they don't keep within the limitations of the device they're supposedly written for. That means they're useless.Even if you're e.e. cummings, you don't produce free verse when a sonnet is required."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Most of the recipes in this book can be found on-line; and unfortunately there was nothing in the book that was something new as I had expected.Good for a beginner slow cooker for sure."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This was given to me as a gift, and I love the recipes in the book.My husband often thinks that crock-pot meals all taste the same, but these all taste distinctly different.

Most looked like slop and the flavors were not as good as some other cookbooks I have already.

Unfortunately, my quest for good Crock Pot recipes is still very much on. The photos in the book are lovely and appetizing, and I hoped that the quality of recipes would match the quality of the book's presentation.I tried two recipes from Finlayson's book, and one was mediocre, while the other was downright awful. Her recipe for Beef Stew with Stout sounded mouth-wateringly good, but was vastly inferior to my regular stew recipe; watery with very little flavor. The Jambalaya recipe was a disaster. Rice was mushy, and the meat was rubbery and underseasoned. I know it may be unfair to judge a whole book based on two recipes, but I'm honestly scared to try again. It's such a waste (of time, money, effort, etc.) to throw out uneaten food, but that's what ended up happening. My husband and I simply could not stomach the results."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"\`The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes' by Judith Finlayson is the third Slow Cooker cookbook I have seen, not counting the recipe book which came along with the slow cooker. And, I can say with more certainty than most other similar comparisons I have made that this is the best of the lot.I am not inclined to like slow cooking recipes but I am satisfied that they have an important place in a well-furnished culinary repertoire. I took to the method when I wanted a good pulled pork recipe without having to invest in a grill or smoker or any other type of outdoor contraption involving fire and smoke.It turns out that this book has an excellent recipe for a pulled pork barbecue recipe which should be able to hold its head high, at least outside the borders of North Carolina, where pulled pork barbecue takes on religious significance.Some slow cooker recipe books remind me of recipes in Church fundraising books. They have a small list of ingredients and the barest minimum of instructions on how to put the dish together. The premium on such books is in the number of recipes rather than the detail in the instructions. This is not necessarily a bad thing when we are dealing with a single method of cooking, especially one where the primary selling point is its simplicity. But, if you are a beginner you may want something better.Other slow cooker recipe books, especially the type from \`Better Homes and Gardens' and \`Betty Crocker' are better, but aside from the glossy pics, there is little to warm the hearts of a cookbook connoisseur's heart.Ms. Finlayson has covered all her bases. She opens with a headnote for each recipe that gives lots of background information on the origins and best uses of the recipe. She also has frequent make-ahead suggestions, especially for those who wish to turn on the slow cooker on the way to work. Finally, her ingredient lists are a real marvel, especially as they give both English and metric units for virtually every ingredient. This may not seem like much unless you have an especially good gadget for measuring small amounts where the tics for milliliters is much more finely divided than the teaspoons and tablespoons. Most people will be especially happy with her exceptionally good prep instructions for all her ingredients.For those who have never done slow cooking but who are expert braisers, I suggest you get this book even if you have your full complement of braising recipes. You will do better to transpose a familiar braising recipe if you have seen and done a few recipes designed for the slow cooker.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it. When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it. What a mistake! These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I am one of those \\"morning people\\" who lose energy as the day goes along.This fabulous cookbook enables me to serve great food to company, doing my cooking in the morning hours.

I have been asked for recipes from this book so many times that I am ordering two more copies today--one for my good friend's birthday and the other to use at my summer house in Maine. Try the orange flavored Moroccan lamb with prunes! It's been a hit numerous times, even with people who claim not to like lamb."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"The biggest complaint here is that you have to turn on the stove for many of the recipes. (Gasp!) If you want to dump and stir without dirtying any other dishes, then you will have to settle for bland food. I have flopped at many slow-cooker recipes but am having a lot of success with this one.The 1-2 extra steps required to prep, brown, saut&eacute;, etc. result in more flavorful food. The author brings slow-cooking to the next level - a lot more gourmet, but still helps busy families save time by allowing you to \\"cook\\" while at work or busy with the kids.As for the mush, you must follow her GREAT tips in the side bar ... for example, if using boneless chicken breasts reduce your cooking time to 4 hours so the chicken doesn't get dried out. Add your bell peppers during the last 20 minutes so they don't get bitter and mushy. Cut your potatoes smaller than usual since they are tricky to get done in the slow-cooker.She seems to know the slow-cooker well since she has written over 10 slow-cooker cookbooks with this particular book being a successful reprint. Note: This is not for the dump and stir cook. It's better than that. As with any cookbook, every single recipe won't appeal to you. I recommend this book - it's the best slow-cooker book I've found."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have had this cookbook for a couple of years and this year bought more of them to give to my grown children, who haven't used their crockpots very much. I've made more than half the recipes in my book and every one has been a standout! True, there is a bit of preparation before putting ingredients into the cooker, but that's the beauty of having an awesome meal ready at dinner time - that it doesn't taste like something you just threw into the pot and hoped for the best. Fish chowder, celery soup and southwestern corn and roasted red pepper soups are worth having the book for themselves! The cumin pot roast, \\"easy pot roast\\" and boeuf bourguignon are wonderful winter dishes that fill the house with lovely aroma all day. My family has had each of these several times and always raves. Pork roast with chili orange sauce is yummy (I left out the banana, as we are not fans). Pork chops and onions was a huge hit, and I even forgot to finish with the mustard sause! Chicken with sage makes a lovely brown sauce and the chicken comes out incredibly tender. Roast chicken in tarragon cream sauce is a real company-worthy meal. I serve it with couscous and roasted beets. I could go on and on . . .The thing I love about this cookbook, aside from that the recipes all come out so well, is that most of the ingredients are things I have in my kitchen already. There are not a lot of foreign or specialized ingredients to go out and hunt for. I can really thaw a piece of meat and flip through the book to find a recipe I can use for tonight's main course.I have a huge collection of cookbooks, and can say without a doubt that this one is used more often than any other I own. I totally reccommend it to beginners or seasoned cooks."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I love this cookbook! I have about 10 others and they cannot compete with this one. I have newborn twins and can't really find the time to cook, and thought of using my crockpot but then remembered how boring and tasteless all the recipes were that I have. Then I tried this book. I now use my crockpot every day! The guys in my house RAVE about the food, think I cooked all day. Definately a keeper. The recipes are easy, the food is wonderful, and clean up is fast."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I have 3 of Judith Finlayson's books and they are all fabulous. I couldn't live through the fall and winter without my slow cooker and this book is one of my favorites. Well written and easy to follow step-by-step instructions, helpful tips and \\"make ahead\\" pointers. Even the recipes that look long are really manageable. I also like the great photos of finished dishes."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"This was the first slow cooker cookbook I purchased, and it continues to be my most reliable choice. I picked it up for the expansive chili section, but almost everything I have tried has been a winner! The combination of flavors and variety is impressive.Favorites so far: Korean short ribs, white chili, Mortimer's meatloaf, country style ribs and beans, lamb keema. The meat is always tender and flavorful while staying away from the veggie mush.Yes, a number of the recipes involve pre-cooking on the stove to develop the flavors, but almost every recipe includes instructions for preparing the ingredients the day before and assembling in the morning. And the recipes often contain alternative ingredients (for harder to find items) and useful tips.I've tried 2 other slow cooker cookbooks since, but I always go back to this book for a new recipe to try.This cookbook is a winner!"},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"In my search to find a slow cooker cook book that does not start off each time with \\"heat a skillet and braise the meat,\\" this book has a smattering of recipies that meet that test. The one for lime and cilantro chicken is great and there are two for pot roast that have no pre-cooking required and that is my major requirement for a crock pot. I need more cook books like this, the point of a crock pot is not to have to pre cook and this cook book has some recipies that fit the bill."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I was looking forward to getting this cookbook since I love using my slowcooker but I was very disappointed when I saw that almost all the recipes had me browning the ingredients before putting them in the cooker!

I wish you all the best, in the short and long-term future. I look forward to viewing the new Cookbook and considering your products again."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"For cooks who enjoy using a slow cooker, as I do, the search for a cookbook that scores high on flavor, nutrition, good taste, variety, and ease of use is not simple. I have bought many different cookbooks over the years looking for the \\"right\\" one and have decided that no one cookbook is going to satisfy all those needs completely. There are basically 2 types of books: those with recipes that satisfy what reviewers on this site call the \\"dump and go\\" approach, and those that require a significant amount of prep time (usually using extra pots and pans on the stovetop).Judith Finlayson's books come out way ahead for me, and this one finds a middle-of-the-road approach that suits me perfectly. It has comfort foods, various more exotic and interesting ethnic recipes, and recipes that are reliable and even useful for holidays and company. \\"Osso buco with Lemon Gremolata\\" is one that I've used again and again and would have no hesitation is serving for company. The recipes in this book do require some prep time (usually browning the meat, sometimes a few more steps), but for each recipe the author indicates exactly how many steps to go though in order to prepare it partially the night before. For me, this is the key to using the slow cooker well: prepare the recipe halfway the night before, then \\"dump and go\\" the next morning. It sounds like a small thing, but this approach makes all the difference in flavor and texture, and this is the only book I know that indicates exactly how far one can go that far ahead of time. (You can of course do it all at once too, but this comes back to having the time for preparation in the morning.)Finlayson has also written a good vegetarian slow cookbook and an excellent Healthy Slow Cooker. Both of those books are on my cookbook shelf too, but they get less use, because they require even more prep time. When I want a speedy recipe that requires no prep, I usually go to Stephanie O'Dea's _Make it Fast, Cook it Slow_. In all of these cases, recipes do usually need to be tried out and often adapted a bit to meet the needs of one's own slow cooker, because they each cook slightly differently, but I have found these to be reliable, easy, and tasty recipes that suit all occasions."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"My husband first bought this book for me right after initial publication. I have made many recipes multiple times. I have recommended it for friends, including one who is a professional caterer. My three daughters, one of whom has a culinary chef's designation, use it regularly. The recipes are creative, use great spices and take the cook out of the realm of tasteless, overcooked slow cooker recipes of the past. I gave this book as part of a wedding gift and the couple have used many recipes for formal entertaining. Some of the recipes require some specialty ingredients found only in foreign food sections of the store or, in some cases a specialty store, but it is all worth the delightful flavors and colors one experiences. I look forward to trying Ms. Finlayson's newest slow cooker book too!"},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"We recently purchased two copies of Finlayson's 150 best recipes as gifts for family members.

This is our go to resource for winter time \\"Comfort Food\\" recipies."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Over the years I had a couple of crock pots and slow cooker cookbooks and everything that came out of the pots was bland and unappetizing looking. I even managed to turn out beef that had cooked for hours and was so tough you could barely chew it. From this cookbook I learned that you can't simply throw a bunch of ingredients in the pot, turn it on low and hope to have something you'd really like to eat hours later. These recipes do require some prep--browning meat, sauteing veggies, etc. Perhaps not a lot less work than required for other ways of cooking, but the advantage of the slow cooker is that you can do all that prep early in the day, do the clean-up then, and then go about your day and expect tasty results when dinner-time arrives. If you're having guests for dinner (and yes, these recipes are something you'll be proud to serve to guests) you can relax and visit with your guests before dinner without being stuck in the kitchen with a lot of final preparations. I definitely recommend this cookbook."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"I really like this cookbook. While I like the \\"typical\\" American fare, I like to try things that are new, too.Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a dump and go slow cooker cookbook. You'll have to spend about 30 minutes or so (depending on the recipe) of prep time before you put everything in the slow cooker, but I actually like that. I think it develops better flavors in these dishes than if you were to just dump everything in and turn the slow cooker on.So far, I've made 6 or 7 of the recipes and have really liked all of them. I try to do a slow cooker dinner every week because of our schedules, so this has been a nice change of pace to the typical short ribs, pulled pork or roasts."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"From dips and main dishes to desserts and even roasts, 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes packs in a range of tips and recipes for using the slow cooker to maximum effect. Add color photos of finished results and tips on using different sizes and shapes of slow cooker and you have a guide which is appealing and delicious."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"Clear directions, good photos, and some good basic recipes make this a fairly good cookbook. Many of the recipes, however, have unusual/exotic ingredients that the average person would not have on hand. Personally, I would have preferred for the majority of recipes to use more basic/easy-to-find ingredients."},{"Title":"The 150 Best Slow Cooker Recipes","review":"The recipes are easy to follow and the ingredients are probably in your pantry already. I think this will be a cookbook to use again and again. Having a slowcooker is a real timesaver. The meats are very tender and flavorful, and cooked thoroughly."},{"Title":"Strange Land Songs (Ladsonian Sonnets 1991)","review":"I don't usually read poetry books; that's one reason why Strange Land Songs is so outstanding to me. I am particularly moved whenever I read \\"I loved My Africa, loved unabated My firstborn,...\\", because it affirms me in my belief in a Creator who launched life on Earth on the continent of Africa. In its songs, there is victory without rancor in the African-American experience, and I am empowered to sing, even in a strange land.Ms. Ladson's technical mastery of the sonnet form provides a counterpoint that adds both suspense and irony to already rich lyrics. My husband and I included two of her poems in our book, Orita: Rites of passage for youth of African descent in America, and featured them in the ceremony associated with an actual rites-of-passage celebration. Outside of the Scriptures, her psalter was the most appropriate literary representation we could find, with both the content and spirit of our theme.This seven-inch by seven-inch, hardbound book is an inspiring work that can go with you anywhere. Each poem could be placed in a separate frame and enliven a room with its hope-filled message. You'll not want to part with your copy, so buy at least three."},{"Title":"Strange Land Songs (Ladsonian Sonnets 1991)","review":"I am, correctly, Irene Granderson, a senior artist & retired social worker. As a lover of poetry and posessing an abiding interest in the history of the African American people, I enjoyed the sonnets in \\"STRANGE LAND SONGS.\\" I found them to be powerfully descriptive, spiritual and mystical. The work is arranged in two parts: The first section discusses the plight of a people torn from their native land and transplanted to a strange new land. The second segment describes women who, in spite of proscribed lives, emerge as strong beautiful people.To add to the spiritual essence which permeates the work, a scriptural reference is provided on the opposite page of each poem. Ms. Ladson's spiritual and feminist beliefs are clearly demonstrated in the entire book. For example, in Song #44, the dual genger of God is discussed: \\"I am your Mother God in curl and braid, I am your Mother God in blouse and skirt, As much as I am Lord of war and trade, As much as I am Lord of beard and shirt.\\" The accompanying scripture is taken from Job:21:4, where God is revealed as a male whose breasts are full of milk. The poetry is written with a delicate touch and has a tenderness that reaches the heart. One of my favorites is Song #21, which describes a romance of the people with their lost country, Africa: \\"You came before him braided, jeweled, beaded, Stood shy and quiet, by the elders flanked.\\" In addition, there are six poems (Songs 29-35) which I call THE REMEMBERING SONNETS because they each begin with the word REMEMBER, and remind the people in abject circumstances about their history, their spiritual connection to their former land, and who they are.Ms Ladson's concept of the Africa that was in the past is that of a bright fair place of tremendous resources. In Song #5, she indicates: \\"The earth nicknamed her dark, I called her sky, Because so many rivers were her length.\\" And in Song #17, we read: \\"You are the Lord's song sounded first in grotto, Are prehistoric lyric at its best.\\"I conclude by saying that this book is really a jewel. After reading the Ladsonian sonnets, you will be able to see into the heart of one who aspires to share the beauty of her people.(Senior Artist, Age 65+)"},{"Title":"Strange Land Songs (Ladsonian Sonnets 1991)","review":"I am Dr. Marilyn Maye and I don't usually read poetry books; that's one reason why STRANGE LAND SONGS is so outstanding to me.

She brings the times she writes about to vivid life using people who do heroic things without ever thinking of themselves as heroes. To borrow a phrase from music, her writing has perfect pitch. Her books that I know of are: The Long March about the American Revolution and General Dan Morgan -- which will remind you of all the things you've forgotten about what it really took to win our Independence; A Shadow of Eagles set near San Antonio about the Spanish ranch Tres Reyes and the daughter of the house who falls in love with a Texan; A Time in the Sun which tells of the Indian wars in the far West from both points of view -- the Apache's and the white man's; Maximilian's Gold a suspenseful story of a tight little group of former Confederate soldiers on a quest for the rumored gold hidden in Rattlesnake Canyon in the Southwest of 1867; and The Carolinians about the men and women for whom the American Revolution became a bloody civil war -- Loyalist families and Rebel revolutionaries. All of her books are fully satisfying but leave me wanting to know more about what happened to these people after this part of their story ends."},{"Title":"Scrap Frenzy: All New Quick-Pieced Scrap Quilts","review":"I really liked this book for several reasons.

(via a normal clothes iron)If you are not interested in the historical view of WW2, this map probably has little value to you.I am an amateur military historian and found the map very useful for reference against various researched USA regimental histories.It is an excellent historical check-and-balance map (e.g. town names change, road names change, etc. from the mid-twentieth century).Although I have not used it in this way, it is probably very useful as an overlay of modern maps, if you are doing a WW2 tour. It is, of course, a map from that earlier time period, so you would have to cross reference memorials and monuments from a modern map and then find the associated reference on the Michelin map, if you were interested in that level of detail from half century ago.Pete"},{"Title":"Assessment and Control of Software Risks","review":"The author proposes that we categorize software development risks like the Center for Disease Control categorizes disease. He builds on this theme by discussing risk from the perspective of symptoms, susceptibility, prevention, and therapies. The information is excellent., and is not available in this compact format from any other source (at least that I know of). This book is a 'must' for any manager intent on improving the system development life cycle. /// This book is primarily directed toward knowledgeable software professionals. It assumes you have a good understanding of development theory.

Almost all are timeless. However, the book is 10 years old and much has changed over the last 10 years. The Internet is a prime example. This new medium has most of the risks of legacy systems, but the Internet brings new possibilities and new expectations."},{"Title":"Assessment and Control of Software Risks","review":"While an update to this book would be nice, the fact is that the major risks cited in this 1994 classic continue to be risks in 2002. What I like about this book is the way it's organized and structured. Jones starts with two chapters that highlight the most common and the most serious software risks. In that respect the essence of the book is provided up front.The rest of the book is a catalog of the top 43 risks, presented in a quasi-pattern format (that predates the GoF patterns movement), using a medical metaphor, based on the US Public Health Service publication titled &quot;Control of Communicable Diseases in Man&quot; as the pattern. The format is highly effective and intuitive, and also plants a subtle notion that the risk can be cured. The risks are arranged alphabetically for easy reference and range from Artificial Maturity Levels to Slow Technology Transfer, with the usual suspects that have plagued software engineering since its inception: corporate politics, excessive schedule pressure, low user satisfaction, malpractice (project management and technical staff), silver bullet syndrome ... sound familiar? In my opinion, until cures are found for the risks cited in the book we, as a profession, don't need an updated list of more.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who manages software engineering projects or processes. If you want a more condensed version of this book get Jones' &quot;Software Systems Failure and Success&quot;, which was published in 1996. That book distills critical success (or failure, depending on your perspective) factors into a manageable group of twelve attributes. It doesn't fully replace this book, but does augment it well."},{"Title":"Assessment and Control of Software Risks","review":"This book is quite complete for anyone needing to deal with software risks and its organisation makes it particularly handy.

Every time I read them, I find something new or laugh again despite the fact that I know many paragraphs from the book by heart...These two books are about adventures of the main hero Ostap Bender in Russia in the period between 1927 and 1930. Ostap in a very non-conventional type of &quot;hero&quot;, in fact he is an opposite of the typical Soviet stereotype of a good man (factory worker, Communist, faithful husband and etc.). Ostap is a small time con artist who dreams of riches and doesn't think that he belongs to Soviet reality. In both books he's hunting for treasures and the readers get a great chance to catch a glimpse of Soviet reality as seen through his and his mostly inept companions' eyes.Both books are written with a bright, ever contemporary humor that still makes people laugh even though the USSR is long gone. I don't know how what it is like for the people who weren't born in the former USSR to read these books in languages other than Russian, as some of the funniest things will probably go unnoticed or will be lost in translation. However, I highly recommend reading both of them if one wants to understand Soviet culture better or impress friends from the former USSR by using phrases that became a part of the general culture (i.e. &quot;Money in the evening, chairs in the morning&quot; or &quot;I will command the parade!&quot;).The books were even further popularized by the great TV series &quot;Twelve Chairs&quot; with a star cast of Soviet cinematography (A. Mironov as Ostap and A.Papanov as Ippolit) and &quot;Golden Calf&quot; with a great cast as well.The only books in Russian that I always keep (in my mostly technical collection) are these two and &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; by Mikhail Bulgakov - another great masterpiece..."},{"Title":"The Golden Calf, Zolotoi Telenok: An Annotated, Accented Reader With Exercises (Russian Edition)","review":"This one's written in the Russian language.

Perhaps, the best way to describe this masterpiece is to say that I have re-read so many times, that I even don't know how many. You can pick up this book and open it on random pages, you can read the chapters in the backward order (I have done both)- it is still the best of the best! Several generations of Russians have incorporated quatations from &quot;12 Chairs&quot; and &quot;Golden Calf&quot; in their everyday vocabulary - these novels are just that great and popular. If you want to understand &quot;the mysterious Russian soul&quot; of the socialist period - this is perhaps the best way to do so.

The adventures and misadventures of the characters, the brilliant humor, the marriage with the incidental theft of a tea accessory, the wild ride in a stolen car, the hilarious boat trip-it all just fits right to create a story that will keep your stomach convulsing and your eyes tearing up. Everyone needs to read this book in order to understand Russians better. I re-read it many times in my teenage years simply because if you live in Russia(or any other Eastern European country for that matter),you will be able to understand those countless quotes taken from this masterpiece and incorporated into everyday language. The characters are hysterical in the least, and the story so seemingly simple contains much bigger messages than available to the naked eye.Please,read this book,and if you understand the humour and sadness of it,you'll be well on your way to understanding not just Russian culture but humans in general. And to the reviewer below who asked if this was ever made into a movie:HELL YES and thank god it was! It's a very old movie (70s era perhaps, cannot say with certainty) which became a Russian classic-perhaps as much as the book itself.

I found this paperbook by accident in a box of discards, dipped in because it was about Russia, and read it straight through with incredible delight. It is amazing that the two authors, both killed at about age 40 in WWII, were not thrown to the Gulag.These crooks on the loose, with their ingenuity and street smarts, who impersonate the sons of former great national Generals in order to cadge money and cafetaria tickets, who take the heroes' welcome due to the real roadrace cars and dine at the citizens' expense wherever they go... surely this was made into a movie somewhere along the line?

Of course during the writing of this book (and its prequel the Twelve Chairs) it was impossible to satirise life in the 20s and 30s in the USSR directly without losing your life. They managed to write two books that satisfied both the officials and the readers. The books are incredibly funny and absurd dissections of almost every aspect of Soviet society, but often the most punchy parts aren't said explicitly. They also make fun of the pre-Soviet mindset just as well.In The Golden Calf we again see Ostap Bender the charismatic con artist re-emerge after surviving his last adventure against all odds. He teams up with a small handful of other petty criminals and a car and they come up with another enrichment scheme. This time, they aim to blackmail Koreiko who they find out is a millionaire. They go on a road trip to end all road trips and again see their country through the magnifying glass that is the satire of Ilf and Petrov. There is also an ideological part as Bender's investigation of Koreiko's past causes him to \\"lose his faith in humanity\\" and he also finds that having money in the USSR is no advantage whatsoever - in fact it alienates him further from society (one of my favourite scenes is when a dejected Bender seeks an audience with a visiting Indian philosopher to find out the meaning of life).A fierce, sharp but warmhearted satire on early Soviet and pre-Soviet society - make sure to read the prequel too!"},{"Title":"The Golden Calf, Zolotoi Telenok: An Annotated, Accented Reader With Exercises (Russian Edition)","review":"This is the best book ever written on the subject of the Soviet Union.

I homeschool and have used this book repeatedly through the years with a 10 year old and now a 5 year old. This book gives an excellent foundation for each of the subjects covered in its separate chapter. There are stories, poems, brief non-fiction pieces, and songs that include simple but nicely creative piano accompaniment. You'll find everything from scary southern folk tales to &quot;Who's on First&quot; to a brief, accessible and sad report of Isabel's &quot;cleansing&quot; of Spain. The writers and artists are incredibly diverse, and include Norman Finkelstein, Longfellow, and Leo and Diane Dillon. The fact that the above and many others can seamlessly exist is a wonderful testament to the talents of the editors, Cohn and Bang.

It was extremely helpful in explaining that the loved one is incapable of foreseeing the consequences of their behaviors. It explains and displays what is actually happening with the brain. It also helps the caregiver deal with emotions associated with taking care of the loved one such as anger, guilt, depression and fear. There is a chapter on communicating with health care professionals, deciding on nursing homes, in-home care, dealing with delusions, and much more. This book was a lifesaver.

I had already read Snowden's &quot;Aging with Grace: The Nuns Study&quot; which Shimer uses as documentation to clear mercury. I have also read Boyd Haley's work linking mercury with Alzheimer's. Since Haley and Snowden are both working at University of Kentucky in Lexington, this is confusing and contradictory.If Haley is right, think of all the people who wrongly feel &quot;secure&quot; that their amalgams (silver fillings &amp; crowns) are &quot;No problem&quot;. This is in addition to mercury (labeled thimerosal) as a preservative in many vaccinations. This for a substance that EPT would fine for disposing of a small amount in a lake or burying in our yards. But it is safe in our mouths? I hardly see how!Adding to Haley's credibility (and decreasing Snowden's and Shimer's) this week (Nov.2002) FDA finally classified mercury as Class III--unsafe for routine use.Read: Tom Warren's 1991 &quot;Beating Alzheimers&quot; (and a new book to be out soon).

(Our Mental health can be no better than our Dental health.)It is time for lobbying/politics to be dethroned from deciding what is good for our health. Mainstream medicine claims to rely on scientific findings. LET IT BE SO! (Instead of the American Dental Association trying to DElicense dentists who talk against mercury.)With the aging population and anticipated increase in Alzheimers Disease, TRUTH is a must if only from a financial standpoint to society.

LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

Loved it even more when I read it as a fourth-grader, delightfully unconcerned with the Christian symbolism, not that it really mattered. My best friend Mark introduced them to me; he truly believed Narnia existed, and come to think of it, how do we know it doesn't? Even now in my 40s, I just don't think the overt symbolism matters much. For me and many others, these books represent a time in our lives when we could willingly suspend our disbelief easily, readily, wholeheartedly. Isn't it sad that, as we age, we often seem to lose that flexibility, that openness?"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", as well as \\"Harry Potter\\", so it seemed only natural that I should also read C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I never read them as a child, but then again I stem from the third world, where these occurrences are not unusual. After watching the movie, I decided to give the book a try. At first I was unsure where to start the series, as there is still a debate as to which order the books should be read in, but I went with the first book in the series that was published, as this made the most sense to me.I am so very glad that I picked up \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\"! The book is actually tiny - less than 200 pages, with illustrations - but packed full of adventure. Most people are familiar with plot, but for those fellow \\"third-world-ers\\" I will rehash some of it. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are four siblings in the WWII England, who get sent to a kindly professor's house in the country to be safe from the German air-raids. They are amazed by the size of the house, and decide to explore it on rainy days. During one of those days Lucy, the youngest sibling, entered a room that contained only a wardrobe. Upon entering the wardrobe, behind the coats, Lucy encountered a different world, with snow and woods and a lamp post.Lucy ended up meeting a Faun called Mr. Tumnus - a half man, half goat, who introduced Lucy to Narnia, the world that she entered, a world ruled by a White Witch, who called herself the Queen of Narnia. Of course, the one true King is Aslan, the giant talking Lion, who is planning on returning to Narnia and bring Christmas and then spring and summer back with him. In order to do this, Aslan needs to fill the four thrones in the castle currently occupied by the White Witch. The four thrones can only be occupied by humans, as foretold by a prophecy.Lucy returned to her world via the same wardrobe. On a different day, while trying to escape the grumpy housekeeper and a group of tourists going around the professor's house, all four siblings hide in the wardrobe. Not believing Lucy's Narnia story before, the siblings are surprised and apologetic when they, too, end up in Narnia. Deferring to Lucy as a way of apology, all the siblings go with Lucy to meet Mr. Tumnus. They are all surprised to see Mr. Tumnus missing and his place raided, as they find out that Mr. Tumnus was arrested by the White Witch for abetting humans.The White Witch found out about Mr. Tumnus' nefarious activities through Edmund, who entered Narnia on his own while one day looking for Lucy. Edmund met the White Witch, who gave him Turkish Delight. The food was enchanted, and Edmund wanted more of it. The White Witch promised Edmund rooms full of Turkish Delight if he brought his siblings with him the next time he was in Narnia.This is just the beginning. The children end up meeting Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them go to Aslan, while Edmund (believing the White Witch was not that bad), escaped to the castle, where he got imprisoned by the White Witch, who then took Edmund on a harrowing journey of looking for Peter, Susan and Lucy. But the snow is already melting, and the spring is coming, so the Witch needs to hurry, as the prophecy is about to be fulfilled, which would mean the death of the Witch.Ah, this book was such a pleasure to read! Lewis wrote this book as a story for his god-daughter Lucy, and at first intended the story to be just that - a story and not a series. The book is written very simply - one can easily imagine the author telling it to a bunch of kids, adding asides for dramatic effect or as a way of explanation. Although the book is written in a very simple language, its plot is actually quite complicated and covers amazingly well developed characters in such a short span.Lewis, who was a good friend of Tolkien, was truly a master of the genre, as this children's book is so well loved by adults, as it has themes that can translate to any age. \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is also the simplest of all the books in the series, as far as language is concerned, as it was obviously originally intended for a very specific and small audience. I am very glad that the book found a larger audience than that. The book is wonderful in that it teaches courage, loyalty, forgiveness, strength, endurance and sacrifice, among other things, while immersing the reader in a plot in which they cheer and sit at the edge of their seat. The illustrations propel the reader into the world of Narnia, and illuminate all that our adult imagination might have forgotten.All in all, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a fantastic children's fantasy book, that would be very hard to match, and that, one can safely say, serves as a basis and a starting point for all fantasy writers of today. And well it should, as Lewis was one of the masters, and \\"The Lion...\\" was just one taste. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"C.S. Lewis writes an inspiring tale of four young children who stumble upon a wardrobe that leads to a magical land called Narnia. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to find Narnia, and while she is there, she befriends a fawn named Thomas. Thomas tells her of the evil ice queen who cast a horrible spell that made it constantly winter without Christmas in Narnia until two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam arrive to save the land. Complications arise when Edmund is bribed and betrayed by the evil ice queen who promises that he will become prince if he gives the location of his other siblings. The other three young children and eventually Edmund decide to help Narnia, and they begin a dangerous yet exciting fight against the evil ice queen. The story is filled with memorable and inspiring characters especially Aslan, the true and righteous ruler of Narnia. The novel is incredibly moving, and C.S. Lewis delivers a meaningful message to his readers. It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and I recommend that everyone read this beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy:C. S. LewisReviewed by:M. LinPeriod:P. 6The eternal winter of Narnia, set by the witch, abruptly stops when Aslan the lion returns to aid it. In order to return the season of spring, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve must be crowned the kings and queens of Narnia at the Cair Paravel of the 4 thrones. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, the 4 brothers and sisters must leave their home in London to escape the air-raids of war. Brought to a mysteriously large mansion, the children wander throught it finding an enormous wardrobe in which they enter to find a lamp post in the middle of the frozen Narnia. Lucy befriends a faun named Mr. Tumnus who saves Lucy's life, but is captured by the Queen. Edmund betrays the party when the witch offers him sweets and tells all his secrets that could endanger his family. Discovering the truth that the witch is not the true queen of Narnia, the children try to find Aslan and be taken to the throne to become the kings and queens. Aslan later saves Edmund ,but the witch claims that according to the \\"Deep Magic,\\" every traitor belongs to her and everything that belongs to her, she has a right to kill. Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund and is brought back to life according to the \\"Deeper Magic,\\" saying that if someone else is killed in place of a traitor,he is brought back. The witch is defeated by Aslan and the children grow up as Kings and queens of Narnia. When they return to the lamp post, the find their way back through the wardrobe and return to the mansion as children again.What I liked about the book was that it was creative and full of hooks that pull you in. Narnia is locked up in winter, but the story is so intriguing that it pulls you all the way to the key. You journy with Aslan. \\"Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for he remembered as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.\\" The book keeps on repeating this line in the begining and even though it isn't very important, it somehow hooks you in and then you really start enjoying what happens in Narnia and how it makes you want to be in the adventure with them. The land is magical in the human world as it is in Narnia because it had the wardrobe in it and it seem as though something magical was driveing the children into Narnia.Lucy is my favorite character because she is pure and innocent. She plays fair and is always honest and when Mr.Tumnus was captured, she tried her best to try to help him because he saved her life. \\"We can't just go home, not after this. It is on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble...We simply must rescue him.\\" All of this showed Lucy's kind nature and caring heart.My favorite part of the book is when the four children are at the Beaver's house/dam to eat dinner. The description of the food makes my mouth water. I love the food and it always makes me hungry. The author does a long description of the dinner and how it smells, taste, and what they eat. Potatoes, fish, bread, and butter just made me feel weak and the loving detail didn't help. It isn't a very important part but it was my favorite part out of the book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia and these books are a part of who I am.

They are fascinated with the mansion that they move in to, and decide to do some exploring inside. In one of the rooms, they notice an old Wardrobe, and everyone except Lucy move on to the other rooms. Lucy, being most inquisitive, decides to open the wardrobe and step inside, not knowing that she is entering another world. Seeing all the wonderment of the mew world and meeting a new friend, she comes back to tell the others. Initially, they don't believe her, but once day, they all enter the wardrobe and into the World of Narnia. However, Mr. Tumnus, Lucy's friend has been made a prisoner by the evil witch of Narnia and it is up to the children to save Mr. Tumnus and make the land a happy place again.This was a delightful book to read. The simple language will make both adults and children enjoy the story. You get to meet interesting characters like Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Mr. Tumnus, the witch, and of course Aslan, the all-powerful lion and protector of Narnia. You meet the good and the bad, and get to see who wins the final battle between the two.This book has comedy, adventure, battles, sorcery and much more that will keep you interested throughout!

LewisReview by Cameron J. HumpherysIn this marvelous book by C.S. Lewis, The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, the settings are the Professor's house and Narnia. Narnia is a magical land where animals can talk and an evil Witch who thinks she'sQueen made it forever winter but never Christmas.The main characters in this book are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. These four siblings along with Aslan, a great lion with great powers, work to help free Narnia from the oppressive Witch, who has ruled by fear for a long time.When Aslan gave himself up to die instead of Edmund to appease a deep magic he activated an even deeper magic which kept him alive. Aslan being alive and the Witch not knowing it made it so that he could un-freeze those that the Witch had turned to stone. Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, \\"I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened.\\" But at the end of the story he is kind and good. An example of his goodness is when he breaks the Witch's wand."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The four Pevensie orphans Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the enormous country house of Professor Kirke. When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first. I've tried to read this book 2 times now. Although short, I just had trouble staying interested in it. I thought the movie was excellent. Normally the books are better than the movie, but in my case I don't think so. I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me. This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie. I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read.

One of these days I'll have the time to read the rest of them, but I read this one in high school, being familiar with the 1979 cartoon version.This was a fantastic book written in a colorful way. It doesn't have illustrations and doesn't need them. Those with good imaginations can easily picture the world of Narnia and get a real feel for all the wonderful characters inside."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I put the series in my TBR pile when it dawned on me that I'd never read them. My kids have, and I'd read this one aloud to them several times, but it seemed like a cultural thing I was missing out on, so in they went. The Lemony Snicket books are in there, too.I have no idea what to say about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that hasn't been said. I don't even know how I feel about it, because the story's so very familiar. There's the heavy-handed Christian allegory, I suppose, which doesn't take much to uncover. And there's really not a lot of depth to it, nor are the characters all that well-developed.But it is, after all, a children's story, a fast-moving tale of adventure and imagination, and Good vs. Evil. Hopefully, I'll have more to say on the subsequent books, which are new to me.One aside: reading this always brings to mind my daughter's kindergarten best friend, who maintained that she did have a doorway to Narnia in her bedroom closet. This frustrated my realist daughter no end, because she couldn't convince her friend that it was just a story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Few reading experiences are richer and more delightful than taking another trip into Narnia, especially when doing so via the mysterious wardrobe. C.S. Lewis's enchanting fairy tale is warm, beautiful, and inspiring with every read. I have personally read it four times in my adult life. (I never read it as a child.) And I could probably read it at least forty more times.In this story Lewis enables the reader to step into the shoes of Peter, Edmund, Susan, or Lucy -- whichever character you find is most like you, or whichever one has the tightest grip on you. Things like childhood fancy and fun, sibling rivalry, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption all play crucial roles in this tale. And it's presented in such a way that a child and adult alike can both learn and understand.Many readers intrigued by the Gospel allegory the book is so famous for will not be disappointed. But many may be disappointed by the allusion to Adam having a wife before Eve named Lilith. This may be a turn-off to some, and I will not defend Mr. Lewis in this area. But I will say that it is a story and should never take the place of the Word of God. Parents and educators would do well to keep this in mind should the matter come up.In other words, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a book about theology or a commentary on the Bible. But it is a fantastic example of what happens when the major themes of the Scriptures are mixed with classic fairy-tale telling and quality children's literature."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of four children that stumble into a wardrobe... the magical door to another world.

An excellent book for all.Anna del C.Author of \\"The Elf and the Princess\\"The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Okay, I finally got around to reading one of the most famous children's fantasies series ever done. Depending on who you talk to, this is actually the second book in the series if you read it by topic, but Lewis wrote this one first, dedicating it to his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. While perusing the Large Print editions of fiction in my local library, I was very pleased to discover this entire series by Lewis, and it is the illustrated version to boot! (Illustrations are b&w; line sketches by Pauline Baynes, much like the illustrated edition of the classic Wind in the Willows). The text of the book runs about 44,000 words so it is not a lengthy or deep read. It is intended for young children, possibly to be read to them. But this entire series is also an allegorical tale of Christianity, not just a simple fairy tale.In the first book of the series (thematically speaking), Lewis tells of creation, when he relates how The Magician's Nephew plays a part in the creation of the world of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is therefore a children's tale about triumph over evil, about the Christ and his redemption and the kingdom of God restored back to faithful believers, and the defeat of Satan. The gospel in a juvenile nutshell, to be exact. In the subsequent books of the series, Lewis deals with fulfilling our destiny with God's plan for our life (The Horse and His Boy); joy in the midst of tempest, with Christ as our conqueror (Prince Caspian); how we can be influenced by a future eternity if our hearts are set toward heaven (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader); a victorious hope against death with our resurrection (The Silver Chair); and the coming Armageddon and return of Jesus Christ and the new heaven and earth (The Last Battle). This all makes compelling reading, when you consider the hopelessness and misdirected avenues taken in sagas such as the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, which are sword and sorcery without any redeeming values.The story is very simple. Four children, Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund, all brothers and sisters, are sent away to a safe house in the English countryside to avoid the WW2 blitz in London. A friendly Professor takes them in. they explore the huge and strange house they are in and accidentally discover a magical passageway into a frozen world full of odd creatures. Lucy first falls through the doors of a wardrobe in one of the rooms, and discovers the world of Narnia. The others follow soon thereafter, and are soon involved in the mystery of this place. They get to meet Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, who has returned to reclaim his kingdom from the wicked White Witch. A sacrifice is made and a battle or two is fought, and Narnia is saved. This is plainly the good vs evil of the gospel accounts of the Christian Bible.Aslan (surely the original \`lion king') is a type of Christ, right up to his sacrificial death at the hands of the witch (Satan). Lewis wastes no time about fine details but carries his young characters right along briskly from scene to scene. I was a bit put off by the appearance of the character of Father Christmas and his reindeer and sleigh and gifts (a type of Santa) but at least Lewis had the courtesy to have this jolly guy praise the king (Aslan) as the real power of giving and love and joy. The entire story is chock-block full of Christian typology, in spite of many critics thinking otherwise. Lewis was perhaps the last century's best and most loved Christian apologist, and he has given the world of youth something very moralistic and divine to sink their teeth into here.I have no doubt that I will read the others sometime. I was prompted to read this one now because there is a very recent movie release based on this particular book, and I want to see it as well. The movie versions of the world of Narnia which were done before were effective in their day, including an animated TV series. The British are experts at this sort of thing. There are even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series. The website ChristianityToday.com offers a lot of help in that direction. Walden Media, a division of Walt Disney Pictures, has produced the latest version of this story in full feature mode, and it is directed by Andrew Adamson, who also directed the previously successful and popular movies Shrek and Shrek II. While the movie audiences of the world seem to be on a quest for mythological escapism at the theaters, there isn't a great deal there of intelligent design or of upright moral teachings. This is a refreshing difference, and the old saying that \\"the book is usually better\\" is still very true in this age of computer-generated images and highly paid actors.I have never been a fan of science fantasy or any of the plethora of sword & sorcery literature out there - I've rarely seen the sense of it all. But if good themes and morals can be portrayed in an entertaining and different way, I will pay attention. While Tolkein's Lord of the Ring series bored me to no end (movies included) and while Harry Potter or the Wizard of Oz or the uncounted TV series which barf out those constant and stilted tales of witches and ghosts and phantom warriors and occultic happenstances, a series like this, composed by someone I personally consider to be the most capable writer in the English languange of the past century, is a treat in every way. An older child-centered adventure that is slow but more appealing is The Princess and the Goblin by George Macdonald, who was an important influence on Lewis."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great book for people of all ages.

The story in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very interesting story. It's interesting because it's a story about this magic land inside of a coat closet, so it get you think about how Narnia got in a closet. The story is age-appropriate, and it would appeal to the kids because it is a Fantasy and Adventure story. That type of age group loves stories that have adventure. The book is very well written and easy to understand; C.S. Lewis is a good author. It is easy to conclude from the title and formation of the book that it has something to do with a lion, a witch and a wardrobe.The theme of the story is that good will triumph over evil and that you have got to have trust in people. Yes the theme is worth conveying to children to let them know that good will overpower evil with the right tools and attitude. The theme is moralistic and it may be a little overly moralistic to some people because of the religious connection. In my opinion the theme is not overly moralistic.The plot of the story is very well constructed. It introduces you to the land of Narnia, and sets each piece of the story in the right spot at the right time. It's not a confusing plot, it's a very easy plot to follow. The plot of the story is original and fresh, but the believable part is a little hard. You have to try and really work to believe kids have the power to save a whole magical land. All the characters, especially Lucy, seem really convincing and credible. They all grow from the experience in different ways, some grow in imagination and some in trust, and all four kids are changed by going to the land of Narnia.This is a very good story for all ages to read; it has the important elements of a great story, the laughter and the tears. You learn from this book really fast who is good and who is not. It has symbolism to reading that is really subtle, but if you pay attention, you will pick up on it. I like the book because of the air of mystery with what is in the wardrobe and at first only one of the kids, Lucy, believes in Narnia. It is a really good book that all kids need to read. You will like it; it is one of my favorites.Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia S.)"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"How can you not love The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe? This book is just tremendous. I listened to it on audiobook recently and fell in love with it all over again. This is one of those books that you could read or listen to once a year and never get sick of it. Love it!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time. It is loved by not just children, but men and women of all ages. I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories, and they, along with CS Lewis' other writings that I discovered as an adult, have had an immeasurable impact on my life.Indeed, I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books, but I will try to do so. We will start with the first review about the first book, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order, not chronological order.Most everyone knows the base story. Probably many know it better than their own country's history. Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II. Among these are four siblings, the Pevensies. They are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.Once at the house, first Lucy, then Edmund, and eventually all four of the children, wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia. Really, (as shall be revealed in later books) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own. The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant, the White Witch Jadis, who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans, two boys and two girls, sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel, it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.Along the way, many adventures are had, and many lessons are learned. Edmund betrays them, and is repentant later on. He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion, Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling, but also of wit, description, and wonderful use of the English language. The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable, and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading. The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating. The audience is transported directly into the story, and can almost see and smell what the characters do, and eat the foods along with them. What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly \\"high-minded\\" in his words and descriptions. He was elegant without seeming snooty. This is not always easy to do, and Lewis did it quite well.All of these ideas are well-known about the book, but there is even more to glean from the work. To be sure, the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ, and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor. Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures, and thus they have lost much of their impact on us. When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund (and rising in the end), or even of any sacrificial character in other stories (whether they rise like Gandalf, or stay dead), it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.There are many other areas that I could examine, but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough. This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view (a very *Christian* view), that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history, including the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said, and I heartily disdain putting words in an author's mouth. I have always hated that people say what an author thinks, especially if they don't know what the author thinks, or if their statements of the author's intents actually *contradicts* the author's beliefs.The above disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions. But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero, because it is important for us to consider how even in this area, the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis' story. In the history of the West and of America in particular, there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe. This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West. This is pure bunk. To be sure, the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history, but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant, and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others, than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures. They were murderous and petty, and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people. The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero. The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.Really, the early concept embraced by the Church is identical, except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero. The hero was called on to do good in honor of God. This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it's control, in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for \\"glory\\" that many of the supposed \\"heroes\\" pursued.Eventually, a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went, and the \\"hero\\" changed. Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted. Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero. This is what is special about Aslan the Lion, and even Edmund as well. Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund, and via the prophecy, *all of Narnia itself*. Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch's wand, leaving himself open to attack.This sacrificial hero is important to our history, and it is one we are fast losing. Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth. Indeed, many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW, as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books. For helping to teach, and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years, we owe a massive debt to Lewis.This book inaugurates a series that has many \\"hidden\\" nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace. It is also a frollicking good story. Please pick up this book and the others, you will *NOT* regret it.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books. When I was a child, I enjoyed it for the action and story, but as I got older, really started to grasp between the lines. CS Lewis is definitely an amazing author and his entire Narnia set is a classic and a must for anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Out of all the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, the first published is also one of the strongest of the series; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is a fantasy book, about a land called Narnia, where all sorts of imaginary creatures live; mythological creatures, magical beasts, talking animals and so forth. Four children enter it through a magical door in a wardrobe, and are soon drawn into a sort of power play between the supernatural lion Aslan, and the White Witch Jadis, who's been claiming the right to rule Narnia for many years; turning dissenters to stone. By the numbers, it's clear that Aslan is more powerful, but the Witch is clever, and knows many tricks. It's the type of story we've heard a number of times before, and if you don't care for allegory, you can skip to the last two paragraphs now.In the past, I've said that Narnia is mainly more protestant than Catholic, but I may need to re-evaluate that, because the symbolism in this book is positively sacramental in nature at many points. When mice nibble ropes off of Aslan as he lies on a stone table, there's a eucharistic image to be seen there, of eating the body of Christ on an altar (since Aslan is clearly Jesus in lion form.) On top of this, the sacrament of confession is nearly mentioned. After being rescued, Edmund spends time talking to Aslan in private, and afterwards, everyone is told that there's no need to \\"talk about what is past.\\" A discussion with the savior in a private place, and the forgiveness of sins? What else could it be, but reconciliation?I also think it's interesting that the oldest boy, and the one who's clearly the group's leader, is named Peter. This aspect of the bible; the primacy of Saint Peter among the apostles, is only rarely admitted outside of the Catholic Church, and their king and queenship would seem to be an allegory for both heaven, and the church.Apart from this, the book's storyline seems to be a clear allegory of the passion and death of Our Lord, with Aslan as Jesus, and the White Witch standing in for Satan. Lucy and Susan are the holy women. Still, some of the roles aren't as easy to fit in as all that. Edmund seems to have aspects of both Saint Peter (betraying and being forgiven) and Judas (selling people out for a promised reward.) However, neither role is really precise, which may be for the best. It gives the story a flavor of originality, which it might not have had otherwise.In particular, this book's main premise; of a \\"Deep Magic,\\" which even Aslan must never break is perhaps the clearest allegory of all; representing something that most modern people want to ignore; Natural Law. Too many people want to just wander off and do their own thing, and forget that even if the law allows them to do certain things, the natural law, and the final judge are still there, and they can still run afowl of them. Even God's will for our salvation only has so much leeway when it comes to transgressions of the natural law, and that's one thing that Lewis gets absolutely right.However, there's also one point near the very end, where I sort of winced as well. It's a few pages into the last chapter, when everyone is seated on thrones. Aslan uses the words \\"Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.\\"Not only does this prove to be false later in the series, but the phrase itself sounds dangerously like \\"once saved, always saved,\\" a belief held by many protestant denominations, but not by the Catholic Church. Still, it would have been worse if it had got beyond just being a simple phrase.As a book of fiction, it's entertaining, but more if you know your myths. It's good for children, and unlike most books in the series, has a strong, frightening villain, with a major role in the plot, which only makes the rest of the story that much more exciting. It has some weak points with respect to pure storytelling style, but not much more so than most children's books.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe may be the best fictional storybook out there for Christian children. It's fun, exciting and packed with the sentiments of the faith. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book is very fascinating.

This is the first \\"real book\\" -- i.e., a book that couldn't be read easily in one sitting -- that my daughter and I have shared. It was a really great first.I never read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, nor had them read to me. While the first few chapters held my daughter's attention, I wasn't exactly impressed. I thought the writing was a bit clumsy, a little too heavy on 1940s British vernacular. I also thought the characters -- the children at this point -- were poorly developed. However, once the kids are in Narnia \\"for good,\\" the entire tone of the book changes, as does the writing quality. Particularly, the scenes near the end are very well-written, exciting, and evoke a lot of emotion. My daughter would always want two chapters before bedtime, and as the book drew to a close, I'd want to read her a third or fourth!We are now reading Prince Caspian, which I'm told is really the second book in the series (although the books have been reordered after the fact, so that even The Lion, The Witch and, the Wardrobe is no longer Book 1), and we plan to go through the whole series. Many people consider the Chronicles series to be some of the greatest books ever written -- adults, I'm talking about. I don't think I agree with that at all, as I don't think I'd really care to read them on my own. However, as an experience to share with my daughter, the books are excellent: Good enough, rich enough with symbolism to keep my attention and interest, and magical enough to keep her excited and wanting to read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I adore these books.

Though it has been more than a decade since, this book has remained one of my all-time favorite works of literature, and I try to reread it once a year. It has an enchanting effect on the heart, mind and soul that never diminishes.The novel features four British children: Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) who discover a magical world hidden behind fur coats in a wardrobe. In &quot;Narnia&quot;, they encounter an endless parade of fantastic characters and events that aid them in their quest to free the land of Narnia from the spell of the White Witch. She makes winter a permanent season and turns those who oppose her into stone. The most prominent Narnians are the talking animals, but especially the lion Aslan who, with the children's help, must return spring and benevolent rule to the land.On a more analytical note, I find it fascinating how C.S. Lewis uses allegory to loosely bridge his fictional world with well-known themes and stories from the Bible. You can most easily recognize this in the ever-present battle between good and evil and the symbolic representation of Christ's Resurrection in the guise of Aslan's death and revival on the Stone Table. Which fulfills an &quot;even deeper magic from before the dawn of time.&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a modern classic that should be included in EVERYONE'S library.

However, I didn't read it until recently, at the age of 21. But for me, and possibly others, it took me back to my childhood, when you believed in the magical, and the unseen.

This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has.

Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time.

Tolkein's masterful LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and Terry Brooks' exciting SHANNARA series and the brilliant works of Stephen R. Lawhead. But, for some reason, I missed out on C.S. Lewis. I had been told this was a children's book.And then, when I was 17 and going on Summer vacation, I picked up THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE on a lark and began to read it. I couldn't put it down. I literally read it in one sitting, one night. The next day, I rushed out and bought as many of the rest of the NARNIA series as I could find. Sadly, the bookstore in the resort town where I was staying did not have the last two titles. I was desperate! I ordered those titles and put a rush on it. Over the next four days, I read the next four books in the series and kept calling the bookstore to see if my order had come in. At the last second, as I finished book 5 in the series, the final two books arrived, and I devoured them.Since then, I've read THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE many times. Recently, I re-discovered this handsome new edition and enjoyed the story all over again. Is it a children's book? Yes. But it is so much more than that. Many adults and scholars with great learning have had their lives profoundly affected by reading this book. Why?Of course, it is beautifully written by one of the true masters of English literature. The story is captivating--the magical land of Narnia and its mysterious inhabitants are portrayed vividly for us by Lewis. The characters, both the main children and the Narnian creatures, are colorful and entertaining. The \\"good guys\\" are sympathetic and brave, if flawed. There is tremendous humor. And pathos.Aslan the Lion is majestic and awe-inspiring. And the villians here are really villians...the icy witch and her evil minions are truly hateful.Beyond all of that is a powerful and subtle allegory about some of the deeper truths of life that are amazingly compelling and moving. Perhaps more than one reader has had to dab a few tears from their eyes at certain points.It may sound like hype, but I truly believe that everyone should read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This superb adaptation by Amanda Benjamin of the C. S. Lewis children's classic is available as stand alone book (hardback and paperback) and book and cassette recording read by Nickolas Grace. Birmingham's true-to-life illustrations complement the narrative magnificently and, dare I say it, will stand the test of time equally as well as have the beloved original illustrations by Pauline Baynes. Amanda Benjamin's adaptation of the original story is faithful to the narrative of C. S. Lewis' story. It neither avoids nor sugar-coats the treachery of Edmund, nor the grim event of Aslan's sacrifice. Though not an abrigement, the narrative maintains the joy and thrills and mysterious wonder of the cherished Lewis story.I've 'road tested' this lovely book with my own young niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) and have had as much enjoyment seeing their excitement and happiness as I got when I first read the story at 11.A first class Christmas or birthday present for any child who enjoys reading, listening to a good story or appreciates beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is the second volume (chronologically) in The Chronicles of Narnia (after The Magician's Nephew, before The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Last Battle).This book takes place during World War II, many years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, and tells the story of four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They are exploring the big house of an old Professor (which I'm guessig is Digory from the first book) where they've been sent during the air-raids, when Lucy enters the old wardrobe in en empty room upstairs to hide in it.Only this wardrobe is actually a direct passage to the world of Narnia, and Lucy finds herself in a forest on a snowy night, the only light that of a lamppost. There she meets a Faun named Tumnus, who is indeed very amazed to meet a legendary Human, an invites her to tea. In the cozy warmth of his home, he tells her of the evil White Witch, who is turning everyone who opposes her to stone, and whose spell on Narnia makes it always winter and never Christmas.When Lucy finally gets out of the wood and then out of the wardrobe again, no time has actually passed, and of course, when she tells her story to her brothers and sister, none of them believes her. Edmund in particular likes to make fun of her.On another, rainy day, when they're all playing hide-and-seek in the huge mansion, Edmund decides to hide in the wardrobe and he too finds himself in Narnia. But instead of the Faun, he meets the White Witch, who lures him with Turkish Delight (his favourite sweets) and by making him believe that he can become King if he brings her his brother and sisters.The book then tells the adventures of the four kids in Narnia, meeting a friendly couple of talking badgers and all kinds of other fantastic animals and creatures, among then the powerful Lion King Aslan, and helping them save the world from the evil usurper Queen.Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think that I would have been more enchanted, amazed and curious about the world of Narnia if I hadn't read all about its creation in the first book. I would have wondered about the lamppost, for example (and it would have been nice to read about the Lion's song later). Knowing about it in advance, I'm sure I found it a tad duller, because I wasn't discovering it at the same time as the kids. This is a nice story, and I know it's a Classic, but I must say it's not as captivating as I thought it would be.I advise you read it in the publication order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; The Last Battle."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher. Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side. Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it. It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy. For adults, it can teach us simple faith in our always-complex world.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I actually haven't read any of the Narnia books until the summer of 2005. I knew that a movie version of this book was coming out and I wanted to see it. My brother, a big, big fan of Chronicles of Narnia, made me read the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before seeing the movie. I read it grudgingly because I was in the middle of reading another book but I figured it was a short book so it wouldn't take long. By the second chapter, I fell in love with the book! It's so good and very well written. The Pevensie children are very likeable and you really do care for them. You feel bad for Edmund when he's being mistreated by the White Witch. Speaking of the White Witch, this book has one of the best villains of all time. It's a refreshing break from the very cliche persona of a villain; having black clothes, black hair, dark face, being mean right off the bat, and those kinds of things. This villain had white clothes (hence the name WHITE Witch), had a light face, and starting off being \\"nice\\". Aslan is also a great character. This book really started me on a Narnia craze. I now have all seven books, the movie, and I can't wait for the next movie to come out. If you wanna read these books, or if you just need a book to read, make sure you do NOT skip this one!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story, and a great film!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I never read this as a child. I had no idea what I was missing until I read this story several months ago. Better late than never. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with my grandchildren. From an adult's perspective the symbolism is profound. I'm so glad I took the time to read this classic. I look forward to reading the other tales of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style accessible to children, or that has a narrative voice that is speaking as to children a &quot;children's book&quot;, and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they often miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book, and the others in this series, fall into that category, just as do &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkein, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, by James Barrie, and &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll, among others.This book is a delightful story, even if as a non-Christian I did find the Christian symbolism a bit heavy-handed. (The blood-sacrifice and ressurrection of the character intended as a Christ-figure was a bit much.) But even so, and in spite of a couple of minor quibbles, this book still was unquestionably a five-star delight. For those who don't have my level of discomfort with Christian symbology, it should be even more enjoyable. Certainly, if you have children, they should enjoy this story, but even if you don't, don't fail to read it for yourself. It's well worth the attention of an adult."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"When C.S.Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia, this was the first tale that he produced and not \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". There is a problem with ordering the books other than in the way that Lewis published them primarily due to the fact that the mystery of Narnia is better revealed when you read the books in this way. The reader is meant to \\"discover\\" Narnia as the children in Lewis' classic tales do.What makes these books so powerful is not necessarily the message of Christian Dogma that Lewis spent his life analyzing and lecturing on, but the incredible gift of story telling that Lewis possessed. Lewis had the ability to make the people, places, and things that he wrote about come alive and leap off the page. While reading about the fine feast served at the last stop before reaching the end of the world (in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader)one can almost taste it. One can almost see the heavy smoke curling down out of Puddleglum's pipe in \\"The Silver Chair\\", or feel as if you are actually taking tea with Tumnus in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".I view the Chronicles of Narnia as classics of Children's Literature and something that should be apart of the reading list of any child as they reach the fourth or fifth grade. Even adults will find them to be facinating reading. Of all the works that Lewis produced fiction or non-fiction, I feel that these are the works that he will be best remembered for."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardobe is a very good book.

This book is second in a series called &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which happens to be one of the only children's stories written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis was famous for his Christian writings, which holds evident is this book for he relates to the story of Jesus Christ throughout it's entire theme. This is done through the symbolism of many of the characters (Alsan to Jesus; the White Witch to Satan) and themes (good vs. evil). These observations may not be evident to children, but it makes an excellent reading for them and adults alike. Aside from the symbolism, the story is timeless and magical as it lets a child's imagination wander and sparks the child within us."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I read this book when I was about six and I have loved it so much that I have read it about eight times. This book has been a great wonderful escape to a whole new world full of fantasy each time I read it. I am a sixteen year old girl that has loved this book for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to have the same great adventures that the four children had in Narnia. This book is highly recommended for children and adults alike. I intend to read the book many more times to come. It is a book that never seizes to capture my imagination."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is a book I read a number of years ago and I still pick it up every now and then. Lewis' story is a classic tale that transports the reader into its pages. I can clearly remember the days when I would climb into my own wardrobe hoping to hear the crunching of snow under my feet, or see the faint glow of a lamp-post in the distance. [admittedly this was only ten years ago!] I recommend the 'Narnia' series to anyone of any age group. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was one of my very favourites, as was 'The Voyage of the Dawntreader'. I hope others who buy this book will get as much enjoyment from it and the rest of the series as I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia. Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan. In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor.One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate. When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings. The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\" When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us. This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story.Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight. The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight. Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensation of mysterious horror.\\" In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin.Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one. The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar. Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God!This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Hi. ...I am here to talk about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is the beginning of the book to start you off. It is about Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund. They all have to move because of World War II to their grandpa&#65533;s house. He is a professor. When they get there, they decide to look around and they come across a wardrobe. Lucy decides to go in, and when she reaches her arm through, she feels a pine tree. She goes through and enters Narnia. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a fawn. He brings her back to his house and cozies her up and she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Mr. Tumnus is crying because he was working for the bad white witch. That&#65533;s all I will tell you about the beginning of the book.You meet lots of other characters like Aslam, the lion. He is practically the main character and he almost dies.

Twelve out of twelve people I asked said it was an awesome book. Matt (my friend) says that the war that takes place at the end of the book was the best part. It is a fabulous book so read it and I guarantee you will like it.

Some people may be a bit put off by the references to the religious undertones of these books, It would be a tragedy if some where put off reading these because of this. I for one was completely unaware of the christian undertones and just read it for the great story it is. The book has stood the test of time and to me is a classic.

Lewis is an excellent but easy, read chapter book. I recommend this book to people of all ages because they can either read it by themselves or get it read to them. People who like adventure type books and chapters that leave you thinking, then this book is the book for you. Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, the main characters, get sent to a far away home because of the London war. Later Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to a secret place. In this secret place there is a White Witch that makes it always winter. Lucy, Susan, and Peter have to get to the Stone Table to meet Aslan to fight the White Witch, to try and get their brother back.Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan made the Chronicles of Narnia very interesting because the characters were detailed by the author and he told a lot about them. Peter is the oldest and he tries to keep everybody together and try to help them. Susan is the second oldest. She helps Peter take care of Lucy and Edmund too. Lucy is the youngest. She is very cute and funny. Edmund is the next youngest. He tends to boss Lucy around. The characters all turn out to help each other in the end.Next, the theme of the book helped bring the characters together to fight the White Witch. The characters went through a lot of change of the different worlds, seasons, and the people who the characters had to live with. The book was terrific because of the theme of the book.The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a different type of book which made the setting tell a lot about what happened where. The book is in a different world so it makes you think in a different way. The wardrobe is wooden and filled with fur coats. The woods were filled with animals that are mostly in a fantasy book. The time frame is the present and in about one to two days. The author describes the book so much and well that it looks like the time frame is in weeks.Therefore I believe that this book is all about change. The characters go through different changes during the book. The characters are different then other characters in other books because all of the animals in the book talk. The setting describes where they are all of the time very well. Every one of those things helps make this novel very splended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the WardrobeIn the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S.

Lucy is showing faith, Loyalty, trust to her friends and family.The theme of the book was based on power. The main power was between Aslan and the White Witch. Alsan was the true ruler of Narnia. The White Witch was the flase Queen of Narnia. The main struggle was who was going to rule Narnia.The setting started in London and was almost destroyed by war. When thet moved to the country and was untouched by war. When they were in Narnia it was beautiful but was going to be soon toched by war.In conclusion, I feel like I Was there. It made me think about how the kids felt when they were gone from home. Every page you turn has some sort of adventure in it. I recommend this book to people that have experienced war because they have a lot of fighting in the book. I forget something you should read it if you like fantasy a lot that fantasy is you life."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I've had this story in my life since I was a child.

As far as I can tell, Lewis never instructed his publisher to reorder the series, he merely mentioned casually in a letter that it would be okay to read them chronologically. That hardly constitutes a statement of \\"the original wishes of the author,\\" as HarperCollins claims.The editors at HarperCollins seem to think that the children for whom these books were intended are so unintelligent that they would get too confused if they were to read them in the order in which Lewis wrote them. Never mind the fact that millions of children have thoroughly enjoyed them in the their original order for half a century.Next thing you know, HarperCollins will be reordering the chapters in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey because modern readers must be too stupid to follow them as they have been read for over two thousand years.If you are new to the Chronicles of Narnia, do yourself a favor: get a permanent marker, blackout the numbers on your books, and re-renumber them back to their original order:1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2) Prince Caspian3) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4) The Silver Chair5) The Horse and His Boy6) The Magician's Nephew7) The Last Battle"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the supreme treasures of all English literature--a wonder in childhood, at coming of age, in adulthood, and in old age. It is also a bringer of hope and a force for good in a world where despair and evil are present and need resisting. It is one of the best gifts you can give a child, a friend, or yourself.You should definitely note, however, that the publisher of this and some other recent editions has made a moronic and despicable decision to change the order in which Lewis intended the books in the series to be read. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" is the first book in The Chronicles, and the way Lewis intended his readers to first encounter Narnia. \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" the next-to-last book in the series as Lewis wrote it, is a sort of flashback in Narnia's history, and the events related in it take place earlier than those in \\"LWW\\" in a chronological sense. IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ \\"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\\" FIRST, AND TO READ \\"THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW\\" SIXTH, AS LEWIS INTENDED. CHANGING THE ORDER CHANGES THE WHOLE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE STORY FOR THE WORSE. Don't let the delusion of the publisher's staff that they somehow outrank C.S. Lewis in literary and artistic judgment rob you of the best possible experiencing of this masterpiece--READ LWW FIRST!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This was one of the first in a myriad of novels that I first explored in the infancy of my interests in literature. I enjoyed reading this book at the prepubescent stage of my life because the children in the book were reminiscent of contemporary children but they exhibited aspects of children coping with a terrible situation, such as war and they sough escape through the wardrobe. The novel began in war-torn times and created a wonderful dream world to alleviate the pain of reality.The fascinating part of the novel that takes you away from the terrible reality is that the animals in the book talk and are presented with real human emotions. Somehow animals explain emotion turmoil and loss in life when the people characters were lackluster and stoic. Soon the children gradually grow up through their contact with animals in the dreamscape of their imagination. Narnia is a place where issues that are difficult to grapple with in reality are skillfully explained and dealt with in the imaginative and creative world of a child's mind."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"How much do I love this book. I recently revisited it and had the experience of reading it out loud to my nephew (7) and niece (5). I hadn't read it for quite a few years and, although I still know the story well, there were parts of the book that had faded with the passing of time and were brought back to life with the re-reading of the book, as tends to happen.For instance - I'd completely forgotten the feeling of complete joy and wonder when Aslan bounds over the wall of the Queen's courtyard and begins to breathe life back into the statues there. I'd forgotten good old Rumblebuffin and how much he made me laugh. I'd forgotten that, in spite of what the movies do, the battle scene was fleeting and over so quickly because the focus of this book is not on the grim trials of war but rather on the redemption of the living creatures spoken of.While reading through the story and watching my niece and nephew sink into despair at Aslan's death I felt again the pang of sorrow I felt as a child. After we'd finished the chapter my nephew looked at the title of the next, being \\"The Triumph of the Witch\\" and he gasped in shock. \\"But, she doesn't win.. does she, Aunt?\\" he asked.He learned quickly that in spite of her best efforts.. in this beautiful, wonderful story.. of course evil does not win.

Being that I began my journey into the world of fantasy with reading the Harry Potter books, I did not grow up with The Chronicles of Narnia like many of us have.After seeing the movie version of this book, I decided to read these books in chronological order (starting with \\"The Magicians Nephew\\"), and my first journey in Narnia was a pleasant one. When I picked up the second issue of The Chronicles of Narnia, the renowned classic \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" I was interested to see if it lived up to the constant praise it received.Again I insist, this book is very enjoyable-- it is not, in my mind, worthy of being called a classic. Narnia is a refreshing world that is beautifully described... when Lewis takes the time TO describe it, that is. This book could have easily spanned 300 or more pages, but instead it is crammed into 189 pages, which do not have enough room for the words needed to thoroughly describe the beautiful world of Narnia. The characters suffer as well, for we hardly get to know any of them or their motivations, and the climatic battle of Aslan's army against the White Witch's lasts for only about one page! This may be the only time this sentence will ever apply, but the MOVIE has a great amount more detail then the book, and allows you to get to know the characters much better.However, I am not saying this is a bad book. While Lewis's use of the word \\"presently\\" becomes so often that it grows to be annoying, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and I plan to keep reading The Chronicles of Narnia in hopes to one day have the whole collection. I definitely do recommend this book, but I also warn the readers not to expect a classic like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.While I don't enjoy Lord of the Rings as much as Harry Potter, I see why it is a classic, from the beautifully descriptive writing to the twisting plot, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" falls short of this. One last time, I will restate that while this book doesn't live up to the hype, it is ENJOYABLE and makes the reader smile often.PS: It is a great story to be read aloud!!6/10"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a wonderfull adventure story, but also a sad story .

Though the wrapping paper of the gift that Lewis gave us in \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is itself quite nice (an approach fully and wonderfully informed by early to mid twentieth century British life), it is the gift inside of the wrapping that is the true source of the book's power. Neither unnecessarily subtle nor offensively overbearing, the Christian allegory that Lewis unfolds is strong enough to be apparent to one accustomed to Christian narrative and imagery while not so blunt as to take away from the reading experience of one without such a frame of reference. And, bonus of bonuses, it is all rolled out in an exciting adventure that is able to engage and entertain all manner of reader. 5 stars and more if more could be given."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"About 60 years ago during World War 2 this story begins.

All the Children excepted for Lucy left the room right away. Lucy Stayed behind to excplore and went into the wardrobe. She found a magical world named Narnia. She met a friend in Narnia.

Their adventures to Narnia don't stop there. If you want to find out more about this magical place called Narnia then read the book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Just imagine a wondrous land, which no other person has ever seen, with creatures beyond comparison. A vast war, a hideous queen, talking animals, a never-ending winter, and a mysterious prophecy. That is what C.S Lewis brings to life in his masterpiece, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. He winds all of these supernatural events into one captivating tale, which is absolutely unbelievable.The magic all begins when four young children, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and their mischievous brother Edmund, discover a thrilling new land inside of a wardrobe called Narnia! Yet, the only problem is the White Witch is attempting to take over Narnia, by casting a spell over the entire land, and she plans to kill Aslan (the real king) in the process. It may sound like a short, typical story, but there are many, many more details. For instance, how Lucy meets a friendly faun (half goat, half man) and quickly befriends him. As soon as the other siblings enter the world of Narnia, they learn that the faun was taken captive (along with Edmund, but that appears later on). Oh, and when the children discover some talking beavers, they also discover a mystifying prophecy. And then how the White Witch's wolves (lead by the wolf Maugrim) soon find the beavers and the children, but luckily they do overcome the wolves. And did I mention a harsh, epic battle comes up between the Queen's Minotaurs and trolls, and Aslan's fauns and centaurs? Well, that happens too! Join the four children on their glorious adventure in the world on the other side of the wardrobe.However, sometimes a book's moral is more important than its events, and the moral in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that if you stay positive, cheerful, and if you forgive those who disobeyed you, you will always succeed. For example, Edmund ran away to the White Witches abode, and she took him captive, yet when he returned his brother and sisters forgave him.All in all, this book was a numinous fairy tale, which has every thing to do with family, loyalty, and absolute excellence. C.S. Lewis did it again, with his work of art, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. But, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was not his only masterpiece. He also wrote more books, all part of the series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" including The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, and many more!!Read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and discover the magical land of Narnia!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The lion, the witch, and the wardrobeI'd like to introduce this book to you! I recommend this book because it's easy to read and understand. It's also the best book ever because it's about a magical place called Narnia. Well one day peters, Susan's, Lucy's, and Edmond's dad goes off to war and they are sent to a professor's house. Once they got there they get all settled then they play hide and seek. But Lucy found a wardrobe and went in it. Lucy has just found the magical land called Narnia.Well since you know about the book lets talk about the theme. In this book the theme is pretty much the same. It's magical. It's magical because Lucy finds Narnia in a wardrobe. The witch can make hot coco and Turkish delight with a flick. She can also freeze people. But the lion can unfreeze people with a blow of his breath. Now don't you think that's magical? Well I do.Now let's talk about the characters. First of all you would do the same thing as them. Well Lucy explores Narnia and talks to strange animals. Edmond talks to the witch and takes hot coco and Turkish delight from her. Peter not believing in Narnia but later becomes a king of the magical world. Then you have Susan who becomes a Queen of Narnia, but also helps the lion live. Now wouldn't you have done the same thing as them? Well I would have.Well now let's talk about what Narnia looks like. Well Narnia is a very wintry place. It has a lot of snow and it's very cold. It's also very icy. Well that's because there is a big river between Narnia and Aslam. Aslam is where the lion lives. That place is a very springy place. It's grassy and very warm. And it's very beautiful there just like Narnia.Well that's about it, one more thing though. Over all I hope you enjoy and like this book as much as I did. You feel like your there and it puts a great picture in your mind. This is the best book ever and you will find out why after reading it. Well that's it.

The Narnia they find is locked in winter,under the spell of the White Witch. Edmund is captured, so the children, along withAslan, must save him, and the whole of Narnia. I would recommend this book to anyone.This book, along with the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series teaches verygood morals (the book was written by a Sunday school teacher). One of the morals itteaches is forgiveness. Peter and the others could have given up on Edmund forbetraying them, but they forgive him. And, the book teaches bravery, as was displayedthroughout the entire book, especially by Aslan.The religion implied in this book is very obvious. In the book, Lewis has madeAslan their god. In the book, Aslan came back to save Narnia, as the Christian \\"god\\" issaid will do. And, Aslan is very powerful, as we might expect a god to be.The Aslan character in this book is very interesting. As stated above, it is obviousthat Lewis has made him the god of Narnia. But, though he rises back, he dies forEdmund, who had betrayed the others.This book is good for anyone looking to read a good fiction. It was very exciting,and kept me reading. Also, many Christians would enjoy reading this book, to see all ofthe religion that is in the book. This was a very good book, along with the rest of theChronicles of Narnia series.-Bill L"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonderful, symbolizing story by C.S. Lewis. It deserves five stars with its greatly written story that keeps you turning pages one after another. The book can be classified as a wonderful fiction classic. The story is told by a narrator and without him/her telling the story, then we wouldn't get the full effect of the book that draws us into the characters. Lewisshows enthusiasm even through a narrator. He shows how other universes may exist a little bit closer than we may think.An entire story starts with one simple action: the turn of a wardrobe handle. When Lucy Pevensie opens a wardrobe door all she expects to find is a few hangers with coats, little did she know that she was totally wrong. She finds herself entering the world of Narnia: a world of magic and talking animals. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is set in Narnia; a world where a witch rules over the entire world, making it always winter and never Christmas. This is all because of the White Witch who will rule over Narnia until four children sit in the thrones at Cair Paravel. Most of the story happens because Lucy's brother Edmund betrays the family. Without this betrayal, the whole journey throughout Narnia would have been an easy and quick one. You should definitely read this book, no matter how old you are."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"One day Lucy Pevensie, accidentally, discovers a magic wardrobe-like portal into the magical land of Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus who kindly lets Lucy go after he tells her he intended on capturing her and giving her to the White Witch. Lucy then takes Edmund into Narnia with her where she loses Edmund who is put in a trance by the White Witch with magic Turkish delight. It makes him do anything to get another Turkish delight from her so he promises he'll bring his siblings: Peter, Lucy, and Susan to see her. Lucy and Edmund then meet up and leave Narnia. Then one day when the siblings are hiding from the housekeeper all four children enter Narnia together and decide to Tumnuse's house but find that the White Witch has arrested him from Mr. Beaver. They then join with Mr. Beaver to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the next day, but notice Edmund is gone. This is because Edmund has left to warn the White Witch about Aslan and Mr. Beaver's plan. Soon the Witch finds where Susan, Aslan, his followers, Peter, and Lucy are hiding, Aslan warns them in time so they see Aslan get tortured to death and stay with his dead body \`til morning where they see it is gone. Also they find the Stone Table broken in half. Then they see him and know he has risen from the dead. They all then fly to the Witch's castle. Peter's army is exhausted, but Aslan makes quick work of the Witch and Peter and his army finish off the followers of the Witch. Then everyone forgives Edmund and they become kings and Queens of Narnia for years. Finally they promise to return and leave through the wardrobe.One thing I liked about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that things are not always going well for the heroes. For instance, until the end Edmund is a follower of the Witch because he ate the Turkish delight. Another example at a point the only two together is Susan and Lucy. Peter took an army with him to go to fight the Witch and again Edmund was with the Witch. Even though he rises from the dead, Susan and Lucy watch Aslan get tortured to death. From this you can tell that the heroes' journey wasn't easy.Another interesting thing about this book was that there were a variety of characters. Like Tumnus the generous villain or the Witch the straight up villain.Edmund plays the good guy gone bad. Peter is the chosen one because he happens to be the oldest and the one Santa Claus gives the mystic sword. Aslan is the god-like character that is immortal never beaten or dead. As you can see there are characters of every kind in this story.I liked the whole setting, Narnia. I thought it was the perfect portrayal of a fantasy like world. You got talking beavers, flying lions, and an ice witch with a wand that turns things into stone and enchanted Turkish delights. Not to mention the way you travel to Narnia is through a magical wardrobe. Sounds as fantasy as it gets to me.Overall I think C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good book because I like to read books where the impossible happen. This book is definitely impossible in the world we know and reality. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers because you won't know what could happen on the next page."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book was great and it had a good theme. It made me feel good inside and made me feel like I could relate myself to the story and I could picture myself in the kids positions. I felt like I would once be in the same position, except for being in magical worlds. This book was so good I couldn't show how good it was in words. You should read this book and you will see how awesome it is. This book will make you want to read the other Chronicles of Narnia books"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I must admit that the title \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is not what compelled me to read this book. It seemed a bit too childish for me. I am familiar with some of Lewis's other work, but this is my first trip to Narnia. In preparation for the upcoming movie, I decided to make my first visit to Narnia.Four Children staying in a mostly empty house can give rise to numerous potential adventures. When a passage in a wardrobe closet leads to another world, a strange adventure is available to the children. Narnia, where it is always been winter since the white witch became queen, has been awaiting the fulfillment of a prophecy. When the four children arrive in fulfillment of the prophecy, they meet the mighty lion Aslan. The great strength of this lion can only originate from one source than allows the witch to ultimately be conquered and the four children to reign as kings and queens of Narnia.While this book is short and simplistic, the adventure has more than enough depth to capture the adult reader's attention. While books with fauns and talking animals are normally not on my reading list, I have a great appreciation for this book. There is certainly a reason this book has been treasured for more than fifty years and across generations of families."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"That is all I can say about thiis book. It is a book that you will never forget. C.S. Lewis is one of the most talented and wonderful authors that ever lived. After you read this book you will want to start it all over again.

It is a very short book and I am pretty sure I read the book in less time then it took me to watch the movie. Most younger readers will not have a problem with this one and it is entertaining enough to keep them reading until the end.The story seemed kind choppy to me and there was very little character development. However, this is only the first of the chronicles of narnia and I've heard the the other books are better and since they involve the same characters there is bound to be more development. I think I might have just been to old when I read this book.If you're looking to get your young reader into novels then this might be a good introduction. Then they can continue with the rest of the series. If you're looking for something entertaining for your 14+ year old, this isn't it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy C.S. LewisHarperTrophyIn a room of the Professor's house stands a wardrobe of coats and something more, something that was destined to be discovered by teh youngest of four children, Lucy Pevensie, while exploring the house. Lucy and her siblings, Peter, Susan, and Edmund, explore the land inside the wardrobe; the land of Narnia, frozen in eternal winter by the White Witch, a land that is waiting to be set free as the prophecy says. However, after over 100 years of winter, the creatures have lost almost all hope, but the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, and the appearence of the four children causes a great change, a betrayal, a great sacrifice, and a great war thast will decide the future of Narnia and all of its creatures.The four Pevensies are very curious children. Little did they know, they had a huge part in the freedom of Narnia. Their arrival signaled the return of Aslan, the end of winter, and the beginning of spring. Peter is the oldest of the four, then Susan, Edmund, and at last Lucy. Peter tries to act like their father (who was probably sent out to war) while Susan tries to act like their mother (who is back at their home in London). Edmund is greedy and even betrayed his siblings to the witch for power that wasn't real. Lucy is very curious and truthful. She has never told a lie. Although the first impression of Aslan is terrifying, this lion is quite gentle, kind, caring, and brave. He is greater that any other lion in Narnia. He has a lovely golden mane and great, royal, solemn, overwhlming eyes. Aslan was there before the dawn of time (this is a fact that will save his life). The Great Lion is the enemy of Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch is the last Queen of Charn. Jadis has had Narnia under her control for over 100 years. She is as white as snow and has a very red mouth. The White Witch wears a golden crown on the top of her head and carries a long straight, golden wand in her right hand. This witch has a heart as cold as ice and turns creatures to stone with her golden wand. She is truly the evil creature of the story.This story is very magical and curious. I think this because in the story, Lucy discovers the wardrobe out of plain curiosity and the story gets more curious as you read on. I would also describe this story as magical because it is about a fictional world of fantasy. This book has a fantasy genre. I like this genre because is this book, there is a lot of mystical events which helps good triumph over evil. I recommend this book to children in grades three through five. It is truly a wonderful book, but I think that it is too easy for sixth and seventh graders. Third grade is mostly whne children start reading short chapter books a lot and fifth grade is when children usually stop reading short chapter books and start reading longer books. However, if you are a kid at heart and love a good story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book is fiction and was written in 1950. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is about two boys and two girls named Susan, Lucy, Peter, and Edmund. These four children were taken away from there home because of the war. They were taken to another house where they lived with a professor. The main part of the story takes place in Narnia.In Narnia there was an evil queen she was called the White Witch. She would make it snow all year but there was no Christmas. And if she saw someone that was happy she would turn them into stone. The most exciting part of the book for me was the battle between Aslan's army and the White Witch's army. What I liked about the book was that it tells you four kids could save a whole world. The book had a great ending it turned out that Susan, Lucy, Edmund, and Peter became the new kings and queens and Narnia was finally in peace."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is an awsome book!

There are of course other scene I would love to tell you all about but that would ruin the story. so I tell you go and read it because this is one of the best books I have ever read.[and I'm really not kidding.] So what are you waiting for GO AND READ!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Four children are sent to live away from home during a war, and stumble upon much more than they had anticipated.While playing a game of hide-and-seek, the youngest girl, Lucy, hides in a wardrobe. What seems like the perfect hiding place eventually turns into a wonderful, mythical land filled with all sorts of strange beasts and talking animals. There are centaurs, giants, and fauns; some animals I can't even really imagine.Upon her return from the fantasy world, nobody believes her story. In fact, nobody noticed she was gone. In the alternate world of Narnia, time is not related to time as we know it.Eventually, her brother Edmund (who I hated from nearly the first mention of his name) follows her through the wardrobe. The plot thickens when Ed meets up with the White Witch. She befriends him because of her fear for a prophecy that four children of Adam and Eve leading to her downfall.From there, the story seamlessly follows the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they travel through Narnia. They learn that Lucy's friend, a faun named Mr. Tumnus, has been taken captive by the White Witch. While Lucy feels compelled to help, the others are not all that interested; except Edmund, who is interested because of the pact he made with the White Witch to deliver all four children to her castle.Edmund betrays his family and goes the Witch. What follows is an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil, ubiquitous Christian allegory, and the inevitable happy ending.There are shocks, surprises, twists, and laughs. Perhaps the most important aspect of the story is the great leader Aslan, who is pure, and represents all that is wonderful (a not-so-subtle representation of Jesus). It's not overbearing as some would assume, but it's definitely there. Aslan teaches, nurtures, chastises, and leads. He gives selflessly, and fights for all that is pure and just.The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story. You'll immediately love certain characters and take sides.I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, and anyone who wants to read a great story. It's a wonderful book that transcends age and genre."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"When we read this in for our Book Group it was difficult to find a good list of discussion questions. Here is the list I compiled from questions I found on the internet. I hope this helps your book group!1) Many of Narnia's fantastical creatures are personified; name some of them. Which human qualities are most celebrated? Which are not?2) Elements of fantasy and real life are intermingled in the worlds of Narnia and \\"reality\\". What makes these worlds different from each other?3) Although they are children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have very distinct personalities. By portraying them the way he did, what messages might Lewis have been sending to children about human behavior.4) Each of the children undergoes some changes throughout the course of the novel. Discuss how these changes impact their characters.5) Symbolism is quite prevalent in this book. Discuss what Narnia and Aslan symbolize and how their portrayals shape Lewis's message. Who or what else is symbolic? How?6) In agreeing to sacrifice himself in Edmund's place without divulging to the White Witch theat he could return, Aslan might be considered somewhat deceitful. What other variances are there on the traditional definitions of good and evil?10) Aslan sternly reminds Peter to cleand his sword after he kills Maugrim. Why was cleaning his sword so important?7) When Lucy tries to minister to her wounded brother, Aslan hurries her along to tend to others. Does the theme of the greater food vs. the individual arise elsewhere in the story? What other themes arise?8) The Pevensie children leave London during World War II because the city they live in is being bombed. Yet Narnia they fought in a war. Do you find this ironic? -Talk about this.11) In Chapter 10 the children meet Father Christmas. How is he like the traditional image of Santa Clause? How is he different? What does he seem to represent?9) Notice the titles of Mr. Timnus' books. Do any of them strike you as strange or humorous? Why?12) The children are each given a gift by Father Christmas. Whose gift would you most like to have? Which do you think is most useful? Elaborate.13) In Chapter 7 the children hear about Aslan for the first time. Describe how each of them feels when they first hear about him. Why do you suppose they react so differently?14) Some readers think that there are parallels to the liberation of the stone statues in Chapter 16. They point to passages like Matt. 27: 52-54; Eph. 4:7-10. Do you see any similarities?15) In Chapter 17 the children (as adults) go after the White Stag. What do you think it represents in the story?16) Do you think it's an accident that the children return to England when they do? Why, or why not?17) Discuss the relationship of time in Narnia to the time in the children's world. How does it work for the children to grow into adults in Narnia, then returned to children in England?18) In the beginning the children have trouble with Lucy's claims that she has been to Narnia. What does the Professor say about this? How does he apply logic to this situation?19) Throughout the book there is a paradox about Aslan, which the Beavers describe as \\"good and terrible\\". Compare what they say about Aslan with what is said about God in the Bible.20) Aslan tells Mr. Beaver (p.137) \\"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Speculate on what he might mean by this.21) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, was written as a children's book.

When Lucy and Edmund came out of Narnia, Lucy told Edmund to tell the others about Narnia, but he said that Lucy was making it up. So, Lucy gets mad at him. One day a lady came to the house to show people the huge house. When the kids hide from the lady they hide in the wardrobe and then walk into the land of Narnia. When they are in Narnia they find two beavers and they invite the children over to have tea. All the sudden they realize that Edmund was missing! They go out looking for him. They all know that he went to find the White Witch because that's where he went the first time he was in the wardrobe. While the kids were looking for him they went to the stone table and meet Aslan (the lion). When Aslan came everything turned into spring. Then Aslan helped the kids find Edmund and get him back from the Witch. But in order to do that Aslan had to sacrifice his life and the Witch kills him. But Aslan came back to life and let out a big ROAR! Lucy and Susan hopped on his back and road all the way back to town.

The authors name is C.S. Lewis. I give it 4 stars.I gave it this amount of stars because the book is packed with very many details such as: Aslan was a big lion with a large gold main and huge paws. I also enjoyed how Aslan was raised from the dead and the stone table breaks. That is just like the bible. Aslan was sacrificed to save Edmond and Jesus died to save everyone. They were both then raised from the dead. They conquered the bad guy and good prevailed. They then went away. It really had me on the edge of my seat when the White Witch took over Edmond and tried to kill all of the other \\"Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve\\". She also turned all of the people or animals that crossed her into stone. She thought that she was the queen of Narnia but she was really and evil dictator that wanted to take over Narnia.My favorite part of the book is the battle. I thought it was very cool how Susan (one of the four kids, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy) shot an arrow at a pheonix and it lit on fire and made a wall of fire to prevent the Witch from getting to them. It really stunned me that the polar bears swung their heads and it took out the entire wall of fire! Then Aslan showed up with an entire new part of their army. They went to the witches house and \\"destoned\\" them all. In the end....I would also recommend any other books writen by this author because he is an amazing writer. Also, the books by Dan Brown are very good.

Now, the four children found themselves in a mystical world called Narnia. The children were amazed to see tiny snowflakes falling, creating a white blanket of snow covering land farther than they could see. Back at the house they came from, it was a rainy spring day. But what the children didn't know is that there were many adventures ahead of them to be explored in this white winter land.As I read this book, it kept my interest because the writing is fluent and intriguing. The book includes vivid verbs such as, vanishing, stooped, and swish. As well, C. S. Lewis uses great adjectives, like filthy, sulkily, and dreadful. C.S. writes so descriptively that it paints a picture in your mind. The book is also packed with excitement and adventure. There are suspenseful parts where you just can't put down the book. There are battles, there are creatures being turned into stones, and there are kidnappings.Over all, this is a very intriguing book that keeps you involved in exhilarating adventure.

The key characters are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who are brothers and sisters, Aslan, and many more. Peter is the oldest and happens to be bossy to his younger siblings. Susan is ladylike and Edmund is rude and mean. You will find in this book Edmund lies to many people. Lucy, on the other hand, is kind and thoughtful. The king of Narina, whose known as Aslan, is powerful and kind to people who are kind to him. Many, many more characters are included.In the beginning of this book the setting is in England and then it wanders off to Narina. The adventure starts when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move in with Professor. Lucy soon discovers Narina in a wardrobe during her attempt to hide while playing Hide-and-seek. Lucy tells her siblings about her discovery but no one believes her. Finally they go in the wardrobe and find out that Lucy is telling the truth. Then they meet extraordinary beavers who are husband and wife. These beavers built an amazing house in the kingdom of Narina. What's so different special about them? You'll have to read the book or see the movie to find out the truth. Something tragic happens to Aslan! Also something amazing happens to Lucy and her siblings. In this story the White Witch wants to keep the humans so she can be the Queen of Narina. Do you want to know who the White Witch is? Too bad you'll have to read the book.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a fast read. This is so because I got so interested in it that it took me two days to read. I loved it. Not everyone like fantsay but this tale is not like Harry Potter, not at all. Even my teacher likes it. Not everyone likes Harry Potter but maybe everyone will like The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Although this tale was rather long, it would only be an to the story to make it have a longer and add more details, because I want it to take me more than two days to read it.

The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life.

Lewis, the author, calls the book I have read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. This book is about 4 young children whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy who stumbles into a mysterious world called Narnia. This world is found in an old wardrobe in their house. How they discovered this pace was when Lucy and her other brothers and sisters were playing hide and go seek and Lucy decided to hide in this old wardrobe they had found. She stared to move back into it and she noticed that there was no back to it. She kept on moving farther and farther into the wardrobe and still she could not find the wall. She started to feel weird about this until she saw a light. She ran towards the light and it was actually a lamppost. She had also noticed that there was snow on the ground and that she was in the middle of a forest! She could not believe her own eyes. Then a creature that had a body of a man and a goat came up to her and it started to talk to her. It invited her to his home. His house was a cave but it had a fireplace and candles and stuff like that. The creature told Lucy all about Narnia. Then after the creature was done she had decided to return home. When she got back home threw the wardrobe she told her brothers and sisters. They did not believe her. She got upset because they all thought she was lying. Then Edmund went into the wardrobe to see if she was telling the truth. What did Edmund see? Was Narnia really there? Was Lucy making all this up? Here are just some questions that the book gives you and the only way to find out more about it is that you will just have to read it!I liked The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a lot. I think this book was exciting to read because of how everything was so unique of what any other stuff I have read. I also liked it because there were fights in it. I could not really feel like I was in the book because some of the descriptions were not very clear as some other books I have read. Also the characters were not really that well detailed. The main conflict did interest me, even if I could not feel like I was not in the book, because I liked the idea of how some one was trying to take back his kingdom and I also liked it because there was a couple of really cool battles in it. I thought the characters did not seem that realistic because the author did not describe the characters as well because he pretty much just gave basic information about each one of them. I thought the books' ending was satisfying but the author seemed to me like he was trying to rush the ending. The ending didn't really make sense but besides that I think the book was good though.I think the author had a voice in a more little childish sort of voice. Like he would not give away the cool parts like heads being chopped off. The author did use a very large vocabulary but he did include monsters that I have never heard of like something called a wraith. I thought the author had absolutely no uniqueness to his writing but I think he made a very unique plot. Some unique characteristics of his writing is that he would say stuff like \\" I can not tell you any more of how these creatures looked like because they would be to hideous for the readers.\\" I thought the dialogue in this book was okay compared to other books I have read. I think this book was more set to younger people, so that's why the dialogue is not very good to me because its it kind of immature to me. I think this author did a really good job with the plot but needs to work on more description, but over all I thought the book was very unique.I think this book is an all right book. I think this book is more for younger people around 12 and younger. This book is a very easy read. Also this book is good for boys and girls. Finally I would rate this book an 8 out of 10.The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is a a pretty good book. I admit that I have read better books but this is a good book if you are looking for a easy and a pretty fast read. I personally think this book is more set for younger kids maybe around the age of 10. I liked this book because of how unique it was. It was unique because of all the different types of monsters it had like trolls, wraiths, goblins, centaurs, and much more. I also liked this book because it was really easy to understand. Finally I liked this book because it did have a few good fighting scenes like the battle with Peter against a wolf captain. This book deserves an 8 out of 10 because of how its really unique but it is also set for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"It thought this book was a very good book.

They stay with Professor Kirke, a kind old man. On their first day in the country it rains, so the kids decide to explore the house. They discover a spare room that is completely empty with a large wardrobe. Peter, Susan, and Edmund leave the room, but Lucy stays behind to look inside the wardrobe. Lucy steps inside the enormous closet to find a snowy wood at the back of it. Eventually she meets a faun, a creature that is half goat and half man. The faun, Tamnus lives in a strange land, Narnia where the White Witch has cast a spell so that it is always winter. He asks Lucy if she is a Daughter of Eve, if she is a human girl. Lucy is confused. Tumnus invites her for tea and plays his flute. Lucy feels like she is in a dream. The faun tells her that she cannot go home, but she begs him. Tumnus walks Lucy back to the lamppost at the border between Narnia and the wardrobe door, and they say farewell.On the next rainy day, the children play a game of hide and seek. Lucy wants to check and see if the wardrobe really is empty. Edmund sees Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He follows her into the wardrobe, but once inside he finds himself in Narnia.

The four kids have wonderful adventures, and learn about themselves and their siblings.I think that C.S. Lewis did an excellent job with this book. He made this story his own, not elaborating off anybody else's. He used imagery, symbolism, and personification to make the book interesting. The plot and story line is like none other I've read.

It wasn't the first, and it certainly wasn't the last, but it was the best. It just pulls you in, and you can't get out. Once you start, you will probably end up reading half of it in one sitting. From the first page, you are totaly envelloped in Narnia. You forget completely about the outside world. Once you read it, it becomes the book by which all others will be judged for the rest of your days. And trust me, its very hard to beat. I would reccomend it to ANYONE, whether they like fantasy or not, it is truly a study in good writing (the understatement of the 21st century). The religious undertones and the author's subtlty of sugestion leave the upmost room for interpretation. Getting others to read it will undoubtedly lead to endless discussions about the significance of Aslan an a god-like leader, or of the so obvious, yet hidden play between good and evil. Be warned.

For a contrast, try Christopher Timothy's reading of James Herriott's &#34;All Creatures Great and Small.&#34; Timothy also does a dramatic reading with different voices, but the volume is reasonable and the voices are plausible.

Read the book to find out"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is undoubtedly one of the most influential works in the history of juvenile literature - timeless and delightful for all ages.There is, however, no small amount of confusion about the literary type of the book. Time and again, it is referred to as a \\"Christian allegory,\\" a tag with which C.S. Lewis would not have been happy. As he explains in some of his essays and letters, an allegory is a work in which immaterial realities are represented by imaginary physical objects. For example, the immaterial faculty of Reason may be allegorically represented by someone we call Lady Reason. This Lady - because Reason is clear, undefiled, swift, cold, hard, and sharp like a sword - we could picture as a \\"sun-bright virgin clad in complete steel,\\" riding on a horse \\"with a sword naked in her hand.\\" This, C.S. Lewis has actually done in his only allegorical work, \\"The Pigrim's Regress,\\" from which the example of Lady Reason is taken.Is \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" then, an allegory? After all, C.S. Lewis loved allegorical literature, and it is obvious that elements of his Christianity flowed into the Narnian storyline, such as the concepts of Incarnation and Redemption.Were C.S. Lewis alive, I think he would be very glad if I could transfer to the readers his view that the book is NOT an allegory. C.S. Lewis did not say to himself, \\"Let us represent Jesus as He really is in our world by a Lion in Narnia.\\" His original inspiration was much less theological than that - nothing more than a mental picture. Long before he became a Christian, he had a picture in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. Decades went past, until one day he said to himself, \\"Let's try to make a story about it.\\" At first he had very little idea how the story would go. \\"But then suddenly,\\" he later wrote, \\"Aslan came bounding into it,\\" and \\"once he was there he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"I believe I am right that some people will now think, \\"But aren't the Chronicles of Narnia Christian at all? Doesn't Aslan die and rise again like Jesus did? Isn't that a representation of the Christian faith? If that isn't an allegory, what on earth is it?\\"Well, C.S. Lewis called the Chronicles a \\"supposition.\\" He wrote the books by saying, \\"Let us suppose such and such were true and then imagine what would happen.\\" At first this supposition did not even contain a Christian element, but after Aslan had \\"bounded into\\" Narnia, Lewis said, \\"Let us suppose that reality contained different parallel worlds, and that in one of them the Son of God, as He became Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen.\\"Now this supposition has a definite Christian element in it; the Christian element is in fact essential to it. But that does not make it an allegory. As we have seen, an allegory is trying to describe a (mostly immaterial) fact in our world by means of a picture, such as Reason being pictured as a sun-bright virgin clad in steel. Aslan, however, does not represent the immaterial God in the same way in which Lady Reason represents Reason. He is the result of a supposition. Granted the supposition, he and all the characters and events in Narnia would have been a physical reality no less than Jesus' death in first-century Palestine. Narnia is thus an imaginary world existing in its own right, having grown out of a Christian supposition, but not being an allegory of Christianity. To put it differently, Aslan is Jesus in another world; he is not an allegory of Jesus in our world.I would encourage those who still cannot see the difference to read Lewis's \\"Pilgrim's Regress.\\" Putting it side-by-side with the Chronicles of Narnia should make the distinction plain.But no matter whether you agree with Lewis's view on the question of allegory, no book shelf is complete without \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\"--or the other Narnian books, for that matter. One can read them again, and again, and again.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"We heard this book on tape, and my kids absolutely loved it!

My first grade teacher Ms. Enderlin read the book aloud to my class. Each day she had a reading time after the noon recess. Ms. Enderlin opened the book, Lucy opened the wardrobe, and I opened my eyes to a whole new type of story. That was over twenty years ago.A young girl named Lucy attempts to hide in an old wardrobe and inadvertently discovers a portal to an entirely different world -- the land of Narnia. After her initial visit to this land of speaking beasts and a tyrannical witch, Lucy decides to return with her three siblings Edmund, Susan, and Peter. In Narnia, Edmund falls to the seductive beauty of evil. Lucy, Susan, and Peter strive to save their corrupted brother and defeat the White Witch who has enslaved the talking beasts.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" offers a fantastic opportunity to expose young readers to fantasy literature. Parents who are looking for something to read with their children will especially enjoy this book and the others in the series. Lewis writes with a distinctly conversational tone that lends itself to being read aloud. Though geared primarily for children (grade school age), the Narnia books will be equally appreciated by adult readers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"It has been several years since I last read this book.

A great buy!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is interesting yet very confusing.

Will they follow the mighty and wise Aslan or fall into temptation from the White Witch?The book is a fantasy/adventure, set in England around the 1950's. One thing the author did in this book that I liked was he used forshadowing toward the beginning which really maked the book more interesting along the way. He also used outstanding detail to describe the look and feel of Narnia: so realistic that even though you know it's a fantasy, it feels real, as if you're there with the kids. He also uses a very 'real' tone, like the author is having a conversation with you about the story. This book is the second book of a seven book series.I particularly didn't enjoy the book, simply because it isn't \\"my type of book\\", but if you are someone who loves fantasy, adventure, suspense and some action, you'll be hooked!

Yes, Aslan is Jesus. And this book has an agenda. Actually, all of Lewis's books have an agenda. It is a religious agenda, and the story does kind of get bogged down in it. So this book is actually perfect if you yourself are religious and are looking to share it with your kid, but I was not looking for religion and when I found it I was sort of disappointed. Why couldn't Aslan just be Aslan? Why did Lewis have to go and bring Jesus into the picture?That being said, this story is lovely minus all the religious stuff. It tells the story of four children who walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a fantastical new land, filled with fauns and witches and whispering trees. Aslan, by the way, is the lion who is the mysterious ruler of this place called Narnia. He has not been seen for many years, and subsequently, the evil witch has imposed winter on the Narnians for one hundred years. The story ran through my head nicely, and it was actually a good fantasy book. The metaphor behind it was just slightly disconcerting in its blatantness.If you're an adult and you loved the Chronicles of Narnia, read The Magician by Lev Grossman. It's an adult fantasy, and it is GREAT."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I've read this book two times and it hasn't gotten old at all.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"It is alsome.

LewisReviewed By: J. ZhuPeriod: 6The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is about four siblings. Their names from youngest to oldest are Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter. They live with their mother, but their hometown is under siege in a war. The sibling's mom is scared that they might be killed and so they are sent on a train to go to the Professor's house. When they get to the Professor's house, his maid Mrs. Macready shows the kids around the house and sets some ground rules. Lucy, the youngest child wanders off for a while and sees the wardrobe. After a while the kids become bored and they decide to play hide-and-seek. Lucy remembers about the wardrobe and then goes back to hide there. When Lucy gets inside the wardrobe she trips and falls into this white fluffy stuff. It's snow! Lucy wanders around for a while in this \\"wardrobe\\" and she meets a fawn named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Tumnus then invites Lucy over to his house and gives her some tea. After they talk for a while and get to know each other, Mr. Tumnus plays this instrument and it makes Lucy sleepy. Before Lucy is fully asleep, Mr. Tumnus stops playing and cries over what he has just done. Then Mr. Tumnus tells what he was about to do and Lucy finds out all about where she is (land of Narnia) and that the queen (Jadis or White Witch) is making it winter forever and never Christmas. There was a prophecy that states when two of Adam's sons and two of Eves' daughters come to Narnia the Queen will be out of power and Narnia will be a happy place once again. Then Mr. Tumnus thinks that the queen might already know that a daughter of Eve is in Narnia and he shows Lucy the way back to the Professor's house. When Lucy comes out however, she tells her siblings what had happened, but no time has gone by. At first no one believes her, but Edmund decides to go check the wardrobe anyways. When Edmund gets into the land of Narnia he meets the White Witch and she gives him magical Turkish delight that makes him want more and more. The queen promises that if he brings his other siblings then he will get as much Turkish delight he desires. After many times not believing Lucy the siblings decide to try to look in the wardrobe again. This time on the other hand, the land of Narnia is there! They all decide to go to Mr. Tumnus, the fawn's house. When they reach his house they find out that he was captured and thrown in jail for fraternizing with humans (Lucy). After they get out of the house the children see a little beaver and it tells them to follow him. The beaver ends up bringing them to a small dam. The beaver then tells the children the story about The White Witch and Narnia. Before the story of Narnia and The White Witch was over, Edmund had already gone to The White Witch's house and told her the story about Azlan coming back. When the other siblings find out that Edmund is gone, they realized that he must have betrayed them and they left the dam with the Beavers. The Beavers found out that Azlan is already in Narnia and he is waiting for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy at the Stone Table. When they reach the Stone Table they see Azlan, but they went without Edmund. Azlan then told the children that the prophecy could not be fulfilled unless they had Edmund too. So, the children and Azlan's army go to where they were holding Edmund and freed him. After Edmund realized what he has done he is back on the good side. Then the children and Azlan's army prepared for one of the fiercest battles ever. Then Azlan called his army and he started one of the greatest wars ever. In the end, Azlan won and The White Witch was killed. Then Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and Susan all became queens and kings of Narnia.I liked this book because of many things. One reason that made me like this book is that C.S. Lewis has a magical ability to give you a marvelous description of what is happening and where the characters are. There is one sentence that I really thought made me feel as if I was one of the characters and I was actually there and that is, \\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That really made me picture a thought of a beaver dam with a marvelous food fragrance coming out of a small chimney. I also enjoyed the book because C.S. Lewis just knows how to hook you into the book.My favorite part of the book was when the kids were in the Beavers' house. This was my favorite part of the story because C.S. Lewis gives a description about the food that the Beavers' had prepared for dinner. When C.S. Lewis wrote about fish I just wanted to get my hands on some fish. Usually I do not like fish, but C.S. Lewis' description made it sound very tasty and mouth-watering."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is the best book ever!This book is about 4 kids named Lucy, Edmund, Suzan,and Peter.

A must read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The lion the witch and the wardrobe is an out standing book written by an amazing author. The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) who take a tremendous journey into a mystical country called Narnia.After stumbling into a wardrobe in an old professor's house (where they were sent because of a war) they came upon the snowy country of Narnia. While in Narnia they come across a talking beaver, in fact every animal in Narnia can talk. The beaver invites the children to his house for dinner.During the dinner the beaver talks to them about the White Witch and how she makes it always winter but never Christmas. He also talks to them about how evil she is and how she thinks she's queen but really isn't. One of the other things that he talked about was that she turned everyone that disagreed with her to stone.One of the most interesting things that the beaver talked about was Aslan. Aslan is a powerful lion that is rightfully king and he had just returned from a very long journey. He also talked about the prophecy. The prophecy states that when four humans sit in the four thrones peace will be restored.It turned out that Edmund had been in Narnia before and had met the White Witch. It also turned out that the White Witch had him under a spell. Because he was under a spell he left the beaver's house when nobody was looking and set off for the witch's house.After many days the three other children met Aslan and told him that Edmund was missing. Aslan went to go get Edmund but the only way he could was to sacrifice his life. Aslan knew that the only way to restore peace to Narnia so he was killed. The next day was a huge war, good against evil.If you want o know what happens in the war, to Edmund, and to Aslan, you're going to half to read the book yourself.

Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best known of the Narnia novels and it is a true classic. Although I personally didn't enjoy The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe as much as I enjoyed the Magician's Nephew,it was still a high quality read. The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe starts with the now grown up Digory Kirke,who has become Professor Kirke,taking 4 siblings into his house in a time of war. One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begib with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \\"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew................. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a stronger story,so too The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe made the Magician's Nephew a stronger story. Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \\"our world\\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \\"gifts\\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is a good read for adults and children alike.

One day a simple game of hide and go seek found them in an adventure in a world called Narnia where through an evil queen (Satan like) made it always winter.

I'll never forget being caught up by the magical land in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe which was read to us FIRST! I know there's a lot of arguments concerning what order the books should be read in: chronological order or as they were published. Well, I have to say that C.S. Lewis published them in the order he meant for us to read the books so start with LWW. What a wonderful imagination this man had and how fortunate for us readers that he put his creativity to good use and put his thoughts down on paper. It's a wonderful and magical trip that any parent should share with their child, they will never forget it.

Even if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is, I think it probably doesn't take a genius to figure out the religious representation throughout this book (and the others). I don't follow a Judeo-Christian path, personally, and I have no problem reading this; it's not at all preachy, or so obviously Christian that it reads like a rewritten Bible story or something. So, regardless of your own religious affiliation (or if you aren't religious at all), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent choice if you want to sit down for a couple of hours for a fun, light story of magic and adventure...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion,The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a very exciting book in which four children step into the land of Narnia through a wardrobe by magic.

Just when almost all hope is lost, Aslan, the lion, returns to Narnia and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch's army in a war that will decide the fate of Narnia.My two favorite charactars are Aslan and the White Witch because they're the rulers of Narnia and bitter enemies. I like the book because of the highly detailed story and pictures. I love it,and you will probably like it too. If you like mystery books,it's not a mystery book.

To kill a mockingbird.So get this book. Its a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story, and a great film!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"C.S. Lewis has conjured a world that millions have adored with incredible creatures(far more than the Lord of the Rings has). The one thing that I'm fed up with is people comparing this to Christian beliefs. It's not that I'm unchristian but I think that this makes people believe that only christians can read the book. Anyone can read the books because though it can be viewed as a tale that instills christian faith its really just a fantasy story at heart. Even C.S. Lewis himself said that Narnia was not supposed to be a direct comparison with christianity. So please enjoy the book or go see the new movie and please don't get religion involved with it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I can't even begin to say how many times I've read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or the other books in the Narnia series. I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door. Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure. When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange. Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams. Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them. How many adventures they have taken readers on, and will continue to do so for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles. Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel. I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants. I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia.The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author. Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"... of Michael York.

You can find out what the book is like by looking at the other reviews; but I definitely recommend this recording!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The reason for the \\"sudden reordering\\" of the Narnia series dates back to a letter sent to C S Lewis by a child after the completion of the series. The young reader noticed that the books were published out of order as far as the Narnian time line goes with the creation of Narnia occuring in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (the sixth book published). In the letter, the child asked which order the books should be read in. Lewis replied that it was really up to the reader, but he prefered them chronologically within the Narnian world which places \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" first. SO it is up to the reader whether you want to read them in the new order (approved by the author) or their publication order. Either way you do it, \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" occurs at the same time \\"The Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe\\" occurs. I read them both ways, and LW&W is a better \\"first book\\" because it's more action oriented than MN. It was more interesting for me as a young reader to go back in time and read about the creation of one of my favorite fantasy worlds...every reader might not agree (obviously the publishers and the Lewis family don't). Enjoy them either way!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, of course, loved by millions as a classic, and it truly deserves its distinction. Rarely will any reader of any genre find a story so moving and entertaining and so enlightening. I can't recommend anything more highly than this little volume.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter who wander through an old wardrobe into the magical world of Narnia. What follows is their adventure as they team with a nation of talking animals and other magical creatures versus the evil powers in the kingdom. The novel climaxes with one extraordinary act of love which tears through the kingdom and changes everything and everyone after.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is such a successful novel. It does serve as a wonderfully powerful read. The book also enlightens the reader with its commentary Christian symbolism on the nature of love. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic, and I really think that it is just now coming into what may be its most popular period. The world is pleading for some type of meaning, and here, Lewis is willing to offer it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Unlike most of the rest of the world, I never read this series as a kid. With the movie coming out, I thought I would take a look as an adult. While the story is nice and there are some fantasy elements that would be appealing to kids, it seems odd to me to compare this book to epics like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, principally because there is just not much there. The story is short and simple, the battles barely rate a couple of sentences of description, there is a bit of repetition, and the characters are fairly simply drawn. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with the allegorical message or the story for what it is, but is is more akin to A Wrinkle in Time in terms of depth and detail than it is to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Thus, it is more likely to be appealing to younger kids than to those able to tackle more extensive and more complex reading material. YA readers who like Narnia might also like Jean Rabe's The Finest Creation."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"When four English siblings (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) are sent to the country to avoid the air raids in London, they find a secret passageway in a wardrobe that leads them to an imaginary land called Narnia. Here the four young children meet a few interesting characters: Tumnus the Faun, a half-goat/half-man that befriends Lucy when she's lost; the Beaver family who help the children elude the White Witch and her dangerous allies; and, lastly, the White Witch herself, who has laid claim over Narnia with her year-round winter spell and her self-proclaimed title: \\"Queen of Narnia\\". She is also the one who lures Edmund to her side with endless supplies of Turkish Delight and subtle hints of him becoming King.During their adventures, the four children ultimately meet Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia who has returned, at last, to reclaim his land from the evil queen. Together they--along with the help of several other mystical beings--aim to defeat the White Witch and return Narnia to its original state and ownership.After reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", you'll definitely want to read the following books in this series: \\"Prince Caspian\\" (#2), \\"The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'\\" (#3), \\"The Silver Chair\\" (#4), \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" (#5), \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (#6), and \\"The Last Battle\\" (#7). Although \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is geared for children age 8 to 12, I consider it appropriate for all ages and encourage everyone to read it.I received the entire Narnia collection from one of my aunts when I was a kid, either for my birthday or some other holiday--I don't remember. Anyway, this book/series has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. It's a wonderful fantasy meant for children, but will inspire adults as well. Highly recommended. It also makes a wonderful gift. ;)There are some Christian undertones in this book, such as the terms \\"Daughter of Eve\\" and \\"Son of Adam\\" for humans in Narnia, as well as Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund; however, I don't really regard The Chronicles of Narnia as a religious series. You can expect a wholesome story, but not to worry--it isn't preachy or overly self-righteous.Several years after it was published, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was made into a TV series in the late 60s, which I never saw because I wasn't born yet. Plus it only aired in the UK. About ten years later, in 1979 (the year I was born), a cartoon movie was made, but I didn't see that one either. The only movie I vaguely recall watching was the 1988 movie starring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, and Sophie Wilcox. I remember that even then I wasn't too impressed with it, not as much as I was with the book.So, for those who love children's fantasies, or are just C. S. Lewis fans, then I highly recommend this book and series. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"While this is not my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia, it still merits five stars and is an excellent book. Few authors can capture the imagination like C. S. Lewis was able to do, and I doubt that many will ever be able to again. This book is unbelievable, yet believable. Extraordinary and impossible things happen, yet Lewis describes things like the meal set before them at the Beaver's Dam so eloquently and vividly, it makes you seem as if you were there, and when you realize you are not, you are suddenly very hungry and wishing you had some fresh fish just caught from the icy river.In addition to being a fantastic story, it contains a point, something which many modern fictional stories fail to do. In this book, C. S. Lewis lays out the crucifixion and Ressurection of Christ, except in Narnia Christ is not a man, but a lion, and not named Jesus, but Aslan. The power and majesty of the Great Lion impresses one while reading, yet his kindness and love shine through no weaker. Lewis does an amazing job of presenting to us the Christ of another world, and I cannot imagine anyone doing a much better job of it.If you have seen the recent movie which models itself after this book, you have seen but a shadow of the real thing. The book is thousands of times better than either the PBS version or the new release. The new release managed to take the focus off of Aslan and put it instead on the children by talking about how the hope that the children have brought has ended the winter, whereas in the book, it was Aslan's power which did it (among numerous other changes to this effect). The movie both lowers Aslan and the importance of the death and ressurection of Aslan, and I think that it fails to capture the real essense of this work. The real thing is so much better, it is well worth the time required to read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I purchased this book to introduce two middle school girls to this classic child's literature.

I know people are always weary to pick up a book that has a religious theme to it but C.S. Lewis is enjoyable no matter what you choose to believe.During WWII, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevensie have to leave London and their mother as they seek refuge in the English countryside with Digory Kirke. The children amuse themselves by exploring and playing games; one day, Lucy steps into a wardrobe and into Narnia, a magical land where she meets Tumnus, a friendly faun, who invites her to him home and tells her about the evil White Witch.When she returns to the real world, Peter, Edmund, and Susan believe she's lying; Edmund, however, goes into the wardrobe and enters Narnia. He has the misfortune of meeting the White Witch who bribes him with Turkish Delight and encourages him to bring Peter and his sisters back with him.While trying to hide from a group of visitors, the four Pevensie children pile into the wardrobe and step back into Narnia; Lucy leads them to Tumnus' house but finds that he has been taken by the White Witch. From then on, the children meet friends, battle the power of evil temptation, and search for the true King of Narnia: Aslan.This story is unlike anything I've ever read before. I couldn't help but admire the brilliant way Lewis wove together so many stories yet made it uniquely his own. Making a trip into Narnia is something everyone should do and your first step is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Like JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, HARRY POTTER, THE WIZARD OF OZ and so many other children's stories that have entered the realm of literature classics, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE begins with the discovery of an obscure gateway into another land. Peter, Susan, and Edmund Pevensie, children living with their uncle in a sprawling country house in the English countryside believe their youngest sister's stories of her visit to an enchanted winterbound land ruled by an evil white witch to be the product of an overheated imagination. For no other reason than to humour her and to prove her story wrong, they skeptically follow her into a dark, musty wardrobe. To their great surprise, they find they have all walked through a magical portal into the country known as Narnia.On the surface, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is a simple children's allegory with characters drawn from a deep well of literary predecessors including English folk tales and Norse and Greek mythology - talking animals, Mr and Mrs Beaver, Father Christmas, dwarves and giants, fauns, unicorns and centaurs, dryads, sentient trees, a snarling, frightful wolf who is the henchman of the evil white queen, black magic, and a great lion called Aslan who mysteriously returns from an extended absence to help Narnia's beleaguered subjects release the magical grip of a never-ending bleak, icy winter and allow the return of the much longed for beauty and warmth of spring and summer.But, at a deeper level, CS Lewis is well known for his Christian references and this story is no exception. Virtually any adult reader will recognize Aslan's heroic self-sacrifice to save Edmund's life and his return from death atop the witch's Stone Table as a clear symbolic allusion to Christ's crucifixion for the redemption of earth's sinners and his resurrection from the dead. While some readers may disagree, I found the allusions considerably less than subtle. While they were entirely obvious, almost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing. As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This amazing book takes you on a journey to a fantasy world of animated excitement.

It is very well written, never short of any details, and I couldn't wait to see what happened each time. It kept my interest throughout the enitre book.It is quite easy to imagine Aslan, the four children, the beavers, the white witch, and all the characters. And each character has a distinct personality. You learn to adore Lucy and Susan, and you learn how brave Peter is, and you can't help but to dislike Edmund. And I kind of wish Edmund wouldn't have gone to the witch, but every detail of the book is important. There is a lesson to be learned about sacrifice, understanding, and love. Aslan is the forefront of those lessons in this book.In my opinion, the book was written perfectly. It got all kinds of feelings and emotions from me.

Four English school children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of hide and go seek. The four children are in this magical land to help the golden lion, Aslan, to defeat the White Witch. The White Witch has used her magic and cursed the land of Narnia with everlasting winter without Christmas. Throughout the book, the children meet many magical characters and animals. The children are forced to fight a war against the Witch and defeat her, which changes the land back to its original beauty and removes all curses she had on Narnia. The children became the Kings and Queens of Narnia for many years in Narnia time. However when they went on a hunt for a white stag, the children stumble upon the lamppost that they had found the first time they entered Narnia. The children wander in the forest near the lamppost and they fall out of the wardrobe that they had entered many years ago. On the other hand, the children were no longer adults as they were in Narnia, it was the same time, same day, and the children were in their same clothes that they were wearing when they wandered through the wardrobe and found Narnia.This is a high quality book in the fantasy genre. Most of the characters are fictional, yet the heroes of the story are children. There is more than one set of literary elements within this story. Each adventure in this book has its own problem, yet there is always one main problem. The language and style of this book is of English literature and some of the wording is different than the English used today. This book also has a different style. The children embark on an adventure to a magical land and find that they are the children of Adam and Eve. To them that is not important, however to the Narnians it means a great battle is to be had. There are a few illustrations through this book in black and white, however they do not tell a story within themselves. The story is told through the printed words. The illustrations are to give a glimpse of the Narnians or land in which the chapters are focusing on. The strength of this book is the high level of fantasy and adventure. The only concern for this book with lower readers is the names and the old English language used throughout the story. The reading level for this book is middle grades starting in fourth to eighth. In the classroom this book can be used as a beautiful example of fantasy. In the classroom, a way to see what the students are visualizing while reading is have the students complete a ten minute quick draw (Yopp & Yopp, 2006). The students can also predict the ending of the story, or even the ending to a chapter. The students can also journal about which character they would like to be use examples in the book to support why they choose that character. Also, the students could journal on the last quote from the professor, \\"But the professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia\\" in which the students could extend what they think this predicts for readers (Lewis, 1950, p.206). Lastly, the students could create a comparison chart and compare the fantasy in the story and reality (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007).

This story is a great adventure for children and adults. It is beautifully illustrated. It tells the story of 4 children who are sent to live with an eccentric relative during the bombings of London during World War 2. They are exploring their new environment when they happen into a new and strange land, Narnia, through the back of a wardrobe, and the adventure begins.What an exciting adventure it is! It describes sweeping landscapes so vivid that you can easily imagine yourself climbing the crest of a mountain to see the beautiful valley before you! There are amazing creatures unlike anything you've ever seen before.This book held the intrest of the children and was very fun to read to them. They identified with these characters, and by the end of the book felt as if they were great friends. C.S. Lewis is an amazing author, and this story is as relevant today as the day he wrote it.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a book that took place during World War II. This book is about 4 children, Peter, Susan, Edward, and the youngest Lucy. It all starts when the children's mother sent them to live with a quirky professer who lived in in the country. During the children's stay Lucy, the youngest, finds a large wardrobe in an almost empty room. During a game of Hide-n-go-seek, Lucy decides to enter the wardrobe to hide. In the wardrobe, Lucy finds a magical world which is called Narnia. When Lucy tries to tell her siblings about the magical world but they don't believe her. After a couple of tries to get them into the wardrobe she succeeds and they all have an amazing adventure in Narnia. Their adventures include mystical characters, a majestic lion, and an evil white witch who turns people into stone. There are battles and also time of peace. There are nerve racking moments and times that make you feel relaxed. This book is an overall outstanding well written book that I can reconmmend for any age! To learn more about this book read it! C.S. Lewis is a phenomenal writer and really digs deep into his writting and an analogy of his faith in Jesus as the Savior."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is a fantastic book. It takes you into a magical land that can only be created by one such as C.S. Lewis. There is never a dull moment which is good if you get bored with reading easily. However, there are a few downfalls. The book itself is relativley fast paced and sometimes the narrartion is a bit childish. All in all its a good read and a classic that nobody should ever miss out on."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is a real classic that we love sharing as a family over and over again! You can read it aloud or read at bedtime, it never gets old."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"What would you do if you entered a wardrobe and found yourself in a magical world? In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe four kids find themselves in that situation. The main characters Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter find themselves deep inside a wardrobe one day and soon discover a magical land inside and set off to explore.Soon they meet Aslan, a lion, who is willing to do whatever it takes to save Narnia from the powerful White Witch who rules all of Narnia. Aslan needs the four to battle for freedom, but when Edmund is tricked into thinking the White Witch is harmless, the remaining three have to find Edmund and convince him to join them on their side. The battle seems easy, but what they discover is that the whole land of Narnia needs them. They realize that it's up to them to save Narnia against the powerful rule of The White Witch.I thought this book was written well and all who like adventure books will love turning pages to find out what happens next to the evil. One adventure I liked in this book was where Edmund was riding in the White Witch's sleigh. I rate this book a four star book for its unique way of adventure for all."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I had first read the Narnia books as a young man, then together with my wife a few years ago, and now to my children.These books are special and wonderful and few children's books compare to Lewis' classic.I recently re-read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and was moved to tears (again!). This book is worth the read at any age. The story is compelling and dramatic. The characters are rich and possess real human dignity. The subtlety and suspense make the book an easy and fast read, yet impossible to forget.Unlike most children's literature, The Chronicles of Narnia--and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in particular--treat both the children and adults with respect and grace. The children are young and sometimes impatient, but brave and decent. The adults are respectful and thoughtful, not dismissive or clueless.Lewis' Christianity is clear from start to finish, but this book is not preaching; neither is the content forced. Lewis artfully weaves his plot and characters into the larger narrative of the Christian story. This is book is fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, and Gospel.I urge all readers (of any age) to enjoy these books! You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"chose this book called The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe for a school project and this book was a good book. My favorite part of this book was when Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Mrs. & Mr. Beaver entered the Stone Table and met Aslan, a lion that is the King of Narnia. I think the characters are believable because they all had a special part in the story's plot. Father Chrismas's part was to give Peter, Susan, and Lucy their tools. Lucy helped the wounded with her cordial that was made by the fire flowers on the top of the mountain, Peter and Edmund were knights that had a sword and a shield to protect them in battle, and Susan had the ability to use a bow and arrows for protection and a horn. The horn was used for thinking about something good to help her when she blows it and that thing she thinks about comes or appears. The ending was happy: the kids helped Narnia by defeating the Witch and her army that was trying to take over the magical place. I recommend you to read this book that is full of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"At the time of the publication of C.S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the world was still in the early stages of recovery from the largest, most devastating, and most costly known war to mankind at the time, 1950. WWII was truly a battle of good verses evil, and good prevails. What exactly C.S. Lewis's experiences were during the war are unknown to me however, I venture to say that he knew about the evils mankind was capable of and also knew of the good man was capable of. He lived in Europe at this time and had first hand experience in the dealings of daily life during war. It appears that in this book Lewis is clearly writing about his experiences, but to the extent that his allegories are based on direct or indirect experiences aren't completely clear to me. What is clear is he wrote of his beliefs, his own faith, and how they came to be questioned and ultimately restored through the writing of this story.These themes of good versus evil, loyalty, prudence and faith become evident as the story unfolds. Truth be told there are numerous themes that apply to this story. The theme of maturation could be applied; you see the children are dependant on adults in the beginning of the story for their well-being. Then they pass though the stage of trust versus mistrust, questioning the very existence of Narnia, and arrive at the stage of innovation versus guilt. During this stage they figure out how to solve problems and over come difficulties on their own. You see them take control over their destiny, as they become the rulers of Narnia. This can be applied to the people of Germany, who so susceptible and dependent on their government after World War I that they crave a solution, that is then brought to them in the form of a new charismatic leader who promises them not only a rebuilt life, but that they, the people of Germany, will be come the rulers of the world. This is similar to Edmond's plight in the story. Themes of unselfishness and selflessness are all throughout the story and example of this is the role of Mr. Tunnis who knows that he will be stoned if the witch finds out that he did not do as she wished, which was to notify her that a daughter of Eve had entered Narnia. He still decided to go against her wishes and sacrificed himself for the safety of the Lucy. This selflessness is also seen in the beginnings of the Third Reich by those who were willing to give up their new found sustained lives, their comfortable economic conditions that their leader had provided, to grow, expand, and protect the safety of their country. These citizens, these soldiers also conformed to the requirements of their government out of fear, much like Mr. Tunnis. They too wanted their lives to change realizing that their world was becoming increasingly irrational. They continued to support their government despite of this, out of fear, out of conformity, and out of a sense of obligation.While undoubtedly there is a strong undertone of the religious beliefs of the author, as a student and of history and sociology I found myself continually drawn to the similarities of Narnia and the German town of Dachau. The people who lived in this town did not support the Third Reich and were proud to not be active participants in the dealings of the government, having heard rumors of the deeds that went against their own beliefs of humanity and dignity. Like the children who heard Lucy's description of Narnia, they did not believe that this was happening in their back yard. They instead chose to believe the reassurances of the government they did not support. Their understanding, their belief system did not support the stories that they were being told, just as the other children could not comprehend the stories that Lucy was telling them. Instead they chose to believe the lie they were told by the very government they did not support, because it was more in line with their understanding of human nature. Lucy was said to have never had lied, and therefore is someone they should believe, leaving the reader to assume that Edmund's character is a little more questionable, yet they more readily accepted his response over hers.As the battle of good versus evil ravaged the world in the 1940s, it also ravaged Narnia. The fight over the existence of Utopia, and whether it could exist in the simultaneous presence of pure evil and pure good, played out as much in the minds of the citizens of Dachau and as it did in the world of the characters in the story, as the conflicting stories of reality blended together so that truth and fiction could not be defined.At the end of World War II the citizens of the town of Dachau were first told, then shown what had been going on in their own backyard, allowing them to see first hand what their acceptance allowed. They had readily accepted the assurances of people they knew and believed to be untrustworthy, and as a result not only allowed, but played an active role in supporting the evil that they had tried to not be part of. They had not actively stopped evil, and instead, through their own complacency, played a crucial role in sustaining it. This realization led many of them to collapse, and unable to return to the place they had been proud to call home. The journey they had been on during the time of the war gave them prosperity, but at the end, the realization of the horror in what they had done, made it clear that they had come full circle, back to the devastation and self-defeat they had prior to the rise of the Third Reich. They had chosen to follow the White Queen. It was as if time had not passed, that any success they had enjoyed during that time period was gone, yet they held the memories and awareness of the years in between. Only now those good memories were all tainted.Similarly, as the children in Narnia began to grow and reach levels of success and accomplishment, they soon returned to the beginning. They recognized the signs that they were getting back to where they started, as they chased the stag, saw the familiar lamppost, but instead of stopping and remembering, they continued forward, ignoring the signs they were given. Soon after they too found themselves back at the beginning, as if time had not moved forward. They were back at the school, back through the wardrobe, back as children. But they returned with the memories of the time they spent in Narnia, where pure good lived side by side with pure evil, and how these powers initially fought for them. Having accepted the protection of Aslan to watch over them, protecting them as they maneuvered the balance of good and evil, they now had a deeper sense of understanding of themselves, a deeper sense of faith and awareness of their purpose in life."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus. Her brothers and sister make fun of her. Edmund will be second and he meets the Witch, Queen Jadis, who has taken over the country. She charms him with Turkish Delight and makes him promise to come back with his brother and sisters.One day, when the children are trying to fly away and hide from a group of visiting tourists in the mansion, they hide in the wardrobe and find themselves in Narnia. They all discover that Mr. Tumnus has been captured and his house ransacked due to the blabbering Edmund had done with the witch.They are all taken into their homes by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and it is then that Edmund escapes and goes back to Queen Jadis. He will have there the strongest and most interesting surprise in his life.That leads to the confrontation of Aslan and his human and Narnian supporters on one hand, and Queen Jadis and her own supporters on the other hand. The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief. Then the battle is a victory because Edmund gets his vengeance and destroys the Queen's magic wand. She is then powerless.The four kids are crowned kings and queens of Narnia till one day a White Stagn, like the Celtic messenger from the other world or the Arthurian quest-announcing messenger, leads them back to the lamp post and they come back to this side of the wardrobe door. But though once a king of Narnia always a king of Narnia, they can't go back the same way. That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend. The origin of Queen Jadis is Adam and his \\"other\\" wife Lilith, a Jinn, and then later taking some giant blood in her stock.We have to think of the Beast when dealing with Jadis, but she is a female witch whereas the Beast of the Apocalypse is a male monster devouring pregnant women, and its number is 666. We also have to think of the French meaning of Jadis which is \\"once upon a time\\", the past in fairy tales. The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them. The sacrificial altar is found in many cultures, among others the Celtic culture, or the Roman or Greek cultures, and even the Jewish tradition, to remain within the Eurasian geographical zone.The resurrected savior is well known in many mythologies and religions, the Christian for one example. The traitor is more Christian and yet there are traitors in Sumerian and Mesopotamian traditions. C.S. Lewis regenerates the motif by making the traitor the hero who will save the day by destroying the magic of the witch.We must also think that the four kids around the Lion are reminiscent of the four animals or living creatures around the altar, a lion, a bull, a human-faced animal and an eagle, hence of the four Evangelists in Saint John's Apocalypse. That number four is crucial in the writing and style as opposed to three that seems to represent disorder. Four is like order re-established beyond disorder when the traitor or stray sheep comes back to the fold.The charm of the book is of course the transmuting of that more or less religious magic into a secular marvelous sorcery that can also be magical, white or black, in a way.Finally the Queen/Witch with her secret police is of course a political discourse to children and it exposes tyrannical means and situations as unacceptable because inhumane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is the first and best of the Narnia books.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"We all know this story, and how exciting and stirring it is. But hearing this dramatic and well-produced reading adds a wholly new dimension to the overall experience. The inspired choice of Michael York allows the story to unfold before your very eyes, as he paces his voice comfortably enough to make you follow along and be excited at the same time. The reading may take a long time, but York never sinks into a monotonous tone, and he also gives each character personality and depth. Particularly tellig is his satanic characterisation of the White Witch. He also avoids the tendency to make the children sound too cue or whiney. To sum everything up, this reading will be sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of anyone who listens to it, and will surely be prized highly in any Narnia lover's collection and also by those who have never heard of the Narnia stories."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a story by C.S. Lewis, and it is the second book in a series of seven books. I feel this book is good to read for any age level from third grade to adult.Narnia is a fantasy about four children of various ages who must leave their home because of air raids. The four children have to go live in a large house with a professor in the country to keep them safe from the war. While the four children are exploring the large house they find a wardrobe in an empty room. When the children look inside the wardrobe they discover a passageway into a magical land called Narnia. In Narnia the four children are swept into one adventure after another while they try to destroy the evil White Witch so that spring will return to Narnia.Narnia is a wonderful, imaginative story that I highly recommend to children and adults of all ages. I loved all the adventure in this book and the magical creatures that they meet. I thought the children were vivid, believable characters, and I think you will find yourself cheering them on throughout their adventures. I feel that anyone who takes the time to read this book will find the ending extremely satisfying and will probably want to jump right into the third book of the Narnia series.In conclusion I give this book four stars. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was because it was slowly paced near the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the beginning of theland of Narnia for readers here in our world. The name itself evokessymbols that mean almost as much in our culture as Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.Reading this book is a lovely gift to make to your children, or to yourself. Lewis draws powerfully on our childhood desire to find ourselves in a fantasy land. The story of Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund being transported into Narnia makes all of think of our own childhoods in a powerful way.And from that power, Lewis can draw on the naivite and newness of children to approach faith and love and the values that accompany them. We see the very basic sin of Edmund as he betrays his siblings for just one more piece of Turkish Delight. And, so movingly, we witness his forgiveness and the love of the Lion for this one boy.Lewis disagreed with the term &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia tales. He felt that an allegory provides tangibility to intangible values and he felt his Narnia stories deal with things that are real in our world already. He wanted to show how people might come to God if they didn't have all the baggage and preconception that &quot;our world&quot; loads on top of religious feeling.No matter how much you're reading into this book, it's a piece of magic and not to be missed. Reading it to a child will give it an even stronger place in the life of that person. Not many things mean as much to me as thoughts of the Lantern, Mr. Tumnus, the Stone Table and Lucy. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was read to me as a child and it will always be a dear, dear book to me."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Having a story that is as well rounded and deeply plotted as this, especially when we're talking about a children's story, is a feat indeed. In this respect, and in many others, C.S. Lewis as done a remarkably excellent job. The Christian morals and principles that it teaches are an excellent addition to the story, and reflect greatly off of the man who wove this story into being. Aside from being very good literature, children should also read it for the lessons that it teaches. Perseverance in the face of fear, trust in God, and love for those around you.Sadly, as so many have pointed out, few children get to experience the emotional vividness, and compelling plot line of this fairytale now a days. In addition to &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, there are six other books in the &quot;Tales of Narnia&quot; series. My advice to parents is to read all of these to your children, or, if your kids are old enough, have them read them on their own. Everybody should read the series at least one time, and if you haven't, your missing a great piece of American literature.It's still amazing to me that all of these thoughts and concepts came from one man's head, and that through the God given gift of words, C.S. Lewis changed the lives of millions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"*The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* begins the enchanting series of Narnia books as, in a game of hide and seek, intrepid Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and into Narnia -- a delightful world of dryads and fauns and dwarves and animals that talk. Lucy finds, however, that as things stand, Narnia is a land of perpetual winter ruled over by an evil witch. Worse, even though it's always winter, it's never Christmas (note allegorical material beginning to rise to the surface). Lucy must return to her house, convince her brothers (especially the aptly named Peter) and sister that Narnia actually exists, and, with the help of Aslan, the great lion, defeat the witch and bring spring back to the land. She has her work cut out for her.As readers, so do many of us. For in this most delicate and charming and gemlike of books, C.S. Lewis has planted as heavy-handed an allegory as anything Edmund Spenser wrote in *The Faerie Queene*. Lucy, as her name denotes, brings &quot;light&quot; to Narnia and England. Aslan is Christ. Narnia is the postlapsarian world. Aslan (Christ) must, according to the rules of the Emperor-over-the-sea (God), die so that Lucy's brother, Edmund, (the sinner) can be saved (Saved). After his death, Aslan comes back to life (is resurrected) and defeats the witch (temptation/the devil). Through the spilling of his blood (Blood) all of Narnia is renewed (finds grace). If your religious beliefs compell you to point this not-so-deep meaning out to your own children, then do so, but please don't spread the word. When teaching this book in a college-level course on Children's Literature, I have too many times seen the years of joy this book has given my students quenched by my Outing Of The Allegory. This quenching is nondenominational.What I write now would not bring joy to C.S. Lewis, but the true miracle of the Narnia series, to this reviewer, lies in its astonishing ability to survive its own allegory. On the literal level, these books are marvelous: they are invigorating, heady, filled with heroism and magic, great deeds and quests. They should not be missed by children of any faith. My two sons love the series, and, frankly, as far as the hidden meaning is concerned, I dread the day that they are finally old enough to ask about it, and I am weak enough to tell."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids. While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia.

At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country. With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today. The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers. Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit. This is the first I read and still my favorite. There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults. The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.A brief word about book order. When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series. Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second. While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much. Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite. It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Have you ever wanted to go somewhere else? Somewhere in which only you can help save everyone in the name of righteousness? This is what happens to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.The four siblings are sent away from their home because of a raging war. Living in a professor's house, they are given many strictly enforced rules by an employee of the professor. While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest of the siblings hides in a wardrobe. To her surprise and amazement, she has found a country all her own, Narnia.When Peter, Susan and Edmund journey into Narnia along with Lucy, they discover that she is telling the truth and that they are the key to a prophecy. But, Edmund goes missing and they have to fight a battle to not only get Edmund back, but to save Narnia.Whenever C.S. Lewis is describing settings, I can easily picture the icy castles, the beaver's dam and the frozen lake. One particular quote that sticks out in my mind as a good example is:\\"There, a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs, that meant that they whole country below them lay in the evening light--- forests and hills and valleys, and winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river.\\"The 189-page book is a fantastic read for fantasy-lovers. It is always giving thrilling details and extraordinary settings. If you like Eragon and Harry Potter, you will be amazed at this book and other in the series. Say good-bye to dull moments. There's none in this book! So, open your wardrobe. You never know...!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Great fantasy book.

Lewis creates a magical winter wonderland that involves adventure and suspense. It is a story about four children that are sent to live with a professor who resides in a huge mansion. They discover a world that is always winter and never Christmas. The residents are tormented by a witch that can turn people into stone. Soon a lion named Aslan arrives and brings spring with him and the power to bring stoned people back to life. Ultimately, Aslan kills the witch and the four children become kings and queens of Narnia. It is a quick, effortless read that is entertaining. Once you start you will not want to put the book down. It is an easy recommendation for anyone. I highly recommend giving the book a chance and picking up a copy of it, especially for kids."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The popular children's book The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking. It's a quick read with deep meaning."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"For my book I read the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.

I like it because all the Characters were different, they were not really similar to each other they are there own human being well except for the creatures in Narnia they are there own creatrures.

They find a magic wardrobe that has a world called Narnia inside it. The four kids wonder into the wardrobe and find many strange creatures that help them during their various adventures.In the book there are two sides: Good and Evil. Edmund (the second youngest) turns to the bad side with the White Witch. The other three (Peter, Susan, and Lucy) are on the good side with the great Lion, Aslan. There is an ongoing battle between the two sides throughout the book.I loved the book and would give it four and a half stars out of five stars. This is the second book in the Chronicles of Narnia series. Which book you read first, doesn't matter. I would recommend it to any fantasy readers, boys or girls. I think this is a really great book and you should try to read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Here are two meanings I got out of the first book. The first meaning i saw was an awesome and well detailed magical story. I saw this to be fun to read. A great story, and that I had something to look forward to, because it is a series. Then I found a out the movie was coming out. My brother mentioned something to me about the meaning behind the book. This is to share Jesus Christ, and show what he did in many different ways. Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus Christ as some might know. Then other people are supposed to represent different things. It shows Aslan dying for the sins the prince made, then raising from the dead. Sound familiar to someone? There were also tons more metaphors relating to christianity. Like the evil witch representing the devil in some parts. First of all, the which is always taunting the lion(Jesus Christ). Also the queen tempting the prince into things like turkish delite, over the love for eachother. Those are just some of the ways i believe the book relates. There are many other things you can get out of the book. If you didn't know some of this, then don't hold back from reading your child the book, because of some of the relations. It is another great title from C.S. Lewis. I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I have read this story several times in my life however i never wrote a review. I recently read the book again because the movie was coming out and i wanted to see how well the movie tied into the book.This is simply a wonderful book and a very quick and easy read. Please do not be discouraged from reading this book because of the possible Christian references. Whether you are a believer or not you can fully enjoy this fictional tale.The book is full of fantasy creatures, heros and enemies that will leave you smiling at the pure genius of how it all comes together. I have always enjoyed this book and will probably read this book a few more times over the course of my lifetime.Take some time and read this book before seeing the movie, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"My father read this story to me as a child. I was only lucky enough to get a chapter each night. I remember wanting more. Wanting the story to be read faster. Reading it now, years later, I'm impressed with how it still captivates me. This story is about four children who move into a large house away from their family. While playing hide-and-seek one rainy day they find a wardrobe that takes them to a magical land, Narnia. In Narnia they learn of an evil White Witch that has caused it to be winter all the time. The children, work with the lion king to try and restore some order to Narnia.

I am not a fan of fantasy but this book was a cute book...CS Lewis has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Any child or adult would sit up straight to hear the story of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from start to finish. Mr. Lewis had the talent of capturing readers' attention especially children's then grasping their interest throughout a whole story. This tale is drolly told right through the entire book. It is a gripping adventure taken by four siblings who are actually eagerly anticipated by beings in another world. There are entities of rivalry, greed, betray, merriment, kindness, magic, and triumph for each person's enjoyment. Although the end is too fantastic that amnesia or giddiness might have been the cause for the four children's forgetfulness of their origin, the immensely entertaining technique of narration overcomes the poor conclusion."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, features four children displaced from their home in London due to violence of WWII to a remote country cottage. Upon arriving to their caretaker's cottage they explored the odd rooms and furniture. To eliminate their boredom, they decided to play hide-and-go-seed. This is when the youngest, Lucy, hides in the wardrobe and stumbles across the land called Narnia. The snowy land of Narnia is filled with all types of little creatures like fauns, dwarfs, and beavers, but the land of Narnia also has one White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia.The four children don't realize that they are the ones who can stop the White Witch and save Narnia from the Winter Wonderland that the witch has cast upon it. With the help of a lion named Aslan they over throw the witch and Narnia has all different seasons all over again. All of the animals live in peace and harmony after the reign of the White Witch is over.This story is written for one who enjoys adventure and likes to have fun. On a scale from 1-5 I would rate it a 4 because it's one of those books that you can't put down once you start to read it. It's a children's book even though some adults enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"If you are familiar with Lewis' non-fiction writings (Mere Christianity, etc.) were all that Lewis had written he would have left a wonderful legacy. However, Lewis has a large library of fictional works as well.'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is my only my second piece of Lewis fiction (the other being 'The Screwtape Letters') and I found it to be a quick, enjoyable read. The characters are likeable but sketchy, but that is understandable considering that he intended it to be a fairy tale. How much character development is there in a fairy tale?Christian themes are very strong throughout the book, but the story can be read without any previous study into Christianity. If you are unsure of the themes or want to make sure that you are not missing any, I would recommend that you pick up any of the half-dozen or more companion study guides that Amazon offers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I read this book for Literature in primary school. When I first look at the book, I said,&quot;Oh no, another boring book&quot;. But fortunately, I was wrong. This book isn't boring at all. Although the story may be weird because Narnia stands in a cupboard in which Lucy enters it first while playing hide-and-seek. But this book does not go on with everyone believing that Narnia exists but Lucy's elder siblings espcially find it most peculiar but the Professor ,believed, to be more logical believes that Narnia may exists due to certain factors that is the time journey and Lucy's truthfulness.

Now that I think about it, it was decades ago, and those were the days of punch cards. I hated computers because of that; what a lousy interface that was; but I didn't hate the punch card operators ... I presumed they were all attractive young women working their way through college and I wanted to meet all of them. Bemoan the hormones. One of the things I hated most then was that there was no debug code. Every time I made a mistake, all I got back from the computer was a whole-page goofy-faced image of Alfred E. Newman with the phrase printed below saying \\"What Me Wonder\\". I'm supposed to fix my code and that's the only clue I get? But I digress.Why do I mention all of this? Because some stupid Alfred E. Newman computer programmer type at Amazon.com decided I should review an audio book CD that I obviously didn't buy for myself (because they took my credit card number and I'm pretty sure that young kids who are interested in these stories don't have credit cards) -- I bought it for a grandchild for Pete's sake. I think it's up to her to do the review, but I'm pretty sure she didn't listen to it yet and for all I know she may never listen to it. Besides, if she does, and by the time she does, Amazon.com's hour glass will have run out and I wont be allowed to review the CD. So ... I think the CD is probably great, and I sort of presented it as a birthday gift while winking at the mother because she should make sure that her husband (my son) should spend some of his personal time with her every night listening to part of it (dispensed gradually over a period of days). He doesn't spend reading time with her now because all she has is printed matter to read and that's a little fatiguing for my son. To give him a break, that's not because it's difficult for him to read; rather, it's because he reads at a level far exceeding the level most people are accustomed to, and especially what children are accustomed to. So this CD is a win-win for everybody: my son isn't fatigued; my granddaughter gets exposed to great literature; and the two of them spend some quality time with each other.Now if you want more than 4 stars, you're going go have to ask my granddaughter. I gave it four because I imagined it's great. Only her imagination will know for sure, and I wont know until I speak with her at Christmas time. If it gets my son to spend more time with his daughter then the CD is great no matter whatever other measure is applied.

But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory.\\"This statement is absolutely correct. While I was reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it sounded like I was reading the bible. Aslan, symbolizes God, and the White Witch symbolizes Satin. When Aslan gets stabbed at the Stone Table, it is symbolizing Jesus dying on the cross, and when the lion comes back to life, it is symbolizing the Resurrection.C.S Lewis' use of symbolism does not make The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a better story. Some people may think that symbolism makes it good, I think it makes it worse. If a person wanted to read about that, they could just read the bible. C.S Lewis should have incorporated more of his own ideas into the storyline.There are a lot of good things going for this book.

The book goes through many emotions such as; sad, happiness, and excitement. For example; in the beginnig it starts in the house playing tag changing setting to the snow. I didn't even like the witch because she is very mean and is full of tricks, I think you should read this book because it will teach you lesson about love and caring."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book is a great Christian fairytale that can be shared by all ages. Aslan, the Great Lion, was created in the image of Jesus Christ as the savior. They both completed redemption and overcame the devil in the resurrection. How Susan and Lucy felt about Aslan's death is similar to how we face the death of Christ. I love the special ending because it indicated that may be we'll forget Narnia one day, but whenever we open the cover of &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; Narina is with us. The reading wlill be finished yet the joy and warmth it brings us could never leave us."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the first and most celebrated book of C.S. Lewis popular children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". It is not the first of the series chronologically, but the second, and although there is much debate over whether one should read the books in the order that they were written or the order in which they take place, I cast my vote for order of writing or publication, with \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" first. The books refer to one another, which makes reading them in order of publication seem more natural -and more desirable, as it also prevents too much from being revealed too soon. The mysteries of the back-story help sustain readers' interests, which might otherwise wane, for the duration of 7 books.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is a fairy tale about brave and honorable children in a magical land. Four siblings -Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy- are sent to the country home of a kindly old Professor to escape the London air raids during World War II. One day Lucy, the youngest, steps into a big old wardrobe, lured by the cuddly fur coats hanging inside. Stepping farther and farther into the wardrobe, past where the back of it should be, Lucy finds herself in a snow-covered forest in a strange land called Narnia, where human children are a rarity. She returns to the house full of excitement, but her brothers and sister don't believer her incredible story. But when all 4 youngsters pile into the wardrobe, trying to evade the housekeeper Mrs. Macready, they are transported to Narnia and find themselves key figures in a fight to free Narnia from the oppressive reign of the White Witch.When I read \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as a child, I found it too simplistic. Reading the book again as an adult, I realize that the problem was that I was too old. I discovered \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" when I was about 10 years old and already captivated by the more sophisticated Tolkien fantasy books. \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are written in a rudimentary style with two-dimensional characters. \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" seems hastily constructed with awkward dialogue and long passages dedicated to insignificant scenes while major events are made incidental. (Lewis' writing style improved in subsequent books.) These books are fairy tales intended for young children. The difficulty is that they are probably too young to read them. But if your kids like to be read to, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are an good choice. I've never met a child who didn't like to hear stories of children who are important, independent, and take control of their own lives. Biblical allegory and morality plays notwithstanding, I think that is why Narnia appeals to children."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This had more charm than I remember from 4th grade, but I still take issue with a few plot points. \\"Ha ha, I win because of deep magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" \\"Oh, yeah, well, ha ha, I win because of even deeper magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" It's almost like Aslan and the White Witch are playing Calvinball. I realize Lewis needed these kinds of plot devices to make the allegory work, but would it have killed Lewis to throw in a little foreshadowing? He foreshadowed other things. It was within his power.The saddest thing about this for me is that there's a nice little adventure story buried under the deus ex machina plot mechanisms. At least there could have been. Perhaps a different author would have sent the characters to find their accoutrement (Peter's sword, Lucy's cordial, Susan's bow--which she never used, I'd like to point out). But Lewis decided to play the Santa Clause card, because... well... I have no idea. I had to keep reminding myself that this was only a children's book, and perhaps it would have been more dramatic if it had been written with an older audience in mind. The moments of narrative tension evaporate quickly. Most of the crucial battle takes place off-screen. The only characters with any development at all are Lucy and Edmund. Peter's supposed to be the hero, but he barely has any screen time. And I realize it was written in the 50's, but is it necessary to constantly break the 4th wall?Oh, and can I take a moment to complain about the professor? I can only assume that he's a Mary Sue for Lewis, and yet he's this jolly, one-dimensional deified beacon of anti-intellectualism. GRR!!!Okay, I've griped. LWW is at least fun and imaginative. And while the main machinations of the plot are transparent allegories for Christianity, they're at least not oppressive. The story is allowed to breathe a little underneath them and develop its own personality. I rather liked that the book has a sense of awe and wonder about itself, and while I can criticize it for being far too brief for its scope, I can just as easily criticize J.R.R. Tolkien for the pointless ramble that is the first six chapters or so of The Fellowship of the Ring. It was a different time and new genre, nobody knew what they were doing. LWW is mercifully short, colorful, engaging, and very accessible, for all its foibles. I guess that makes Lewis the anti-Tolkien, now that I think about it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book has been sparking the imaginations of children for decades.

The story follows Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they plunge into the world of Narnia. Digory from The Magician's Nephew makes an appearance, but he is now known as Professor Kirke. Of course, the White Witch also reappears as does Aslan. If you have read The Magician's Nephew you know how the wardrobe came to be.The Pevensie's are great characters. I actually liked them more than the characters in the previous book. Edmund did annoy me at times, but I think he was supposed to be like that since he did betray his siblings. Great story from beginning to end.I thought The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a fun book to read. There is a lot of symbolism in this book that relates to Christianity.

Don't miss this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This wonderful little book was, at one time, the first in the Chronicles of Narnia series, written by the late C.S. Lewis, a Christian philosopher and literatus. It was the first one I read, and is a delightful story. Both children and adults who enjoy the fantasy genre should enjoy this book. It is centered around four children who, while staying as guests at an old mansion, walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a completely different world. There, they have many adventures and get involved in a great conflict between an evil witch, who is oppressing the land with an eternal winter, and the good king Aslan, who comes back to his country after a long absence to fight the witch's evil works. Anyone with a church or Sunday-school background should quickly recognize the Christian elements in this story, and I think it is safe for young children to read. It is a charming tale and worth reading again and again.

I loved it when a first read it at 6 years old and still do now. I agree with those people who say the series should be read with &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; as book 6 - luckily for me, even though they'd rearranged the books by the time I read them (how idiotic) I ended up reading them in the right order cos I couldn't find a copy of &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; until after I read &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;! I think there is a lot more feeling of things being explained at the right times if the books are read in the order C S Lewis intended them to be read in, but whatever order they're in, they all still give an incredible feeling of magic waiting just round the corner. Even though I'm old enough now to see the the religious allegory in the book, I'd really rather not.It's a clever way of explaining Christianity to children, but for me seeing it as a religious allegory takes a little of the wonder away from it.

And I had seen the children's picture books featuring the noble lion, Aslan and the fearless children as well as remembering the animated show I saw on the TV years ago - so right now I am falling into love all over again! Now I just can't wait to re-read the remarkable tale of bestiary as soon as I can get my hands on a copy!

Even though these stories are a kiddie version of the &quot;Bible&quot;, where Jesus of Nazareth is replaced by a lion, they are fun to read and bring out the goodness in everyone. These books also show, not just children but anyone who reads them, that people can be swayed by evil, but that everyone can be true at heart. These action adventures have had a lasting impression on me. Yes, I understood that C.S. Lewis was just covering up Christianity with a lion's mane, but I have not let that affect my relegious views in any way. I did take the lessons of kindness and forgiveness to heart however.

It makes my day bright and gay to read about such happy adventures that the four children have together. At least it's much better than reading about the misfortune in Jonsboro, Arkansas or about some gangs shooting at one another, etc. The Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful collection to pass down from generation to generation.

Peter is a brave and courageous boy. Susan is also brave. Lucy is the main character.

I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than 1 week and that was the fastest i read a book because it was so interesting and captivating. This is now 1 of my favorite books. I recommend that others read this book and like it as i did to. I enjoyed reading this because it was so captivating. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is very courageous, and caring to others. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named something very special. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She was my least favrite because she is evil. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were given a special position in Narnia My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I liked it because it had vivid details and it was imaginative. It was also full of great characters kids can relate to. Since the characters were kids our age and the setting was an imaginary place it made it more fun to read.

I did not like it when the other children didn't believe Lucy, but then Edmund found it and the White Witch and he thought she was the Queen of Naria. It was weird though when she made a hot drink and turkish delight out of snow and something in a bottle. I love though the way the beavers let the four children come in to their house that was so kind of them. It was cool how they let the children even eat dinner with them. It was sad though about how Mr. Tumnus the guy faun that Lucy met got taken away by the police. The when the spell started to break I cheered up.

The children find a wardrobe of which they can enter into a whole other world. This world is Narnia. In Narnia, the evil witch made it winter all year \`round with no Christmas. The children soon find out that they are the only humans and the animals can talk. Also they find out that they can stay in Narnia as long as they want and they wont lose any time on earth. The children and Aslan, the lion save Narnia become kings and queens and rule Narnia for many years with out ever losing a second of earth time.My favorite part of the book is the great big war between good and evil when the children find out that Aslan (even though he sacrificed himself to save them) came back to life and they fight side by side animal and human fighting for a common ground. The witch has great big ugly beasts on her side but Aslans army is far more cunning then these barbarians. Together, they defeat evil and rule the land of Narnia.I have read many fantasy books in my life and this one is not my favorite to say the least. If you want a quick read this is the book for you but if you want a book that will keep you reading for months I suggest the Shannara series by Terry Brooks.

C.S. Lewis wrote this--second chronologically in the series but the first written--for kids, but embedded within the tale is an allegory rich enough for the hardened academic, or theologian.The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and (especially) Lucy begins as the youngest of these children finds a gateway to Narnia, a magical world imperiled and imprisoned by a terrible witch. Only by fulfilling a prophecy and through the sacrifice of the great lion Aslan can the world be saved. Along the way, the reader will meet magical creatures, fight epic battles, endure unbearable betrayal, and witness the rebirth of a world. Returning through the other side of the wardrobe is like waking up from a dream (or, in the words of Tolkien's Frodo, \\"like falling asleep again\\").Along the way, Lewis also throws in a cameo appearance by Father Christmas--a real mistake, as this seems to allow trappings, or mythology, from the real world to shatter the whole invention of his own. It's a quibble, but it's also the reason why I can't give the book five stars.(This review posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"If you've never read a 'Chronicles of Narnia' book, you'll be surprised at what a quick read this is! Despite all the talk about 'Christian allegory' and other 'symbolism' that adults have tried to inject into Lewis' writing, the Narnia series, particularly this volume, is intended for kids above all else. The influences on 'Harry Potter' and other modern fantasy series are apparent. While Lewis' writing may lack a certain amount of polish in his descriptions, he manages to convey a lot of information in a relatively brief space, while leaving a lot to the reader's imagination. The four children are instantly likable(well, most of them are), and the various fantasy characters actually add something to the story than just comic relief.I'd never read this book til now, and wish I'd picked it up years earlier!Having read a bit about the other books in the series, I'm not sure if I'll continue. I found that 'Lion...' reached a logical ending point, and Lewis took the characters about as far as they could go.

As they are left alone most of the time, the children are free to wander and explore the huge house. One day while exploring, Lucy steps into a wardrobe, and walks into another world, the world of Narnia. There she finds that she is not in the wardrobe anymore but is instead in a forest of trees, covered in snow. She meets a faun and spends the afternoon having tea with him. The faun confides that a wicked queen rules the land, making it always wintertime and never Christmas, and that he has sworn to bring any humans he finds directly to her. There is a prophesy that someday four humans will come to sit in the thrones of the castle and that the queen will be defeated. Lucy convinces the faun to let her go, though.When Lucy returns to her sister and brothers, none of them believes that she has really been anywhere, and she is very upset. Soon afterward, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and is shocked to discover that his sister was telling the truth. Unable to find her in Narnia, though, he meets the wicked queen who charms him and makes him promise to bring her his brother and sisters.Soon afterward, all four children find themselves caught in Narnia. Peter and Susan and Lucy are eager to meet Aslan, the great lion who is said to be coming near to end the eternal winter. But Edmund sneaks off to announce the presence of his siblings to the queen. Peter, Susan and Lucy are now in trouble. Will they be able to avoid being taken by the queen? Will they help their brother come over to the side of good?I liked the descriptions of Narnia and the way things worked there. It's a great mythology. I also liked Aslan's character and the ways he handled problems that came up. I thought that Edmund's turnaround seemed too easy, though. He semed to slip from one side to the other with no effort. I also didn't like that the story of the children growing up happened too quickly, without incident.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience.

I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than three hours because it was so interesting and captivating. this is now my favorite book. After I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I bought the other books in the series. I recommend that others do too. I enjoyed reading this book and then the Magician's Nephew. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is a lion that comes to save Narnia from the White Witch. Aslan is very courageous. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She made Narnia always winter but never Christmas. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were crowned Kings and Queens. Peter was crowned King Peter the Magnificent. Susan was crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was crowned King Edmund the Just, and Lucy was crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first of the seven Chronicles of Narnia by unequaled English author C.S. Lewis. These books are able to accomplish something that few other books in all of literature have been able to achieve. They are able to be at once great and entertaining literature as well as insightful and profound theology. They are fun and inspiring. Tolkien, Lewis's model McDonald, and a few others achieve some variation of it, but none quite like Lewis.The story unfolds with the four Pevensie children being sent to live with an eccentric old professor in the country, in order to be out of London during the bombing. The house turns out to be as interesting as the professor, and soon the kids find their way to an alternate world where some of the animals can talk and fairy-tales come to life. Not just the fun characters, either, but witches as well, in fact one has the land of Narnia under a spell where it's \\"always winter but never Christmas\\". The kids become the focal point for a classic good versus evil struggle, but with heavy though never pedantic theological lessons. And the king of Narnia, the lion who is the son of the Emperor-over-the-Sea, is just fantastic. Highly, highly recommended for kids and adults."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"\\"...a book worth reading ONLY in childhood is not worth reading even then.\\" ~C.S. LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming.

Highly recommend this audio cd."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"In my humble opinion, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the finest children's story of the past century. The story contains both enormously imaginative touches combined with childlike simplicity, and the solid yet uncomplex prose belies a story of great sophistication. It also is a story intended for children, yet so respectful of their intelligence that adults can read it with equal appreciation.There should be absolutely no controversy about where this novel should come in the seven-novel sequence that comprises The Chronicle of Narnia: it is the first, and it is required to be the first both by the quality of the novel and by the way it fits into the overall structure of the series. Shifting it from the first spot in the series to the second is quite possibly the worst publishing decision of which I am aware. The justification for the change is exceedingly weak. A child wrote Lewis saying that in their opinion the series should be read beginning with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which tells, among other things, of the creation of Narnia. Therefore, they felt that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW should be the first and THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE second, with a subsequent reordering of the other books to reflect the chronology of Narnia instead of the kids that discover Narnia. Lewis replied that he agreed, and this agreement is used as the excuse to reorder the books. I have two huge problems with this. First, my guess is that Lewis was, as a wise adult will often do, affirming the child rather than stating his conviction that the books should be reordered. Second, even if Lewis did think the books should be reordered, it is not clear that he actually would have authorized it actually being done, nor that he would have resisted the efforts of any decent publisher to point out to him that reordering was a dreadful idea. Why? Because what is so magical about the original ordering of the series is that it focuses on the extremely subjective experience of the discovery of Narnia by children. The original order maintains a chronology based on its exploration and discovery by children and in reading the books that is going to be the concern of any child or childlike adult in reading the story. Who cares about the narrative from the standpoint of Narnia when the far greater concern is the narrative from the standpoint of children? A lesser but still pertinent criticism of the reordering is that it places one of the weakest novels in the sequence in the first position. When I first read the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW was, along with THE SILVER CHAIR and A HORSE AND HIS BOY, the weakest stories in the sequence. Why put your worst foot forward? The Narnia books are about to be made into a series of feature films by the Disney studios, and they have quite correctly decided to film the books in the original and correct order.As noted initially, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a nearly perfect story. The manner in which the children first discover Narnia, by entering it through the back of an ordinary wardrobe, is the most exciting entrance into a magical land at least since THE WIZARD OF OZ and probably ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. What they discover is a land under the worst of all possible curses: it is always winter, but never gets to be Christmas. The land is temporarily ruled by a beautiful but evil witch who entices children with Turkish Delight. As literature it is all so delightfully perfect, and one marvels that an enormously literate Oxford don could have written it, though perhaps not so surprising when remembering that another Oxford professor, the mathematician and logician Rev. Charles L. Dodgson, wrote ALICE IN WONDERLAND under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll.Of course, Narnia isn't really ruled by the witch, but by a magnificent, enormous lion by the name of Aslan, who, as we are often reminded, is not a tame lion. Anyone reading Narnia will instant recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion. During the course of the book Lewis retells the story of the death and resurrection of Christ through the character of Aslan, yet he ever gets to the point of preaching or dogmatism. A very close friend of mine, raised Jewish, was aware of the Christ overtones of the story, yet still declared that it was her favorite book as a child.This is also one of the books with the largest potential audience of which I know. I first read and loved it in college, but elementary school children can delight in reading it, and even younger children can love having it read to them. And it would take a pretty somber and sober adult to not be seduced by its beautiful simplicity. Absolutely no one should deny themselves the joys of exploring Narnia, but make sure you start your tour with this book and not another."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I liked reading The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe.

But not one of the four children could have ever imagined that they would be transported to a strange, faraway land known as Narnia. Lucy is the first to discover the strange place, when she looks into a wardrobe, and is quickly walking through ankle-deep snow, and cavorting with a Faun named Tumnus. When she returns from her journey, she is shocked to find that her older siblings think she is making up lies, and even more shocked to find that Edmund - who discovers Narnia and the White Witch at a later time - lies when his siblings question about his journey there. But when all four children find their way to the strange land, and find that Lucy's friend, Tumnus, has been seized by the White Witch, the four children believe that it is their duty to rescue him, and quickly find themselves immersed in adventure, statues, talking animals, a great lion, and a battle.I have heard about THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA for years, and while I saw the BBC version of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE years ago, I never read the book. That is, until I heard about the new Disney film being created from this book. I found that from page one I was deeply immersed in this story, and interested to find what would happen to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - all very enjoyable characters, by the way. C.S. Lewis weaves an enchanting story that will keep readers enamored for hours, as they accompany the four youngsters on their adventures through the mystical land of Narnia. A fascinating story that will enchant readers of all ages - especially those who accompanied Alice through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I first encountered C.S.Lewis when 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was read aloud to my class, over the period of a term, by our teacher in 1969 when I was eight years old. Of course I, like millions of other children over the past fifty years, did not recognise the Christian parable. To us it was just a story. But now, as a forty-four year old man and a C.S.Lewis devotee, I am of course aware of it's intended 'other meaning'.However, that aside, I think back to 1969, and can clearly remember as a child, how I and my classmates received it as 'just a story'. We were absolutely enchanted. Whenever the weekly lesson started during which our teacher would read a chapter or two from the book, I remember, as she began, having butterflies in my stomach. Throughout my childhood no other literary work ever came so close to literally giving me a glimpse of magic. Although we were unaware of it's christian meaning I believe, in hindsight, that what so captivated us was indeed it's deep spirituality which reached out, through the storyline and the characters involved, and entered our very souls. I do not think it is inappropriate of me to suggest (even accounting for my partisan leanings of being a huge Lewis fan) that, whilst such literature is available, a childhood that is allowed to pass without being given a similar such glimpse of something so fundamentally enchanting, has been deprived of something very important."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This c.d. was a complete life saver on our summer driving/camping holiday. Our six year old son was completely enraptured by the characters and the plot. There were moral lessons to learn but of course fabulous evil characters, good guys and battle scenes as well.

They were sent away from their home in London to live with an old professor because of the air-raids in the war. The professor had strict rules about the house such as what not to do and where you shouldn't go. While they were at his house they decided to play hide and go seek in the house. When the youngest child Lucy decided to hide in one of the forbidden rooms, which had nothing but a large figure with a sheet over it. Lucy wanted to see what it was so she took off the sheet to find a beautiful wardrobe laying there in front of her. She decided to hide inside of it and when she opened it she found something amazing inside of the wardrobe.Which is what leads to the whole adventure of the four children.The Lion, The Witch, and The wardrobe is a great book for people who love fantasy or Lord of The Rings.

The struggle between good and evil has prompted many discussions after reading the book. I'm a fan, and each year the series prompts many of my students to go find the box set. I think the series is a must read; for kids of all ages.I highly recommend this book, but beware there is some violence in the book, but again I think that handled properly even 3rd graders can discuss the perils of Good and Evil.Find the Series, but please read \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" first the way C.S.

Even though this is the second book in a series of seven, it can be read without reading the The Magicians Nephew, which is a magnificent book also.

Peter is the leader of the group. He is a very brave and strong boy.They find Narnia through a wardrobe. When they got there they saw how fabulous and wonderful Narnia was. They meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver. In Narnia animals can talk, so Mr. Beaver told them about how they were fighting the White Witch and Aslan was coming. None of the children knew who Aslan was. They asked Mr. Beaver and he told them Aslan was the great lion that created Narnia. They heard the witch was after them so, they ran to a battle field, and met the witch where they fought.My favorite part was when they went to Narnia and saw how wonderful and amazing it was.

So do you want to read a great adventurous book? If you do then The Chronicles of Narnia is the right book for you. There are four kids [peter (oldest), Susan, Edmond, and Lucy (youngest)] who have to leave their home in London because there are air raids. So they have to get on a train and go to a place far away from their home. They go to a house in the country where a professor lives and the professor has a house keeper. When the kid's get there the house keeper makes many rules for them and the most important rule that the house keeper made sure they heard was \\"don't bother the professor!\\" While they were playing one day they find a magical wardrobe that leads to a mystery land called Narnia, while in Narnia siblings have to learn to trust and believe in them selves and in others in order to get through Narnia. Ultimately Edmond is tricked by the white witch and leaves his brother and sisters. They must rescue him, but how can three kids defeat a powerful and mystical witch?The Chronicles of Narnia is a book for everyone. It has a great adventure and once you start reading it you're hooked. The whole book is basically a rising action as each page gets better. It also has some action and a little magic. It has a lot of different creatures. With a very creative story, this book is fiction and fantasy.The Chronicles of Narnia is really similar to the movie version of The Chronicles of Narnia. The book just has a lot more description than the movie. For example: in the book they tell the setting everywhere and when they get to the beavers house they describe everything and in the movie they just show the house while they are walking into it. They both make a good picture in your mind. They both have the same characters.There are no weaknesses and nothing I didn't like about the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book makes you wonder what is going to happen next, example there is never a slow boring part. The book is always moving and it feels like you are moving with it or in it. It is great all the way to the end. In conclusion this book will blow your mind. A never ending adventure that takes you with it. Full of action waiting to happen, when you pick it up and start reading it you won't want to put it down. Even if you don't like to read you will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"For a few years I tossed around the idea of reading this children's fantasy novel and finally took the plunge after hearing a speaker at our fellowship talk about it last month. Fiction is not my cup of tea, but if there is anyone who could give me a taste for it, C.S. Lewis would be the one. Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe. Upon completion of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, both Rose and Grace have expressed on one more than one occasion their disappointment that I am not continuing on with Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia, the second of seven books in The Chronicles of Narnia series. Although I do not plan on reading more fiction anytime soon, I think there is a good possibility we will continue these adventures in the land of Narnia one day."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"My edition of this book is subtitled \\" Book 1 in the chronicles of Narnia\\". Interestingly the author wanted this book read after \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals. I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read \\"Nephew\\" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!In any event \\"Wardrobe\\" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a \\"magic\\" wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor. It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story, after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading.

When I first read the book I was too young to understand all that was going on under the surface of the main plot.

Even if you aren't a Christian, I wasn't when I read them the first time, the stories are a wonderful picture of fantasy intermingled with a light morality play.

The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of them. It has been almost twenty years since I first read this book, and I still get goose bumps. It's not one of the deepest or most poetic pieces of literature, but it is truly one of the most magical. \\"Magical\\" is really the word to describe this enchanting novel. It's very, very simplistic as it works its powers on the child imagination. A wardrobe that is a door into a magic realm that needs to be saved from eternal winter. Even after many readings and many years, I still feel the beauty and the darkness of the book. I still get a little freaked out by the paranoia of the trees listening in. And I still feel the incredible power and joy of the melting snows. C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is deceptively simple. He takes the ordinary and turns it into pure magic. He plays with the child's imagination. He creates darkness in simplicity. The simplicity is enchanting rather than dull. The characters are fantastic and utterly charmingly enchanting, from the brat and betrayer Edmund (my favorite) to the kind goodness of Lucy to the sympathetic and conflicted Mr. Tumnus the faun to the frightening and awe-inspiring Aslan and the White Witch. The simple and allegorical story of saving Narnia through sacrifice and redemption isn't really the point. The point is the magic of it all. One of my all time favorite books. One of the books that formed my imagination and my brain. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"After reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time at age 31, I sat and asked myself what I really thought of it. I think one of the main things that I felt was disappointment. Not in the book itself, but mainly with myself for not reading it when I was much younger. I truly enjoyed the tale that Lewis has woven, but I think that a lot of the magic is lost by reading it for the first time as an adult.The story itself is solid and I enjoy the narrative tone of it and the references back to the reader by the author as he tells his tale. As an adult, I did notice a fair amount of simplicity in the writing (I'm used to reading novels with much more detail) but not in a negative way. Overly wordy and descriptive narrative can sometimes undermine the smooth flow of a simple story line, and that might have been the case here had Lewis gotten too detailed.I am looking forward to continuing my maiden voyage into Narnia and am eagerly waiting to see what adventures lie ahead."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \\"Wardrobe.\\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to \\"Wardrobe\\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \\"Nephew,\\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \\"Narnia\\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\\" and from me that is saying worlds.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This Review is for the HarperCollins hardcover edition of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". This printing uses the original text from the British edition of the book, rather than include the changes that C.S. Lewis made prior to the publication of the American edition.In 1950, C. S. Lewis's first book of The Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was published. This book would later be considered the 2nd in the series' internal chronology. If you are coming to this book after seeing the movie version as I did, you will find that it is aimed at a younger audience. This book serves well as an introduction to the fantasy genre for young readers. At a little under 200 pages, it is a fairly quick read. In 2001, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for novels published in the year 1950.The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie) who are sent out of London during World War II to the English midlands to keep them safe. There they stay in a Professor's large house. While exploring the house, they find a room with just a single Wardrobe in it, which Lucy soon finds sometimes acts as a doorway to Narnia.The other children don't believe her at first, but later when trying to hide from the housekeeper they are all find themselves in the mystical land of Narnia. They find that Narnia is in a perpetual winter without Christmas, caused by the White Witch who claims to be the Queen of Narnia. They soon learn that they are prophesized to bring an end to the evil of the White Witch, and they learn of Aslan, a great lion and leader who has returned to the land and who is the true King of Narnia.Much has been written of the use of Christian themes which run through the story. Some of them are quite obvious, such as the references to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, and the winters without Christmas. Others are a bit more subtle such as the betrayal, death, and resurrection stories. Lewis also drew on other mythology though, such as Norse and Greek in some of the creatures which inhabit Narnia. In any event, the Christian themes are not too heavy handed, and the book can easily be enjoyed by readers of any faith for what it is, a fantasy.The overall result is a fun light read for young readers. As the age of the reader goes up, the amount of enjoyment will undoubtedly go down, as this story lacks the detail and texture which can be found in Lewis's contemporary's work \\"The Hobbit\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien. There are also some rather odd passages in the book, such as references to problems with Edmund which had never been discussed earlier and an inconsistency with regards to repeated travels to Narnia. These flaws are minor though, and this work is deservedly considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting.

I have read this book as a younger kid and just now and there was a big difference in the way I read it. As a kid it was a lot more magical and I couldn't put it down I just had to read it.

The author dedicates this book to Lucy, a girl, that like the characters in the story, went to live in a country house, escaping from London in the war years.The author begin telling the story of four siblings, the Pevensyes. Peter, the oldest, Susan, the second oldest, Edmund, the second youngest, and Lucy, the youngest were all sent to a country house to live with professor Kirke, during the war.They went to live in a humongous old mansion, where only an old professor and his maid, Mrs. Macready. One day, they were playing hide and seek, when Lucy, the youngest, found a spare room, empty like many other rooms in the house. The only difference was that this was not a completely empty room, but there was a wardrobe in it, and as soon as she entered the room, she was astonished with the wardrobe, there was something different about it. It was an old wardrobe with many drawings on it, and she thought it was a very beautiful wardrobe. They were still playing hide and seek, so, she hid inside the wardrobe, and she kept on going further in, until she thought to herself, \\"this must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\\" She had been walking through coats which didnt let her see what was in front of her, but she felt something cold under her feet, and wet. Soon, there were no more coats, instead, there were branches of trees on her face. She was shocked when she saw that she was in the middle of a wood and it was winter. She had entered the world of Narnia, and there she had incredible adventures and she even met Mr. Tumnus, a faun.When she came back to Earth, what seemed to heve lasted many hours in Narnia, didnt take any time at all, here on Earth. She tried to explain to them what hapened but they didnt believe her.It was many days later that they were playing hide and seek again, and they all went in the wardrobe to hide and they saw that she was telling the truth. And That's how the whole adenture begins.All four of them were in Narnia this time, and they had to try to rescue their brother Edmund from the White Witch, the responsible for the eternal winter in Narnia.Meanwhile, they met Aslan, the creator, the real king of Narnia, who helped them rescue their brother, and made them kings and queens of Narnia after they Fought the White Whitch, killed her and put an end to the long winter, bringing peace to Narnia again.They were Kings and Queens for many years, until one day when they were walking through the woods and, accidentally, went in the wardrobe and came back to Earth.

Going into the Christian symbolism has been interesting and my students love it. This is a great book to show children there is deeper meaning behind surface story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is the first book C. S. Lewis wrote in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Even though \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" occurs first chronologically (and is now listed as #1 in most sets), this book is a much better introduction to the land of talking animals and, more importantly, to Aslan. Though children from our world are the main characters in this (and other) Narnia stories, the true hero is Aslan, The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea.Though this is written as a fairytale for children it follows C. S. Lewis's philosophy that, \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\" Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book, besides being a fun fantasy story, explores a different aspect of His character. This book reveals Aslan as Redeemer."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is a wonderful audio edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, perfect for car trips. However, if you are planning to read along with in the book, this is not the audio cd to purchase."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"You know, I can't help but question whether a book like this would be published today. There's a lot of telling, not so much showing, a lot of action is skimmed over and it's very obviously a religious allegory (not that that would make it ineligible for publication). I couldn't help but think that as I read it but at the same time I couldn't help but think just how magical the story actually is.Compare the circumstances to other works now and you don't have all that much that is original but then, back in 1950, this was the epitome of original. There was nothing else like this story except for facetious fairy tales that carried very little depth. This was the basis for portals and other worlds and magical creatures that authors today either consciously or subconsciously pull from for their own stories. So no, it's not original today but it is the very reason it's not original today, because it was so original and magical then that it was bound to spurn derivatives.This is a classic fairy tale despite the obvious Jesus references (if I could find that YouTube video, I'll post it, with Aslan as Jesus). It's light and airy and the kind that, obviously without me saying it, will stand the test of time for many more years to come. The children are eternally relatable , their wishes are forever there in the reader, to escape to a magic land and become king or queen. There's nothing in there that couldn't appeal to anyone, at any time, reading it.When comparing this book to something like Stardust by Neil Gaiman, I think the voice of Narnia just stands out. This was Lewis's voice. He was born to write these types of fantastical stories in the style of an age-old fairy tale. While Gaiman's idea for Stardust was on the level of awesome, the voice just wasn't right. There was a sort of force there, a trying too hard. I use Gaiman as an example because (aside from the fact that I can't think of any other authors that have tried to write like this) he's a magnificent writer and writes amazing stories. Stardust was an experiment for him, not his usual voice so it's not chalked up to him not being able to write. That old timey style voice of fairy story telling is bestowed only on a select few. Lewis was one of those few.These stories are capable of transcending time with ease and are written in such a way that they'll never go out of style. Sure, you'd have to be either really damn good or someone of Gaiman's status in the publishing industry to get something like this published now, and even then there's no guarantee of equivalence, but it doesn't erase the fact that Narnia was published, does exist and will continue to exist for generations. There is a classicism about these stories that just can't be erased and just can't be mimicked unless you've been bestowed with the voice to do it.Yes, there is so much that could be expanded on in Narnia but what's already there on the pages is amazing. Perhaps it is because it's the epitome of a fairy tale and someone who's much more critical than I can might be able to see how empty of a plate it might be but to me, there's just enough there to trust the reader. It's not bogged down in worldbuilding infodumping or unimportant backstory or research masturbation on the part of the author. All that's there is what's important to the story at hand, and nothing else. It goes from point to point seamlessly and with little to no fat and, for me anyway, makes the experience of the read that much more enjoyable.The world misses fairy tales like this, in all their simplicity but I don't think there can be much more than what there is now without an inundation which would only devalue what's already available. Let's hope the world never has to know what it's like to live without Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I thought this book was unbelievable. It was very exciting. It always had action in the book. It had a very great and fascanating plot. I loved how they walked into a different world. It was cool when all the characters were in the book.It was the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Have you ever imagined being sent away to someone's house, that has a secret that no one knows but you? The house in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe had a secret , which only Peter, Susan,Edmund, and Lucy knows. Once they went through the wardrobe in the house,their adventures would begin in the land called Narnia, and their lives will change.I love this book, because it tells about Lucy trying to save her friend Tumnus. It tells about the wonderful adventures she had with her friends, Peter, Susan, and Edmund and the great dangers they faced in Narnia. I also liked the little rhymes that describes Aslan, the great lion.I wish that this book would be longer and the adventures of Narnia would countinue in this book.I recommend this book for people who like adventure stories, because this book is filled with adventures.My favorite part is when the dwarf made Edmond a prisoner and used a whip to threaten him to go faster. If the White Witch ( a terrible witch) that calls herself queen of Narnia wants Edmond to go faster, the dwarf whips him until he goes faster.My other favorite part is when Edmond got tricked into bringing Peter, Susan and Lucy to her because she wants to turn Edmond and his friends into stone. They are smart and she doesn't want them to break the White Witch's spell. The spell is a spell that will keep Narnia always in a winter season.On the map, I think it is a little confusing because it doesn't show the place where Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy came through the Wardrobe to Narnia, but the story is exciting."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"World War II rages but in the country, the Pevensies (Peter,Susan, Edmund, Lucy), four children find their way into the greatestplace they have ever seen-Narnia.

Aslan, the Lion who created and has protected Narnia since it's beginning must come once again and free the land from evil.

The evil, foul-minded people who are publishing these works (The Chronicles of Narnia) have profaned the fantastic writing of C.S. Lewis by rearranging the order of the seven books so as to confuse the reader and steal away some of the magic and wonder by imposing it in a chronological order rather than the artistic one in which it was rendered. Is the horrible time witch at play again or it could be that rascal Screwtape at work? I shake my head sadly at the poor folk who will read these books in the wrong order, actually thinking that perhaps the author meant for them to read Volume Six first. Yes, of course these books come highly recommended but I think it is most important to stress that they should be read in the proper order, which is as follows: 1. The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe 2. Prince Caspian 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4. The Silver Chair 5. The Horse and His Boy 6. The Magician's Nephew 7. The Last Battle Please, do yourself a favor, if you are reading these books for the first time, read them in the right order."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I somehow managed to make it through my childhood without ever coming across C.S. Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia. I had heard of the series but never read it, and it's only now as an adult that I have picked up \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I knew a little going in; there was a magical land known as Narnia, it featured a lion, and somehow a wardrobe was invovled.The book centers around four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They have been sent away from London to escape the air raids of World War II and are staying at a professor's house in the country. While exploring the mansion one day, the youngest, Lucy, comes across an old cupboard that houses coats. Opening it up to hide in, she discovers that, rather than being an ordinary wardrobe, it is a gateway to a magical land called Narnia. There are many interesting creatures, from unicorns to giants, centaurs and dwarves. Sadly, Narnia has been put under a spell by an evil witch who has made it winter all the time - but never Christmas. The land is waiting to be freed, and freedom can only happen with a war against the witch and those on her side.Lucy eventually makes it back to the professor's house and quickly tells her siblings what she has seen. They don't believe her, even when Edmund accompanies her into the wardrobe on another adventure in the land. There, he is met and falls under the witch's spell. Eventually, all four siblings enter the magical land, where they participate in a battle to rid Narnia of the witch and restore Aslan as ruler of all.I've read commentary that the Chronicles of Narnia is a very religious series, and coming from a Christian perspective, I can agree. Aslan is definitely representative of Jesus Christ, and aspects of the story mimic biblical events. But this is something I was looking for as I was reading; if I hadn't been aware of it, I may not have made the connection. And, while this book isn't as vivid as, say, Harry Potter, it is still a great tale.Overall, while I was less than thrilled with \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", I can see the appeal to children. I am going to delve into the rest of the series to see what it's about; after all, it's a fast read and an interesting one at that."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by C.S. Lewis. The genre of this book is an adventure book. The name of the book comes from four young children's lives in a somewhat parallel universe as ours. I would say that the theme of the book is loyalty to your family. I enjoyed this story very much. It was a constant page turner for me. Every new page was sort of a new adventure for me and the characters alike. The story is written in a 3rd person point of view where the author not only tells of the story but talks to the reader as well. I enjoy this much more than a regular third person point of view. The authors voice to me sounds like an older man sitting by a fireplace telling you of this story that he came up with the previous night and was energetic to tell us. \\" There shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane ( for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\" This is a quote from the book in which the author adds his own little thoughts, as if he were really telling us what was happening.The setting of the story takes place in a fictional world called Narnia. It is world filled with magic and mystical beings and talking animals. It is very much like the world we live in today with exception technology and regular humans. The writer makes you feel like your in the story. He does not use a lot of the seeing sense but much more of the others such as cold, harsh. hard, and pale. Narnia is mostly covered in snow and ice due to the Witch's rule. However there are parts of the land that are not affected. The parts that have not been affected by the cold is where her evil power has not yet reached.The main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy; going from oldest to youngest. Then there is of course the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch; the Queen of Narnia. You also have Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Lewis put a good deal of detail into each of his characters, even the non important ones. As I said in the first paragraph the theme is about loyalty to your family, Edmund, the second youngest of the four, dishonored his siblings and almost got them killed by a the Witch's police wolves.The story is essentially about the four children going into a magical wardrobe and ending up in a world called Narnia ruled by the Evil Witch.

There are little lessons in morality, religion, history, and undeniable fantasy wrapped in a story sure to please. I read this book again and again and from the moment Lucy steps through the wardrobe door and pushes her way back through what seems and impossibly large wardrobe, through fur coat after coat, and finally into the forest, hearing the snow crunch beneath her feet, I was hooked.

Her brothers and sister make fun of her. Edmund will be second and he meets the Witch, Queen Jadis, who has taken over the country. She charms him with Turkish Delight and makes him promise to come back with his brother and sisters.One day, when the children are trying to fly away and hide from a group of visiting tourists in the mansion, they hide in the wardrobe and find themselves in Narnia. They all discover that Mr. Tumnus has been captured and his house ransacked due to the blabbering Edmund had done with the witch.They are all taken into their homes by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and it is then that Edmund escapes and goes back to Queen Jadis. He will have there the strongest and most interesting surprise in his life.That leads to the confrontation of Aslan and his human and Narnian supporters on one hand, and Queen Jadis and her own supporters on the other hand. The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief. Then the battle is a victory because Edmund gets his vengeance and destroys the Queen's magic wand. She is then powerless.The four kids are crowned kings and queens of Narnia till one day a White Stagn, like the Celtic messenger from the other world or the Arthurian quest-announcing messenger, leads them back to the lamp post and they come back to this side of the wardrobe door. But though once a king of Narnia always a king of Narnia, they can't go back the same way. That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend. The origin of Queen Jadis is Adam and his \\"other\\" wife Lilith, a Jinn, and then later taking some giant blood in her stock.We have to think of the Beast when dealing with Jadis, but she is a female witch whereas the Beast of the Apocalypse is a male monster devouring pregnant women, and its number is 666. We also have to think of the French meaning of Jadis which is \\"once upon a time\\", the past in fairy tales. The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them. The sacrificial altar is found in many cultures, among others the Celtic culture, or the Roman or Greek cultures, and even the Jewish tradition, to remain within the Eurasian geographical zone.The resurrected savior is well known in many mythologies and religions, the Christian for one example. The traitor is more Christian and yet there are traitors in Sumerian and Mesopotamian traditions. C.S. Lewis regenerates the motif by making the traitor the hero who will save the day by destroying the magic of the witch.We must also think that the four kids around the Lion are reminiscent of the four animals or living creatures around the altar, a lion, a bull, a human-faced animal and an eagle, hence of the four Evangelists in Saint John's Apocalypse. That number four is crucial in the writing and style as opposed to three that seems to represent disorder. Four is like order re-established beyond disorder when the traitor or stray sheep comes back to the fold.The charm of the book is of course the transmuting of that more or less religious magic into a secular marvelous sorcery that can also be magical, white or black, in a way.Finally the Queen/Witch with her secret police is of course a political discourse to children and it exposes tyrannical means and situations as unacceptable because inhumane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Michael Hague once again captures the images of a classic story.

When the movie came out (which I also loved) it just furthered the popularity of this series. While it can be read as a stand alone, I recommend reading the complete series for the full richness and history that is contained for the world of Narnia.When Lucky, Edmund, Peter, and Susan have to go to the countryside to escape the air raids and war, they stay with a kindly professor at his rather large house. There is plenty to explore, and it is on a rainy day that Lucy finds a magical doorway to another world, inside the wardrobe in a spare room. She quickly makes a friend in a faun and learns of the evil White Witch who fancies herself Queen of Narnia. The other children don't believe her about her adventures though, and this is even worse for her when Edmund comes through too but lies about it to the other children. Finally and quite by accident they all make it to Narnia and learn that they have been expected. Aslan, the great lion, wants to see them and they set out to meet him and help him with his fight against the White Witch. However, they experience a setback when Edmund defects to the witch's side and they feel sure that he is lost to them.The characters, despite this being a short book, are very well done. I love Lucy and think she is charming and sweet. Peter is rather noble and distant, and Edmund of course is a complete brat in the beginning of the book without hardly any redeeming qualities. The other characters are quite nice as well and it is easy to see that Aslan has a regal bearing.The writing is great and definitely the most appropriate for kids (adults might find the story a little rushed) and while there are battles there is not extreme violence in this book. In fact, the only thing I found offensive was Father Christmas saying women shouldn't fight in wars, but that could just be the small bit of feminist in me. There are Christian tones, but they aren't strong in voice and are rather just a background to the story itself. It is read more as a fantasy novel, and highly appropriate that way.I love the series and especially this book and read it over and over. I don't think I could ever tire of it. With all the fantasy novels out there, this is definitely one that should be read.The Lion The Witch and The WardrobeCopyright 1950206 pages (and my edition had black and white pictures as well)Review by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I grew up attending a private, Christian school and I was convinced that I had heard this story, and read it, enough times. I finally picked the book back up and was surprised how much I had forgotten and how many things I never picked up on before.This is a great book for all ages. For children, the story of Christ is presented in such a way that is easy to relate with and understand. For adults, C.S. Lewis has insights about who God is and how He relates to the world that will open your mind and heart. Using metaphor as a means to describe who God really is has fallen out of use, but it is a tool that can sneak around the most guarded defenses and penetrate souls better than any other.As I started the series again this time, I realized that the death and resurrection story would start the series. Many fantasy series contain this element, but normally as the climax to the series. Lewis includes it at the beginning. I don't know why he wrote the series this way, but I suspect it is because it reflects our own lives. The first thing we must learn about is Christ and his death and resurrection and saving power. Then we learn how God moved in the world before Christ, after Christ, and how He is moving now in our own lives. For that reason, even though I'm not done with the series yet, I like how Lewis starts with this story.One of my favorite quotes is from this book, and it was great to read it in the full context again.\\"He'll be coming and going. One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down-and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\\"This is well worth reading again if you have not read it recently, no matter your age.

HA!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"\\"Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was written\\"The four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - have come into the countryside to live with The Professor, away from the war. While there, Lucy discovers an old wardrobe that leads to a magical world.I Liked:I find myself at a loss figuring out what I want to say about this book. I've never been as fond of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as I've been of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", but it certainly isn't a bad book.The story is clever and unique. At the time, not many fantasy stories existed for children, and this book definitely transports you to a world much different than ours. I love how it is populated with mythological creatures like fauns, nymphs and centaurs, but also has talking animals (which Disney almost owns exclusive rights to), and not just your \\"typical\\" talking animals, like cats and dogs, but animals like beavers (beavers?! That wouldn't have been my first choice) and lions.Another clever addition was the treachery of Edmund. Children in books tend to come off as almost insanely perfect and unable to err, and even this book doesn't avoid it 100% as Lucy, Peter, and Susan do have near-perfect attributes. But Edmund's deception, greed, and subsequent guilt do make things more realistic and show redemption. Plus, it keeps our bad guys from being painfully bad.I Didn't Like:What's always bugged me about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the heavy-handed Christian allegory/symbolism/whatever-you-call-it. I consider myself a religious person, and yet the message is still too heavy-handed to me and makes me feel I am being bludgeoned with a brick. There were some things that weren't bad (Edmund's redemption), but the obvious parallels to Christian ideology, again, made me cringe.Similarly, I found a lot of the characters to be very simplistic and easily drawn out. I realize this is a children's novel, but still, it would have been nice had Lucy not been so obviously perfect (it could have made the \\"Who is lying?\\" bit between Lucy and Edmund's stories of Narnia more interesting) and had Peter and Susan had more character beyond \\"caring, older siblings\\".I also wasn't fond at all of the lack of participation of the girls in particular and the children in general. Lucy finds the land of Narnia, so she gets some brownie points, but after that, her purpose is nothing. Peter fights a battle and that is it. Susan is the worst as she does nothing that couldn't have been done by one of her other siblings. Honestly, the only person that does anything in the course of the novel is Edmund, and even that is only mess things up. The children themselves do nothing; only their presence in Narnia dictates any action, and that is because of a painfully written poem/prophecy. I understand that Lewis was going for an allegory of sorts between Narnia and our world in Christian terms and that our characters are children and can't be miniature Rambos and Rocky's, but when none of our characters really do much, it makes the whole story feel a little pointless.Also, I know this book was published in 1952, but I hated how Susan and Lucy were purposefully cut out of the fight (\\"Wars aren't for girls\\" - but they aren't for little boys, either) and the prejudice to non-humans (Mr. Beaver says that the White Witch is bad because she isn't human but is pretending to be human and those kinds of people can't be trusted...WTF?!). Maybe if Susan and Lucy had more of a role, then I wouldn't complain.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Absolutely nothing.While no where near as creepy as Uncle Andrew towards Polly in The Magician's Nephew, the White Witch does act pretty cozy to Edmund.There is an epic battle; a major character dies.Overall:While enjoyable to read, I did find myself growing bored, irritated, or embarrassed while reading this book. I would have preferred a book less overt about its theme and message, and one that spent more time building characters and making them important. However, this book does ignite a spark of imagination and creativity, and I think children would enjoy it worlds more than a jaded adult like me.Brought to you by:*C.S.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C.

S. Lewis wrote this volume first, in 1950, but he later said that The Magician's Nephew, written in 1955, should be considered the first book in his seven book Narnia series. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe occurs when the main character of The Magician's Nephew is an old man, a very wise professor, who lives in a very large house.Four children, siblings, two brothers and two sisters, are sent out of London to the professor's house in the countryside to escape the bombs dropped by the German air force during World War II. They discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a portal leading to the magical land of Narnia.Narnia is under the control of a wicked witch who is a descendant of Adam and the demon Lilith. She has covered all of Narnia with cold weather and snow, with no Christmas for a hundred years. Aslan the lion, the God figure, the creator of Narnia, has been absent from Narnia ever since the wicked witch took control. The citizens of Narnia look forward to his return to save them from the evil. This reminds readers of the popular idea that a messiah will come and help create an ideal world.There is a prophecy in Narnia that if four humans come to Narnia, two males and two females, Aslan will return. The four siblings are present; however, one of the two boys has been seduced by the witch. Nevertheless, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, Father Christmas appears. He gives everyone gifts. He gives the three children instruments of war.How they fought? What did the lion do? What happened to the witch? What happened to the fourth child? Did all four children return home? These are questions that the rest of the book answers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages. He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler. While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice. Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun. It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets! This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life. Another Christian fantasy book I like, aimed at a somewhat older audience, isARROWS THROUGH TIME: A Time Travel Tale of Adventure, Courage, and Faith."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"For those of you who are unfamiliar with C. S. Lewis's works and stances on life and faith, I suggest you check out Mere Christianity, which is perhaps the best book ever written on the fundamentals of Christianity. Narnia is also one of the greatest Fantasy series to tackle faith, as it is filled with Biblical symbolisms. Lewis noted that kids often picked up on the symbolisms more than adults, so we gotta show those youngsters that we can still think creativelyStory overview:---------------Peter (13), Susan (12), Edmund (10) and Lucy (8), are evacuated from London to escape the effects of WW2. They go to the home of Professor Digory Kirke, who owns a huge country house and lives with his housekeeper, Mrs MacReady.Lucy discovers that a mysterious wardrobe is actually a portal to another world called Narnia. She meets a talking faun named Tumnus and learns of the White Witch, who made it always winter but never Christmas. No one believes Lucy on her return, but one day Edmund and her end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Edmund is deceived by the White Witch and betrays his siblings once they all find their way to the world of Narnia.Meeting up with the Beaver family, the children learn about the fate of Tumnus and the goings on in Narnia. They find out about a prophecy and Aslan (The Great Lion), who is said to be on the move. They eventually meet up with him, and when Edmund is rescued, the White Witch demands his return. According to the ancient law (the \\"Deep magic\\") she has the right to do so, but instead of handing over Edmund, Aslan takes his place to die for the boy's guilt. This isn't the end of the Great Lion, as a final battle takes place and the prophecy is fulfilled.My thoughts:-------------When I was little, my mother read me this story and I absolutely loved it. Unlike some of the other books my mother had read, I still like this one as much today as I did back then. Ironically, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is one of the books in this series I liked the least, but it still marks the beginning of a wonderful magical world, and a journey that every kid should experience.

There are many reasons why you should buy the book itself. The plot is rich and full of details (however if you read The Magician's Nephew first, much of the plot will be spoiled). The illustrations are absolutely wonderful. Also (though this is a reason why you should buy the 1950 one), having it in hardcover and textured really holds the book together, so you can expect to get many years out of it, if it has already lasted 59. This is the order in which you should read the books: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Newphew, and the Last Battle. By the way, if you're someone who absolutely loves the original order of the books, or even someone who prefers the chronological order, you'll notice there's just no way to change The Last Battle, with the \\"last\\" part of it in the title."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I think kids would enjoy reading \\"Narnia The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" because there's plenty of adventure and action. The main characters of Narnia are Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund. The author is C.S. Lewis. C.S. Lewis was very descriptive in describing the characters which made them believable. For example, when the author described the kids being scared of the beavers. The beavers seamed real.My favorite part of the book is when Edmund went into the witch's castle. I liked this scene because it was very spooky. It was spooky because there was a lion that appeared to be real but was really made of stone.

Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.This is, of course, the most recognisable title of the series as well as being the first written/published. Most readers will pick up the book hoping for a written account of the events in the recent film, or perhaps the BBC drama series if your memory goes back that far! For the most part the events are the same, although elements are extracted and expanded upon in the films making the novel a little pale in comparison.It is not however lacking in terms of character or charm, and is an alluring tale that sucks the reader in instantly despite the intrusion of the narrator at times. The protagonists, places and events are described straight-forwardly with insightful touches that enhances the specific element that brings the scenes to life.

Soon, they will figure out how foolish they were to not believe and how this will be one heck of an adventure in Narnia. Unicorns, fauns, battles, an evil witch, Aslan the lion..The rating for this book is 4/5 for a reason. This being that I disliked how C.S. Lewis gave us very long and pointless descriptions and often renamed every single creature in the world of Narnia. I constantly had to skip through those just to continue my story. Some might find it better for you to read this, but I didn't.Overall, I think you will find this book very pleasing to read. It's a warm and freezing cold story to read.

The four siblings then go on the adventure of their lives.I'm a 35 years old male and I don't know why, but I had never read any of The Chronicles of Narnia books by Mr. C.S. Lewis. After reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe what a shame it has been to not have read them before. My wife and I saw a trailer for the upcoming \`Chronicles' movie by Disney, Prince Caspian. We both thought it looked interesting and decided we should watch the first movie being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe before seeing Prince Caspian. After reading some of the reviews of the book I decided it would be worth the time to actually read each of the books before seeing the corresponding movie which brings me to the place of reading The Lion... this weekend. Books are almost always better than their corresponding movies and I think it's important, if possible, to read the books first so your imagination can take over and you are not placing the faces and voices of the movie characters into the reading realm.

As you come back to the pages again and again, you will develop a fondness for a place that exists only in your mind. As the story draws to a close you may experience a kind of home sickness and feel somewhat silly because it's just a book...right?This is great bedtime reading to children."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"A must-have for all Lewis fans.

Then, the youngest brother named Edmund found the wardrobe and met an evil witch. He practically traded his brothers and sisters for Turkish Delight!

In this book, that is not so bad."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"*****I was happy to hold a hardcover with Pauline Baynes' illustrations.

S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"During the German blitz of London in WWII, four siblings are sent to the English countryside for safekeeping by an eccentric professor and his stodgy servants. Left with nothing to do besides play and get into trouble, Lucy, the youngest, gets into a wardrobe and finds a passageway to the magical world of Narnia. It is there that she meets a certain Mr. Tumnus, a nice enough chap who just happens to be a \\"Faun\\", or what I would call a satyr. At first Tumnus seems to be very friendly and invites Lucy back to his home for tea. It is there that he reveals that he is supposed to capture any humans he finds and report them to the White Witch, the self-appointed ruler of Narnia who has entrapped the land in endless winter. When he goes against the Witch's orders he is taken prisoner and taken to her castle. Lucy, along with Susan, Peter, and Edmund, set out to rescue the Faun, and in the process becomes agents of prophecy who may have the power to overthrow the wicked White Witch. They're not alone. Aslan, the god-like lion that created Narnia, has also returned to lead the fight against the black magic that threatens to extinguish all goodness. But the kids never counted on one of their own blood turning against them.Since they came out around the same time and the two authors were such good friends, one cannot help but compare the Narnia books to the Lord of the Rings sequence. And let me tell you, Lewis's work seems pale in comparison to Tolkien's. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe never quite makes it to epic status. There are too few characters, the world seems landlocked and hyperfocused, and you never get the sense that the book is part of a larger tapestry. Instead of world-building for all eternity, Lewis did just enough to frame his story. Nothing more. Nothing less. I just don't feel that the work has a solid mythology behind it.I also didn't feel very connected to the characters. They all seemed distant, cold, and at times very snobbish, in a way that only the English can be. Instead of warm-blooded real life characters, the four kids were more like anonymous cut-outs from fairy tales. Yes, Edmund was a little backstabber, and Lucy was the curious one, but beyond that, I never got a feel for who these people really were.I will say this. I liked the book ok. It was a nice diversion, but I just never connected fully with it. I definitely do not rate it as a classic. It seemed more like a work produced in the 19th century than the 20th, and perhaps that was Lewis's intention. It just didn't work for me. I will definitely continue to read the series though."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting. I have the sequels and may read those to find out what happens next in Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Set early in World War II, four children are evacuated from their home in London, which is being bombed by the German airforce and rockets. They are sent to the country residence of a wise old professor. There Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund find that they have \`fallen on their feet' as the house and its grounds are delightful. Most amazing of all (of all the things they discover, that is), one room contains a wardrobe which may allow entry to a land called Narnia, a land of myth made alive, full of creatures of legend, and ruled by a wicked queen whose magic makes it always winter. The talking beasts have taken sides, fearful or greedy ones like the wolves have turned bad and sided with the witch. But many who seem weaker remain loyal to the memory of before the witch's rule and to the true ruler of Narnia who is Aslan the great lion. And now the coming of the four children sets in motion the fulfilment of an old prophecy which gives hope to the true Narnians, and puts fear into the heart of the witch. If the four children take all four thrones that wait empty in the castle of Cair Paravel, they will become the kings and queens of Narnia, and the witch will be thrown down. So there will be war in Narnia too.How can four children who have escaped from one terror hope to win against a clever and cruel witch of such power? All their courage and all their strength is required, and the help of all are willing to aid them. They will need weapons magical and weapons plain. Even the sheer power of Aslan cannot be used to simply destroy the witch as it becomes clear that the magic by which he made Narnia follows the laws of deep magic, which are part of the nature of Aslan himself. Even he must obey his own nature, which in Narnia governs everything as the laws are a part of the existence of the land itself. Now the witch, for all her cleverness, does not understand magic as well as she imagines, and in her haste to capture and kill Edmund and prevent the prophecy coming true, she makes a bargain of which no-one can see where it will lead except Aslan himself.This was written first of the seven in the Narnia series and overall it is best read first. It is the easiest to read, and a five-year old can understand the story quite well if read out by an adult. It is probably best to read \`Prince Caspian' next in the series as it was written second, and all four children appear in this story. \`The Magician's Nephew' was written sixth in the series, and it explains how Narnia was created, and is a superb story. But none of Peter, Susan, Lucy, or Edmund appear in it as it is before their time. Also, the language in it is somewhat harder than that in \`Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe'.The Narnia books are not allegories, this is the wrong word for them. In an allegory, each character, and often each place, stands for one other thing. The names of these characters almost always give away what they stand for. A good (in fact the best) example of an allegory is \`The Pilgrim's Progress' by John Bunyan, where there are characters called \`Christian' and \`Hope' and \`Mr Worldly Wise', and places names like \`Vanity Fair' and \`The Slough of Despond'. There are many others, the Greek legends, Aesop's Fables, and fairy stories often work like this. Narnia stories are magical, mythical, parallel world stories but not allegory. The characters are living characters in their own right, they do not stand \`one-for-one' as things or symbols. The stories do contain symbols and meanings, but then so do all stories, or they would not be called stories. The other thing you cannot call the characters is metaphors, they live and breath and develop in their own world. All language is metaphorical. The sentence \`I see what you mean', is metaphorical. A blind man can \`see what you mean', it does not take eyes to \`see' meaning. So, what are the Narnia books? They are a \`thought experiment' in a magical world. All stories are thought experiments, or they would not be called stories. The only question is, what type?C.S. Lewis was a Christian, was converted around the age of thirty, and he knew what stories appealed to the non-Christian as well as the Christian. He was exceptionally clever, even for an Oxford don and Cambridge professor. He knew how to appeal to \`hearts and minds'. That is why these stories are so popular, they ring so true. It is easy to be attracted to the goodness of the good characters in them whoever you are and whenever you are in life's journey. The \`good dreams' which the ancient Greeks captured in their myths and legends attracted him, and that is why they reappear here. The things they did not understand well are all overshadowed in the light of a greater myth, the myth of Narnia. What the Greeks saw, in part and broken up, is seen here - brighter and more full of life. More of the good, better woven together. Because we have greater light, it does not mean that they did not do as well as they could with the light they had.It is hard to create really exciting good characters in books, often the bad characters are more exciting--many books of magical tales have dynamic villians and wishy-washy cardboard good guys (it is not so hard to think of some). C. S. Lewis is one of the greats, and the mark of it is that his good characters really are."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I didn't read this book when I was younger, but I enjoyed it very much!

LewisReviewed by:R.AjocPeriod: 1The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best book that Clive Staples Lewis has created. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is about Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund in their guardians home because of war in thier homeland. One day as their playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a giant wardrobe and stumbles into a mysterious land that her friend, Mr. Tumnus calls Narnia. Lucy is very astonished that she has found this new fantasy world inside of her guardian, Professor Kirke. Lucy tries to tell everyone yet no one believes anything that lucy says. Then Edmund, the bratty one in the family happens to also find Narnia, Edmund being the brat that he is tells everyone, and no one believes him. Then all of them go into the wardrobe for the first time and nothing happenes, then tries later thier in the snowy world of Narnia, and they all see Mr. Tumnus, as sneaky Edmund runs off with the white witch. Now the others Lucy, Susan, and Peter must find the White Witch and defeat her with the mighty lion, Aslan.The whole plot of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is to start of the real beggining of The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book. C.S. Lewis starts off the great fantasy world, Narnia with a great hit. Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has already been created into a movie. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book because it features many scenes while you read where you can just sink into and get lost in, especially the part during the war.This book is a very good book, although I am not a very big fan of fantasy books but Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best fantasy book I have ever read and probably the one and only best book in the series. This book is special because of the way you feel as you read it, it is as if your actually in the fantasy world of Narnia as your reading, like your running right behind Aslan as you run, or like your on flying on a dragon, such as on Dragon Rider. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best fantasy books to have hit book shelves.My favorite part of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is during the end when there is a big battle for who will win the land of Narnia The White Witch or Aslan, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This part took alot of imagination, and it really helps you picture the war in your head. As Aslan revivies from the brutal killing ceremony from The White Witch Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund are surprised to see that Aslan is still alive. This part of the story showed that you can never die, your body may die but your soul lives on. Aslan's role in this part of the story is very strong, you can feel that C.S. Lewis is trying to send you messages in a fantasy book, while your using your imagination and thinking of how the story is going on in your head."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I like it .and I think this good and useful.And i find it online by myself .really really really good"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia, what can I say, they are all great.

I found this book was a great fantasy and a book I could read with ease. I felt that C.S. Lewis came up with a very interesting plot that most readers can enjoy. I loved the setting descriptions, the characters, and overall plot. However, I feel this book suits a younger audience. The simple diction and context made the book seem of lower level reading, certainly not of my age group.There is a definite religious theme throughout the book that C.S. Lewis is trying to get across to his readers. He uses the Christian faith and Jesus Christ constantly throughout the book. He uses the main characters to represent religious figures in the bible. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in which Aslan dies and rises from the dead. The White Witch symbolizes Satan with her evil ways and treatment of the animals and people. The children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy represent Jesus' disciples as the follow and love Aslan who represents Jesus Christ. Some might find this use of religion as an annoyance, but being a Christ follower, I actually liked these references and loved the connection that was portrayed between the characters in the book and the biblical figures of the bible.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, despite it being a little too young for my liking.

I decided that the only place where wonderful, magical things happened was in England. Only in England could characters like the White Witch, Aslan and Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund have exciting, magical adventures. Even now at 27, I still have this child-like fantasy that England is a magical place filled with the possibility of adventure and excitement. This wonderful book is enjoyable for all ages.

I am writing this mini-review in &quot;The Lion&quot; section of Amazon rather than the &quot;Magician's Nephew&quot; section because I absolutely agree with the other readers who maintain that the original order of the books is the right and proper order in which to read them. The surprises that come and are explained in &quot;The Magician's Nephew,&quot; for example, are absolutely delightful when read as Book 6; as Book 1, they have little resonance or meaning. By all means ignore the new a! nd &quot;improved&quot; order that the dolts at Harper Collins have imposed. These are some of the best fantasy works that I've ever read, and it's a little embarrassing that I waited so long to discover them. I think my personal favorite of the series is &quot;The Voyage of the Dawntreader,&quot; but each book has so many exciting and memorable events and characters. I think I'm ready for the &quot;Perelandra&quot; trilogy now!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This book is a very good book.

After learning that the two will be meeting, the four children go off on a daring and magical adventure to meet Asland and to track down the White Witch.

For example, Aslan, the lion, is Jesus, and the Witch is Satan. The story is perfect for children because through the course of the novel, the character Edmund discovers that being on the side of good is better than turning to evil.

The story's about a family of four young Londoners being sent away by their parents to the countryside mansion of a professor to escape the German bombing of London. Soon after arriving at the mansion,Lucy (one of the children) discovers a magical wardrobe that leads to a place called Narnia. She convinces the other three (Edmund, Susan, and Peter) to come with her, and from there their adventures start. The story begins at the Professor's mansion. While exploring the mansion during a Hide-and Seek game, Lucy finds a spare room with a wardrobe in it. She goes into it, finds another world, (Narnia) and meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun who lives in Narnia. After leaving Narnia, she goes back to the real world and after a lot of trouble, convinces the others to come, too. Upon arrival, they learn that there's an evil witch controlling Narnia with eternal winter, and that she's ransacked Mr. Tumnus's house because she let Lucy escape. They make their way to a beaver dam, and learn from Mr. and Mrs. Beaver that the true king of Narnia, a lion named Aslan, has returned to depose the White Witch and restore spring. With the beavers, they set out to reach Aslan. they learn that a prophecy says that they four must fill the four thrones at a castle called Cair Paravel and rule Narnia, but all four must be there and they need Aslan's help to depose the white witch. That's more, Edmund had already seen the \\"Queen\\" and snuck away from the beaver's dam to alert her. He quickly realizes his bad choice, and wants to reunite with his siblings. Will they reunite with each other and Aslan to depose the Witch?

So now the children must go along with a army of talking animals, spirits, and trees, along with the leader of Narnia, Aslan the lion, to defeat the White Witch.I just love C.S Lewis's style of writing.

It's not the best, but really is the most memorable. Here you are introduced to the four Pevensie children- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Lucy, the youngest, ventures into a wardrobe at her eccentric relative's house and finds herself in a different world- Narnia, home of the evil White Witch and the mythical Lion Aslan.Nowadays you could dismiss this book as one-dimensional and predictable- yes, good triumphs over evil, there's a bit of forgiven betrayal, and a child's dream comes true. But Narnia is completely unique, because it was CS Lewis that came up with this other world idea, and it was from his Narnia books that all the others were spun off of.Narnia reads like a fairytale. Lucy is sweet, Susan is mature, Peter is a warrior, Edmund is an oddball that goes through random personalities changes. Aslan is faultless, the Witch is cruel. But all that is where the magic comes from. Somehow these characters all work and are believable and readable. You are surprised and hooked till the end.Despite Lewis's awkward dialogue, his obvious love for the word \\"presently\\" and dragging descriptions, these books are classics, to be read over and over. As I've said, every time you read them you understand a bit more."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Ages 12 and up.

This book deals with courage in many different ways as Peter (the eldest of the four)overcomes many obstacles throughout the course of this magical novel."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Chronicles of NarniaThe Lion, The Witch, and The WardrobeZach ThomassonThe book that I read for the fourth quarter project is called The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. It was written by C.S. Lewis, who has written many great books.The book is mainly about four kids who live in England at the time of World War II. Their mother sends them off to an estate to live with someone while the war is going on. Since the day they got there was raining, they went to go and play hide-and-go seek. Lucy, who was the youngest, went to this secret room with a magical wardrobe in it. She went inside it and kept going back until she found she was in a forest. This magical place was called Narnia. Then she saw a light post and met a faun, which was a mixture of two animals. The faun took her back to his place to have tea and to kidnap her. But this faun was good so instead of kidnapping her, he took her back to the light post so she could get home. Then Edmund, who was her brother, followed her into the forest. But he went the wrong way and met up with the evil White Witch. He told them about his family and went back home. One time they were playing and they heard footsteps so they went to the wardrobe room. they went in and found themselves in a snowy forest. When they saw talking beavers, they went to the beaver's house for dinner. When they were talking, Edmund snuck out and went to the White Witches house. She took him prisoner because he didn't bring his family with him. So the rest of the book is about them finding Edmund and getting into a big war against the White Witch. And of course they win the war.The four main characters are Peter who is the oldest, Susan who is the second oldest, Edmund who is the third oldest, and Lucy who is the youngest. Peter is a smart guy and despises his brother because of his attitude toward all of them. Susan is very smart knows how to solve problems between her family. Edmund you can almost say is very bad. He acts like that because he is afraid that his dad will die in the war. Lucy is a person with many freckles and a nice personality.I think the theme of this book is good vs. evil. In the war it is the axis powers who are evil vs. the allied powers who were the good. The when they reach Narnia, it is the White Witch who is evil and Aslan the mighty lion and his side that is good.I really liked this book for many reasons. One it is filled with adventure and is just a great book. Two it has many different characters that seem very cool. Three the good guys win and the four children become the kings and queens of Narnia. I think you should read this book too."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"A world of fantasy that leads the reader to the victory of good over evil, C.S. Lewis has written an enjoyable children's story that allures to the Christian religion. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor in a huge old house. Inside a wardrobe in one of the many rooms is a passageway to the world of Narnia where mythical creatures live alongside the mundane animals. However, in Narnia the White Witch has placed a spell on the land so that it is \\"always winter and never Christmas.\\" The four children travel with friendly beavers to meet Aslan, the great lion who can defeat the White Witch. He leads them to fight the Witch's allies to restore the beauty and goodness of Narnia.The events and characters in the novel take everyone back to childhood dreams of unicorns, talking animals, and glorious victories. The reader becomes captivated by the plight of the four children and their quest to save Narnia. The children are alluring because of their innocence. The clear line between good and evil aids the flow and understanding of the story. The imagery describing Aslan captivates the reader, creating a mysterious character who is kind yet fearsome and who cares for all the people. This imagery draws the reader to love Aslan just as much as the children love him. The clear distinction between the awesome goodness of Aslan and the evil treachery of the Witch fuels the reader's desire to learn of Narnia's fate. The fate of the creatures the White Witch has turned to stone also keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat. The reader wishes to keep reading because of the foreshadowing of a great battle and the prophecy that the children will ascend to the throne of the Castle Paravel and defeat the Witch.The sentences seem awkward at time, but this is due to Lewis' writing style. He writes as if he is talking, relaying the story to a group of children. The wording is simplistic and there are quite a few moments where he recaps the story or explains mundane actions. This style is ideal for children because the explanatory comments help children to better understand the story, and it helps adults to remember what occurred earlier in the novel. C.S. Lewis switches between a narrative of the Witch's actions and Aslan's actions throughout the middle section of the novel. Lewis will break one story at a climax point and return to the other which causes the reader to continue in order to discover the answers to the questions in the last chapter.C.S. Lewis continuously alludes to the Bible, making the story a great study for Christian groups. The name Peter connects the apostle, the head of the Church, to the boy whom Aslan trusts to head the battle against the evil White Witch. Edmund, the youngest boy is related to Judas. Edmund meets the White Witch and is taken in by her magic. Just as Judas was enchanted by the allure of money, Edmund betrays the whereabouts of his siblings and Aslan while under the spell of the White Witch. However, Aslan frees Edmund. Edmund repents and is forgiven, just as Judas would have been had he not killed himself. Also, the many prophesies throughout the novel allure to the prophesies in the Old Testament about Jesus' life and death. The connections continue, but would give away the rest of the story.Lewis' novel is a great read for all people because of its adventure and mystery. The courageous children's fight to save Narnia is a childhood dream come true. All will fall in love with this novel. It is not just a book for Christians, but it is a book for all longing for adventure in mystical lands."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Lewis is amazing in many respects, one of the reasons is his ability to adapt to his audience that he is writing to. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an amazing extension of who Lewis was. The book itself is seamless and flows from beginning to end. Lewis creates characters that are real and fun, leaving you able to become involved with the story.Aslan is a great hero, evoking a strong and protective, just and right lion who is the people's champion. Throw in the evil white witch and some naive Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve and you have a tale worth reading. The ending is very clever (especially since Lewis foreshadowed it) as Aslan brings an army to the battlefield.Don't get me wrong. Lewis says it in his opening acknowledgment. This is a fairy tale meant for children, or for an adult willing to sit down and enjoy a fairy tale, for that is what it is. Don't mistake this for a full blown fantasy series and book. The descriptions are short and concise, the characters are black and white, and the outcome is fun. That being said, there is no reason why this book, or series, cannot be enjoyed by an adult. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially to be read before the movie."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"C.S. Lewis really did a great job in creating a world known as Narnia. A little background on Narnia: Narnia is a place stuck in a winter that is never ending, it is \\"ruled\\" by the White Witch. There is only winter and no Christmas. There are many, many creatures in the land of Narnia.The book starts when 4 kids are shipped to a professors mansion during the times of WWII. They are told not to disturb the professor. They pretty much have the huge house to themselves, so there is much mischief that they can get into. Well Lucy, the youngest of the 4 one day stumbles upon a wardrobe. She enters into it, but there is not a back to the wardrobe and it leads to Narnia. She meets a creature called a Faun. He is actually a creature that is supposed to be telling the White Witch that a human entered Narnia.She gets back and her brothers and sisters don't believe her. Nevertheless later in the book they all end up in Narnia, and are stunned that Lucy had been telling the truth the whole time.The meet many creatures along the way. They meet with a Beaver and his wife and they are told of the White Witch, Aslan (a lion who the White Witch fears), and the prophecy that they would be fulfilling.Well one of the four, Edmund takes off after the White Witches palace, because they had meet before and she gave him something to eat.Aslan ends up putting down his life for Edmund after he supposedly betrays the White Witch. This is a parallel to Jesus Christ. Many other Christian thems take place after this, and I don't want to reveal them for they are amazing.Note that this book is highly recommended by me. It has a ton of Christian themes, and it takes you to a fantasy land that is amazing to me.

Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic book that combines great story telling and charming style while engrossing readers in an intriguing mythical world. Though it is numbered as book two in The Chronicles of Narnia series, C.S. Lewis wrote it first and therefore meant it to be read before book one, for it introduces the world of Narnia and launches readers on the beginning of an exciting journey leaving you wanting more. Though the style of writing and almost non-existent use of difficult vocabulary ostensibly targets the book toward a younger audience, fans of all ages can enjoy this timeless classic, and perhaps older audiences will grasp the deeper underlying message.The book begins with the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, being sent to live in a mansion with a fabulously rich, mysterious, and old professor because of the German air raids in London during World War II. While the four kids explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, first stumbles upon the doorway to the world of Narnia-an ancient and gigantic wardrobe. Eventually, all the children go through the wardrobe together, and they begin their adventures in Narnia. It is there we see two distinct sides of good and evil: the White Witch and her minions and those for Aslan the lion. The White Witch has spread an ethereal winter that has lasted for over one hundred years, and it is only the coming of Aslan that this winter spell can be broken and the White Witch defeated.C.S. Lewis brings a wealth of intriguing and interesting characters into his book. Upon meeting the characters of Narnia-mostly various animals-you become automatically attached to them. There are by no means \\"fuzzy little cute things\\" you would expect a children's book to have, but noble, smart, wise, and humanlike. Animal lovers of all sorts will enjoy this book that much more, as will mythical creature buffs. C.S. Lewis also brings in centaurs, unicorns, dryads, and naiads among others into the story, along with numerous evil creatures such as wraiths, ogres, and many other things that I will not mention here.The plot of the book is engaging and relentless. I found it almost impossible to put down the novel at the end of each chapter, a cruel but effective ploy to grasp the reader's attention throughout the book. The first initial peeks into Narnia leaves you wanting more, and upon permanently entering there, you are just as eager as the four children to explore and find out more about the strange, mysterious, but beautiful new world.I highly recommend this book to any fan of fiction. Readers will never forget the magic of entering into the world of Narnia for the first time and the wonder that it instills. This book incorporates everything that an epic novel should have. It successfully pulls you into a magical world that is totally believable, provides engaging characters and events, and captivates big and small audiences from start to finish. There is no doubt that children and adults alike will enjoy this book, and just like the Pevensie children, will leave Narnia hoping only to come back again."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe is a book about four kids in the 1940's. The youngest sibling, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that houses a magical land that was cast under a spell by the Evil White Witch. With the help of Aslan the lion and Lucy's 3 brothers and sisters, Peter, Mary, and Edmund they must return the magical land of Narnia to the way it originally was.The most exciting part of the book was during the climax. During the climax there are fights and celebrations. During the fighting Aslan leads his magical army into battle with the four children by his side. Mary and Peter are able to fight with their gifts from St. Nick, Peter had recieved a sword and sheild while Mary had a bow and quiver. Lucy acted as a nurse for all the wounded soldiers. Towards the end of the book Aslan prevails and the four children are crowned Kings and Queens. Finally, after many years later they find the wardrobe and return to their house they were at in the 1940's a few seconds from which the originally left that house to go to Narnia.The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an amasing book, that is why I recommend it. The action through the climax is enough to get any action lover to read it. Even people who like fairy tales will love the ending. The book will also help younger children know that not everyone is as good as they think they are. It can also help other people think that their might be other livible worlds out there"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"A PR man recently lamented that the movie of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was not being sold with the pitch, \\"See the Bible come alive!\\" But while Christian elements appear in various guises throughout C. S. Lewis's \\"Chronicles\\" you may search both Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the wealth of extracanonical writings BC and AD and find nothing about Narnia.This first installment was published in 1950 with the subtitle \\"A Story for Children,\\" and in his dedication Lewis calls it a \\"fairy tale\\": it is set during World War II, when many London children were sent away in hopes of finding safe in the countryside. In addition to the usual fairy tale contingent of a wicked witch of great powers, trolls and ogres and werewolves, Lewis has added the naiads and dryads, fauns and centaurs from Greek and Latin myth, as befits a classics professor, plus Father Christmas. When Aslan, the great Lion, is first mentioned one-third of the way through, his status as a Christ figure will be unmistakable---to any adult. But how many children of eight or ten---the premium age to enter Narnia---will recognize allusions to the Agony in the Garden, or interpret the sacrifice of Aslan at the Stone Table by the White Witch as the Crucifixion, or his return as the Resurrection? (The \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" plus \\"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time\\" are tough doctrinal nuts to crack at a young age; I never understood them at the time, and now their arbitrary nature---to provide a rationale for the plot---rather sticks out.) Aslan's trials and triumphs are much sweeter than the Passion Story, which is shot through with a larger sadder view of human nature and destiny.The vivid pacing and emotional charge of Lewis's narrative bears all before it: one is swept along. What one recalls in after-years are images from high fantasy: the lamppost visible from the depths of the wardrobe, which shows one is leaving this world for Narnia; the Dwarf handing Edward the Witch's steaming tempting brew; her castleful of stone creatures being turned back to flesh by Aslan's breath. This is due in no small part to Pauline Baynes's witty, elegant, endearing illustrations, which are as much a part of Narnia as Tenniel's are of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World, or Louise Fitzhugh's of Harriet the Spy's beat.\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" bear the imprint of the time when they were written, and the author who wrote them, as every book does; but where Harry Potter finds most of his adherents in readers near his own age, and Tolkien's Middle Earth calls out to young and middle-aged and old alike, for what they can bring to it, Lewis was right---these are stories for children. As I reread them today, I see the boy I was when I first read them; for as an adult one can revisit, reappraise, and criticize, but one cannot recapture Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This is probably my favorite book in the Narnia series, because I did read it first in the series as a child and it stuck with me. What always gets me, for some reason, is when the character Edmund indulges in some enchanted Turkish Delight. One of my favorite parts in the book, maybe because of my sweet tooth.This novel features Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go through a magic wardrobe and enter Narnia, caught in an eternal frost. The children in turn encounter fauns, a witch as icy as the environment she has created, and a golden lion, not to mention talking beavers, giants, and Father Christmas. Edmund learns important lessons in the ethics of betrayal, or lack thereof, so to speak. Peter, Susan, and Lucy all find courage within themselves through battle and the wise words of Aslan, the golden lion.The Christian allegory in this book is somewhat stronger than in the others, due to the death and resurrection of Aslan, but as a semi-Kabbalist/former Christian/former semi-Wiccan, I have to say I do know about religion and this scence is more magic at work than the power of a god or gods. So, whatever religion you are, just be open-minded while reading this novel, and I think you will be able to see it for the extraordinarily crafted fantasy it truly is.See you after I read the next novel, for those following my review trail !"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Four kids find a magical world called Narnia.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"The lion the witch and the warcrobe is a wonderful book.

It describes the process like a paper catching on fire,and I could see the process in my head.While the book starts out slow,it is worth the effert to keep on reading.

One day they were playing hide-and-seek and Lucy decides to hide in a wardrobe. She finds that the wardrobe has no back. She walks through and finds herself in the land of Narnia where it is always Winter and never Christmas.

The first book in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful tale of four siblings who live during WWII. The four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves living with their Uncle whom they have never met. While playing an innocent game of hide and seek, Lucy, the youngest of the four stumbles into a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe enters into a place called Narnia where it is never Christmas and always winter, animals talk, and an evil witch rules over the land. Lucy, her older sister and her two older brothers will enter Narnia and be known to the animals and magical people as the \\"sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. The four learn that they have entered a world where evil has thrived and good has been forgotten. Until, they hear of a savior, a king, a lion named Aslan. The four must save the kingdom, fight evil and restore good.This first book is only the beginning of many adventures the four children will have in the land of Narnia. My promise is that if you read the first book, you will be hooked! C.S.

It's a classic that never gets old!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I love how C.S. Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity, perhaps C.S. Lewis's most famous apologetic work, to also support the idea that Narnia exists.Lucy must either be a liar, mad, or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic. Clearly, there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus, lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.This writing is very much secretly evangelistic, but probably not in a way most people would expect. I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story, and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic, it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon, but the witness of a fairytale presented to me. It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord, liar or lunatic, but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar, lunatic or telling the truth. But, as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story, most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale. That is, they are neither telling the truth, lying, or insane, but that they are just plain honestly mistaken. When someone tells me that if I don't believe in a fairytale, such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment, I won't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place. Strangely, C.S. Lewis seems to support that idea as upright, such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity, even if it be lies, is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.Of course, Jesus was a real person, but anything beyond that is anyone's guess, and as mysterious as Narnia itself. Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict. Christianity says that Jesus is Lord. Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist. And, Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed. Therefore, what is to be made of this man's story is anybody's guess. Absurdly, most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife. That much I am unable to accept."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Just re-read this last week to my boys (4 and 6), and what a relief it is to read something that's been written with real care and a sense of style.

What makes a book good is detail, and that is exactly what C.S. Lewis did. All hail Aslan!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", to be quite honest, is my least favorite of the Narnia books. While it is the most well known book in the Narnia series and seems to receive the most adaptations, for this reader it is also the weakest. While my personal prejudice against the book may seem unjustified, I will go into detail on why it is this book does the least of all the books for me. However, do not think that I despise the book. Some of the individual scenes are my favorite in the series, including the meeting of Tumnas and Lucy and much of the actual world of Narnia. The scene with the professor stands out as well, as do others, including Edmond and the scene with the White Witch and her devilish Turkish Delight.The chief fault I have with this is the overly explicit Christianity in this book. The Chronicles represent very fundamental Christian faerie tales, and generally Lewis embodies Christianity with a very good story. For me, however, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" ceases to be good story and just mere allegory. I think of the Chronicles as something of magic themselves, and the spell of the series are the excellent stories that also have great Christian truths. The death of Aslan for the sake of Edmond totally ruins this spell for me. Again, this is personal taste.To best describe what I'm talking about, I will give you my personal view on why the series itself is good. Lewis, while always writing from the Christian standpoint, keeps first and foremost the story in mind. Christianity underlies it all, but the most important element is the story itself. Readers do not like to be preached at. If you tell a good story that has exhibits various elements of Christianity as its theme but keep the story original, that is a good faerie tale. Here, Lewis starts that and then stops that at the end and has Aslan die for Edmond. It would have been fine had the parallel not been so blatantly obvious. For me, it makes me lose focus of the story and concentrate on the Christianity solely. Still, it's like Lewis decides to make it very explicit what he is talking about instead of sticking to the less obvious.Another element that alienates this book from me is the inclusion of Father Christmas. I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but for some reason he does not sit well with me. We have this beautiful new world of Narnia, and here it's always winter and never Christmas. Why would they have Christmas in the first place? Again, I understand Father Christmas can represent the Holy Spirit, etc, and put it on the level that children will definitely relate too, but even when I was little I had an immediate dislike to this inclusion in the story.While the slain god myth is an essential archetype, it just does not work for me in this story. I would have rather Lewis come up with a more ingenuity and have a different way for Aslan to redeem him. How is the ultimate question. But he did do this with Eustace in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\". While that may seem to be a rather harsh reaction to the opening book of the Narnia series, it was my initial reaction, and when rereading it, I am still of this opinion. Again, I recognize this is personal taste, and \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is certainly deserving of its acclaim.For myself, the explicit Christianity ruins the otherwise flawless faerie tale atmosphere Lewis creates in this tale. Lewis does not violate my own personal aesthetics of endowing a story with Christianity without making the story seem bogged down with Christian elements in the series again with the exception of \\"Dawn Treader:. Every other story in the series the Christian themes but does not, in the end, breaking the spell of the faerie tale. It just feels like in LWW he starts preaching at us. But what do I know. It is probably the most popular of the seven books.\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", a book I very dearly love, only breaks the spell at the very end and only as part of a comment from Aslan to the children. While certainly Christianity (i.e., a relationship with God) is the most important thing, for myself it brings down the story when Lewis has Aslan say that he brought the children to Narnia so that they may know him better in their own world. I guess it is meant to give hope to the children reading it that they will one day know Aslan, and it is certainly a worthy inclusion for the book, but I still feel, when I read it, that that is a little to explicit for me. The story ceases to be story and becomes just regular Christian doctrine, and while certainly we need Christian doctrine a story should be, first and foremost, a story. However, Lewis's intent besides the story was to win souls to Christ, and if Narnia help does that, then ultimately that is more important than trivial literary concerns.You can tell this is the first one he wrote and that originally there was no thought of a series. There are several contradictions in between this and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", which include the ancestry of the White Witch and the belief that there have been no human beings in this world. Originally Lewis tried to stay true to this premise but Roger Lancelyn Green told him cut this long scene between a ploughman and his wife in another world and Lewis took his advice and instead went with this concepts. Another case of this not being originally intended as a series is when asked about the story from Coriakin's book, Lucy is spoken of in the present tense, indicating she is still alive. Even Prince Caspian adheres to the original concept of the idea that there were no humans in Narnia at the beginning. Another element that, although working in the self-contained book that Lewis originally meant LWW to be, seems rather awkward to this reader is the professor. He is never named in LWW, but is so in MN. Father Christmas doesn't seem to fit either.This passage from \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" where White Witch is demanding the life of Edmund because he has betrayed the children and Aslan to the White Witch is one of Lewis's most overt allusions to Christianity in the series. Aslan makes the sacrifice. This also illustrates the fact that evil was not there in the beginning. The White Witch did not know the great magic from before the world's foundation. There were rules and ordinances that were not made known to the angels. Pride also blinds, because when Satan fell, he thought the crucifixition would truly solve the problem with Christ and his ministries. Jadis also thought this as well, that she would triumph in the end. Both were proud and glorified in their evil. Their belief is placed in the wrong deity.Lewis uses the colour white in the cold, wintery sense rather than white symbolising purity. The White Witch has put Narnia in a spell, freezing Aslan's land into a continuos winter than cannot be broken until two kings and two queens from the human race come to seat at Cair Paravel. The white is sickening and represents the cruelty. Ironically, Lewis reckons her colour as that of salt, which precisely what she is not. Salt is a natural preservative and adds flavour to the food, but the White Witch only ruins and destroys and perverts. Jadis, who also appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\", uses the natural colour perverts it into the evil. Green often has been associated with the spring time. In \\"The Silver Chair\\", we find her as the Green Lady. She directs the children and Puddleglum to the giants of Harfang. Here, she appears to be a rather mysterious woman, but she shows her true colours in the Underworld. Jadis, just as she used the white as a perverted colour, here she uses green in her underground kingdom, because here that colour will never come. Spring cannot come to the Underworld, and if her plans would go through, she, like she did in Charn, would destory the world. Green, that vibrant colour of life, is chosen by her to mock spring.Although the winter is an unnatural one, the attitude the characters show for it is part of the pathetic fallacy. From Wikipedia: \\"The pathetic fallacy is the treatment of inanimate objects as if they had human feelings, thought, or sensations. The word 'pathetic' in this use is related to 'pathos' or 'empathy' (capability of feeling), and is not pejorative. In the discussion of literature, the pathetic fallacy is similar to personification.\\" When spring comes to Narnia, they all rejoice for the characters feel so much happier now that the winter is lifting. This also occurs in The Silver Chair with Scrubb and Pole. Jill thinks of the edge as being horrible simply because it is high, which is quite an odd attitude to take. If, by your very nature, you are skilled in mathematics and another person is not and they say. You are black or white or yellow or whatever, this colour has nothing to do with what you are like as a person. If the water is cold and someone says they love water when it is cold because it is so good, but it is bad when it is hot, that is pathetic fallacy. Cliffs are not bad or good - they're just cliffs and that is all.Although a worthwhile book, as I've explained I like the other Narnia novels much better than this one. Tolkien likewise did not like this book for many of the same reasons. He once wrote to a correspondent George Sayer, saying \\"It is sad that 'Narnia' and all that part of C.S.L.'s work should remain outside the range of my sympathy, as much of my work was outside his.\\" Tolkien thought the mixture of various fairy tale motifs quite absurd. Obviously the reading public has adored these books, and they are established literary classics, so if you haven't read LWW, give it a chance. You may have a completely different view than myself and just love the work. For myself, the other Narnia novels are so much better...------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complications if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomaly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"This classic is an enjoyable read.

This book is the hero's journeyThe Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell). Some would say this is for children. Well, ok, I read it in high school, actually all of the Narnia books. But it has deeper layers of meaning. The 4 children are the 4 directions, and the four alchemical elements, and Jung's 4 archetypes, from which we get Meyers Briggs. It's a good story, with good characters. It's a masterpiece of its genre."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"My father used to read me and my siblings this book while we were little. Everyone got to be one of the charchters in the story. I was Edmund (although I'm a girl). While reading this book I kept pretending that my family was in the story. I was able to say to my siblings \\"That's you,\\" or \\"You're that one,\\" I enjoyed connecting to this book since it was quite similar to my family.The thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of connection between this book and the Magician's Nephew. The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was. I think Aslan should have said something about the beginning of Narnia, Digory, or Polly from the other book.Overall, I wasn't able to give this book five stars because it didn't appeal to me as much as other books like Harry Potter did.

They were sent to an old professor's house because of the air raids in London. On one cold, rainy day, the children decided to explore the house. The came into a rather empty room, only filled with a very large wardrobe. They saw that nothing of interest was there, so they left, except for Lucy. She wanted to open the door to the wardrobe and stepped inside. What she found inside was not just the back of the wardrobe but an entire wood all covered in snow. While walking a little through the forest, she met a faun named Mr. Tumnus. He brought her to a den in which he was about to turn her in to the white which, who was making all of Narnia, the world Lucy had came in, winter with no Christmas. Mr. Tumnus realized he had to let her go and help her escape. When she returned to the wardrobe, it wasn't even a second after she had left. One other day, the children decided to play hide-and-seek. Lucy went almost directly to the wardrobe room. Just as she stepped in, Edmund saw her go in and decided to follow and tease her, when he found himself also in Narnia. There he met the White Witch. He gave him some food and drink and told him to bring his siblings to her house. When the White Witch left, Lucy found Edmund and they both went back to the wardrobe room. When Lucy told Peter and Susan that Edmund had gotten in too, Edmund said that he had been playing and pretending with Lucy. The house in which the professor lives in, is one of those houses in which many sightseers came to look at. One day, a whole group of them were there with Mrs. Macready. So all the children went into the wardrobe room and hid in the wardrobe and backed up until all the children ended up in Narnia. They had decided to go visit Mr. Tumnus when they found his house had been destroyed and Mr. Tumnus pulled off to prison. Outside, they saw Mr. Beaver who led them to his home on a frozen river. There Mrs. Beaver and Mr. Beaver told the four children the entire prophecy, when suddenly they had realized that Edmund had gone. Mr. Beaver said they had to leave right away for Aslan at the stone table because the White Witch had gotten Edmund to betray them. At the Stone Table, Aslan and his entire army had gotten ready for a great war. Aslan sent a party of centaurs to chase after a wolf at their camp. This wolf lead them to the White Witch's camp and they were able to bring back Edmund. A couple of days later, their armies clashed. Aslan had went to the White Witch's Castle to revive all those that she had turned to stone. With those extra reinforcements they were able to win the battle. Peter was crowned high king, and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy became king and queens.I really enjoyed this book because it was almost impossible to put down. The description made it feel like you were actually there and could feel what they were feeling and experience what they were experiencing. For example, this sentence made me feel like a picture was elaborately painted in my mind,\\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That made me feel probably just as those Pevensie children felt when they saw it.There was nothing in general about this book that I didn't enjoy. Nothing except in one moment when Edmund lied that he hadn't been in Narnia. I felt extremely sorry for Lucy. If I were her I probably would have shouted at Edmund for lying and being beastly. Despite that one moment, the story was really great. The best moment was probably when Aslan revived the lion. The description was just beautiful. \\"Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back-then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame lick all over a bit of paper-then, while his hindquearters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds ripple into living hair.\\" Reading that description was just impossible to describe with words."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY ADVENTURES WHEN FOUR KIDS PETER,EDMUND,SUSAN,AND LUCY FIND THE MAGICAL LAND OF NARNIA.ESPESILY WHEN ASLAN {GOD} CAME AND THEN EVERY GOOD PERSON FELT CONFIDENT OF DEFETING THE WHITE WHITCH.LUCY WAS AMAZED TO FIND MR.TUMNUS.THEN EDMUND FOUND THE WHITE WHITCH AND HAD ENCHANTED TURKISH DELIGHT WHICH HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO HAVE SOME MORE.THEN THE WHITE WHITCH TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE SOME MORE AFTER HE BRINGS HER HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO HER.AFTER HUGE BATTLES THEY FINALY KILL HER AND ARE NAMED KING AND QUEEN OF NARNIA."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"Although I have only read two NARNIA books, (LION &amp; MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW), I am sure LION is (one of?) Narnia's best.(It), even though (it was) written before MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, fills in the holes from the prequel, as well as creating a new vivid and enchantingly entertaining story of it's own.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MAGICAL STORY, HERE'S YOUR SERIES!The order the plubisher put them in after Lewis wrote them is as follows, although I'm not sure I spelled everything correctly:#1 THE MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW #2 THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE #3 THE HORSE AND HIS BOY #4 PRINCE CASPAN #5 THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER #6 THE SILVER CHAIR #7 THE LAST BATTLEThe star charecter of the books, I can tell, is easily Aslan, and his bravery in LION was stunning! LION is a true favorite, a treasure, and a classic.I believe the easiest way to read them all is by buying THE COMPLETE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (a 500+ page book including the full text of ALL SEVEN Narnia novels), or by buying the boxed set (either in hardcover of paperback.) Either way, enjoy LION and the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie-in Edition (The Chronicles of Narnia)","review":"I read this in three days. The fastest I've ever read a book I think. Of course, I didn't have much else to do though, so that might be a factor.Still, the book was very enjoyable, especially since I'm not into all of this mythological stuff. I especially like the lamp-post at the end of the world concept.This book is very descriptive, which I guess is an essential element to the success of a book. It gives you a sense that the author is actually there and just reporting what happens. He mentions everything, even how one of the kids during a long journey watches a beaver's feet plod along through the snow, as if in a trance. Minor details like that seem to confirm the author was really there. Great for fiction. I think the Harry Potter books are like that too.I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this book has Santa Claus in it, which I personally thought was kind of lame, but oh well.This isn't my favorite book ever, but it's fun to read. I don't think I'll get the other Narnia books, but I've got nothing against them. They're good stuff. I only got this book because I recognized the book cover. I believe I saw it when I was a little kid. These books must have been popular for the past 50 years. I think Mel Gibson is due to make this particular book into a movie this Christmas, but I'm not sure.I used to think books were always better than movies, because seeing a movie every week cost a lot more than reading books for a hobby. Now I'm not so sure. This one cost me seven bucks, and I finished it in less than a week. Now I think good books are good, and good movies are good, but neither books or movies are better overall.I've noticed that my reviews have been getting poor ratings as of late, so I don't think I'll write as many now. I'll have to find something more productive. Like reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland again. That's a great book to read by the way.

It's great for little kids."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"If there's one positive thing I can muster about Al Sarrantonio's \\"Hallows Eve,\\" it's that he conjurs atmosphere beautifully. Like other reviewers have noted, Sarrantonio truly knows how to capture the essence of our darkest and most rustic holiday. The spirit of Halloween is readily apparent in this book; it practically clings to every page as Sarrantonio sketches a refreshingly macabre, yet strangely picturesque, portrait of smalltown Americana amidst the cold Autumn chill of Samhain. Reading this book I could practically *smell* the candy corn and hear the rustling of the cornstalks as they emanated from the page. So, based on that aspect alone, I would recommend this book.Unfortunately, the novel is saddled with a dull, contrived supernatural plotline that Sarrantonio must have dug up from a cobweb-covered box of CLICHES. Of course there's the emotionally scarred hero, returning to his hometown of Orangefield for the first time since something really bad happened to him as a youngster. There's the good-hearted but skeptical cop who gets caught up in the action, and the innocent little girl who holds the key to the mystery. And then there's a helpful wraith, disguised as a scarecrow, who pops up at random intervals to provide needless exposition for the audience.Now, overused plot I could've dealt with, but the main problem with \\"Hallows Eve\\" is the simple fact that Sarrantonio doesn't have the talent to bring even this story justice. He may be great at writing atmosphere, but when it comes to characterization he's at a total loss. The heroes are one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the villains are just as bad. Samhain, the Grim Reaper-like spirit that serves as the book's Darth Vader to Corrie Phaeder's Luke Skywalker, is about as menacing as a seventy-year old substitute with a hearing aid and liver spots. And the book is littered with utterly bland dialogue: In one scene, as the cop is hiding in the attic from a swarm of undead spectres, Sarrantonio cheekily writes \\" . . . he sat in an attic gaurding [Corrie and Regina] from an army of evil pumpkin men and the Lord of Death because someone who claimed to be dead made out of corn stalks with a smiling pumpkin for a head told him to.\\" Yuck. Another howler is when Corrie, wondering in some alternate dimension ruled over by the evil one, thinks to himself that \\"If this was the Kingdom that Samhain ruled, Corrie felt almost sorry for him.\\" Bland, bland, bland!But still, it's an entertaining read if you're in the right mood. The right atmospherics would certainly do it justice; reading this on your front porch in the middle of Fall, amidst the blowing leaves, a nice hot cup of cider in your hand, you could very well fall under the spell of this quirky little book. It's by no means a great novel, and I wouldn't really claim that Al Sarrantonio is the \\"...very talented writer\\" that the Washington Post claims him to be, but it's worth a look nonetheless."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"This book to me was a fast and fun read. The way this guy describes The halloween season is fantastic. It's a also a great story and cool concept. A must for fans who want a good read for Halloween."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"I have always had a soft spot for Halloween in my heart, and even though I haven't read the prequel, Orangefield, I still enjoyed this story. Sarrantonio sucked me into his tale of the whimsical town that is known for its pumpkins. Halloween is the main event and celebration; everyone seems to prepare it all year round. This year however series of unexpected events reoccurs more often, and as we learn what caused them the tale grows chillier by each page. I loved the description of the festive mood, the corn husks under the shoes, warm winds, crisp harvested apples, pumpkin patches and town full of folklore.Corrie Phaeder is back home because suddenly his life fell apart back in California and he is mysteriously drawn back to the place where his mother died. He didn't want to be back in Orangefield, but power beyond him have directed him back home. Right of the bat, we meet John, a mysterious creature that seems to know everything Corrie dreams about and who foretells him about horrible things happening, while Halloween is two weeks away. He and a little girl, Reggie with the help of a local cop, Grant, try to solve the unnatural happenings while battling mythological evil that has spawned stories about Orangefield. The trouble is that the stories start to look more like truth and when everyone who tries to help Corrie seems to have a fatal \\"accident\\" he has nowhere to turn but John, but can he fully trust a strange creature that comes from another dimension?Sarrantonio did a great job writing phenomenal descriptions of matter that is not of this world, the shapes, colors, sounds, inflated bubbles, geometric forests, Technicolor waiting stations, ghouls, walking pumpkin men and dark clouds of destruction were really vividly pained and filled my head with images. I read this book in a very short amount of time, and it sure made me miss Halloween!I must say I enjoyed the ending! The story filled me in on what I missed in the first book, and if anything, it made it even more haunting and mysterious as the puzzles of mystifying deaths in the town were answered before my eyes. The ending itself reminded me of The Matrix. Life and death are all contained in this intangible nothingness that is yet full of color. I cannot do the writer justice as this is a good story, and it was a fun ride that a book reader should hop on."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"Al Sarrantonio writes the best halloween books of this generation. His Orangefield stories are a refreshing take on what could be a boring, seen it before tale in the horror genre. Sarrantonio never fails to entertain, and Hallows Eve is another winner.

The story starts off stronger than the predictable finish, but I found it solid nonetheless. As a writer, Sarrantonio has flavors reminiscent of T.M. Wright and Tom Piccirilli. The book is a very quick read, but I wanted Sarrantonio to push the envelope a little more."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I wouldn't go so far to call it anything like Ray Bradbury. I mean, come on, that's the guy who wrote timeless masterpieces that will never die.This is more a dark fantasy set in Sarrantonio's town of Orangefield, a kind of Halloween spookland where very weird things take place.Al Sarrantonio creats a dark Halloween world of death that is ruled by Samhain. Things from his world cross over into the present and make for an atmospheric tale of ghostly pumpkin men, strange murders, and another strange world you go to when you die.Sarrantonio did a good job including all the cool Halloween spooks and autumn wanderings, while still keeping with the main tale of Corrie Phaeder's decent into near madness at the hands of John, a supernatural being in the form of a scarecrow with the head of a pumpkin.I enjoyed this enough to read the other Orangfield books by Sarrantonio. And I would defintely recommend this to Halloween fans. I'm sure this could be read any time of the year, but I would suggest only reading it come autumn, or even better, on Halloween night in one sitting.Horrordude."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"Corrie is returning to his home town of Orangefield, the Pumpkin Capital of the World.

Even before he arrives in the town, he spots a pumpkin-headed scarecrow that gestures to him.Samhain, the Lord of the Dead, is making incursions into Orangefield. But Samhain is actually working for a more terrifying power. One that would like to see all life destroyed. Corrie and his abilities will be needed in some sort of battle to save the world come Halloween.Nicely plotted with interesting imagery and intelligent twists on Halloween and its symbols. A good read even if it isn't Halloween."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"Sarrantonio's best work channels the nasty lyricism of early Ray Bradbury (that is, Bradbury of the 1940's, before he got too mushy inside) into new and unexpected directions. It's an approach that seems to work better in short stories than in novels (which was also true of Bradbury's output), though this novel contains a lot of fascinating scenes and setpieces, along with one of the more idiosyncratic views of the Afterlife ever put on paper.A young man returns to Orangefield (the pumpkin capital of America), the small town he grew up in, ten years after he left. Orangefield is deeply weird, as in supernatural occurences every ten minutes weird -- it's like Stephen King's Castle Rock after several bong hits. The Celtic god of death and the harvest (what a job title!), Samhain, is working to let a much greater evil god into our universe. Our protagonist and a plucky little girl can stop this. Maybe. Weirdness ensues.The first half of the novel is weird and gripping; the second half seems a bit rushed and sketchy. Nonetheless, Sarrantonio takes chances with both plot twists and characterization here (not to mention the overall weirdness of the supernatural in this novel), giving us something other than the standard humanity vs. supernatural evil tropes that dominate horror fiction. This is part of a much larger story-and-novel cycle, though it stands pretty well on its own."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"I genuinely like the idea of making Samhein into a \\"real figure.\\" Quite original in the premise and very interesting version of limbo. :) Sarrantino does a fine job developing characters and making you care for them or not.

I had never heard of author All Sarrantonio but I figured I would give him a try, the book was on sale and I figured....\\"Why not\\"? The story begins with main character, Corey Phaeder, returning to his old \\"hometown\\" of Orangefield after a 10 year sojourn. Orangefield is an farm-area known for its pumpkin growing and its Halloween celebrations and Samhain sightings. Samhain is the god of the dead. As one may guess, Corey returns to his hometown to \\"face his fears\\" right around Halloween and the rest gets pretty predictable. Corey left after his mother was brutally murdered and Corey was one of the suspects. Corey meets a young girl, Reggie, in his neighborhood who befriends him and starts having the same bizarre hauntings that Corey had since he was 7 years old. Bill Grant, local sheriff, hates Corey and tried to pin Mrs. Phaeder's death on him....needless to say, the grudge still holds. As the horror of Orangefield unfolds, even Grant is witness to the life and death struggles between the Dark One and his world, as the Dark One's messenger, Samhain visits terrors upon him and he is visited by harbinger of doom, a pumpkin-headed scarecrow who refers to himselfas \\"John\\". Sarrantonio fleshes out characters-Corey and Grant but glosses over characters such as Reggie and others that needed expansion...BUT he is a good descriptive writer whose writing hopefully gets better with age....the story was by no means horrible, but it wasn't King either....but Sarrantonio DOES have potential and he hopefully uses it. The story is by no means stellar in its predictability, but it isn't a waste either. I read it through...and although the ending got a bit \\"weirded out\\" and switches from horror to fantasy fluff, it's not a bad read on the whole....I will definitely give Sarrantonio another read. Only \\"fair\\" Halloween fare....."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"All Hallow's Eve isn't anything new -- it's a twist on an old theme, concentrating too much on the practices of Halloween (which has been beaten to death already), while showing all it's cards up front. The villians are introduced way too fast, there's not enough mystery remaining, the characters aren't really latched on to, and the ending wasn't anything overly powerful. Still, All Hallow's Eve isn't too bad...it kept me reading, and that's saying something. If a novel is genuinely bad, I usually won't finish it. I finished this one, because it DID have some saving grace. One being the well written detective, another being morbid curiosity for the show down (although my expectations weren't that high), and another being that while the plot was disorganized and jumbled, it wasn't exactly dull."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"HALLOWS EVE isn't a badly written book, but the plot is nothing new and the characterization is relatively thin. The main character, Corrie, is not particularly likable or admirable (until the end, anyway). Many of the supporting characters are pretty negligible and easy to forget.The last third of HALLOWS EVE is more like a fantasy story than a horror tale. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this -- I actually liked this last part of the book a lot, much more than the first two thirds. But I felt the transition to the fantasy story to be kind of jarring, which hurt the overall flow of the book.Sarrantonio's a good writer, and does a good job creating the atmosphere of a small town. But I don't read books solely for mood and atmosphere; I instead want a good plot and characters I can relate to. I don't feel I really got that in this particular novel.HALLOW'S EVE is worth trying if you like your horror fantastic and surreal, in the vein of Ray Bradbury or TM Wright. If this doesn't appeal to you, my advice is to skip this one."},{"Title":"Hallows Eve","review":"After reading some of the reviews but mostly the 1 star reviews I had to jump in. I realize this book is out of print and was published 6 years ago but I still have to put my two cents in.Nobody in their reviews (especially the one star reviews) said anything about how poorly this book is written. Some have even said it was well written. I take issue with that. For example the protagonists are a twenty something year old man and a 7 year old child. So at one point in the story why does Al refer to them as children? At another time a police officer is firing his pistol and it goes from a revolver to an automatic and back again. In fact he reloads his revolver by shoving a loaded magazine into it!?!Ugh, this author is the worst and I have no desire to read anything else by him.

Being well written however, is (as any avid reader will attest to) not enough! One must have thought evoking concepts, emotional connections, as well as excellent character constructs to be deemed \\"a good book\\", or at least a book worth reading.That being said, I would not deem Hallow's Eve \\"a good book\\".

I have given his \\"What to Cook When There's Nothing in the House to Eat\\" book to many people over the years as bridal shower and new home presents. This book is the perfect companion for the soup lover who already owns the other book. I remember when Mr. Schwartz was the food editor at the NY Daily News newspaper (early 1990's I think) and I used to eagerly await his articles on Wednesdays and Sundays. For those who know what I'm talking about, his recipes are a lot like his articles - yummy and informative! This cookbook not only contains soup recipes (his cream of broccoli is a family favorite) but Mr. Schwartz includes recipes for items to serve with it - breads, appetizers and delicious salads, as well as desserts for after!"},{"Title":"Soup Suppers: More Than 100 Main-Course Soups and 40 Accompaniments","review":"Arthur Schwartz, Soup Suppers (Harper Perennial, 1994)The more cookbooks I read, the more I find the majority of them are repetitive, especially those centered around a given theme. (Certainly makes me appreciate Marlena Spieler more.) Soup Suppers definitely falls into this \\"too much of a good thing\\" category for most of its length; a hundred-odd pages of soup recipes and you realize that there's not much variation in technique where soup is concerned. Learn a few basic recipes and then vary the ingredients; the bulk of this book could have been six pages of instructional material and ten or fifteen pages of variations.Where it does get interesting is in Schwartz' almost in-passing closing section on stuff to serve with your soups, from quick bread recipes all the way to dessert. Instantly, the repetition factor goes away and the book gets absorbing again; it's worth it for that final section alone. (For me, it's worth it for the avocado salad recipe alone, but I understand not everyone is as much an avocado fanatic as I am.) Check this one out of the library first to make sure you want to add it to your permanent collection. ***"},{"Title":"Soup Suppers: More Than 100 Main-Course Soups and 40 Accompaniments","review":"Excellent cookbook for easy and mostly quick meals at home.

The authors are qualified based on their extensive research about women and nationalist movement in Nigeria. They lucidly show the local beginning of Funmilayo, and her international connections. The radicalization of Funmilayo is explained by British ineptitude and unreceptive posture towards nationalist issues, devolution, and the the transfer of power. To them, Funmilayo was not only a dominant figure during the period, she was a fomidable player in postcolonial politics as well. Whether or not Funmilayo was a communist, a fellow traveler, or someone that exploited ideology to better her aspiration and that of the women folks is left to readers to judge. Well written, readeable and concise; this is a must for all interested in women, nationalist politics in Nigeria, and the emergent gender dominated civil society in colonial and postcolonial Nigeria."},{"Title":"Cast Me Out If You Will: Stories and Memoir (Gender culture politics)","review":"It was refreshing to read the stories again. I had read them in pieces earlier. Lalithambika Antherjanam shows a rare sensitivity in her stories while portraying the recess of the hindu household, the kitchen and the soul of many antharjanam's(ever inside).The stories are a rare insight into the trauma and agony which results in the silence of the characters which only the Author is able to explain. Many of them bring back memories of an exotic land rich and deep in its spirituality but at the same time perplexed by the complexity of it all... Gender relations are at a balance when the women is repressed! Men walk around chanting 'vedas' while the womenfolk long to see the light of the day... The stories are extemely readable and the collection is a gem.Her memoirs mark the courage and the conviction of an Antherjanam to speak out and to think the way she does. Lalithambika's life story( or stories from her life) is a rare one. One that speaks volumes about the graceful men(women) fighting systems and social structures for the freedom of mankind. She writes for women but never does she fall into the trap of steriotyping.

The heroine is a strong role model."},{"Title":"soonie and the dragon (Weekly Reader Books)","review":"I came across this book as a kid and always remembered it. Mostly remember the illustrations. These are strange, almost myth based stories about a young girl, on her own, living out of a gypsy cart, but other than that very happy. She has several adventures, one I don't remember, the other includes a dragon that regurgitates her every night so she can tell him stories. It's blurred with my memories of the movie \\"Dragonslayer\\" (I was going through my Dragon phase)so I'll wait to reread the book before I go any further. I'm delighted to find that somebody other than myself is aware that this book exists, and I want it for no other purpose than to restore my childhood book collection that my mom donated to charity while I was away at school one day. I have never recovered the over the loss of those books, and no matter what the cost I will have them back! That and my Stephen King collection she threw out when she went through a religious phase, but that's another story!"},{"Title":"soonie and the dragon (Weekly Reader Books)","review":"This was my favourite book when I was a kid. It may have actually been the first book I ever read by myself; certainly it was the first I ever stayed up late to read with a flashlight every night for a week (and it only took me one night to reread it each time.) It's about a girl named Soonie who has to save her village from a dragon, along with the three princess it had eaten. Soonie fills the role of the young man in the fairy tales, except of course that she doesn't wind up marrying any of the princesses. I'm not sure that this book was really intended for small children, but I'm glad it was one of my first. It didn't teach me that I can accomplish great things even though I'm a girl; it taught me that I can accomplish great things BECAUSE I'm a girl.

A great asset to any tatters library."},{"Title":"Tatting with Visual Patterns","review":"This lovely book by Mary Konior is her last and possibly her best book of tatting patterns. It contains a large selection of patterns ranging from motifs which can be built into large cloths, to doilies, bookmarks, and a collection of fragment designs intended for use as small decorations. There is also a superb collection of edgings and insertions. Some of the patterns use very unusual techniques such as freehand tatting and filet tatting. There is some tatting with beads but for the most part Mary Konior concentrated on a range of techniques which included pearl tatting and traditional ring, chain and mignonette work. The designs are crisp and clean and work up well.At the time the book was written diagrammatical pattern writing was coming into its own, but many people still did not have computers so the patterns are hand drawn. That said they are amazingly clear and well laid out so that text is not really required at all.The book is not aimed at the beginner but at the lacemaker who has learned to tat and wants an interesting selection of patterns to make. This will be a real treasure on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Tatting with Visual Patterns","review":"Although I am a beginner and not good at English, this book is easy to understand because of visual patterns. And I think this book has a lot of modern and effective and elegant designs."},{"Title":"Tatting with Visual Patterns","review":"I like tatting, but looking for designs gets tiresome, since most of the patterns out there are just old-fashioned-looking: limited variations on a few basic themes. I purchased this book because it offered something different, and I was not disappointed. Tatting with Visual Patterns is full of contemporary and unusual designs.I'm a bit puzzled by the emphasis on visual patterns as the whole reason for the book's existence. The visual patterns are easy to read, and I don't think it would be too hard to understand even if you've never read the book. I don't see tatters flocking to visual patterns because it's so much easier to write out a traditional patterns, where as visual patterns require a bit of skill as a drafts(wo)man. Also, you can quickly jot down a copy of a traditional pattern, or type it into email or a web page, whereas to share a visual pattern you'd have to trace it or photocopy it or scan it into the computer.This book includes tips with good diagrams that have been useful to me as a beginning tatter. There are little tricks that make tatting a bit less frustrating, as well as explanations of unusual or more advanced techniques.I'd recommend this book to tatters at any level for its striking designs. It's a bit pricey compared to cheaply-bound books of tatting patterns, but if you're looking for some original designs, it's well worth the price."},{"Title":"Tatting with Visual Patterns","review":"Mary Konior is one of my favorite designers, and this is probably her best book of the 4 she has written for tatting (the only with visual patterns).

Its somewhat more clear and helpful than most metrics books, but not by a whole lot. It suffers from the same problem that plagues all econometrics texts. Like all metrics textbooks, it's long and overly detailed where it should be concise, and it's terse where it should be detailed. It also lacks a coherent, step by step structure. But that's essentially par for the course.Statistics texts are almost universally either ultra-simple, hand waving outlines with no good mathematical insight, or they're a sprawling, useless mess of asymptotic derivations with no practical explanation, applicable intuition, or computational guidance. I'm hoping that one day, someone will write a really good econometrics textbook. This is a small step in the right direction, but it isn't the one we've all been waiting for."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"As a development economist with some experience with panel data, I found Wooldridge a great guide to the nitty-gritty of longitudinal analysis.

Instead of other textbooks it stresses more on conditionals and explains potential problems with underlying assumptions in more detail. As I find it sometimes hard to orientate myself, I give 4 stars."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"I am a former student of Dr. Wooldridge and used his earlier manuscripts of this book in his econometrics classes. I recommend this book to anyone who does applied research for the following reasons:1. From the point of view of a student, Dr. Wooldridge knows how to present the most complex econometric theories in an intuitive and easy way. Having thrown up at Greene in grad classes, Dr. Wooldridge's style was like a breath of fresh air. Econometrics not only will make sense with this book, but it will be fun!2. From the point of view of a researcher, this book condenses the current econometric methods used in microeconomic research in such a way that will save you years of sifting through journal papers to figure out where the current state of the literature. At the same time, the book does so in a fairly detailed way, unlike the encyclopedia-like approach of the Handbooks of Econometrics.3. Although Dr. Wooldridge is a theoretical econometrician, the book is written for the applied crowd. It explains how to perform various complex estimations. Definitely get the companion problems/solution text, because there are details on Stata commands that can be used for the various estimations. There are also numerous specific examples throughout the book that use data from published papers, so if one is interested, can follow up on the references and get to the bottom of the problem (and the solution).The book is useful for both graduate students and researchers alike. This is because it covers the fundamentals AND the most up-to-date state of the literature. If you have no access to the contents, here is a quick description:The book first covers the basics of linear regression, asymptotics, etc., and then dives into all that can go wrong with the model - heteroskedasticity, bias, measurement error, etc. The solutions to such problems are then discussed (proxy variables, random coefficient models, etc). There is a chapter on instrumental variables that discusses at length all the current issues with the method. There is also a chapter on pooled data and difference-in-difference policy evaluation methods. Then the book covers GLS and Feasible GLS estimation. The treatment of Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) models is a must for anyone ever trying to set up a two- or more equation model. Next the book discusses GMM estimation and Simultaneous Equation Models (SEM).The part that covers modern panel data analyses is, in my opinion, the most useful section. The genius of it, is that Dr. Wooldridge has already set up the problem in his SURs and SEMs discussion, so with a simple adaptation of notation (and asymptotic twists due to the time dimension), the theory remains pretty much the same. In this section, the treatment of lagged dependent variables is extremely important reading - I have seen many published abuses of this issue(albeit not in top journals).Next the book covers limited dependent variables (MLE methods), where the most useful is the application to panel data. Again, dynamic unobserved panel data models are in my opinion one of the highlights of this section. There is of course, discussion of probit, logit, multinomial logit, and tobit, all with applications to both cross-sectional and panel data.Next the book covers censored data - sample selection problems and their solutions. Finally, there is a discussion of survival analysis. The potential reader should be aware that this book focuses on parametric methods."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"Excellent book for advanced panel data applications. The author explains the underlying theory and the mechanics of complex econometric models. In every part of the book, the author provides empirical applications to support the topic just covered.

So far I have used the book as a reference (e.g. to find out how/why to run a Wu-Hausman test) and Wooldridge's explanations are clear without leaving out important detail. As a PhD student, I'm looking forward to the next couple of years of getting oddly intimate with this book. (I knocked off one star because there are no images, graphs, and tables.

He attends seminars and interacts with various researchers tackling numerous problems lending his books and his work a very practical and useful perspective.Even if this book were as expensive as other PhD econometric books I would highly recommend it. However, as that it is 1/3 to 1/4 the price of other textbooks I think it is an exceptional deal."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"Its an excellent book for advanced econometrics and a must read at the graduate level. Thanks Mr. Woolbridge"},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"The strengths and weakness of this text is well-covered in the other reviews. I want to point out at least one serious error in the 1st edition of the book: in Chapter 12, page 357 it is claimed that the empirical Hessian may fail to be positive semidefinite. This is simply impossible since positive semidefiniteness is a necessary condition of maximization of a smooth function at an interior point.This error has been corrected in the second edition (see page 414). Spend a few dollars more, buyEconometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, 2nd Edition. You also get lots of new material. (Don't know about new errors though).It is unfortunate that while Wooldridge has corrected this error in the 2nd edition, he does not mention this in the errata file on his website [as of 2011.02.28]. Led to lot of head scratching on my part."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"This is a an excellent textbook at the graduate level.WHAT'S GOOD:- Detailed explanations: Wooldridge's \\"wordiness\\" helps with the interpretation of the math.- The examples are very clear and he tends to \\"re-use\\" them through the text which is good because it adds layers to your own understanding. All the datasets in the examples are available for download.- Problems at the end of each chapter are both \\"math-based\\" and \\"applied\\", so it's nice to get a mix of both proofs and applied empirical work.WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD:- No graphs! I have to give it Four Stars **** because the book has no graphs - not one. Graphs can go a long way, for example, in explaining identification in a 2SLS system.- There's not a lot of material on time-series."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"It is an excellent book for econometric analysis of cross section and panel data. Provides several examples that are very helpful when trying to understand a specific topic."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"With more than 1000 pages, the author does not cover some important topics. Where is partial identification? Where is nonparametric identification? It also misses some estimation methods, motivated from dynamic models, like Hotz-Miller. It is a good textbook to learn some basic econometrics, but hardly a good graduate-level textbook. For econometric and applied researches, Handbook of Econometrics chapters are better references."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"Clearly this product is overrated. In my opinion the book is a complete mess, with definitions, propositions and theorems mixed with the main text and not clearly evidenced from it.It's funny, because the book uses a panoplia of bolds, italics, etc in the main text (well, there is only main text here) which I dislike and think is unnecessary, and then do not use it to evidence the important results. As a result I think this is probably the worst book that I can remember of for reference.There are better books and it's almost impossible to get one worse than this one."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"If you are interested in learning the latest microeconometric methods, this book will save you from long hours of sorting through the literature. Wooldridge has brought together in a well organized, clear and concise manner the state of the art techniques in microeconometrics. His book covers all of the core issues involving single equation and simultaneous equation models. The most important aspects of M-estimation, MLE, GMM and minimum distance estimation are carefully presented. Those interested in limited dependent and qualitative variables will find that this goes well beyond Maddala's classic book. In addition to new developments in logit, probit and tobit, Wooldridge explains sample selection, attrition and stratified sampling. He covers research by Heckman et al on estimating average treatment effects using instrumental variables. I found his material on negative binomial regression, binomial regression, exponential regression and fractional logit regression to be especially interesting. He concludes his book with a nice summary of research on duration analysis. Throughout the book Wooldridge shows how to handle panel data with the various techniques he covers. Anyone doing applied work with cross section or panel data runs the risk of being left behind if they fail to read this new classic of microeconometrics."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"In my opinion, this is now the best introduction to cross-section econometrics. Wooldridge covers all the basics, he does it very well, with a lot of attention to empirical applications. Most of the empirical applications can be replicated using Stata datasets that you can download from his web page. One thing I love about this textbook is that robust versions of variance matrices are almost always provided, so one does not have to rely much on homoskedasticity. This is also one of the very very few textbooks to devote some space to important topics such as stratified sampling, clustering, weak instruments. The exposition is generally excellent, with intuition provided, and proofs rigorous enough for beginners, even if the most technical details are usually left out. Sometimes I find Wooldridge style a bit disorganized in the way he orders topics within a chapter, but overall I do think this is a great book, and the best introduction to the topic. I never liked Greene, which devotes too much space to irrelevant topics. Ruud is a good book too, but very technical, and probably one that you want to keep as a \\"backup\\". Hayashi is very nice too, but a bit unusual, with its strong emphasis on assumptions such as stationariy and ergodicity that are important in time-series (not covered AT ALL in Wooldridge). Amemiya is still a great reference, but it's too advanced for beginners. Overall, I highly recommend this book.Here are the topics covered:- Conditional Expectations and Related Concepts in Econometrics- Basic Asymptotic Theory- Linear Models- The Single-Equation Linear Model and OLS Estimation- Instrumental Variables Estimation of Single-Equation Linear Models- Additional Single-Equation Topics- Estimating Systems of Equations by OLS and GLS- System Estimation by Instrumental Variables- Simultaneous Equations Models- Basic Linear Unobserved Effects Panel Data Models- More Topics in Linear Unobserved Effects Models- M-Estimation- Maximum Likelihood Methods- Generalized Method of Moments and Minimum Distance Estimation- Discrete Response Models- Corner Solution Outcomes and Censored Regression Models- Sample Selection, Attrition, and Stratified Sampling- Estimating Average Treatment Effects- Count Data and Related Models- Duration Analysis"},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"If you are frustrated with the presentation in Greene and other econometric textbooks, then you may want to take a look at this book. It's the anti-Greene, full of clear, well-motivated presentations. What I love about this book is that the author clearly intended for it to be used by students -- even though you can find all the formal results that you would expect from an advanced econometrics text, there is so much intuition that can't be found anywhere else (at least in one book). If you plan on doing applied research, get this book!"},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"Wooldridge fills an enormous gap in the market between applied manuals (which do not deliver enough theory for an academically serious audience), and theory books (that leave you scratching your head as to how one is supposed to implement their results). This is a wonderful book for economic practitioners who want enough theoretical knowledge to support their applied work, but who don't want the theory obscuring the practical issues. An econometric theoretician might find another work more satisfying."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"This book does an excellent job in covering cross-sectional and microeconometric models (Stata codes for all examples in the book are available from UCLA's webside). However, the exposure to panel data is limited. For a theoretical overview of panel data econometrics, I'd recommend Hsiao and Baltagi. For applied work, Edward Frees wrote a good book, although his book is more from the social science perspective (SAS and Stata codes are provided)."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"Wooldridge's \\"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data\\" is a gem. As a student of applied microeconomics, I found reading his undergraduate book \\"Introductory Econometrics\\" is a great complement of reading this graduate text -- especially part I of the UG book (especially the parts of interaction terms, dummy variables); part III (panel data) might be too chatty. I think both of his books worth every penny that I paid. Although, I think Hayashi text is great, maybe it is geared toward time series econometricians. For example, Wooldridge's example of omitted variable bias is clearer to me (using wage-education regression from labor economics and compute the asymptotic inconsistency of OLS estimator with omitted variable bias), compared to Hayashi's simultaneity bias. Both are nice illustration of endogenity, but I prefer Woolridge's text."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"I agree that this textbook actually provides a truly thorough overview on microeconometric methods and stduies. Furthermore, it is immensely instructive in discussing the role of assumptions, on ways of setting up a good empirical investigation that actually answers the research question etc. Plenty (especially applied) problem sets will definitively further your skills, too.However, all this comes at a cost. I personally like fully grasping the methods I use. That includes, for instance, at least having had a look at some of the details of how the particular estimator is derived. Wooldridge is rather silent on that, I was a lot more comfortable with Hsiao's monograph when dealing with panel data topics."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"I have bought this book to have a comprehensive intermediate-advanced text on panel data and other approaches. The book is good, but no tables, no datasets, no figures!Compared to other books on the topic, it is a very understandable book, but only COMPARED to those books. You do not have to be a Mathematician to understand it, but you must be at least intermediate in econometrics (after Gujarati or an intermediate course)."},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"It's difficult to decide how to rate this text because it receives very favorable reviews from most readers, but it was not the book I expected, nor is it a book that I find particularly useful. I have long been a fan or Wooldridge's basic econometrics text because of its accessibility and coverage of a broad range of useful topics. I had expected to have a similar experience with the Econometric Analysis of Cross Sectional and Panel Data: a lot of good material covered in accessible fashion making technically difficult topics seem almost easy. Sadly, I found this book much more difficult than Woolridge's basic text, making it much less valuable as a self-instructional tool.In good part, no doubt, the higher level of difficulty reflects the increased complexity of the material. But it also seems clear that Woodridge, perhaps rightly, is addressing a very different audience than the one he expected to use his introductory text. In any case, his earlier efforts to make hard-to-understand material accessible to readers who do not work with econometrics every day seem to be absent from this book. A reasonable admonition, therefore, might be that just because a reader found Wooldrige's introductory econometrics text useful is absolutely no guarantee that he or she will find this more advanced effort similarly readable. Certainly, anyone not thoroughly comfortable with matrix algebra will struggle mightily and still miss a great deal of value.All tolled, the book may very well merit more than a three star rating. My experience with it, however, suggests otherwise. If only there were an unambiguous way, short of actually procuring and trying to read a text, to make its level of difficulty and required mathematical and statistical background a good deal clearer. The need for this sort of information has become a good deal stronger now that econometric methods are being used in a much more varied range of disciplines.As an alternative to Woolridge's text, anyone interested in learning to analyze panel data might give Singer and Willett's (2003) Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis a try. Happily, Singer and Willett cover a broad range of pertinent material, and they never lose sight of the fact that their audience contains a lot of folks with limited training in quantitative methods. Their material is framed in terms of multilevel analysis, which makes it even more valuable. The only pre-requisite is a course in applied regression analysis,"},{"Title":"Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data","review":"This book fills a real gap for those who are interested in things like ATE, ATET and topics related to impact evaluation that are only talked about now in research papers. The explanations are very very clear and they walk you through the thinking process by which the different methods were developed. Of course, it has the traditional coverage of panel data and cross section but with the clarity that Wooldridge always delivers on his books. For all that, this is a perfect addition to your econometric libraries as it covers topics that are not discussed in traditional and introductory econometric books."},{"Title":"The Five Pennies","review":"The story is just what I remembered as a child in the 1960's.

Of course, some areas, such as fMRI applications in Epilepsy are well-developed, and will be common clinical procedures in the near future. Others, such as using fMRI for hearing disorders, are still the subject of early studies and a standard clinical procedure has not yet been developed. If you need a well-written review of the cutting edge in numerous clinical areas,this is your book. The book also has some great images of clinical cases that I plan to scan and use in my courses."},{"Title":"Functional MRI","review":"....or with someone you love, or even with someone you are totally neutral about.But it is a lot to spend on a book which doesn't cover anything new except for that which is experimental and quite a ways away before reaching your local theatres.I suggest you let the rads you work for buy it for everyone, and you go have a very nice night on the town instead."},{"Title":"Net Slaves 2.0: Tales of Surviving the Great Tech Gold Rush","review":"Although Lessard and Baldwin are amusing and entertaining writers, at the end of the day, this book is just more of the same regarding the dot.bust pity party.

Tough."},{"Title":"Net Slaves 2.0: Tales of Surviving the Great Tech Gold Rush","review":"This book may have been relevant two or three years ago, but it's just whining at this point.

By the time I left, the bust was beginning and things were seemingly all down hill - I felt as though I had missed something magical.After reading Netslaves 2.0, I realized something. I was an idiot. Bill Lessard and Steve Baldwin have removed looked past the facade of of 24 year-old CEOs and free-money stock-options and dreams of reinventing the world and revealed just how miserable life at the average dot-com was. The book is hillariously funny, but its comedy in the Mel Brooks sense: \\"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down a manhole and die.\\" The lives and experiences of these dot-com worker-bees while on the surface had me laughing out loud, they also anecdotally reveal the systemic problems of the cheap-money craze between 1998 and 2000."},{"Title":"Net Slaves 2.0: Tales of Surviving the Great Tech Gold Rush","review":"NetSlaves 2.0: Tales of Surviving the Great Tech Gold Rush, is a must read for anyone who has risked it all in the hopes of building a better life, only to fall flat on their ... Thankfully, this book is not about 24 year old dot com millionaires crying about their lost fortunes. As Tom Petty says, \\"Baby, even the losers get lucky sometimes,\\" and this is a collection of stories about hard working underdogs that are worth caring about.Charles is a young ambitious college student who loves the idea of creating an online zine. Instead of handing out a Xeroxed packet of articles to his 10 closest friends, he knows that the Internet will give him a whole new audience of readers from around the world. His passion even leads to a job at the ultimate destination for tech-nerd-intellectuals, Wired. Unfortunately Charles falls in love with the wrong girl at the same time that the Internet bubble is bursting, so Charles must find his inner resolve in order to survive physically and emotionally.What may make NetSlaves 2.0 a frustrating read for some is the fact that most of the characters in these stories do not find a happy ending. That may leave readers wondering why the authors have bothered to bring these stories to the page at all. The reason may be that Bill Lessard and Steve Baldwin simply want these stories to be heard. They have also chosen to use a mix of fact and fiction when telling these stories which may add to this frustration. The reader is sometimes left wondering how much of each story is fact or fiction.NetSlaves 2.0 rings true because it highlights the willful ignorance that many had as they jumped on the Internet bandwagon. One of the least sympathetic characters in the book is Gene. Gene is a 12-year Proctor and Gamble marketing man who is on the brink of a mid-life crisis. Instead of buying a red Porsche and spending his evenings down at the strip club, Gene decides to pin all of his hopes on the Internet. It seems obvious from the start that his dreams of getting rich quick will never come to pass but it's still painful to see him lose his wife, kids, and house. Gene does manage to stumble upon redemption as he comes to accept his fate and bounce back to minor entrepreneurial success.The most compelling story in the book is the Matrix-esque tale of Vincent who finds himself in possession of something extremely valuable to his employers. The drama unfolds as the company resorts to illegal tactics in order to protect their corporate assets. Vincent is standing on strong legal ground, as he tries to protect what is clearly his intellectual property, but the ultimate challenge will be coming up with the money to fight a company with nearly limitless legal resources.Netslaves 2.0 is a quick history of how the Internet debacle occurred and the lives that were changed in the process. Bill Lessard and Steve Baldwin chronicle the daily lives of some of the individual net slaves while also looking at a larger world that includes paranoid AOL execs pawing through employee emails in order to silence rumors that could hurt the company's bottom line. It is an enjoyable ride from the height of dot com mania to the crash of economic reality."},{"Title":"Net Slaves 2.0: Tales of Surviving the Great Tech Gold Rush","review":"Everyone who has dissed this book obviously hasn't read it. This book is fun, and puts the entire Dot-Com Bubble and its aftermath into perspective. The people profiled run the gamut from executives to regular tech workers who went from making a great deal of money to barely getting by and the dignity that they somehow muster amidst very unpleasant circumstances.

Lessard and Baldwin go beyond tedious repetition of standard facts and address the question of what comes next for people who didn't take enough out of their web jobs to retire. Netslaves 2.0 is presented as a series of self-contained sections, each of which centers on the story of a representative example of nine types of former dotcom employees.The novel expository style works well, Lessard and Baldwin are engaging writers, and they avoid longwinded punditry and \`\`inside baseball'' filler. NS 2.0 isn't a book about the boom so much as a look at the beginning of the Internet winter.

The book makes caricatures of them, and tells fictional documentaries about how each of these characters has got along during the bull market and after it. I don't work in the computer field, but I found it a funny book anyway, because most of the caricatures are familiar anyway.

The book is a readable exposition of the foundations and most important results of statistical mechanics. The intended audience is advanced students of statistical mechanics, however, some previous acquaintance with statistical mechanics is recommended. His follow up book,An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics(I've heard it referred to by some as \`\`baby Hill'') is a better starting point for the first-time student.The book treats a small number of subjects (there are 8 chapters in total) but in detail (this review is based on the chapters I have read so far, 1-4 and 7).The fundamentals are developed in chapters 1-4 which establish the ensembles, first from the classical Gibbs perspective (chapter 1), then from a quantum mechanical point of view (chapter 2). In chapter 3 Hill develops a generalized ensemble from which the microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical follow as special cases. This part ends with the discussion of fluctuations in chapter 4. The remaining four chapters are devoted to general applications: the treatment of imperfect gases and condensation (Mayer's cluster expansion), distribution functions, and lattice statistics.Overall the book is very readable by anyone who has some previous exposition to statistical mechanics and the basic mathematical tricks in working with partition functions. There are some small problems. Chapter 7 (nearest neighbor lattice statistics) is uncharacteristically disorganized and unbalanced with respect to explanations relative to chapter 1-4. Notation is not always helpful. A large number of variables in bold and script letters make the reading of equations a chore. This chore becomes even more laborious by the small type of the book (I estimate that the main font is point size 10 or 9, if not less). Dover would do scientists a huge favor by reissuing the book in larger format.Hill's strength is in not over-explaining things: all mathematical detail is made available to the reader who must then use make use of his/her own brain to make sense of it. For the most part this works well for anyone willing to put the effort (for those who want some guidance in reading about statistical mechanics, an excellent companion is Pathria's book)."},{"Title":"Statistical Mechanics: Principles and Selected Applications (McGraw-Hill Series in Advanced Chemistry)","review":"Very good text if you have the other book by hill on 'stat thermo' or a previous background on the subject, yet another Dover bargain."},{"Title":"Statistical Mechanics: Principles and Selected Applications (McGraw-Hill Series in Advanced Chemistry)","review":"Classic stat mech text.

However, that is deliberate, as a lot of the narrative is told under the artifice of 'recovered audio cassettes and papers' from what remained of Miskatonic University after The Fury unleashed by Cthulhu levelled it.Henri de Marigny returns from travelling via the four dimension clock with Crow, but Crow does not appear with him, and when he wakes up in hospital, it is ten years later.Eventually, with the aid of Mother Quarry, he realises Crow's plight, and aids him in his return.Crow and the audio fragments and papers recount to Marigny, while in hospital and talking to him, what went on.Titus has returned looking 25 years younger, and is a post human now. A robot intelligence rebuilt his body in android form, he has a mastery of time and space travel and mental powers beyond the minor telepathies he employed before.He has travelled through all earth's times, to alien galaxies, and alien places, and taken a fated alien lover, and met one of the 'good' Elder Gods. Not to mention cavorting with lisping dragons with Hawkman anti-gravity harnesses. The Hounds of Tindalos have been pursuing him, as have elements of Cthulhu and Hastur, but his now developed abilities enable him to avoid being killed, or pulled into black holes, even.All this in fragments, through a short book. A transitional information phase almost, and what is unfolded here may be too rapid and overloaded for some people to want to keep up with.Crow takes off again, leaving de Marigny behind, with the devices and guidance to undertake a journey similar to that Crow has undergone.The form of the novel is a hybrid type version of The Time Machine and The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath, with a dash of Burroughs or Moorcock."},{"Title":"Sudden Death (Horror High)","review":"The first page of Sudden Death pulled me in and kept me turning pages due to the suspense.I have read it 4 times!The moral is kind of hard to see but it so saying that you don't need to take steroids for sports.It was saying don't sacrifice your body for something you don't even need to succeed.\\"Would his father have taken steroids if the were available?Billy tried to convince himself that his father would have but inside he knew it wasn't true.\\"All of this happens at and average American school called Cresswell High.This story probably would have happened recently.Lara Crandall has been dying to break a good story for the school newspaper to put in her r&eacute;sum&eacute; to go to journalism school.

This excellent, 300-page guide describes just about everything anyone might want to know about the area, from geography and climate, to fishing and hunting opportunities, to historical tours. There are scores of detailed maps and charts, and many, many photographs. What I found most interesting were the chapters on historical tours across the region, with just about every town and hamlet described. (There are also whole chapters on Fort Smith, Hot Springs National Park, and Little Rock.) This is not only a great book to have with you if visiting the area, but it's also a terrific book for armchair travelers as well. A wonderful guidebook, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Debunking History","review":"This is an interesting book, but very British as written by British authors. Sometimes they go into flights of fancy, every bit as bad as the myths they attack, so their conclusions are not to be taken as gospel by fledgling historians. An example might suffice:In 7.5, they claim that President Reagan's record was thin -- but somehow leave out his bringing about the end of the Cold War. Yes, Gorbachev caved, but it is difficult to see how this would have happened with a liberal president. They also note that Reagan's failings were aggravated by the \\"not uncommon American trait of insularity.\\" How very British and patronizing of the authors! Haven't we pulled their chestnuts out of the fire twice in the twentieth century? But as the authors state, \\"They (Americans) are starry-eyed to the point of mawkishness in their love of their homeland...\\" Oh, spare me....Other weak or misguided excursions into a British Weltanschauung of American history would include: 3.13 on McCarthy (shows America at its worst); 4.8 on Manifest Destiny (very bad -- but nothing about British Imperialism); 4.14 Pearl Harbor (has their facts wrong of the timing of the 14th part); 5.6 The Zimmermann Telegram (supposedly not important); 6.4 Who won the Battle of Waterloo (Wellington and the British Army, of course); 8.9 Kennedy & the Cuban Crisis (historians give Kennedy high honors...?); 9.1 Washington (should not have hanged the good British officer, Major Andre); and 9.6 Was the North bound to win the Civil War (no).The list of references on American history is weak, and it appears that the authors included the U.S. items about which they had little knowledge to make the book saleable in the U.S. I did not think they succeeded, although the idea of the book was good. One needs to read more than one reference on an event to understand its complexity. Gordon Prange's postumus book on Pearl Harbor is a good case in point -- many of its \\"facts\\" are now known to be false, but apparently the authors were in a hurry and confined themselves to it as a single source.One last note, many of the authors' \\"popular myths\\" will seem contrived to an American reader and many may seem uninteresting or trivial."},{"Title":"Debunking History","review":"A great price for a great book of facts.I am well pleased with the book and service"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read almost everything Mr. Saul has written. Oddly enough, I only recently came across this one, his second published novel. It certainly has a terrifc premise, and our hero, Peter Balsam, is likeable; also conflicted and vulnerable, which makes him perfect fodder for the wonderful mind of Mr. Saul. How exciting to come to a new town and start fresh after a rash of failures, whether the priesthood or his subsequent marriage, or the certainty of his future. Peter Balsam comes to teach phychology at a parochial school, almost unheard of by the set-in their ways populace. Angry nuns, weird old priests and closed-minded townspeople greet him with suspicion, but the kids love him, so glad to be given a chance to learn something new during their \\"formative years\\". Well, chaos ensues, as would be expected, and the next-to-lead character, Monsignor Peter Vernon, Balsam's old school chum, creates lots of confusion and plot twists that carry the reader to a satisfying conclusion, though not the one you'd think. Or...it would've been unexpected had I not read so much Saul before. It was very enjoyable, and if you're new to Mr. Saul, check this one out right away."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This book grips you from the very start and never lets go. While its a fast pace horror novel regarding suicide, and religious fervor it also tackles other topics such as abuse of power, sexual hypocrisy and the church overall. I got a bit upset when the sexual element was introduced; thinking Saul was making a judgement call but as the story progressed it redeemed it self. It also has one of the best and realistic endings I ever seen in a novel of this type. I am glad Saul had the good sense to end it in the way he did. A great audio book from the first CD to the last. The reader did a good job though his female voices needed some fine tuning at times. Still a great listening experience. I'm off to buy another! This book contains 5 CDs and is read by a single reader."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish the Sinners is a thriller concerning a rash of suicides and religious fervor sweeping through a desert community (the heat is symbolic on many levels). On another level I think it is a very personal book for Saul, usually a very impersonal and highly structured writer. This is due to the tensions regarding sexual orientation issues with the lead adult characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"John Saul is a master of horror story telling. His stories cause shivers up and down your spine, butterflies in the stomach, and the uncontrollable urge to keep reading. I am deliberately keeping these reviews vague so as to not spoil anything.Punish the Sinners is a bizarre story, set in the backdrop of a private Catholic high school called St. Francis Xavier High School. When Peter Balsam begins teaching a controversial psychology course, he notices that the children in this school have been very well indoctrinated in the attitude of the whole village (Neilsville, WA), which is very much a small town filled with very religious people.However, something isn't quite right at the high school and Peter is determined to find out what it is. There are strange rumors, whispers about a dark secret society. And then the children start dying ...This story is just creepy and I loved reading every word.

Don't miss this great story."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the first novel I have read from Saul and I admit I was impressed. From the first page it hooks you in and keeps you there. The ending was not typical and much of a surprise.

I look forward to reading more of John Saul's work."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"A typical Saul thriller that his fans will enjoy. The plot centers around a Seminary dropout- turned teacher who is asked to teach at a stuffy parochial school and finds himself in the middle of a rash of teenage suicides and other evil goings-on. A typical fast-paced Saul thriller that lures you in quickly and keeps you there. The ending was different than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, but I wish Saul had cleaned up some of the loose ends. All in all, a quick, easy read that Saul fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the best book Saul wrote, it's great. I read it a few times actually and each time I couldn't leave it and move on with my life, like doing something for school or something. It touched me, the subject is very well built, so are the characters. Peter Balsam, and old childhood friend of Peter Vernon (now the Monsenior) is asked to come and teach psychology. He is an outcast in a relligious society and relates only to another oucast, a divorced woman. Prejudice coming from religious ideas is a great background for the Monsenior who finally came with a plan how to punish the \\"sinners\\". He is a very disturbed character and if you are a smart reader you'll get the idea why he is as he is. He is by no means the common religious fanatic, he's more. You enter a world of dark, creepy secretes hidden under a mask of peace and God. It's so usual for saul to do this, paint a perfect picture and turn it into grothesque, showing the true evil. I like that he's not a writer that ends books the way most do, he doesn't make it sweeter than life is. I hated this book, I threw it on the floor in rage when I finished it. But I loved it too, believe me. I understand it, it has a certain logic. Oh, you have to read it to see what I mean. If you didn't read Saul before - this is the best and the most evil book I'd say. Ok, let's say, the most evil from the pleasant ones. \\"The right hand of Evil\\" is the most evil. I am 22 and still it gave me nightmares. It wasn't believable and it was kind of distgusting like also \\"Suffer the children\\". Morbid. I would relate it to \\"Comes the blind Fury\\". It's about fury, but at a more unconscious level, I don't suspect that the evil character realizes hos rage so well, he can't controle it, it's madness and yet a perfect plan, so cold, and so calculated. It's brilliant! Great, grrrrrrrreat book."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Peter Balsam has come to Neilsville to teach a class in psychology at the local high school.

While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on \\"ugly girl,\\" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"If you are a John Saul reader, you do not need a review. You know how good he is.

The first book (The Saints of Neilsville) plods along with a laughable predictability. The second book (The Society of St. Peter Martyr) picks up the pace and things really start to get creepy and strange. This section unfortunately relies too heavily on descriptions of all sorts of sexual acts. I'm not sure if I should laugh or be insulted. The two books take the plot on an unexpected tangent. Just as things seem to be petering out (excuse the pun), it picks up speed with the same frantic pace of some Stephen King novels. The last twenty pages then take a huge and wonderfully surprising tangent, earning this book a higher review than I otherwise would have given it."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I am a big Saul fan and was not disappointed by this story. I have read all of his books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This was definitely in the second group. A long, slow build up to basically nothing, no mystery, no resolution, nothing more horrific than a secret undercurrent of homosexuality in the Catholic Church (imagine that!). Writing is at best completely unremarkable, but often clumsy and repetitive. Why is this book still in print?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read two books by John Saul (I'm reading them in order of publication).This story dealt with suicide. There was blood due to the suicide methods, but nothing in the sense of \\"blood and guts\\", except for the opening scene. The story did revolve around Catholicism. Catholicism has always been a focus in horror films and such. This story by no means was a jab at the Catholic faith, but just this specific fictitious church in the story. The author I felt did a good job with character development. He slowly peeled away layers of the story to reveal the plot. It wasn't as \\"intense\\" as I might have liked it to be, but still was enjoyable and kept my interest throughout. John Saul does a good job with keeping the plot mysterious to the reader. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"The thought that comes to mind when I think about Punish the Sinners is how shocking it is. The novel starts out like many John Saul novels with an outsider being menaced by something possibly supernatural and the level of menace and fear is as high as Saul's other books but the degree of violence from this book really did surprise me (especially the sexual violence). This is a very dark novel and explores issues that might cause discomfort to those who live sheltered lives and have similar outlooks on life. The suspense itself will have you jumping at shadows. Throughout the entire novel I kept feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and foreboding. I always felt like there was something out of the corner of my eye that I missed when I read it. The book will shock and scare and what more could one ask of a horror novelist such as John Saul?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I have kind of been on a John Saul kick as of late, and decided to give one of his older novels a try. So picked up a used copy of Punish the Sinners. I found the book to be... slow. There are shocking moments, and some very grizzly violence towards the end of the novel, but none of that really picks up until 3/4 of the way through. The rest of the novel is one character's inconsistent struggle with his faith. I say inconsistent because his motivations and feelings really don't flow from chapter to chapter, but instead seem to jump randomly to fit the story. With the exception of one very shocking and wonderfully tasteless revelation and sex scene, the book is almost boring and repetitious. The characters never seem to fully develop, with most of the teen girls being interchangeable, and our lead character seeming like a different person from chapter to chapter, and sometimes from page to page. While it's not a total train wreck, it basically becomes a very mediocre small town soap opera.So based on the first third of the book I would only give this book 2 1/2 stars. Then the last third begins and the whole book changes. Characters begin to kill themselves, and the stakes are raised, and suddenly the book becomes very entertaining. The \\"supernatural\\" aspect of the novel takes over and at this point I couldn't put the book down. I won't give anything away, but I will say that ending shows that Saul is capable of creating some almost stunning, and yet violent imagery as the body count begins to rise. In the last hundred or so pages John Saul's talent begins to shine through. It's just a pity that it takes so long for the book to get going. So long in fact that I'm guessing most readers will have already given up.Then there is the ending. I will just say that I was surprised at the choice John Saul made, and looking back at it now, the final pages seem to give the book a much welcomed nasty edge.Do I recommend this book? No, not really. There are so many better books, including ones by John Saul, that I just can't tell anyone to spend money on this one. If you can get a cheap used copy, then maybe, but otherwise skip Punish the Sinners and find something better. If you are looking for a John Saul novel try Faces of Fear or The Manhattan Hunt Club. John Saul has done better, and you the readers can do better as well."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish The Sinners is escapism at its best. Sauls weaves a sad tale of suspense and intrigue. Readers will find the opening funny and almost instantly chilling. Sinners exposes Saul's ability to craft a story that exposes the delicate almost fragile nature of children. This is the catylist for the evil that prevails. If horror has a first name, this book may just be the middle name. This is a must read. FYI..there is one part of the book that is sure to have you cringing or puking. Either way, you will be moved by this horroring tale."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"To date, this is by far the best *and also the first) John Saul novel I have read. And based on other reviews, I think that sentiment is shared by a lot of other readers. Had I not had other commitments, I probably would have read this cover-to-cover. All in all, I think it took me two days. If you are looking for a quick escape - read it. Too bad, nothing else by John has even come close to this one....."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"After reading &quot;Creature&quot; a few months back I had some doubts about John Saul. Well, i don't know about his later work, but this one was good. Peter Balsam goes to Neilsville to teach a psychology class at a parochial school, but soon finds some of his female students are killing themselves for no apparent reasonother than the fact that he showed up in town. Finding out why the girls do it is mainly what this book is about, and it had an unexpected ending, which is rare in most stories I have read as of late. I also couldn't find too many loose ends thatweren't tied up, although there were a few, which led to 4 out of 5 stars. All in all, a fine read."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"Kotler tries to sell college students new books every year, hence the 12th edition he is now marketing. There is no new information, and the information contained is no different from any $12 marketing book. Students, buy an old edition and save, teachers stop using books like this, more and better information is available for free over the net anyway. Just because they are expensive and shiny doesn't mean they are worthwhile. BTW this is also available in an international edition with the exact same content for 1/4 of the cost."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"No doubt this book is a classic in Marketing - most any MBA program in the world has this book as required, if not optional, reading. If you're taking an academic Marketing class, you'll probably be required to buy this, and rightfully so. If you need a desk reference on Marketing, again this will be a good read.That said, it is a very long and detailed read that covers Marketing definitions, Marketing gurus, Marketing tactics, Marketing strategy... The whole 9 (or 10?) yards. In being everything to everyone, the book loses some of it's strength. If your interests are less broad and academic, the book is too broad. Interesting in improving your advertising? There's more precise books out there. Interested in applied Marketing Strategy? Again, there's more focused books available than even just reading Kotler's sections."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"Using a variety of case-study analyses, this \\"Marketing Management\\" elaborated on the principal concepts of 21st Century marketing. Post-graduate students, as well as practising professionals will find it useful. Its specialized chapters did their best in ramifying every aspect of marketing. Information is everywhere; although that its versatility led to the boring repetition of strategies.This book is simple and well-written. It is very good; but in comparison, the \\"Principles of Marketing\\", which is cheaper and comes with an attached CD-ROM, (and was written by Gary Armstrong and this same Philip Kotler) offers much more for less money."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"This is the approach to marketing that tries to quantify the process instead of illuminate it. When all the formulas are stated, the numbers crunched, the bullet points listed, and the case studies studied, marketers are still left with the same problem: How do I align the whole company behind a single, powerful idea? In this particular effort, your best allies are courage, common sense, and a handful of simple principles. An expensive, five-pound \\"bible\\" is only good if you want to wake up your colleagues by dropping it on the table. Unless you're a student who has to read this stuff, you're better off buying \\"Bottom Up Marketing\\" by Trout & Ries or \\"The Brand Gap\\" by Neumeier, and spending the money you save on a nice dinner."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"The overall thoroughness and comprehensive coverage of marketing fundamentals is very appropriate for undergraduate textbook. There are plenty of excercises, illustrations and quasi-mathematical formulae, but the book lacks the depth and insight for the more discerning reader. The text is very thorough and verbose, which makes is boring at times, full with superficial direct conclusions without even an attempt to look at the bigger picture.In my opinion it more retrospective than forward-looking and inspiring. I would highly recommend &quot;Strategic Marketing Management&quot; by David Aaker at 1/2 of the price and 1/6 of the size. Also, I personally find inappropriate that Prof. Kotler starts each chapter quoting his own book."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"Phillip Kotler's Marketing Management is the the classic MBA marketing text. It's comprehensive and encyclopedic--that means its not an easy read. Kotler's writing style could be described as a list of lists. Each topic is parsed into its elements and he then recites all possible attributes.The book has an enormous market share, which means it comes with every possible ancilliary product (for instructors who adopt the book) such as videos and power points. Because Prentice Hall sells so many of this book, they can afford to issue new editions on an accelerated, two-year cycle. The good news from this is it allows them to move with the times (in this edition, they've eliminated all the trivial &quot;Did you know ...?&quot; sidebars that detracted from the seriousness of the last &quot;Millennial Edition.&quot; The bad news (from a student point of view) is that you may be forced to buy new, because used copies won't be correct.However, this is one book that you'll want to keep on your professional library shelves--it's as much a reference as a text. All other marketing texts either derive from Kotler or distance themselves from this book, so you might as well go to the source."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"This book is not organized well at all. There is a lot of repetition in the chapters and they are extremely long with a lot of information contained in each chapter. Many of the examples seem irrelevant and the book just does not flow well. It seems Dr. Kotler is attempting to use the same old dry text with modern updating that makes this book long, confusing and boring."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"This book is a great reference guide for those interested in marketing. The topics covered are too varied to be indepth, but it cavers a wide range of topics. I'd read this book in conjunction with Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine to get a complete picture."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"Great text for marketing basics. If you need a place to start this is it. It delves into a variety of topics and covers the extensive ground of marketing management. Should be great for students and professionals because it has many real life examples. It is very general, not industry specific. So, if you're looking for marketing specifically for hospitality and tourism for example, Kotler co-authored a textbook on that too. (another great book on that topic is Heads in Beds-hospitality and tourism marketing). A great book on branding is Keller's Brand Management."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"The analytical frameworks are great and look very applicable.

Prof. Kotler's book is definitely the best choice for those wishing to start learning Marketing from scratch as well for those experts wishing to review or deepen their knowledge through the extensive bibliography which is provided. The reading is easy and enjoyable, thanks to pictures, examples from everyday's life and common Marketing mistakes that make you master the art of observation and strategy. It would have been useful to dedicate a chapter or two to quantitative analysis methods, such as the usage of statistics and so on, but such a miss is easily forgiven once you get through the text and get caught by the Author's style."},{"Title":"Marketing Management","review":"This book by Marketing Guru Philip Kotler is a Bible you must read before starting your career in Marketing.

Of particular interest was the chapter, \\"Why Old Dogs Can't Learn New Tricks (or can they?)\\" Among the questions addressed in this highly informative chapter are: \\"Senior moments\\"--what are they and can they be avoided? Is aging and senility one in the same? Is forgetfulness the beginning of Alzheimer's disease or can forgetfulness be the result of other causes? And, the question of greatest concern to those of us who at one time or another in our lives have grappled with trying to remember or dealt with loved ones who are memory impaired--what (if anything) can be done about memory loss?Each chapter's theme in this scholarly work is supported through charts, graphs, research, lists of tips and citations, but not to worry, Dr. Klemm writes in laymens terms and his conversational tone speaks directly to readers.

What You Forgot Was My Fault","review":"Bill Klemm has been with us for a while. For about 40 yrs now he has been teaching and publishing books and articles on brain function. And if we've been paying attention we've been adding to our brains capacity throughout this period. But, if you're like me, and have just discovered Bill and his work, your in luck.Bill's new book has a slightly silly title, but it's no lightweight little piece of fluff. Instead we are treated to a delightfully thorough, behind the scenes analysis, of how we create memories. As you can imagine, being a Ph.D. an all, there are some big words included within. But no to worry, Bill's worked long enough with his students to realize that everyone learns in a specific fashion and he offers several slants on his subject.While he includes numerous common methods such as pegs, the picturing of related things hanging off a system of pegs, to acrostics, where the first letter of each word serves as a cue, to acronyms, think YMCA, he also offers us a host of other easy methods to increase our memory.But the real helpful bits are why, how, when, where, and how much we are capable of remembering. And along the way we also learn how sleep can play an important part, how alcohol can be detrimental, and why we no longer need to subscribe to the myth that getting older means getting forgetful.This is science at it's most fun. We all can't be Ph.D.'s, but with this little book we can astonish the grandkids, one up our college buddies pulling all-nighters, and best of all remember the name of that hunky guy or gorgeous gal we met at that party last week and now run into at the grocery store."},{"Title":"Thank You, Brain, For All You Remember.

Scientific and lab experiences aside, the book offers a lot of tips for changing the way we learn and recall. / Simple ways to learn social skills like remembering the names of 10 people you just met. Using a skeleton outline instead of taking notes in class. And, for long-term recall, figuring out the answers rather than memorizing them. But Thank You Brain is more than a how-to book. When Klemm points out the short attention spans of today's kids he opens a discussion about the need to change the way our teachers teach their students. \\"Yes, it's true that learning is hard work,\\" he says. The brain works harder to learn a new thing than it does to maintain a memory or a process. Exercise the brain by learning unique, foreign processes and the brain gets intricately involved in learning the requirements for the new subject, and you keep it active, alert, sharp. Klemm talks about the FOCUSED brain and how difficult it is to divide its attention, for example, when driving and using a cell phone. And how drug abuse hijacks the brain's coping system, takes it out of the loop and removes its power to manage emotions. He says recall is not the same as memory. Recalling someone's name is easier when all the original cues are present, such as when and where you knew that person in the first place.

If we are defined by what we know, and what we know is limited by what we can remember, then Klemm's book is the ultimate in self-help titles.The book starts off with anecdotes and overviews, and then rapidly dives into giving the reader real tools to use. Klemm accurately recounts research from the field, sharing old and new ideas from other sources to give a well-rounded summary of what can be done to improve memory.The book is 300-pages long and organized into eleven chapters including the Introduction. Unfortunately the chapters are not numbered, which forces readers to remember the page number at the beginning of a chapter if he or she wants to find a certain chapter of interest. Perhaps this is Klemm's way of gently urging us to work on memory improvement, but I'd rather be able to lazily skim forward looking for a clearly defined chapter heading. It's a minor inconvenience.The book is well organized, providing a detailed index to help readers find material on specific topics. Each chapter is opened with a list of the subjects discussed within. Some of the section headings are entertaining, providing a play on words to draw you in and make you want to read more. Chapters are closed with easy-to-read tables of Key Ideas to ring the material home. Sources and references are listed for completeness as you would expect from a Ph.D. author.Readers looking for a quick fix to enhance their recollection ability can find several techniques inside the book. Each one takes personal effort, make no mistake.

Neither of these styles is a single type of beer, but rather a category of ales made locally with various brewing methods and array of ingredients, including spices. The brewing methods in these areas continue to evolve and do not necessarily relate to the styles of the past. Although the styles have an amorphous nature, this book provided me with a clear understanding of Biere de Garde and Saison.Experienced brewers will discover plenty of information in this book, especially ideas that go against the common convictions about brewing. What about fermenting at high temperatures? Mixing yeasts? Red wine type yeasts? Warm storage? Markowski takes the view that brewing is a process of experimentation, rather than following set recipes. Obviously this book is not for a beginning home brewer.Markowski argues that though the classification of beer styles is useful, the classifications should not be used to inhibit the brewer from coming up with something much different. I agree with this. What is the use of always imitating commercial beers? Our fascination with brewing is to discover a new taste through experimentation.This book covers the past and present styles of Biere de Garde and Saison (including an informative essay by Yvan De Baets on how Saison evolved), and provides a list of the breweries producing the styles, detailing grains, hops, temperatures and other brewing details, along with tasting notes on the beers they produce.In sections on brewing the styles, the sample recipes are just guidelines (in the spirit of experimentation) rather than set formulas. You must decide what overall weight of grains you will use and then calculate percentages of the grain types. You also must calculate the amount of hops you will use to achieve the target IBU. The brewing notes about the styles are highly instructive, providing the parameters of grains that can be added, even the ranges of various spices for Saison. Such details must come from a lot of labor in the brewery."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This book contains a wealth of practical information for the experienced homebrewer, without being dry or stuffy. Thankfully, there are no pages wasted on \\"brewing for beginners\\" or \\"equipment you'll need to get started\\"; it is assumed the reader already has a basic knowledge of all-grain brewing procedures, and beer appreciation in general.Discussion of historical and geographic influences on saison and biere de garde are interesting and kept to a minumum. Of particular interest is the text devoted to paragons of both styles- describing their evolutions, specific malts and hops used, abv and attenuation, yeasts, gravities, fermentation temperatures, aging, water profiles, and so on... everything one would need to reverse-engineer a clone beer, if one chose to do so.It is not, however, a collection of clone recipes. The samples recipes for variations of both styles are intended as guidelines, easily adaptable to individual brewhouse procedures and efficiencies. Also, the parameters are so diverse that it is difficult, if not impossible, to define style guidelines, a fact that the author acknowledges. This loose end can be frustrating to the reader.Overall, a useful book; solid information, and nothing irrelevant or overtechnical."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"As a homebrewer, it's hard to read this book and not immediately want to brew. What's great about this title (and all of the others in this series) is that it can inspire anyone who's brewed before. For the less-adventurous among us, there's plenty of information here to credibly recreate a \\"typical\\" saison or biere-de-garde even if you've never tasted one before. For the more seasoned brewer, however, the frank discussions of the intricate history of these beers and the vageries of style inspire you to create your own unique farmhouse ale."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"These are some of my favorite beers: I like to brew them and I like to drink them. This is an excellent book that has helped improve my beer. It's also alerted me to the tyranny of the idea of 'beer styles'. Not every family of beers can be described by referring to the standard beer judge criteria-sometimes history and culture are just more important.Well-written and fun to read, this is one of the best books for advanced home-brewers.Lynn Hoffman, author ofThe New Short Course in Wine"},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This is what every beer book should aspire to be. Farmhouse Ales presents the state of the art in knowledge about the history, ingredients, and brewing techniques of two fascinating and delightful styles of Belgian Ale. Much of the information presented here has not appeared anywhere else in easily accessible form. And the authors have done an outstanding job in being thorough in their presentation of information while at the same time writing in a style that makes this book a pleasure to read. Whether you plan to brew saisons and biere de gardes professionally or on a homebrew level, or whether you just want to enhance your appreciation of two neglected but rich and complicated styles, this book is a must-read. I myself especially treasured the comprehensive information on the yeast strain utilized by Saison Dupont, and on the historical origins of the style. If you're a brewer, this book will make you a better one, and if you're a beer lover, this book will make you love it more."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"While this book does stay on track regarding these ales, if you are looking for recipes or a how to book with specifics you will be disappointed. This book is more an explanation of style than one telling you how to brew a specific brewery's ale. That said I learned a lot about these ales and put it to use when I brewed some recently. I learned much in regard to techniques and basics of style. These ales are not for the new brewer and are difficult and very time consuming to make correctly. This book points the direction but doesn't map the way to brewing successful saisons. I would encourage brewers looking for a challenge to read this book."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"As a librarian, I get to see a lot of books on this subject and I have found this particular book to be exceptionally well done in nearly every respect. I appreciate the history lesson included within, because in order to brew quality examples of these fine Belgian and French ales I think it important to understand the historical impact of them and how the styles have grown and evolved over the years.Having said all of that though, I find this book's practical advice and information about the actual brewing of these beers to be the most valuable. I love Belgian saison beers, and with a handful of tips I gleaned from this book I was able to brew a deliciously complex example on my first try. The beers I brewed after that only got better.If you are a brewer who likes to experiment with new styles or more advanced techniques, this book is definitely worth having. Highly recomended!"},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"I found this book to be fun and informative to read. I am an avid homebrewer that loves to experiment. This book gives a useful account about how the beers of rural Belgium came to be. In particular, the author explores how culture and geography combined to create the beers of the region.For me the best chapter was \\"A Word on Style\\". The quote \\"Perhaps no other family of beers can frustrate the style police like farmhouse ales...\\" gives an idea of the attitude of this book. The point is made that \\"style\\" is sometimes over defined and stifles creativity. The point is to make good beer.The book does not set out to prescribe what a farmhouse ale should be. Rather it describes the history of the farmhouse ales and their modern successors. The book does give some recipes and suggestions, but makes the point that these are starting points for experimentation.As a brewer who views style very broadly and loves to learn new techniques and experiment, I greatly enjoyed this book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys beer and brewing."},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"An introduction to farmhouse ales is a liberating experience for those who live by the rules of endless possibilities. In Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition, Phil Markowski provides a vivid literary experience by clearly defining the elusive quality that holds such allure for the beer enthusiast, whether as a brewer, historian, or beerficionado. Enhanced by a superb historical essay on Saison by Yvan DeBaets and a well-grounded foreword by Tomme Arthur, this volume stands as a comprehensive guide to the brewing traditions that so clearly define France and Belgium.Traditional Farmhouse Ales comprise the family of beers known as Biere de Garde and Saison, although the line that separates the two styles is often blurred by traditions that have struggled to endure, despite the upheavals of changing borders and paradigms, World Wars, and industrialization that led to the closure of countless small farmhouse breweries.My personal experience has consisted of esoteric discussions that seek to delineate the differences between Bieres de Garde and Saisons. Our conclusions echo the subtle intangibles that Markowski so clearly defines. In his observation about Saison, he states, \\"These vague and varied descriptions will frustrate anyone foolish or stubborn enough to try to pin down these wildly complex, deceptively simple rustic ales,\\" and of Biere de Garde, he says \\"If there is any accepted physical or sensory standard, French brewers may quietly acknowledge it, but will put their own spin on it to make it their own.\\"Markowski pushes onward, however, seeking to define them by presenting their historical significance and the conditions under which they developed. He examines the terroir, including the climatic conditions that led to their development, the geology that affects the water of the region, European grain profiles, Belgian and specialty hops, adjuncts, spices, and the complex nature of yeasts that stray wildly from (or may include) the single-strain traditions of lager brewing. His discussions include technical details on decoction, infusion and step infusion mashing, and the results of storage or \\"garding\\" under a variety of conditions.Not only does he present detailed information for the seasoned brewer, but also encourages creativity on one's own terms. His descriptions are so vivid that even a non-brewer can envision working in his own simple farmhouse brewery, with mash tuns and hoses, cool ships and vats, replicating the delicate nuances of these distinctive beers.Markowski's proficiencies in chemistry and math define the scientific art that makes the crafting of these beers possible, even for one who does not have the advantage of living in Hainaut, Nord or Pas de Calais. His descriptions present visuals for the mind's eye and paint the palate with flavors so intense they become real. With your senses fully piqued, he stimulates action by providing sources for ingredients so you, too, can create your own magical interpretation of these beers.He inspires by providing full details of examples that define each style, noting a full description of each brewery and technical specifications that comprise each beer: Plato readings, ingredients used, temperatures, and storage or garding. He follows each with clear tasting notes that serve to illustrate the broad range of possibilities in these refreshing beers. In the words of Markowski, \\"...almost anything goes.\\""},{"Title":"Farmhouse Ales: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"Provides a realistic definition of Belgian brewing methods.

When she informs him that they have a son & that he is very ill, hero bulldozes his way into their lives. Heroine is ok with that having realized some things for herself: she regrets running away from him instead of tackling their problems together & she is willing to take what she can get from him even though she knows he doesn't love her but hopes he'll fall in love with her. But will hero stand by her when he learns the complete truth from her?I had to laugh at the 1-star review b/c I would typically give books like these, with the many big misunderstandings & heroine's dumb behaviors, a similar rating. BUT Baird weaved the plot, dialogue, emotions, & character development so well that I end up really liking this one. Sure, heroine did make some monstrously stupid mistakes when she 1st married hero b/c of her emotional immaturity but she progressed from there. I liked how Baird portrayed her change from this naive & unwise 21-yr-old who believed what others said about her husband & run away from him instead of confronting/discussing things with him to an insightful & practical woman who thinks before she acts & confronts issues even if uncomfortable. Like heroine, hero failed in clearly verbalizing his motives, feelings, & thoughts with heroine thus adding to their relationship problems. Hero is the restrained & well-controlled type but it masks a romantic & vulnerable heart. It was really sweet to find out later how he sacrificed his dream job just so he can be close to her. I really refreshing to read hero & heroine fully discussed their past & present misunderstandings. Heroine wanted to make sure that they had total honesty & tackled their issues. Many HP books fail in this regard, where we as readers are supposed to believe & be satisfied that things are well with hero & heroine b/c they're saying \\"I love you\\" to each other. Baird takes the book resolution to a satisfying & believable conclusion by making her characters talk & explain things to each other with their \\"I love you\\"s.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Valentine Child","review":"Back Cover description: When Zoe's baby arrived on February 14, it seemed only natural to call him Valentine!

But, welcome to the real world James. Ask uncle Bill about this. Keep dream on, dream the bad dreams."},{"Title":"The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems","review":"In The Death of Competition, James Moore asks us to reconsider the way we think about business at the most basic level. In this thought provoking analysis, Moore takes us from the Hawaiian Islands to the jungles of Costa Rica, and from war torn Mogadishu to the boardrooms of Wal-Mart and Intel. Clearly this is a book that goes far beyond the standard boundaries of a \\"business\\" book.Moore tells us that we need to consider our business as being part of an \\"ecosystem\\". Whereas the value chain would encompass suppliers and distributors, the ecosystem is much broader. Members of the ecosystem may sell complimentary products, after sales services, or other products and services that are vital to the overall customer experience. Even when considering the members of the value chain, Moore tells us to think in terms of the ecosystem, and look for ways of making the connections deeper, stronger, and more to our advantage. Among other examples, Moore shows us how Wal-Mart, by forging relationships with suppliers that are much closer than the classic manufacturer-retailer relationship, has positioned itself at the center of an ecosystem that is stable and strong. In another section, he compares the way that Intel fostered an ecosystem around the Pentium line of microprocessors, and how the diversity and strength of this ecosystem kept other \\"ecosystems\\" such as Apple and Next, from encroaching. He also showed how Apple made it more difficult for other members of its ecosystem to co-evolve, making the entire Apple centered ecosystem weaker.The central theme of the book is that business ecosystems, like biological ecosystems, evolve. Each of these evolutionary stages brings both opportunities and threats, and the businesses within ecosystems need to understand both the status of the ecosystem they are in, and their role in it, or they risk extinction.First, Moore compares ecosystems in Hawaii and Costa Rica, showing how an isolated and protected ecosystem, such as Hawaii, can give rise to a rich and diverse ecosystem, but one that is fragile and easily overwhelmed by invading species. By comparison, the ecosystem of the Costa Rican jungle, on the bridge between North and South America, gives rise to species that have had to protect their niches from invaders on a regular basis, the result is a hardier, more robust ecosystem.Having established the metaphor, Moore takes us through the four stages of ecosystem evolution: pioneering, growth, maturation, and renewal or death. First, he traces the history of the automotive industry ecosystems through all four stages, then he presents an in depth case study for each stage. The case studies are rich, diverse, and fascinating, ranging from the creation of a telephone system in Mogadishu to the prospects for health care in the U.S. Throughout the case studies Moore shows how decisions are made, and the effects of those decisions. In some of the most interesting analyses of the book, Moore examines the 7 \\"dimensions\\" of the ecosystem (customers, market, offers, processes, organizations, stakeholders, and values and policy) and shows how each of the dimensions evolve as the ecosystem evolves. He also shows us how to tell which stage of ecosystem evolution we are in, and what the critical success factors for each stage.One of the most interesting, and surprising aspects of the book was Moore's emphasis on social responsibility, particularly for leading companies. An example of this emphasis is seen in the chapter on Wal-Mart. Moore notes that in many communities, Wal-Mart has completely displaced other retailers, and has done so in such an effective manner that there is no room for alternatives to enter the space. This strategy of \\"space packing\\" behind secure boundaries, has allowed Wal-Mart to grow into a huge organization and stable ecosystem. At the same time, Moore notes that this strategy leaves communities vulnerable to Wal-Mart, and hence opens Wal-Mart to a greater level of scrutiny than most other businesses. \\"In short, Wal-Mart is not just another business within its environment, and it should not expect to be treated as one. Perhaps the largest managerial challenge facing Wal-Mart today is how to invest in the relationship building, the public campaigning, and the substantive policy studies to assume its role as a leader of communities.\\" Wow! Not just a business, but a leader of communities.Moore carries this idea further in the final chapter, as he asks us first to think about our personal \\"ecosystems\\", and then to put the business ecosystem into a wider context. Moore states \\"As you invest in your own personal learning system and begin to experience problems more holistically,... a shift occurs in your perspective.\\" First, he asks us to consider how \\"business is totally dependent on society\\", and how the \\"changing tides in a society\\" create the environment in which business operates. Next, he asks us to consider economic systems as subsystems of biological systems. After all, if all economic systems were eliminated, biological systems would still exist, but if the biological system were eliminated, the economic systems would not last very long. The upshot of this line of thought is that business needs to consider the impact it has as a business ecosystem interacts with and sometimes clashes with societal and biological ecosystems.And it was here, in these final thoughts that Moore impressed me the most, and showed how this book is broader in scope, and more important than most other business books. No, this book won't tell you how to get new customers tomorrow, how to beat your competition or squeeze more productivity out of your employees. All this book will do is ask you to reconsider everything you thought about business and its place in society. That, I would say makes this book one of the most important books you could read."},{"Title":"The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems","review":"The ecosystem approach to analyzing industries described by Moore is powerful.

Anderson's recent biography of de Vere is also good and more fun to read, but Looney goes much more deeply into the span of basic arguments behind his conclusion that de Vere wrote all of \\"Shakespeare's\\" work, including closely examining the poetry that appeared under de Vere's own name and how it links to Shakespeare's poems and plays.Looney doesn't spend a lot of pages on why Shakespeare of Stratford is unlikely to have written the works, but he does get into that some. A fun way to enter that topic is Mark Twain's short, marvelous \\"Is Shakespeare Dead Yet?\\"Looney's style is outmoded, sometimes verbose and overly insistent, but there's so much meat on them bones that, if the subject matters to you, you'll get past these stylistic irritations. If they bug you too much, read Anderson instead.One of the fascinating things is that Looney apparently began with a set of criteria, based on Shakespeare's works, about who their author must likely have been, and then used those criteria to pick out de Vere as the most likely candidate.Although Looney's study was limited by knowledge still undiscovered at the time about de Vere's life (including his trial for atheism and other nastiness and his having a child with Anne Vavasor who was probably the dark lady of the sonnets), pretty much everything essential that Looney writes seems consistent with those more recent discoveries.If you started exploring the authorship question with Alan Nelson's very recent biography of de Vere, don't let yourself think Nelson has answered the question without reading Looney and/or Anderson."},{"Title":"\\"Shakespeare\\" identified in Edward De Vere, the seventeenth earl of Oxford,","review":"Looney's double-o is for emphasis, in some languages, e.g. Dutch, as in 'brooch' - everyone points out he isn't pronounced to rhyme with 'loony'. This book was published in 1920, after some years' work. It's not the first alternative authorship book: in 1910 for example a Baconian work was published. Looney is always described as a schoolmaster or teacher in Gateshead (a town on the other side of the Tyne from Newcastle), though so far as I know, no school in the area claims him.Looney's method was to comb the plays for clues as to character, then comb what's known of the Elizabethan world for a person to match, detective fashion. It would be inaccurate to state that controversy raged thereafter. He was largely ignored and shrugged off. But he must have made a bit of impact, since one volume of Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga mentions the theory.This book therefore has some historical significance. Just a few notes:[1] It's a tremendous proving-ground for theories of revisionism. Every possible attitude - derision, contempt, accusations of ignorance, etc - and every possible style of counter-argument - pulling of rank, ridicule, concentration on trivia etc - has been used against Looney, and, for that matter, by his supporters when on the defensive.[2] In principle, deletion of the 'Stratford man' (probably an illiterate war profiteer in food) should allow a far better appreciation of the Elizabethan period. This means historians would have to do some hard work, however. (One edition of this book included an excellent description by Capt. Ward of England as engaged in a war with Spain, comparable with the First World War, and far removed from the ahistorical merrie England stereotype of for example 'Shakespeare in Love').[3] What does it matter? - Well, there's an effect on educational theory. Occasionally , educators look at the real world, and even more occasionally, at genius. Their view of 'Shakespeare' therefore is of some importance. If the traditional story is correct, genius can appear anywhere, even to someone of little education, who is thought to be able to deduce almost everything about the world. But if Looney is right, education is of paramount importance. Present-day acceptance of poor educational standards therefore owes something to the 'Shakespeare' myth.________________I haven't seen this paperback, which I assume is a straight reprint of the 1920 book, 1920 typography and all.Looney struck lucky - on his quest he found just one single published poem by Oxford, 'Women', which conformed to his checklist of characteristics. This was the clue which he followed up relentlessly.There's a two volume American edition of 1975, edited by Ruth Lloyd Miller, which of course has added material - including a good piece by a Captain Ward, pointing out that there was war with Spain at the time and that as a result there was widespread poverty, famine, and high food prices. The 'merrie England' stuff as in 'Shakespeare in Love' is fnatasy. Miller's volumes are lavishly produced with may monochrome and colour reproductions of portraits etc.However; I do have something of a warning. De Vere put his own life story into his plays and sonnets. As you come to understand 'Shakespeare' it becomes clear that de Vere was an aristocrat obsessed by his own sidelining - he was a monstrous egotist. His work describes Elizabeth's court with unsparing accuracy, but beneath it all is an aristocratic world view with no room for the masses - unless they are amusing writer/actor types.A further point: the 'Shakspere' mythology has been guarded by a ridiculous corps of professional careerists. To this date, this still applies, though possibly the USA is shedding this absurd skin more successfully that Britain. However, a similar pattern is appearing amongst the Oxfordians, who have their own ring of paid journals and publications and speakers. I tried to get a 50 minute speech by Burford/Beauclerk on Youtube, to help diffuse the message more widely. He didn't want it up there, possibly on copyright grounds, or because he considered it lacklustre, though in my view it was an excellent introductory overview. Most of the content was Looney, paraphased."},{"Title":"\\"Shakespeare\\" identified in Edward De Vere, the seventeenth earl of Oxford,","review":"I bought a paperback version of this book years ago. It was revolutionary because it used logic and facts to reach it's conclusion. While some of the author's minor contentions have since been shown to be incorrect, the main thrust of the book, the assertion that Edwards De Vere wrote the works of Shake-speare has been continually gaining evidence ever since. If you like Shakespeare and have an open mind about the authorship, this will change how you view the plays. Many things which were confusing, now make sense in light of events in De Vere's life which is very connected to events in the plays."},{"Title":"\\"Shakespeare\\" identified in Edward De Vere, the seventeenth earl of Oxford,","review":"The Kindle edition of this book IS UNREADABLE.

Just suppress those thoughts and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Runway zero-eight,","review":"I have been a fan of Arthur Hailey since reading HOTEL back in the 1960s, now having almost all his work in hardcover editions. While at Goodwill, my favorite low price bookstore, I came upon a hardcover copy of RUNWAY ZERO-EIGHT for only a minor amount of money, how could I lose.Turns out this is one of the better books I've had the pleasure to read in quite awhile. It is a story of suspense it is true, but it is more so a story of people and their ability to work together during a crisis of massive proportion. Even after 50 years this book is one that not only offers truisms but also offers great reading enjoyment.Reading this book, which can be done in a few hours time, will prompt me to now turn to AIRPORT for another reading. Though Mr. Hailey is gone from us he has left us many enjoyable books to re-read and enjoy.One caution: I would not start reading this book unless I had the time to read it in one sitting, it is that type of book that one will not want to put down. As stated, an average reader can read through this one in only a few hour's time. But the enjoyment will last much longer.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Runway zero-eight,","review":"This book would have been so much fun if I hadn't watched the Airplane comedies prior to reading it.

Also an interesting trip back in time when a giant airliner only held 60 passengers, had 4 prop engines, and cigarettes were common place. Airplanes didn't land themselves, you were out of radar range soon after leaving the airport, and the pilot could walk the aisle to meet with the passengers.

One of the passengers was a pilot in the war. Hehas to take over when the pilot becomes incapacitated.

Trig wants to say no, but Chandler holds the aces. Chandler will pay Trig and more important see that the phony murder rap is dropped. If Trig fails to return with Carleigh, Chandler plans to retaliate by harming his father. Trig believes the vicious man because the Judge killed his brother.Trig catches up to Carleigh before she reaches Mexico. However, she manages to escape and continue on her trek for she needs to meet her mother whom she was led to believe by her father was dead. He captures her again and again, but finally agrees to escort her to see her mother before taking her back to her father. On the trip south together, Carleigh and Trig fall in love, but her father remains a formidable person that they will need to deal with if they are to find happiness.This is an exciting western romance that brings to life the gay nineties from a not so elegant perspective. The story line is loaded with action as the lead couple deals with a lot more than just what her father does.

This books storyline is based on lies, secrets and a host of unpleasantness.The hero has his own motives and the heroine is frankly a spoiled brat who wants to be treated like a queen but is extremly naive about the ways of the world.Implausibilities abound- like fifty pages into the book the author has the two characters having sex while barely knowing more than each others names, and the hero forces his way into her room.Simply annoying-this author can do better than this. Skip this one:(2 stars."},{"Title":"Deutsche Sprache Und Landeskunde","review":"Deutsche Sprache und Landeskunde is a well-developed text for a first-year German course. In the preface, the authors specifically state that the book was designed after extensive research to avoid the shortcomings of other texts; in particular, they highlight features such as simple grammar explanations, thematically-controlled vocabulary introduction, balanced skill development, cultural relevance in readings and dialogues, and ample activities and \\"engaging exercises.\\" The book consistently lives up to those promises. Although the book was clearly written for the undergraduate level, it might also be appropriate for mature or advanced high-school level students.One of the first features of the book that appears particularly attractive is its well-planned layout. Each chapter is organized around a theme, and the themes are ordered in a natural sequence, presenting the experiences of an American exchange student in Germany (Rick) and a German exchange student in America (Renate). For example, the first chapter, Gru&szlig; und Abschied, presents greetings and introductory phrases; following chapters include Ankunft in Europa, Erste Eindr&uuml;cke von Deutschland, and Eine Reise durch Deutschland. These are followed by chapters about national customs, shopping, home life, free-time activities and sport, University studies, and so on. The themes seem quite natural, not artificial, and they would likely be appealing to many students, who would naturally consider learning a language as a means to using it in the land(s) where it is spoken.Each chapter is divided into six units, each of which has a consistent style across the book: 1) Vorschau (\\"Preview\\") - a \\"cognitive overview\\" of the chapter's theme and core vocabulary. Most have drawings with vocabulary labeled, or occasionally photographs. These are followed by exercises to practice the vocabulary: fill-in-the-blank, word matching, sentence creation, free-style question answering.2) Phonologie (\\"Phonology\\") - a short one or two page unit on a particular sound in German. (The book itself is prefaced by a two-page introduction to the letters and sounds of the language). While this section is an obvious attempt to make sure that phonological topics are spread throughout the text and not just lumped (and overlooked) at the start, the effect is that material that would be useful near the start of the course - the critical German ch sounds [] and [X], for example, - are found nearly at the end of the book. This is definitely material beginners would need early-on.3) Sequenzen (\\"Sequences\\") - These form the heart of each chapter, presenting concise grammatical lessons in well-organized units. Each starts with a short dialog that demonstrates the structure or concept for that particular sequence. The dialogues are quite natural - they follow the \`theme' of the chapter, usually having to do with one of the two exchange students - and they employ short but meaningful sentences that students could quite easily learn and also put to use. They are followed by content-based questions in German, both objective and subjective, designed to check students' understanding of the passage and to provide practice in using its forms. An English translation of the dialog, using every-day colloquial forms, appears at the bottom of the page. Next come the grammatical units - first, a brief description, never more than a few paragraphs, followed by a series of examples, often in table format and almost always using real German sentences. Here, the book lives up to its promise of making grammatical explanations simple - even topics late in the text are never given the appearance of being ponderous. Exceptions or finer points are often noted at the bottom of the page. A generous number of exercises in German follow each grammatical topic, enough to provide even those students feeling challenged by the material with plenty of practice. The exercises usually start with pattern-practice drills, followed by simple substitution and transformation drills, then sentence completion drills and open-ended exercises for freer student expression.Taken together, this combination of an inductive introduction to material, followed by a deductive explanation with examples in natural, useable German, capped with a variety of exercises, provides an excellent and highly useable coverage of the grammar of the language.4) Sammeltext (\\"Collected Text\\") - Following the grammar units is a one- or two-page text in German designed to review and reinforce the grammar structures and the vocabulary encountered in the chapter. Designed as reading practice, they usually take the form of a letter, dialogue, or short monologue. Incidental vocabulary is glossed in the side margins of the page. No exercises follow.5) Kulturecke (\\"Culture Corner\\") - Next in each chapter is a short cultural unit related to the current topic: forms for writing letters, the media, public transport, the Kaffee und Kuche tradition (German \\"tea time\\"), the school and university systems, etc. This cultural information is the gem of the book -- avoiding glib stereotypes, it introduces students to the commonalities and differences between American and German life. (Unfortunately, the inclusion of Switzerland and Austria as the final two chapters makes them seem almost like an afterthought).6) Wortschatz (\\"Vocabulary\\") - At the end of each chapter, new vocabulary is summarized by part of speech, with lists in German and English side-by-side.Every chapter also starts with a page describing the language and cultural objectives for the unit, along with a brief outline of material. The objectives are well written - not only describing what will be discussed, but also why a student might use such material in real-world situations.Following each chapter is a mini-unit on blue pages called a Zwischenspiel (\\"in-between game\\") presenting excellent additional material for communication practice - oral situations and dialogues to be acted out, short readings, and writing exercises. An Endspiel unit at the end of the book presents a brief excerpt from the D&uuml;rrenmatt play, \\"Das Unternehmen der Wega.\\" Unlike the exercises within the chapters, which stay quite close to the ongoing themes of the two exchange students, these exercises are based around situations in average German life, and provide excellent material to create opportunities for individual and group student practice in using all four language skills from the start.The book includes an Appendix that summarizes the key information about German verbs - both regular and irregular (\\"weak\\" and \\"strong\\") verbs - in a tabular format in under eight pages. This can serve as a handy reference for students and as a learning aid for those whose learning style makes them inclined to prefer a more structured, rather than descriptive, approach. The addition of tables summarizing pronoun cases and adjective declensions would have been useful.One criticism with the layout of the text is that, in trying to present such a wealth of material for a year's course in German language and culture in 600 pages, the text itself appears simply too dense. The book could benefit from more white space, and perhaps differing type styles to differentiate types of material - explanations, exercises, dialogues. It could be daunting for some students to approach, and certainly could not be covered in its entirety by any typical class."},{"Title":"Tips to Fly By: Thousands of PIC Hours' Worth of Tips and Tricks of the Trade (General Aviation Reading series)","review":"As a private pilot, I have purchased video tapes etc. from one of the more popular pilot supply houses where Mr. Collins hosts the many video titles under the vendor's name.

The current fascist regime in China, the pseudo-Stalinist Putin in Russia, and the lunatic regimes of North Korea and Iran are all ticking time bombs. Therefore, I ask every family to buy this amazing book as a rational and modest insurance policy against the unthinkable.As the other reviewers have stated, this book is excellent. It begins by debunking all of the doomsday myths that have been generated regarding nuclear weapons, such as nuclear winter and radiation lasting centuries. It is stated plainly that nuclear war would be the worst tragedy in human history, but there is virtually no chance that it is an extinction-level event for Homo Sapiens. All the facts are verified by scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, although the book clearly states if some data or charts might be outdated. I now firmly believe that nuclear war is survivable for the vast majority of Americans and that we should plan for survival and not decimation.It then lists the actual real-world effects of nuclear war and how they can be counteracted using simple, common tools and tested and scientifically proven methods. The focus of the book is short to medium term survival, focusing on the specific threats from radiation and nutrition, so it might be advisable to supplement this essential text with other books on subsidence agriculture until modern techniques of food production can be restored.The other amazing fact about this book is that it tries to give the maximum civil defense benefit using the minimum preparation by trying to only use methods that can be done by the average American and his family, using common household supplies. For example, the book has detailed plans on how to make a fall-out meter using household supplies. Sound absurd? This fall-out meter uses the same methods as the original scientists who discovered radiation and has been verified by nuclear scientists. The book itself has paper patterns to use in its construction and how to verify the accuracy of the meter and troubleshoot any issues.I have actually made this fallout meter and have been working recently to perfect it. I am not yet at the high level of accuracy recommended in the book, but I now have an instrument that is entirely usable without electricity that can measure radiation down to 0.15 roentgens/hour. I have also gathered the supplies that are not commonly available, such as potassium iodide, and stored them for future use. I have several other items to gather, but I am very close to fulfilling the minimum preparations checklist. This may seem extreme, but I have put all of these essential preparations into 1 small Action Packer plastic box, at a very minimal cost. Although nuclear conflict is hopefully unlikely, it would be so catastrophic that to abstain from taking modest, low-cost precautions would be foolish.Again, this book is paradigm-shifting, and I cannot recommend it as highly as it truly deserves. I plan to buy several more copies for distribution among my family. I risk being judged the family oddball, but I think any fair-minded person will have their eyes opened by the 1st chapter and keep this book as an emergency supply like a fire extinguisher."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"Complete guide with very detailed information.Would highly recommend this along with \\"Principles of Protection\\", Walton W.

This book is very different and is written for the average citizen by a former U.S. Army officer, field geologist and civil engineer who built and field-tested the \\"expedient\\" shelters described within while still employed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.These shelters can be put togeather within a few hours by ordinary, untrained men and women. (It is a good idea to take a weekend and practice building them.) They provide good protection during the weeks it may take for fallout to decay to negligible levels of radioactivity. (Expedient blast shelters, which also protect against the shockwave from a nearby explosion, are also discussed.)The author is clear and thorough throughout, supplying checklists for supplies, equipment and materials; detailed building instructions and descriptions of the genuine (as opposed to fanciful) effects of nuclear weapons. There is also a valuable discussion of the purchase and use of potassium iodide compounds for protection of the thyroid gland from absorption of radioiodine. Finally, detailed plans and instructions are provided for the construction and use of a homemade fallout meter(!) to indicate radiation levels. (It is a lot more accurate than many of the over-priced, defective-or-uncalibrated war-surplus \\"Geiger counters\\" on the market!)The 2001 edition contains a new chapter on the hazards of trans-Pacific fallout, which could drift eastward to the U.S. mainland from a nuclear conflict in Asia. (Such as India vs. Pakistan, or a North Korean nuclear attack on the South or Japan.) There is also a new appendix detailing the persuasive medical and scientific evidence that low levels of ionizing radiation below a certain threshold do no harm to humans or other forms of life, or their descendants. In fact, it may make them healthier. (Far from being crackpot, this concept is known in Biology as \\"hormeisis\\" and is dicussed in a recent article in DISCOVER magazine; see \\"Is Radiation Good for You?\\", DISCOVER Vol. 23 No. 12, December 2002.) This should help to dispel the superstition that radiation is some sort of magic poison, and that any amount is deadly.Anyone not living in a fool's paradise realizes that the chance of a nuclear detonation in an American city is probably higher now than it ever was when the United States and Soviet Union were locked in mutual standoff. Nuclear deterrance may have worked even on hardened Soviet or Chinese apparatchiks; but to to depend on it alone now against psychopaths and apocalyptic fanatics is to invite hideous disaster."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"Are you bothered when you read that the Russians are building a giant underground city in the Ural Mountains? Have you ever heard of Mount Weather?The people who want the American people to cower in vulnerability to nuclear attack do not want anyone to read this book. Kearny addresses the things courageous individuals and families can do ON THEIR OWN, using the McGyver approach, to improve their chances of survival.Drop the giant-cockroach nonsense and learn the effects of blast, radiation, and fallout. Learn to build your own fallout shelter in a day using shovels, axes, and saws. Learn to make a fallout radiation meter from a coffee can, a chunk of drywall, and a piece of aluminum foil. Make a shelter ventilation fan in hours from wood laths, plastic sheeting, cord, hinges, and staples. Make a mortar-and-pestle-style grain mill from a section of steel pipe and a coffee can.The designs and procedures were developed and field tested on real-live Americans over many years at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Even if you have a merely-idle interest in technical subjects, you will enjoy this book, and it might even save your life.

Kearny's book is dead practical on surviving in your house or in a quickly built shelter in the boonies. No sentimentality here, he points out that older people should do the jobs that risk nuclear contamination, because they are less likely to live to develop cancers from it. Very good on structures, staying warm (how many layers of newspaper sheets to put under your bathrobe), lots of very clear photos and drawings, and pretty good on cooking, sanitation, and lighting, too. Just a trifle weak on nutrition, as he does not understand vegetarian protein. So don't make this the only book you take along.

And as preparedness books, and Government manuals go - this book is the BOMB!Many books on survival and preparedness are shallow, poorly researched and untested, fear mongering or written with a social or political bend. Or the advice of the book amounts to - \\"Sit tight, take notes, wait for government officials, they will save you\\". This book is none of those things. It was written by Cresson Kearny - a Rhodes scholar who was working as a research engineer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory at the time that he was asked to write this book. His other qualifications include (but are not limited to!) serving in WWII - where he worked on testing and improving jungle combat gear for US soldiers. As a demolition specialist in China (during a portion of the Japanese invasion). He was re-recruited by the US military for combat gear improvement for US soldiers in Vietnam. He also traveled the world trading knowledge with other countries on protecting civilians from the effects of a nuclear war. Etc, etc.Mr. Kearny has thoroughly researched and thought through the most likely scenarios (most relevant at the time that he wrote this book) and gives step-by-step solutions on how to deal with each problem. His solutions are simple, tested and can be implemented by almost all individuals. He advocates looking out for yourself, and gives advice on how to do so.Although this book was specifically written to address a massive nuclear war with Russia - the knowledge and approaches in this book can be applied to all disaster scenarios.

(Invented by him - the \\"Kearny Fallout Meter\\" or KFM)-detailed instructions and templates for construction of a homebuilt ventilator.-where to find food and antibiotics for you and the rest of the country, how to process that food so that it can be eaten by adults and children.

I suspect you will then want to have a hard copy on hand too.4-17-07 Addendum: one of the assumptions of this book was that our satellites (USA) would show missiles being fueled and fielded, and cities being evacuated. This would give us a 2-3 day advanced notice of a major power's (Russia's and/or China's) nuclear launch. This is no longer a good assumption.Events that have occurred since this book was written:-Russia has built and actively maintains excellent permanent shelters for most of its population.-Russia has upgraded its missiles (and continues to actively do so).-China has maintained and is actively improving its excellent system of shelters and underground facilities.-China has upgraded its missiles (and continues to actively do so at an alarming rate).When using this book keep in mind the above changes - ie don't count on the USA having a 2 day warning."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"This book is an unemotional, no-nonsence resource for anyone interested in the title's predicate. Having built and tested Kearney's radiation meter, with the household materials suggested, I am convinced of the author's practical veracity espoused in the other sections of this volume. I highly recommend this book to anyone unprejudiced by the present hypnotic malaise of a materialistic utopia and pollyanna belief in the &quot;end of history&quot;. It is worth noting that with the advent of the ICBM we became, without grasping it, a continental power, with all that this engenders. That others with ideologies bent on our destruction continue to manuever toward this end should be no surprise.To quote the great Chinese General and Strategist Sun Tsu -- &quot;All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when we are far away we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.&quot; Consider both the Russians (Soviets) and the Chinese in this light. Get busy! Pray! Have Faith!

This is the initial premise of Cresson Kearny's outstanding manual on nuclear war. Only a small number of people would be killed in the initial explosion of a nuclear blast, whether it is from a massive Russian or Chinese attack, or even a more limited terrorist attack. The \`conventional wisdom' is that there is no reason to prepare for a nuclear attack as everyone will be wiped out, most quickly and painlessly. This wisdom is completely wrong. Kearny explains in great detail what will happen during a nuclear attack, what the obvious and not so obvious dangers are, and what you should do to prepare yourself. This book was originally published in the 1970s at the height of the Cold War, but is perhaps even more relevant today given the increased threat of limited nuclear attacks by terrorists or other non-state forces.Simply put, this is a User's Manual for civil defense. What to do before a nuclear attack is likely, and how to avoid many of the post-attack dangers (particularly fallout). I'm actually surprised that this information isn't more widely disseminated in the US. In fact, among the public, there is almost no public awareness or even recognition of civil defense, only that the \`government' must have plans in place to deal with catastrophes. This is a dense tome filled with details, but even a small amount of information in this manual could be vital to an individual's or family's survival after a nuclear weapon is detonated near their home.This manual includes information on the effects of a thermonuclear detonation, how much damage is done, how wide spread it would be, the dangers of fallout, how to mitigate the effects of fallout (probably the single most important aspect of the book), how to build a shelter (both a quick, expedient shelter, and a more elaborate shelter if you have the time), the effects of radiation sickness, preparations for storing food and water, and how to build a simple but effective radiation detector. There is enough detail to keep a hardcore survivalist busy for years, but you don't need to be a hardcore survivalist to find this useful. This manual also includes enough basic information that the average American should be aware of that could make the difference between life and death. Many of the problems/issues addressed by Kearny are also relevant to other types of natural disasters or crisis situations, not just a thermonuclear attack.I have to agree with another reviewer that this manual would also be of great use to authors who want to write about nuclear war. Even if you don't think that a nuclear attack is all that likely (or you truly are living at ground zero and won't survive the initial blast), I found this to be an interesting, readable account of what to do. You can find this manual online for free, but the nice bound edition is definitely worth the $20 in my view. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"This is 'the' guide for surviving a nuclear disaster. The author worked at Oak Ridge Nuclear Facility and the government asked him to write this guide. It can be download off the web for free, but I'm a big fan of books...they still work when the power goes out. Explains the effects of a nuclear explosion as well as fallout and how to protect yourself and family. Though the drawings are a bit simplistic and 1950-60ish it gets the point across. The supply lists and preparation lists can be applied to many major disasters."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"This is an updated late-Cold War guide to the effects of nuclear weapons, survival strategies, and practical construction techniques for shelters designed to withstand special weapons effects in the wake of a nuclear exchange with a peer power. While this is available for free on the web as a pdf file, the inherent practicality of a printed and bound text makes it ideal for reference under emergency conditions.The book includes detailed instructions for shelter construction, ventilation methods, etc. These all seem workable. I would only note that creating a shelter of substance would involve a real investment of time and labour; one also has to be able to interpret and action design and construction instructions. Practice would make perfect. This would be practical in any heightening of tension scenario (still relevant, for example, on the west coast viz. North Korea), but would be less relevant to a bolt-from-the-blue terrorist strike in or near an urban area.That said, the book contains excellent myth-busting information that counters conventional uninformed assumptions about the \\"inevitability\\" of death by radiation, etc. Vital information is included about the extent of the radiation danger and its limits. This alone is necessary psychologial armament to build the necessary resistance to dispair and giving up that would probably kill more people than an actual nuke.All in all, this book is highly recommended for the information therein, and as a means of preparing oneself for a worst-case scenario. Because no matter how often Teleprompter Jesus apologizes to the world, this threat won't go away."},{"Title":"Nuclear War Survival Skills: Updated and Expanded 1987 Edition","review":"Ignore &quot;A reader from China&quot;'s review folks.

I loved it as a child (in the sixties), and love it still - although it has a VERY sad ending that still makes me cry.Reading the extract from Chapters 1 and 2 will give you a good idea of the writing quality, so I'll say little of that.As a child I though it was a child's book, but as an adult I've come to the conclusion that it was probably written as a book for \\"young ladies\\". My grandmother was in her late teens when she was given it, which backs up my theory.What makes it stand out from children's books of the era is that the children really are just like ordinary kids, getting into all sorts of mischief, but no morals are drawn. At least not overtly, and those that CAN be drawn are more along the lines of \\"this is what can happen when you stifle your children's originality and natural exuberance\\" than the more usual \\"this is what happens to naughty children\\". Not that the parents are horrible, but the father is somewhat stern and withdrawn - typical of many fathers even nowadays. He features mostly as someone who gets angry at the children's mischief, or who has to be applied to for funds. The stepmother is just lovely, although you get the feeling that the father married her more because he needed someone to look after his kids and satisfy his lusts (just because she's young and pretty, lusts are not mentioned in the book) than because they were in love. But then as far as I can see love didn't really come into marriage much in those days.The What Katy Did books are the closest American comparison I can think of, but they are very goody-two-shoes-ish and moralistic compared with Seven Little Australians. This book is what made me realise, as a child, that children born \\"in the olden days\\" were just like we were.In general, this is a jolly good book. Get it, you'll love it. (But make sure a hanky is at hand when you get close to the end)."},{"Title":"Seven Little Australians","review":"Set in Sydney, Australia in 1880's, seven children get into all sorts of mischief even though they are trying their best to behave. Ranging in ages from sixteen to one year, the Woolcot children are mostly left to their own devices. Their step-mother Esther, the birth mother of only the youngest, is just twenty and has no experience with children. Their father is a military man and expects his children to behave and only to show up when he expects them to.I have been wanting to read this book for several years. I was able to download a copy to my Playbook and read most of this adorable story in one sitting. I really don't want to start telling you about the events that happen in the childrens' days, but I can assure you that they didn't set out to get into trouble, those things just seem to happen in this family. I suppose it might have been different had they had a nanny to see to their needs.Author Ethel Turner wrote over 40 novels and has been the longest in print author in Australia. She also wrote further about the Woolcot children in: The Family at Misrule, Little Mother Meg, and Judy and Punch."},{"Title":"Seven Little Australians","review":"An interestingly modern book, in that there are no \`lessons' to be learnt, as in most children's books of the era. The narrative arc seems to stop short. The crisis has no resolution, we are left bereft.There is a remarkable freedom to the children's lives. No parental involvement, much freedom of movement, very little formal education or religion.The father is absent, neglectful, from a modern perspective abusive. He is absent even in the standards of the time - his children are unusual in that they eat separately to their parents. His \`discipline' stems from anger, he leads the children to incriminate themselves then punishes them, he banishes his daughter from the family unit indefinitely.The mother is another \`child' only four years older than the eldest daughter, and inexperienced.The children are drawn as true characters - neither good, nor bad, but trying to do their best, making mistakes, sometimes putting their own needs ahead of their \`duties', but caring and loving of each other.The children have no adult to help guide them, so they are thrown upon each other.Meg is an empty vessel, and looks to the dubious role models of friends. Her \`mistakes' are corrected through well meant advice from others who have no role in her upbringing.Pip is the only one to attend a day school. He is not punished for his part in incidents where his sister is fully held to account.Judy is the best drawn character, she has a distinct voice, has motivation for her actions. She is the one who is not obedient and passive, but takes control of the situations she finds herself in.Nell is beautiful and of no other interestBunty is dirty, fat and lazy, totally self centred, a liar and \`weak' He is the least appealing of the children. His appearance and morality are interchangeableBaby is \`cute'The youngest child, 'The General' is their responsibility - they are his carers, and this inappropriate burden for children has the greatest repercussions for Judy - who is banished for neglecting his care, and loses all in protecting him.Remarkably, the story still resonates after 100 years. This is the Australian version of the Vonn Trapps, without a Maria to save them."},{"Title":"Seven Little Australians","review":"Growing up we had an unabricged audio book of the Seven Little Australians in our house. It used to exert an uncontrollable power over me. I did not want to listen to it because I knew how upsetting I would find the ending but I couldn't help listening to it on account of how enjoyable the preceding story was. Inevitably it would come out on long car journeys or on holidays and I would sit transfixed. This is the only book that ever made me cry and I can still remember great chunks of it off by heart. The opening lines set the tone \\"None of the children in this story were ever really good for the excellent reason that Australian children never are...\\" This is the story of seven children growing up in middle class poverty, their father is an army officer, it includes their triumphs and failures the embarrasment of first love and early adolescence and the need for caring parents who just do not exist in the world of the story. To say more about the plot would diminish the joy of a book that is full of joy and heartache.The two characters that mose appealed to me as a child were the two wickedest Judy, who had quicksilver in her veins instead of blood, and poor doomed Bunty whose every action was designed to lead him into troble. I identified with poor Bunty who was always outshone by his older siblings. As an adult however it is Meg and Pip (and Esther the twenty year old step-mother) who move me more - though the charm of the book lies in its wide appeal. This is a must read for those girls who read Little Women and Little House on the Prairie but who are not yet old enough for the Bronte Sisters."},{"Title":"Seven Little Australians","review":"The Judy's death led me to recall some similar cases in my person knowledge. This is the fate: someone escapes from duty to see his/her relatives, likely this is the last visit.In this story Judy ran away from boarding school to see her family, which is her last visit.For another example to illustrate this fate, my father-in-law once visited his mother and relatives during his errand. Thereafter, he had to go on another errand, during which he met the great earthquake in Tangshan, China, on August 28, 1976, and died."},{"Title":"The Lake At The End Of The World","review":"I'm a fourty+ year old female who enjoys reading young adult books to review for school bookclubs. I highly recommend this story for young readers probably starting at fifth grade/over ten years old.The style of the book is told through the alternating eyes of the two young people, Hector and Diana, in the year 2025. They may be the youngest people left in the world. Hector having lived underground in a cave all his life and Diana living with just her family alone by a lake nearby, neither knowing the others have existed.It is not the world we know today - read the book and you'll be reading a great story about how the world changed by the year 2025. You'll slowly learn what has happened and in the end you'll wish there was more to the story, or use your imagination to imagine what they're life and the world will be like as they grow older.The review by V.Chang is inaccurate when he wrote \\"In the past, because of a worldwide plague, a group of people: musicians, engineers, plumbers, carpenters, scientists, etc. escape down to the underground for safety.\\" He is refering to the people Hector has lived with and they \\"escaped\\" underground in the late sixties under the guise by their leader that a nuclear disaster was imminent. It is in much later years that unexplained things occur causing people to die in huge numbers.Also there is the sentence \\"Diana is the headstrong girl living in a house near the underground community. Both of them meet and soon get to know each other \\"well.\\"\\" I personally find the use of the word- well - with quotes around it to imply something very grown up in the way the two children have a relationship and that is not the case.Hopefully this book will come back into print but until then it is worth looking for at the library! For a simular books I would recommend:The City of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau for kids in fourth grade and older.For teens I would recommend Z for Zachariah by Robert C. O'Brien, out of print but well worth finding."},{"Title":"The Lake At The End Of The World","review":"This is an excellent book. Set in the year 2025, it follows two main characters, Hector and Diana, and what they experience as two teenagers in a world that is so no longer &quot;normal&quot;. The story is told from both perspectives - Hector's story and Diana's story. It is about strangers who learn to trust each other in a world where a disaster has wiped out all but a few of the world's population. Keeping in mind that this is a book written for young adults, it is well written and easy to follow - complex enough to be interesting to adults and simple enough to keep the attention of a young reader. My only complaint is that it left me wanting more - it really needs a sequel. My husband and 11 year old daughter give it 4 stars as well and also believe there should have been a sequel."},{"Title":"The Lake At The End Of The World","review":"The Lake at the End of the World by Caroline MacDonald is fantastic and dramatic tale of what life would be like because of the hazards to the environment.The novel is set in the year 2025. In the past, because of a worldwide plague, a group of people: musicians, engineers, plumbers, carpenters, scientists, etc. escape down to the underground for safety. Under the guidance of a man called the Counsellor, the people down there are relatively safe from the death and turmoil on the surface, with chemical disasters and environmental dangers occuring every day. Fast forward to the present.The book is told through the perspective of Hector and Diana. Hector is a boy from the underground. He and his trusty dog Stewart venture through the mazes and tunnels of the underground to the surface, where they discover surprising sights and sounds. Diana is the headstrong girl living in a house near the underground community. Both of them meet and soon get to know each other \\"well.\\"However, because of an injury and a ban, Hector is forced to escape the underground and go back to the outside world, where Diana and her parents Evan and Beth take him in. There he discovers the story of the outside: the real events and all the wonders of the lake near them. However, a problem arises with the underground and both Hector and Diana are forced to go underground again to save the entire underground group from a deep, dark fate and conspiracy.The book is very well written and is excellent for secondary students.

Mr. Crail had hit Irma Begley's car, and an offer to repair her car and pay her bills soon led to a quick marriage. Georgia wants Cool & Lam to investigate Irma and the Rendezvous business she wants Ellery to buy (Chapter 1). Lam discovers Irma had been in an earlier accident (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 tells about the Rendezvous clubs that operated in the afternoon. Lam is recognized and told to leave. Lam interviews the other man who was sued by Irma Begley, and meets someone from the Rimley Rendezvous. Billy Prue has information, and explains it to Lam. But when she returns to her apartment she finds a dead body (Chapter 5).The police arrive to take their statements (Chapter 7). Bertha Cool was traced from her earlier accident (while investigating). Lam learns about the dead man's nephew (Chapter 8) and his relationship with Billy Prue. Lam gets a surprising telephone call after the murder weapon is found (Chapter 9). Who could have planted it? Could a clock be changed to create an alibi? Billy Prue tells Lam about Stanberry's racket (Chapter 10). Chapter 12 explains how multiple parties can be held liable for one accident. But one party can make a deal with the plaintiff. Is there a reason why this case should be settled out of court? Can a person be sued to sway their testimony (Chapter 13)? Or to influence a witness? The testimony about the accident sounds like a real court case (Chapter 14). [This is a lesson in testifying about an auto accident when unprepared. If you are ever in an accident write down all the details as soon as possible. Lawyers earn a living by analyzing testimony and making opposing witnesses sound stupid.]There is a surprise when the lawyers want to settle out of court (Chapter 15). Miss Rushe had a change of mind. [There is more humor in this chapter.] As part of the settlement Lam gets the names of the witnesses and the license numbers of every car that was there. Lam reviews the notes and finds a surprise that leads to a solution of the conflict (Chapter 16). Lam figures out why the handle of that ax was sawn through (Chapter 17). Detective Frank Sellers arrives to conclude the story; the ending is a surprise (Chapter 18). The last chapter ties up the loose ends. [I found the ending to be sort of tacked-on].

Tonia and her sister Lou grow up thick as thieves in a world apart from their extremely detached parents and the other kids in town. Tonia particularly is dreamier and more sensitive than the gregarious Lou. Whenever things become too much, she retreats to that quiet and calm place in her mind she dubs Listening Valley. There she can suss things out on her own time and make sense of them. When Lou runs off to get married at 18, Tonia is left alone, unhappy, and unsure of who she is and what she wants to be. When offered independence and the opportunity to leave her parents' home, she makes a difficult command decision and accepts an offer of marriage from a wealthy, but kindly older man. Soon Tonia finds herself in London amidst bombings and rationing and her life is suddenly filled with purpose as it had never been before. This time is not to last, however, and Tonia eventually finds herself back in Scotland attempting to refashion her life once more.Above all, this is a sweet story about life and growing up, leaving home, and finding it again. I enjoyed watching Tonia become more at ease in her own skin over the years, so much so that she is able to not only take care of herself but others as well. These others include the funny and endearing inhabitants of Ryddelton as well as the boys of the RAF who congregate at Tonia's. Tonia herself is so very fragile in the beginning, but by the end I felt like she would be quite all right, come what may. That she was, indeed, someone who would \\"go out with you in any weather.\\" That kind of transformation was gratifying to watch and the story as a whole both pleasant and touching.

It has three main themes, clearly defined in the introduction.The first is the love between Adrienne Monnier and Sylvia. The details of this, so we are told, 'were and are still little known' in 1983 when this book was first published. The second is her admiration for, and championship of, James Joyce. The third is her bookshop, Shakespeare and Company, which was a key feature of the literary scene in Paris between the two World Wars.By far the most detail is provided on her professional relationship with Joyce. Her efforts to get Ulysses published and smuggled into America, her financial and personal efforts to support the author, and the amount of time and energy she invested, are the key theme of the book.Naturally Sylvia knew all the other familiar literary figures of the time. Hemingway and Pound are frequently mentioned, as is Gertrude Stein.As intimated in the introduction there is less to be said about more personal relationships. In a way this seems rather a pity. The anecdotal style and recurring references to various incidents along the way give the writing a rather disjointed feel. Inevitably there is also a certain sense of d&eacute;ja vu particularly for anyone familiar with biographies of Hemingway for example.The strength and the weakness of the book is the amount of text devoted to James Joyce. Joyce attracts great, but not universal, enthusiasm. The man himself seems to have had more arrogance than charm. Depending on the side of this divide which the reader favours this book will firmly hold the attention or will, in places, rather pall."},{"Title":"An empirical test of the incentive effects of deposit insurance: the case of junk bonds at savings and loan associations.: An article from: Journal of Money, Credit & Banking","review":"Noel Riley Fitch may not know everything about the artists and writers of early to mid- twentieth century Paris, but she certainly comes close. Just as Sylvia Beach and her French counterpart Adrienne Monnier between them seemed to know all the English-speaking and French writers of Paris, respectively. Sylvia Beach owned Shakespeare and Company, an English language bookstore and Ms. Monnier, on the opposite side of rue de l'Odeon, owned La Maison des Amis des Livres. Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation is an excellent biography of Ms. Beach which details her involvement with literary Paris, especially the time between the wars. If there is a very heavy emphasis on her involvement with James Joyce and her publishing the many editions of Ulysses, that was the reality of her life. And if Mr. Joyce comes across as a self-preoccupied schemer, who showed Sylvia Beach very little gratitude for all she did for him practically gratis, well, that was the reality of her life, too.Paris between the two world wars was a fascinating place and Sylvia Beach was in the thick of it. As the author says in her introduction, \\"Sylvia Beach created a literary center that magnetically attracted artists from all over the world during what Archibald McLeish calls the \`greatest period of literary and artistic innovation since the Renaissance.\\" T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Andre Gide, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Samuel Beckett, Leon Edel, Janet Flanner, Virgil Thompson, Paul Valery, and Thornton Wilder to name a few, were part of Shakespeare and Company in a real sense.The full title of this book is Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation: A History of Literary Paris in the Twenties & Thirties, and an excellent literary history it is. Highly recommended.

I learned quite a lot about Sylvia Beach, but still found her somewhat mysterious. Because of this book I altered the path of my standard jog around the Jardin Luxembourg to include number 12, rue de l'Odeon (now a trendy dress shop) and touch the walls that held the first printed copies of Ulysses and inside which Hemingway discovered Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and went on to change the world because of it. There is something sad about the fact that this site is not a modernist museum or temple of some kind. The story of Hemingway personally liberating the bookshop seems a bit farfetched but seems to have been well verified and the fact that he then rode off in his tank to \\"liberate the wine cellar at the Ritz\\" speaks volumes! Fitch seems to have filled a niche and written extensively about American expatriates during this period in a way that lets readers focus on the work rather than the personalities. In our celebrity obsessed culture, this is a great thing."},{"Title":"An empirical test of the incentive effects of deposit insurance: the case of junk bonds at savings and loan associations.: An article from: Journal of Money, Credit & Banking","review":"Sylvia Beach knew everyone who was anyone in the Paris in which she lived. She was the publisher of James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\", and was his financial savior at the expense of her own economic needs. ON PBS, I saw a documentary about her, and immediately bought this book. It does not disappoint. The author writes with an ability to explain the atmosphere of the period, the mores extant, and the incredible number of famous people who inhabited this world.Among the famous characters in her world (and all realistically portrayed) were Hemingway and his women, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T. S. Eliot, etc. Stephen Spender and William Butler Yeats gave readings in her book store. Basically everyone who was anyone during that time knew Sylvia.One of the unintended consequences of my reading this book was that I found James Joyce to be a real jerk. Basically, he was not a nice man; he was an awful combination of arrogance and humility, and he seemed to feel he was under appreciated by everyone, even his greatest acolyte, Sylvia Beach.This is definitely a must read for anyone who is interested in this period - it's one of the best I've read. Sylvia Beach lived a life that many women of that period could only dream of, and the author has captured her life and her milieu beautifully. The book is also excellently indexed, and has informative notes. My only (selfish) complaint is that I wish there were more photographs (16 pages weren't enough for me).I highly recommend this biography."},{"Title":"The roots of reconstruction","review":"This book should be required reading in every classroom in the Western World.

For anyone who loves honor, adventure, love, and bravery, I highly recommend this or any other Arthurian book."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur was written while Malory served time as a political prisoner in the Tower of London; the comprehensive nature of the text attests to Malory's abundance of free time. Indeed, the knight-author compiled his tales of Camelot and its surrounding characters--knights and ladies alike--from numerous French romances on the subject. Note that the stories were originally romances; Malory, of course, added his own English slant to the stories, and they gain a considerable amount of gruesomeness because of his decidedly English imagination. But these stories of Arthur were originally bloody, as well. The French romances were probably gleaned from the Welsh Mabinogion, translated to the Gallic sensibilities, and purified, as it were, by Malory.The book itself is probably not one for those of us who are wrapped up in the details of everyday existence. Like much of Arthuriana, the details are left to the imagination of the reader/interpreter. More happens--more knights are killed, more ladies are saved, more tilts are tilted--in two pages of Malory than in all of Don DeLillo's books combined. (See what we've lost in our modern world? The will to act has dwindled because we're not exposed to enough action in our everyday lives. But I digress . . .)Le Morte D'Arthur has become the canon of Arthuriana, and the construction of the compilation of stories mirrors another canon, the Bible. As in the Bible, stories are repeated in different sections. Different characters do different things in different stories. But it's okay. We still love it. And we love it because it's part of our collective heritage. It's even seeped into our pop culture in musicals and animated feature films. The staying power of the stories may have something to do with the Bible, as well. Arthur is messianic in the purest sense; as the &quot;Once and Future King,&quot; he will come again to rule in glory. With every reprint of Le Morte D'Arthur, we insure that this statement will never ring untrue."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Ever read the Bible? Shakespeare?

I downloaded it because although I have read much of the book already, I needed something to listen to on long road trips.The narrator's voice is the definition of irritating, posh, effeminate British dandy. He almost sounds condescending and his voice grates the ears. It becomes comical when he does the ladies' voices.I love the story. I just wish they had an actual human being read it. This guy makes me feel like the Knights of the Round Table were all just prancing around on ponies and fretting over their manicures and pencil thin mustaches. The sound of the voice is annoying enough, like nails on chalkboard. Worse, his reading removes all gravity from the text.Obviously, this is a personal opinion and my own problem. If you can get past the voice, this is one of the greatest story arcs ever written. That is if you enjoy this sort of mythology.

Here we are introduced to Tristan and Isolde, Lancelot, The Fisher King ... the &quot;usual&quot; cast of characters. We develop some background understanding of their actions and motivations as a result of Malory's exposition. This particular edition of the tales is translated into modern prose; I own another edition (published in the late 19th C.) that is more heavy going due to the stylized writing. My only caveat on &quot;Morte d'Arthur&quot; is that the tales are not always linear. Sometimes they represent things that are happening simultaneously, which may give the impression of the author jumping back and forth in time.

The slow and constant testing of human nature which this book portrays with its heart breaking finale sings with the kind of pain that only joy and the failure of joy can offer. Whoever the real Arthur was is immaterial compared to the moral vision of this right old book and shows with utmost psychological acuity the Catholic visionary landscape of the Middle Ages fall, shatter, and finally fade. Logre was an impossible glory, something unattainable. The mere Britain that succeeds it is only politics.There is a lost world at the bottom of the book that is best revealed in the denial of the Sangreal to Launcelot. Launcelot was the greatest man who ever lived but that wasn't great enough.And so, Logre fell.\\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" is necessary.

We allknow of the sword Excalibur. We allknow of glorious Camelot. So whatmakes these tales stand above allelse? We all long for what wecannot have. Is there a man alivewho isn't seeking a true lover asGuinevere? Is there an ignorantfool among us who doesn't desirepeace or true love or fulfillment ofthe soul?

It is a sensational book(sectioned into either eight ortwenty one books, depending upon thesource) for all members of thefamily. It should be read, andreread often. Here I must voice mystrong opinion that this a book notmeant to be read in modern English.Keith Baines' modern interpretationof Malory's book is a wonderfulcompanion volume to the middleEnglish prose, but should not beused as a substitute. Any readerwho chooses so is missing out on afantastic experience. It is notthat difficult to comprehend. Toread a modern rendition, instead ofone in Malory's elegant language, islike reading the Bible in modernEnglish. Sure, the point is clear,but a piece of the art has beentainted. I also recommend pickingup a volume of Aubrey Beardsley'sart, which compliments Le MorteD'Arthur very nicely. Also, I wantto mention that Malory's Le MorteD'Arthur is the best amd mostcomplete of all Arthuriancollections, although there a largenumber of great stories that shouldnot be ignored, some of whichinclude, Alfred Lord Tennyson'sIdylls of the King, T.H. White'sOnce and Future King, and someme! dieval works which predateMalory's masterpiece, including,Geoffrey of Monmouth's The History of the Kings of Britain, and four poems (authors unknown), Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, La Mort le RoiArtu, Morte Arthure, and Le MorteArthur. Even Mark Twain (arguablyone of the greatest, if not thegreatest, of all English writers)could not resist creating a storyusing Malory's fascinatingcharacters as the centerpiece, albeit in a comical, yet enchanting, way.

It really is a beautiful book and I highly recommend this edition of Malory."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur \\" is perhaps the best-known version of the Arthurian legends in English. Despite the title, \\"the death of Arthur\\", the work does not deal solely with King Arthur's death but rather with the whole of his life and reign. The error appears to have originated with Malory's first publisher William Caxton who applied the title of Malory's final section to the entire work. The book retells some well-known stories from French and English sources, such as the Sword in the Stone, the Quest for the Holy Grail, the romance of Tristan and Isolde, the adulterous love between Lancelot and Guinevere and the death of King Arthur at the hands of the traitor Mordred. One of the book's eight sections, the Tale of Sir Gareth, appears to be Malory's own invention.The identity of the author is not precisely known. During the time it was being written, during the 1450s and 1460s, there were at least six men named Thomas Malory living in England, but most (although not all) modern scholars attribute the work to Sir Thomas Malory of Newbold Revel in Warwickshire. This individual lived from around 1413 to 1470, so would have lived through the latter part of the Hundred Years War as well as the Wars of the Roses. He appears to have been a colourful character who served as an MP for Warwickshire but also served time in prison for various offences including rape and robbery. There is an irony if such a man was indeed the author of Le Morte D'Arthur, as one of the work's major themes is how one might reconcile two of the great preoccupations of the Middle Ages, love of God and love of violence.There is some doubt as to whether King Arthur ever existed, and to judge from Caxton's preface there were some people who had doubts about his existence even in the 1400s. Malory, however, presents his work as though it were the true story of a real historical figure who lived about a thousand years before his own time. The work is, however, anachronistic in that the society which Malory describes bears a much greater resemblance to that of the fifteenth century than it does to that of the fifth. Malory even makes reference to cannon, even though firearms were only introduced into Europe about a century before his birth. (Mind you, the only character who actually makes use of guns is Mordred. Perhaps Malory saw them as the coward's weapon.)Indeed, the whole work is based around an anachronism. Although fifth-century societies had warriors, they had no concept of the institution of knighthood or chivalry, something which grew up in the later Middle Ages. This institution may have developed in an attempt to reconcile warfare with Christian ideals. In \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" these ideals are represented by the Pentecostal Oath sworn by the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur makes his knights swear that they will only fight in a righteous cause, show mercy to defeated opponents, uphold justice, fight against oppression, protect the poor and weak and respect the chastity of women.A key concept in the book is \\"honour\\"- except that Malory generally does not use this Norman-French loanword, preferring the native English \\"worship\\", with all its religious connotations. A knight can gain worship by mighty feats of arms, provided they are performed in a worthy cause. A knight will lose worship if he fights in an evil cause or if he fights unfairly, such as by striking an opponent who is wounded or unhorsed.Yet despite this note of idealism, Malory's vision is at heart a pessimistic one. The only knight who wholly lives up to these ideals is Galahad, who is rewarded with a vision of the Holy Grail but dies young. Galahad's father Lancelot, in other respects a paragon of knighthood, is deemed unworthy because of his adultery with Queen Guinevere, and most of the other knights fall a lot further short of the ideals expressed in the Pentecostal Oath than does Lancelot. Even Arthur himself, although initially presented as a beacon of hope, is far from being an idealised monarch- he fathers a child, for instance, by his own sister. It is the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere which leads to the civil war which devastates the kingdom, to the downfall of the Round Table and to the death of Arthur. Malory was doubtless inspired to write these passages by the civil war which had devastated England in his own lifetime and his message is clear; idealism is doomed to failure by human weakness.My comments are based upon the Wordsworth edition which modernises the spelling and punctuation but otherwise leaves the text as it was first published by Caxton. The modern reader's main problem with the work is unlikely to be Malory's language- there are only a handful of unfamiliar vocabulary items, and the Wordsworth edition provides a helpful glossary of these- but his long-winded prose style and tendency to repeat himself. Apart from the Holy Grail sequences, which are more like an extended religious allegory, the narrative tends to fall into a very familiar pattern- Knight A rides out, meets Knight B, fights with him, overcomes him and then moves on to a fight with Knight C, which is described in similar terms. Even Malory's similes become repetitive- two knights fighting are generally likened to two wild boars hurtling together, even though these creatures had been extinct in England for around two hundred years at the time he was writing. Malory's passion for informing us exactly how many knights Lancelot or Gawaine unhorsed at some particular tournament recalls that of the football anorak who can recite by heart all Sheffield Wednesday's results from the 1956-57 season.Some modern editions abridge the text, and I can understand why. \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" may be the best-known work of English-language Arthurian literature today, but \\"well-known\\" does not always equate to \\"widely read\\", and I suspect that most readers today will owe their familiarity with the story to a modern retelling. The original, at least in its unabridged form, will probably be of most interest to those with an academic interest in the development of English literature."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This version of Malory's classic saga of love, honor, chivalry, and betrayal is the definitive version of the story. Its language is an excellent balance of modern and archaic English, resulting in an authentic, yet highly readable tale.

In fact, I'm beginning to get a little peeved with typos in digital books in general.In Mobi's Le Mort d'Arthur, each Chapter has a heading and description. For example, chapter 11 looks like this:\\"Chapter XI\\" (larger, bolded and centered)\\"Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the twokings Ban and Bors, and how they went over the sea.\\"This is followed by the chapter itself. Then, somewhere in the middle of chapter 11 is \\"...and smote him down horse and man, where CH. XI TOURNEY MADE BY KING ARTHUR fore Sir Griflet was wroth,...\\" Honestly, a little proofreading would have brought this to anyone's attention.With archaic language in an unfamiliar book, I can't help but wonder if something else less obvious is missing or added or even just misspelled.

It is the first publication of Le Morte Darthur based on the Winchester Manuscript designed for the general reader; more prominent are the editions which are compilations of Caxton's print version.Editor Helen Cooper does a wonderful job of tackling the problem of presenting a coherent and comprehensive version of a medieval text for a twentieth century audience. Although this rendition of Le Morte Darthur is slightly abridged, it still retains its original charm. The preservation of a good deal of the vernacular in the text and the convenient glossary and footnotes really help to define the medieval setting of the story. The actual story of the life of King Arthur is most enjoyable as well, especially now that Cooper's introduction and explanatory notes enhance it. Malory's expos&eacute; of the Arthurian legend is lively enough that one can easily read this book for pleasure - the story-line and plot are more cleverly developed than, say, Geoffrey of Monmouth's History of the Kings of Britain, which seems to present itself as a chronology of dubious events. In her introduction, Cooper provides a bit of a factual background for Malory and explains many of his subtle allusions intended for his contemporary medieval audience, all of which adds to the reader's understanding of Le Morte Darthur in the context of the fifteenth century. Scholarly readers may also find Cooper's annotated bibliography quite useful."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Sir Thomas Malory's rendition of the Arthurian legend, Le Morte Darthur, is one of the most complete, clear, and enjoyable versions of the story. Malory combines aspects of Arthurian stories found in other works into one complete volume. Le Morte Darthur gives the reader a taste of the romance, as found in lais of Marie de France, as well as the battles and gallantry found in Geoffrey of Monmouth's The History of the Kings of Britain. This edition, based on the Winchester Manuscript and edited by Helen Cooper, combines the battles and romances into a cohesive and enjoyable story which encompasses the stores of Merlin, the quest for the grail, the story of Tristan, and Lancelot and Guenivere.Malory wrote his story in the late 15th century, and while it was in English, the spelling would be hardly distinguishable to the modern reader. Cooper has edited the text for clarity, but its character is left intact by Cooper's refusal to change words. Included in the book is a table of words that are not commonly used, or appear to mean something other than their intention. This takes some getting used to, but once they sink in, the reader will be appreciative because this language gives the book flair and one does not feel like he or she is reading a modern text. In other Arthurian literature that has been translated from Anglo-Norman, French, or English, much of the original writers craft has been lost, and poetry has become prose. In Cooper's edition of Le Morte Darthur Malory's original work is better represented, and provides a more enjoyable story.Malory's combination of romance and battle, and the breadth of his story give the reader a lot of material to peruse. The story covers almost every area of the Arthurian legend, and Cooper has edited it in a style so as to keep the Old English feel. This makes Le Morte Darthur the most complete and enjoyable piece of Arthurian literature available."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"I just finished this book.

I haven't read numerous other editions, so I can't compare this, but what I can say is that you'll be a richer person for reading this book. I don't claim that it will be easy, as significant amounts of historical English permeate the text. After a little while, though, your brain will switch over and it will be easier. There are a tremendous number of endnotes to help the reader along and a table of translations that also comes in handy.Months after reading this I still find myself recalling the characters and stories.

When I started reading Le Morte Arthur -- I was delighted that there is no shtick and just the story. That's the difference between a real classic and a derivative work. Malori is powerfully engaging. The chapters are short so it can be read like a series of small poems, related to each other. There is no strain to be entertaining as in T H White's work -- just pure beautiful myths of ages long past. Excellent T reading, lunch reading, and any cirmstance reading"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"I have wanted this book for close to a whole decade. I rented the movie Excalibur when I was like 13 years old and loved it. I watched it over and over again, finally getting a new VHS edition of what has to be easily the best sword and sorcery movie ever made. As I watched the credits in the movie Excalibur, I noticed it said it was based on Malory's novel Le Morte D'Arthur. I thought the book would be really expensive and hard to find. Finally one day last summer I was able to get thid paperback edition and I found it even lower the cover price of $7.99. I read the book and was surprised. It did have some of what was based in the movie Excalibur, but it was a large collection of individual stories of the legendary characters. I was expecting something more in line exactly with the script of the Ezcalibur movie. After initial surprise, I read the book and liked it, if only for sentimental value. It was written in the 1500s! I like really old gothic and occult literature and now can read them very fast. I usually read 10 pages a sitting and at multiple sittings a day and sometimes reading more than 10 pages you can through books even long 500 page ones like this fast. It is a classic that stands the test of time. This is a savage and barbaric book, this is what it has in common most with the movie Excalibur. When most people think of King Arthur they think like A Kid in King Arthur's Court. Well Excalibur is more realistic and this book if King Arthur really existed this what it would've been more like. Though it borders on cheese- knights in armor getting limbs severed, etc, but the special effects in Excalibur, the script, the acting, everything made up for that is regarded amongst even mainstream movie fans as a masterpiece. I would recommend this if you want to know the real story of King Arthur, not a childish fantasy...surprise...Arthur dies!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Le morte d'Arthur (it should be La Morte d'Arthur) is a literary work that cannot be forgotten. Probably Arturus or Artorius was a roman officer trying to defend the last remains of civilization from its fall in Western Europe, but he was soon transformed into a Celtic chieftain, and much later into a medieval Norseman king. The reason is that everybody wanted to hear stories about him, and everyone wanted him to be the righteous king in times of distress.

Caxton's dry, stilted rendition left me hungry for a cleaner, more modern version.Here's a prime example from page 1:Caxton: \\"It befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all England, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that held war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of Tintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him to bring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a passing wise, and her name was called Igraine.\\"Baines: \\"King Uther Pendragon, ruler of all Britain, had been at war for many years with the Duke of Tintagil in Cornwall when he was told of the beauty of Lady Igraine, the duke's wife.\\"If Caxton was my high school English teacher demanding that I diagram his sentences, I might forthwith set myself through with mine dagger most deadly.Anyway, if you just want to enjoy the Arthurian tales in their cleanest English version, buy Signet's paperback. It's also half the price of other translations.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This Modern Library edition runs true to form, lacking much in the way of supplemental material or notes but providing a good basic presentation of the text on quality paper in a good binding. An edition to keep on the shelf for occasional reading rather than a student's book. If there's a really good scholarly edition of the \\"Morte\\" out there I don't know about it - anyone?"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This 1962 translation of Sir Thomas Malory's account of the King Arthur legend has many things to recommend it. Robert Graves, a historical novelist of just renown, writes an introduction telling us about Malory's life, the good, the bad and the ugly. We get the benefit of Graves' scholarship as well as his authorly insight. Malory, born a gentleman, was a Member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, but he turned rogue and robber five years later and was imprisoned in Newgate. There he languished, wrote this collection of tales about King Arthur and there he died.The text is a pleasure to read. Keith Baines has walked a narrow line with razor sharp accuracy. He gives us the action in clear, crisp language that contains no jarring anachronisms. This is important because the ornamental nature of Malory's fifteenth century prose is a two-edged sword. Despite the beauty of the prose, it's heavy going for a modern reader.The importance of Sir Thomas Malory's work can hardly be overstated. Writing in the fifteenth century, he still had access to earlier works and oral legends that have been lost to later ages. In Malory's work, the legend of Arthur becomes codified into the romantic love triangle of king-queen-leading knight that still inspires a diverse collection of writers. Every era sees a definitive retelling of this story changing the emphasis and details to make King Arthur forever young.I love this edition and it grieves me to see that it is out of print and has become a rarity. Some copyright hindrance must be the issue as this book does not lack in excellence."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Helen Cooper offers a new translation of the MS Winchester -- this is NOT Vinaver's text.

I knew next to nothing about the Arthurian legend, so I picked up this book in the library for a book report. It is a modern language edition of Malory's entire story of King Arthur. Unlike most &quot;modern renditions&quot;, nothing is abridged or omitted.Some people are intimidated by Le Morte D'Arthur because of complexity and and antiquidated language.

When I finished the book and put it on the shelf, it was a lot like saying good-bye to a friend.What makes the book even better for a modern is that Mr. Matthews' edition has rendered it extremely readable, while still keeping the ancient flavor that helps put aside for a moment the outlook of the present century. And Ms. Ferguson's excellent drawings of various scenes, interspersed throughout, are further delights that help the mind paint its own pictures along the way.It is said that Arthur's story is known throughout the world.

Despite its title (meaning the death of Arthur) it deals exhaustively with the life of Arthur and his knights. Malory combined several pe-existing French and English Arthurian tales to create his grand compilation.Within the pages of this book are found the famous stories of Lancelot and Guenevere, Tristam and Isolde, Galahad and the Holy Grail. However, since Malory write these tales in no paticular order, they are inconsistent here and there. Also, Malory's version of the Grail quest is not even worthy of comparison to earlier versions such as the Old French Poem Perlesvaus or the Didot-Perceval. Still, this is the best version of the Athurian legends ever written."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"~This book is very big, very old, veyr hard to read, but still quite good. In case you are unaware, this is basically a synopsis of the larger King Arthur tradition, a kind of readers digest version. Thus, it is only readable in small doses at times, because the gramar can be painful, and one event will happen in one sentence that totally changes the plot line. So a guy will be in London or whatever, and then two lines later all the sudden he's in Wales. He jousts, then goes onto Scotland~~ where~~ he jousts some more and takes a castle. I wish I had known this before i read it, and it would have made much more sense why things weren't making the kind of sense I would have liked.However, some of the characters are great to follow. My favourite was Tristram, simply because of his struggles against a corrupt King Mark, and his endless quest to find his woman while not betraying his codes of knighthood in the meantime. You will have yours, so zero in and maybe find more stories~~ about~~ that person in the original tradition.~~~"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"It's always difficult to &quot;rate&quot; a classic book because the standards by which writing is judged have changed so dramatically. Had &quot;Le Morte D'Arthur&quot; been written in 2001, it would earn 1 star: there is almost no description, the plotlines are implausible and the characters are for most part sketchy at best. It often seems to be little more than a joust-fest punctuated with occasional meaningful moments.However, for anyone who is genuinely interested in the Arthurian legend, Malory's work is essential reading. The atmosphere of surreal beauty which is associated with the legend of King Arthur permeates this work in full: a sense of destiny and inevitable tragedy lends a minor key to what otherwise seems like a purely exuberant epic. This theme culminates in the last section, &quot;Morte D'Arthur,&quot; which I would recommend someone read even if they lack patience for the rest. In that section the characters are suddenly full of life as they never were before, though ironically on the verge of their own destruction. The sense of a higher destiny and heartrending tragedy at last merge together and give meaning to what before seemed an almost frivolous legend.As to characters, while they don't have vividly drawn personalities, Malory throws out hints all through the story which are eventually pieced together to form a picture of each character's personality. While he never makes value judgments about Gawain's behavior, by the end it is clear that Gawain has been heading for his own downfall from the very beginning. This sort of subtlety is refreshing in an era when authors are expected to make their characters &quot;deep&quot; with lengthy descriptions or dead-giveaway hints. If only more modern writers would let us figure their characters out by ourselves.The greatest character in my view was Sir Dynadan, who was consistently loyal, humorous and sarcastic throughout. His affectionate and tough personality sets him apart as a real person amid the often hollow suits of armor that march endlessly through the story on their respective quests.This is not a fun read, and if it seems too daunting I would highly recommend &quot;The Once and Future King&quot; by T.H. White, which captures the atmosphere and basic plotline of Malory with an added psychological depth and vivid characters."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This is not a review of any particular edition, but of the work in general and I only put this here in response to a number of one-star reviews scattered about various editions available on Amazon.Often a reviewer will say the book is \\"boring\\" and \\"stupid\\" then give it a one-star rating. Some reviewers go on to recommend some outrageous alternative (like a video game) so I am not sure if all those reviewers are serious or not, but they do get a couple of things right -- it does get repetitive (\\"long and boring\\"?) and some of the characters do some very stupid things (like blindly promising to grant anyone pretty much whatever they ask for before knowing what it will be).But all that has a purpose. It eases you into accepting and joining that reality -- falling in love with that imaginary time and place. The story starts with light hearted and humorous episodes -- good deeds are done, victories are won, valor is rewarded, romances consummated (or not) -- but as you go through the \\"boring\\" parts it slowly gets darker and darker. When it all comes to its (by then) inevitable end it really means something to you. Just where did things go wrong? Where is Merlin when you need him?\\"HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE\\"(\\"Shame be to him who thinks evil of it\\")"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Highbridge Classics' &quot;Le Morte d'Arthur,&quot;as read by legendary British thespian Derek Jacobi, is a great adaptation of Thomas Malory's quintessential Arthurian tome. Newcomers to Malory will find the audio book more accessible than the beautiful but often enigmatic source volume, while long-time Malory devotees will discover fresh nuances in Jacobi's authoritative rendition. Necessarily, some significant abridgements have been made, but at six audiocassettes this production still captures much of the Arthurian world's enormous scope. Featured storylines include Arthur's rise to the throne and his claiming of Excalibur, the epic search for the Holy Grail, the doomed love between Lancelot and Guenever, and the tragic final battle between Arthur and his ill-begotten son, Mordred. Jacobi conveys all the glory of Malory's prose style, while nonetheless cleaning up the diction a bit for modern ears. Finally, Ruth Morse's concise text introduction provides some keen observations on the big picture of the Arthurian myth. A magnificent version of Malory that no lover of Camelot should be without."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This was a very intriguing book. I felt it had very little description used throughout the book, the plot lines were so complexed that they got to point where it was impossible to follow them. Then characters just seemed to come and go throughout the book, sometimes their name was not mentioned for three or four chapters and the bam all the sudden it is like they were there the whole time, but yet it was still so interesting.Mallory did an excellent job just describing the scenery and the daily activities that occurred around the castle. When he tried to describe the feelings or justify the acts of the characters is when the book got too confusing. The way he wrote this book really makes it seem like a legend; the castle is so grand, the people are so happy, the villains are so evil, and the knights are so incredibly strong.My favorite part of the book was at the very beginning when Arthur went to get Excalaber. Mallory described the scenery and the actions with such vivid description it was so easy to get the gist of what was going on. He even throws in some supernatural elements to make this excerpt even more interesting. There was the mystical lady of the lake that could not be seen; all Arthur saw of her was her hand holding Excalaber above the water, and then the fact that Excalaber was just a normal sword and that the scabbard is what was truly magical. Woah this guy threw so many twists and turns in there."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"I love the book. It is everything I expected. I would recommend to anyone who loves the tales of King Arthur as it contains ALL the stories. The reader can find out who the characters are and their relarionship to each other. Given all the movies and TV productions that we have seen, it's sometimes difficult to discover who's who but this book defines each and every one and how they fit into the saga. The best thing about this book is that each chapter is a complete tale in itself and describes at the top what it is about, so the reader can either read it in chronological sequence or just choose a tale that they are particularly interested in."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"An amazing book at a more than fair price.I have had professors use quotes and passages from this book but have never had the opertunity to read it in it's entirity.Now I can get the full experience by reading all of it.So far it has been very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This is not the \\"prettied up\\" Victorian (or later) King Arthur full of justice and nobility...at least not by current standards of justice and nobility. This is the story of King Arthur and his knights as translated/adapted/compiled (mostly from much older French manuscripts) by Sir Thomas Malory during the chaotic days of the Wars of the Roses.Most of the main characters are deeply flawed. This is even true of Arthur who spends most of his \\"screen time\\" being manipulated by either Merlin or Sir Gawain. The main character traits which get someone labeled as a \\"noble/worshipful knight\\" seem to be:1. He fights well2. He fights fairly3. He speaks courteously4. He is of noble birthPossess these four characteristics and just about anything else can be overlooked (the occasional rape, murder, adultery, etc.). Malory does not seem to comment one way or the other on this morality other than in the quest for the Sangreal where only the three (mostly) sinless (and virgin) knights are acceptable to God.I found the main story arcs interesting, but most of the minor events of which they were composed were repetitive in the extreme. Each story arc was a series of episodes most of which involved the protagonist fighting other random knights at battles, tournaments, or in single combat; sometimes to right a wrong, sometimes just for the sake of fighting. These encounters are all described using the same dozen or so stock phrases. This is a common device in older writing, I think, but it becomes quite tedious after a while. In my opinion, the last third of the book was much more interesting than the preceding 600 or so pages. It described the quest for the Sangreal and the events which led up to the death of Arthur in a much more cohesive manner than the other stories (the story of Sir Tristram and La Beal Isoud which takes up the middle third of the book was especially fragmentary).I would definitely recommend this book to fans of the Arthurian mythos as being closer to the source material than modern retellings, but I do not know whether the average reader would enjoy it or not."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Written in the midst of the calamitous Wars of the Roses, Malory's Arthurian epic includes themes of civil turmoil, conflicting loyalties and the supernatural (and other things beyond human understanding). King Arthur himself cannot escape the turning of the Wheel of Fortune, and his quick ascendancy in the beginning eventually leads to his equally sudden plunge into disaster at the end. In between, order returns to the British Isles for a short period in which harmonious cooperation among knights following the code of chivalry bring down traitors and rogues (interestingly enough, Malory himself apparently spent time as an outlaw). Though the tale was based on Celtic and French legends, civil war and imprisonment no doubt influenced Malory in his writing, which in itself became the foundation for nearly all future Arthurian literature.The Wordsworth Classics edition is not too difficult to read, but the glossary has great room for improvement. Some entries are redundant (with four for the word &quot;orgulous&quot;) while others are missing entirely. For a relative new-comer to Arthurian literature like myself, the constant name alterations became a bit confusing as well. Though not a major barrier to the enjoyment of the book, this could have been amended by either annotation or an index of names/recurring characters. All in all, however, it was a wonderful and enjoyable read! No wonder medieval personalities fantasized about imitating Malory's chivalrous knights."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This is an excellent edition of the greatest Arthurian romance of all time. At first it may seem daunting, and a little bit sexist, but there's something about this set of stories that inspires not the conscious, thinking part of the mind, but rather the subconsious. Reading it is like having a dream. Reading from start to finish is a tremendous task (it took me several months and I can read pretty quickly), considering the length and the fact that it's in the original language (not quite as difficult as Chaucer, but more difficult the Shakespeare). Many of the words he uses had different usages in his day. Others like \\"orgulous\\" are hardly ever used. Still, like I said, this is for the subconscious, and I consider it well worth the difficulty. There is a vocabulary list somewhere on the University of Virginia website, where they have an electronic edition. This could be of help."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"\\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" comes at a turning point in English literature. It is both a summation of the courtly legend and lore of the Medieval world and indicator of literary times to come. Not quite a novel, not quite a collection of tales, not quite an exemplar of etiquette and ethics, it was still one of the great creative accomplishments of the 15th century. Countless generations of writers, poets and artists and felt its influence.Unfortunately, my memories of Malory's work are tainted by my memories of the difficulties of reading the book. In college I was sentenced to reading small paperback editions with tiny, cramped print. It was never possible to settle into the task for more than a short time without feeling a headache coming on. As a result my impression of the book was that it was both interesting and impenetrable. It was with great relief that I went on to other classes and texts.Lately, I found I needed a copy of \`Le Morte D'Arthur\\" again, and in reviewing the available editions discovered this new edition, edited by John Matthews and illustrated by Anna-Marie Ferguson. When it arrived, I was amazed and delighted.Academically the edition is much as one would expect. It is basically a reprint of a Medici Society version of the Caxton original. Matthews has corrected some spelling problems. He has also silently interpolated some snippets of the manuscript version (some 20 total) where these make the narrative clearer. It is unfortunate that he did not document these additions to prevent scholastic confusion, but he did not wish to break up the narrative with footnotes. I have found several of the changes and they all make the sense better. There is a forward by fantasy writer Michael Moorcock, a very informative and readable introduction by Matthews, and a short piece on the illustrations by Anna-Marie Ferguson.It is the physical presentation of this edition that makes it extraordinary. The book is quite thick, very well bound with a heavily coated slip cover. The paper is well made and heavy enough to prevent the print through that can hinder readability in books with dense printing. The type font is glorious. Large and simple enough to be easily readable. This makes it possible to easily pick out the sense and structure without having to squint at every word. I found the text more readable than some of the efforts at modernization I have encountered.Finally, the illustrations. These are plentiful, 62 in all, half of them in color. Ferguson has a fine detailed style with both watercolor brush and pen. They have pleasant dreamlike quality that arises from her masterly use of light. These are not mere illustrations, rather, the artist has made them invitations to consider the world of King Arthur. In summary, this is a welcome new addition to the Malory canon, and one well worth owning."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"I don't read a lot. In fact, the only time I do read is when I am required to do so by a class. Such is the case with The Tales of King Arthur. But although I would never have read the book were it not for my fascinating English teacher, I must say that I have never read anything as intriguing as the Tales of King Arthur.Getting used to the language isn't as difficult as some other reviewers are saying... At least it wasn't for me (and I'm an eighteen year-old high school student). You'll struggle through the first few pages but once you've got an ear for it the language comes natural (somewhat like reading Shakespeare - it takes time to adjust). I found nothing tedious about the book other than the somewhat unfocussed book of the Sangrail.The characters are awesome, the language is awesome, the plots and emotions are awesome. If you read this from beginning to end you'll walk away with a sincere compassion for the characters and the inevitable death of the times.I can't imagine bothering with a modernized version - the classic text is just so sweet."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"LE MORTRE D'ARTHUR (The Death of Arthur) was written by Sir Thomas Malory while he was imprisoned for some number of years. It was one of the very first times that the Arthurian legend was penned in English. There were some older Latin fragments of the myth floating around, but it's thru Malory's account by which we know the stories most thoroughly. The most successful movie adaptation of the legend, EXCALIBUR, is based on elements taken from Malory's epic.As I struggled through Chaucer while in college, I've not yet gotten up the courage to read the original middle-English version of this work (my apologies to all of the English professors out there). Therefore, it is good that Mr. Keith Baines was kind enough to translate the middle-English into a more accessible lexicon for me & people like me. Baines reveals the myths and legends in all their glory, and I can't help but believe that he expresses them in at least some measure of their middle-English power.This is an ABSOLUTE must-read for all persons who have even a remote interest in the Arthurian fantasy. Although the book is abridged from the original, it nonetheless contains all of the most famous characters and episodes from the legend.Within these pages, one will encounter Arthur, Gwynevere, Sir Launcelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Modred, Sir Bors, Sir Percivale, Merlin and all the rest. The purity of Galahad is contrasted with the sinful nature & temporary madness of Launcelot. The memorable allegory of Sir Percivale's duel with Satan, as well as so many other knightly adventures, are all recorded for us here.This book is highly recommended to all fans of medieval times, medieval literature, the history of Great Britain and the idea of Chivalry. The codes of honor, the rules of fair play and the heroic ideals conceived by the knights of the middle-ages have followed us down thru the centuries and are still as relevant to the best of us today as they were 500-1500 years ago. The story ends with one of the most memorable Latin phrases in literary history:HIC IACET ARTHURUS, REX QUONDAM REXQUE FUTURUS[Here lies King Arthur, the once and future King]Now for the details, open up the book!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Aamazon has lumped together reviews of most available versions and editions of Malory's classic, and it isn't always possible to tell just which one a reviewer is talking about. This review applies solely to the Signet Classic modern-English version by Keith Baines.Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" was published in 1485. That was at the very end of the Middle English period. What that means is that the ERnglish that Malory spoke was in many ways closer to Chaucer's than to our own. You can read the original, but you'll need an extensive glossary and a good deal of practice.Nearly fifty years ago Keith Baines took the somewhat daring step of presenting Malory's proto-novel in Modern English. Baines called his work a \\"rendition\\" rather than a \\"translation\\" because he has cut out a fair amount of repetition and done a good deal of paraphrasing as well. Nevertheless, the resulting edition faithfully sets out all of the substance and most of the detail of the original in straightforward Modern English. There are no archaic \\"thees\\" and \\"thous,\\" for example, yet, fortunately, Baines makes no attempt to \\"modernize\\" the level of diction. His prose therefore sounds appropriately sober without being stilted.I read the Baines version in high school when there was no way I could have handled Malory's original Middle English. I loved it. Scholars are appropriately annoyed that Baines may have condensed a little too much, but if you're curious enough to delve deeper there's always Janet Cowan's Penguin Classic edition, which just modernizes the spelling, and the Norton edition which meticulously reprints the original and includes a number of academic essays to boot.By the way, Malory's 1485 narrative of the Arthurian legend is quite a bit different in almost every way from T.H. White's deservedly popular and very humorous \\"Once and Future King.\\" For one thing, Malory wasn't kidding around. His enduring classic of world literature is serious though filled with wonders. If you're mainly interested in the story, the Baines \\"rendition\\" is the best version of \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" available. (But take the fascinating introduction by poet Robert Graves, author of \\"Goodbye to All That\\" and \\"The White Goddess,\\" with several grains of salt.)"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Where do I begin? Watching the film Excalibur inspired me to try to track down this book. I found out shortly after that day of this edition. Boy am I glad I did. The illustrations, whether in color or black and white are absolutely beautiful and vivid. They transport you expertly in your mind to the place being depicted in the image. When I first opened this book I was reminded in a way of reading Scripture almost. This is VERY old English folks, but PLEASE do not let that deter you. It only takes a little while to get used to the wording and you can soon begin to appreciate the \\"flavor\\" of, and get lost in the world of this book. To me this is the quintessential story of ideals, one man's dream as he wanted to affect the world for the better, and the problems, trials, and triumphs in his trying to make that dream a reality. It has EVERYTHING. Chivalry, love, honor, family, friendship, conflict, malice, trust, betrayal, and spice too. There is something in here that will surely delight everyone. Just give yourself time to get used to the wording of the text. A glossary is provided for this purpose in the back of the book as well. I loved this text partly BECAUSE of the way it was written, it did not \\"modernize\\" or \\"dumb down\\" the words. The \\"flavor\\" is ancient, noble-sounding, and captivating. It MADE me want to slow down and actually READ this thing, to ABSORB the text and story, the world and the people that live in it. If STAR WARS is a trip to a galaxy far far away, this is a voyage to a past rich in ideals, ideas, and passions of the human heart and soul that seem to have grown either cold, taken for granted, or simply and quite sadly, forgotten in this modern age.Again...please do NOT be turned off by the archaic writing style. Kick back, open the book, and let it carry you away to a world of romance, beauty, adventure, and passion that has seldom, if ever been equalled in our time. I fell in love with this work, and I think you will too... it can put a spell on you... and draw you into a world that you may wish you never had to leave. Even when you close the book, the allure and beauty and romance of this work just may stay imprinted on your heart forever."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Most everyone has some knowledge of the King Arthur legend. Either they've read it, been exposed to it by Disney or Robert Goulet, or have just heard of it from someone else that knows. So, I'm not recommending this book so much for the text.The reason why this edition of Le Morte D'Arthur is an absolutely necessary part of any collection is for its stunning illustrations. Anna-Marie Ferguson must have dreamed of Camelot when she was a child for there is simply no other way to explain the attention to detail, the romantic cast to all that we see. As real as Arthur and Lancelot may have seemed to us before, they become infinitely more human in the hands of Ferguson. I never tire of walking to my shelves and pulling out this book to just flip through it. To track my fingertips down the smooth sweep of colors and the beautiful images that really bring Camelot to life."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"When I began to create the curriculum for a British Literature course at the boarding school I work at, I realized the resources I was given to use only briefly mentioned the adventures of King Arthur and his knights. Medieval literature is one of my favorite subjects, and I didn't feel it was right for students to be robbed of the experience of reading this classic work. Malory wrote this classic work during the War of the Roses, a civil war that tore England apart. Through his prose, Malory hoped to resurrect the vision of a perfect medieval world. Keep this in mind when you read this book, and try to place yourself in the medieval era. You won't be dissappointed!!!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"The earlier rendition by Keith Baines of Mallory's classic work, 'Le Morte d'Arthur', went out of print, but the demand was such that there was bound to be a press that would pick it up. All hail to Signet for doing so here! They have taken the old text and reprinted it, practically as a photo-stat. Even the pagination has remained the same, but the print face is a bit cleaner than the older copy in a side-by-side comparison (I purchased the Signet edition, thinking it was a revision, when I already had the older Baines edition -- they are the same).Sir Thomas Mallory was a great one to write the adventures of King Arthur and his knights - a knight himself, he led a life of intrigue and adventure, albeit not one that always lived up to the ideas of chivalry he penned at the heart of the Arthurian legends. Mallory did not invent Arthur; he is one of the principle medieval chroniclers, having time (he was in prison with nothing else to do, after all) to set down in prose stories he'd heard throughout his life. These were popular tales, not always told in the same way with the same details, as is true of most oral legends and transmitted stories, much to the later frustration of scholars and readers. The earliest printing of Mallory's stories had his authorship suppressed by Caxton, one of the better-known publishers of the time.The earliest Arthurian legends date back as far as the late Roman times in Britain. Controversies abound, but many have settled on a late Roman or Romano-British general named Arturius - however, given the linguistic nature of the name (it is derivative of ruler or leader), it is impossible to know if this was in fact a name or a title, and the legends may be compilations of the acts of many leaders bearing the name. There was also a Welsh leader with the name/title Arddu, \`Dark One', who is sometimes conflated into Arthurian legend. Arthur was celebrated in the pre-Norman times for the order and stability he represented; Arthur was celebrated in post-Norman times for his campaigns against Saxons. Arthur continues to be an intriguing character, today reminiscent of ancient mysteries as well as pagan and new age ideas as well.In any event, Mallory doesn't attach specific dates to his tales. The book actually consists of many tales. The first is entitled \`The Tale of King Arthur', which introduces the figures of Merlin, Gawain, Uwayne, Pellinore, Morgan le Fay (the Celtic war goddess Morgana, dressed up as Arthur's sister) and others, and includes the sword-in-the-stone event. While this text has been modernised by Keith Baines, there are certain crucial lines left in Mallory's English, including this most famous one:Whoso pulleth oute this swerd of this stone and anvyld is rightwys kynge borne of all BrytaygneFollowing this tale, Mallory includes many of the famous tales in Arthurian legend as stories more or less complete in themselves, but still linking to the other tales. \`The Tale of Sir Lancelot du Lake' is a knight's tale indeed, with no fewer than twenty horseback duels back-to-back. \`The Tale of Sir Gareth' is a similar spirited tale, less well known. \`The Book of Sir Tristram of Lyoness' makes Tristram and Iseult, famous by other writers as well, into lovers, this time with a more happy ending than usual. The lesser known \`Tale of Arthur and Lucius' describes battles and skirmishes with the emperor, but never really captured popular imagination.Mallory saves the best for last, with three major tales - \`The Tale of the Sangreal', the Holy Grail; \`The Book of Sir Launcelot and Queen Gwynevere'; and finally, \`Le Morte D'Arthur'. The tale of the Holy Grail continues into the present day in various fashions; here is contains strange glosses of the Old and New Testaments, as well as a good number of miracles, as one would expect from the Grail. The last tale, the death of Arthur, is probably the most famous, and the best written.Even though an English knight, the courtly fashion was after a French design for many centuries after the Norman conquest, and this French influence in notable in the stories, from their titles to their plots and characterisations, including the places Mallory uses.Keith Baines eliminates a lot of needless dialogue from his rendering here, but keeps the plot lines and sequence of action with integrity from earlier manuscripts and recited tales. His translation compares favourably with others, becoming a fairly standard text for good reason. Robert Graves (of \`I Claudius' fame) provides an appreciative introduction to the text. Baines himself was a poet; however, this text, accepted somewhat reluctantly, is probably his best known work.Arthur lives on into the modern world and beyond. Baines' edition gives it life to carry on, and Signet makes it available."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"In his preface, the translator Keith Baines asserts that he attempted to &quot;provide a concise and lucid rendering of Le Morte d'Arthur&quot; and to clarify &quot;those episodes which, for the purpose in hand, seemed obscure, and condensing those which seemed prolix.&quot;As an example of this condensation in progress, Baines version of The Tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake is 19 pages long. Steinbeck's translation of the same story (which had the goal of accurately preserving the story as told in the Winchester Ms.) runs over 100 pages. Throughout, Baines' edition is horribly abridged. He leaves most of the basic facts from the story intact (though some parts of his translation, especially concerning the obscurer genealogies, are plain wrong when compared to most other editions). However, he cuts all elements that make reading the legend enjoyable."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This review applies to the abridged audiocassette version. I have not read the book, but I will, after hearing this wonderful reading by Derek Jacobi. His immaculate British accent truly brings to life this epic tale of King Arthur and his knights' adventures. I highly recommend this version and also: 'Excalibur' the movie, T. H. Whites' 'The Once and Future King', and also Carl Orffs' 'Carmina Burana - Empress of the World' - music which was featured in 'Excalibur'. These four put together can give you a truly grand starting experience of the Arthurian Legends."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Malory's anthology of various King Arthur myths is great reading for the hero in all of us. The appeal of the Knights righteous behaviour and humility before God is an excellent example of how people should govern themselves. I'm not saying that one can just run about decapitating folks, or that &quot;might makes right&quot; but I do believe people should try to harbor good will, gentleness, and honesty. That just makes for better people. The stories themselves are fascinating. The Knights clearly maintain there high status, and in fact increase this, by serving Arthur. Arthur, conversly, does not act as a pampered King, but ventures off on his own, and jeoperdizes himself. Great reading, thoroughly enjoyable. I plan to read it to my sons to encourage chivalrous behaviour. Also an excellent look into the lives of our predecessors, hundreds of years ago."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This edition of Malory's classic is very good, though probably too long for the average reader. For them, one of the abridged editions would be better. The best is probably the one by Helen Cooper, published by Oxford University Press."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"A very interesting book, Le Morte Darthur was a lot bigger than I was expecting! I've only just begun reading it, and I'm sure it will be a while till I am finished. It is broken down into many short stories, each only a few pages. The spelling has been modernized, but some of the wording is a bit archaic. All in all, though, very charming!"},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"AUDIOBOOK REVIEW: I'm sure there are any number of more pleasurable books of which one could listen to audio versions, but sometimes it's good to buckle down and get acquainted with something that boasts more historical relevance than literary value. This text is a trial, not because of the language, which one becomes accustomed to easily enough, but because it possesses nothing of the pacing or narrative structures that characterize more modern novels. Events happen seemingly at random, people do things for no apparent reason, swords are stuck in stones (more than once!), the holy grail is so ubiquitous that it begs the question of why anyone would bother to go quest for it, and at no point does the author feel obliged to account for anyone's motivations or the inconsistencies of the plot. I doubt I would have the patience to get through this text if I were reading it on paper (although if you are interested, some nice older versions are digitized on googlebooks), but I'm somewhat enjoying the audiobook. For all the deficiencies of the narrative, Derek Jacobi's reading is nothing short of masterful, as one might expect. He gives the writing much more pungency than one might think possible, to the point where it can be almost humorous. His spirited delivery of the line \\"Nay, nay, my lord Arthur, it is not so; I was never your father nor of your blood, but I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were,\\" made me laugh so hard that I rewound and replayed it at least a half dozen times. Such interludes of levity are welcome in a text that can otherwise get quite ponderous, so I'm quite pleased with this production."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Skipping the book review, you can read it yourself for that... the book, this edition is very very well made. The book has a great cover design with and beautiful dust jacket. She's beautiful without the dust jacket as well... a really nice binding too. The book to buy."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"In the quest, thus far, to discover the truth about King Arthur, I have encountered many aspects of several authors and how each one perceived the legend. One particular author that struck my favor was Sir Thomas Malory, especially in his book, Le Morte D'Arthur. Although, as a class assignment, I only read one particular section of the novel, which was the love affair between Guinevere and Lancelot, I can honestly say I have a strong favor and opinion towards Malory's depiction of that portion of the legend. The relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot is inevitably one that leads to adultery, which affects Arthur in a way that one can discover his true feelings about his Round Table, oddly enough. Since Lancelot was one of Arthur's strongest and most reliable knights in the hood, Arthur feels more betrayed by Lancelot's decision to act on his feelings towards Guinevere than he does by Guinevere who had more control over the situation in my opinion. In his own words, Arthur states his bond with the knighthood and how Lancelot's affair with Guinevere affects the Round Table by saying, \\"And much more am I sorrier for my good knights' loss than for the loss of my faire queen; for queens I might have enough, but such a fellowship of good knights shall never be together in no company (Malory, 482).\\"Arthur's hardship over this love affair really brings to life his emotional level and how most of his emotion lies in the sorrows he has for his Round Table. It seems as if he is astonished that a noble knight with such great power could ever go against his own king the way Lancelot did to him. It was as if Arthur gave him all the goodness and glory a shining knight could ask for, and betrayal was his reward. Malory depicts this part of the sequence with such an astounding viewpoint, in a sense that the audience can almost feel Arthur's emotions within the story. He not only makes the story easy to relate to, but he also writes at a comfortable level in which the audience can comprehend the emotions that Geoffrey of Monmouth certainly did not portray. Not to say that Geoffrey wasn't a great writer, but I just didn't feel the emotion as much as I did in Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the joys and hardships of King Arthur in order to better understand the emotional aspect of the legend."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"The story of King Arthur, the boy who pulled the sword from the stone and was crowned King of Britain has been with us for centuries, much in part to this book, Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur. This book, often published in two volumes, is here in complete form and features stories from the entire Arthurian saga, including some not nessarily about the King. This book has been the basis for many of the modern stories of Arthur, such as T.H. White's The Once and Future King (the inspiration for The Sword and The Stone) and the movie Excalibur."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"This is the first book about the King Arthur and his knights written in English with the complete set of knights. The story of Sir Tristram, perhaps the greatest Arthurian legend, is usually neglected in other renditions of the stories. Without it, you lose the comic Sir Dinadan, the knight with common sense who realizes the foolishness of two knights fighting thirty. You lose Sir Palomides, the knight torn between jealousy for Tristram and his friendship with him. No reader of King Arthur should skip this book."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"Derek Jacobi reads an abridged version of Le Morte D'Arthur on eight compact discs: more than enough to give the student a reasonable grasp of the whole. His delivery is a little short of the magic which characterised the Argo set released in the 1960s: we don't get the full list of one hundred knights for example: but his enunciation is clear, engaging and idiomatic. The set is excellent value."},{"Title":"Le Morte D'Arthur, Volume 1 (Library Edition)","review":"What a delight.

The main character, Svetlana, goes with her family to Germany and eventually finds herself 12 years old and alone again in Russia. The book follows the twists and turns in her life, caused sometimes by her decisions, but more often by things outside of her control. I found the book full of suspense, so I will not tell you any more about what happens. It seemed that in every page, there was uncertainty looming.
